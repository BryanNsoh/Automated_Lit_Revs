    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Vellore, India SECTION 1. Introduction At
    present, water use is growing at more than twice the rate of population increases.
    Due to the shortage of water resources, we need water saving irrigation technology
    for agriculture. Irrigation is a scientific process to supplying water to the
    agriculture land that is being cultivated. The dry regions having very little
    amount of water and that has to be utilized very efficiently. In conventional
    water irrigation system is wasting the water and drip irrigation systems use 20-30%
    less water than conventional watering methods. Therefore, the conventional method
    can be replaced by drip irrigation technology [1]. A new idea for saving each
    drops of water by the way to test the soil conditions before supplying water to
    the crop fields. This mechanism will reduce the workload of the cultivator and
    help maintain suitable soil conditions for the better crop production [2]. Hence
    the technology advancement is possible to design systems that eradicate the direct
    involvement of the cultivator with respect to irrigation of their fields. For
    the sustainable use of water resources, the rainwater is generally stored in a
    rainwater tank and it is used for irrigation or directed to recharge groundwater.
    Firstly the rainwater is used for agriculture in rainy seasons and the well or
    bore well water is used for other times. The crop growth rate (CGR) can also monitored
    using the IR transmitter and receiver system. The whole sensor network has analyzed
    by the microcontroller and sends the sensors information to irrigation control
    centre (ICC) through Zigbee technology. Zigbee technology has low cost, low power
    consumption and wireless communication which could replace the wired connections
    in the traditional system. In ICC, the entire drip irrigation is controlled by
    the electromagnetic actuators. The ICC has two technologies one is global system
    for mobile communication and secondary one is the ARM controller. This GSM facility
    serves as an important part for controlling the drip irrigation which sending
    the results to the cultivator using SMS to a mobile device [3], [4]. Then the
    user controls the entire agriculture irrigation system through SMS. The controller
    works as a central core for operation of the automated process which is initiated
    by the sensor networks. Based on the crop field conditions the ARM controller
    used in ICC is activates the drip irrigation system and their respective valves
    [2]. SECTION II. System Architecture In the automated system, the human factor
    is reduced by a microcontroller which is specially programmed to monitor any parameter
    changes in sensors. The function of microcontroller depends on the data of sensors
    from crop field units and the corrections are made by control devices in the irrigation
    system until the desired performance to be attained. This automatic system can
    also be stopped in case of rain, cyclone and crop cutting time, etc by the cultivator
    through SMS. Fig.1. Remote monitoring and closed loop irrigation system Show All
    The remote monitoring and closed loop irrigation system is shown in Fig. 1 which
    consisted of three components: a remote sensor node, a system control module called
    ICC, and a GSM mobile device. The amount of water required for a crop varies in
    various growth stages, different in soils and climate changes. The sensor node
    is placed in each crop field which is continuously collect soil parameters and
    crop growth. The sensor node consists of soil moisture sensor, humidity sensor,
    temperature sensor, IR transceiver, Zigbee transceiver and microcontroller. The
    value of air humidity is important for the correct growth of plants and high air
    temperature leads to affect the crop yields. High soil moisture will produce high
    evaporation and reduced the nutrient uptake. The soil parameters and crop growth
    status are collected by microcontroller and send these data to irrigation control
    centre through Zigbee wireless serial communication technology. In irrigation
    control centre (ICC), the soil parameters, crop growth status, cultivator''s control
    information from GSM are analyzed by the microcontroller. The ICC consists of
    motor driver unit, solenoid values with driver, LCD module, Zigbee transceiver,
    GSM module and microcontroller. The sensor measurements are transmitted to ICC
    by sensor node and are received through Zigbee transceiver. The electric solenoid
    irrigation valves should be installed at the closest point possible to outlet
    of pump set, that is, the location where you tap in for the irrigation system.
    ICC turns on the pump according to soil parameters. The valves are operated by
    12V driver circuit by the controller which integrates all the environmental information
    through suitable control algorithms. The gateway allows the activation of automated
    irrigation when the threshold values of soil moisture, air temperature and humidity
    are reached. The system provides the details about the agriculture farm to cultivator
    though SMS by GSM and the same information are display on LCD screen. The cultivator
    can also sends the control command to ICC through SMS, after processing displayed
    it on the LCD screen. SECTION III. System Components A. Software Portion The choice
    of a programming language for microcontrollers normally the C language, and most
    commercially available microcontrollers have C language compilers for the development
    of their programs. The closed loop irrigation system [5] is developed by the MPLAB
    compiler and KEIL μVISION4 Compiler. The MPLAB compiler consists of an integrated
    development environment for the windows operating system and supports the entire
    line of PIC microcontrollers [6]. The new KEIL μVISION4 by ARM IDE is to enhance
    developer''s productivity, user friendly, faster, flexible window management system,
    efficient program development and support for multiple monitors. PROTEUS allows
    designing for circuit simulation. It has a range of simulator models for popular
    micro-controllers and is possible to simulate complete micro-controller systems.
    The first task of the program is to transmit field parameters to ICC via Zigbee
    protocol. The PIC microcontroller in sensor node has pickup all the sensors information
    one by one and stored it in memory. This information is send to ICC through Zigbee
    wireless transmission. Second, the ARM microcontroller in ICC receives the data
    package transmitted by sensor node. These soil moisture, air humidity and temperature
    data are processed by the algorithm that compared with the threshold value that
    already stored in memory. Then it activates the irrigation pumps and respective
    solenoid values. Finally, these sensor node data and a crop growth status are
    transmitted at each predefined time to a user mobile device through SMS via the
    GSM in real time. Whenever the cultivator needs the information about the crop
    field, they can give the missed call to ICC''s GSM module [7]. The crop fields
    data are also send to LCD Screen. B. Hardware Portion Smart senor node is implements
    four types of measurements via sensors which are soil moisture, air humidity,
    air temperature and crop growth. The Soil Moisture Sensor is used to measure the
    volumetric water content of soil [8], [9], [10]. The SM150 measures volumetric
    soil moisture content with 3% accuracy. The output dc voltage range of the sensor
    is 0V to 1.5V. The temperature sensor AD594 is capable of measuring −55 to +125
    degrees centigrade. The AD594 has a positive and negative source input. In order
    to receive 0 to +125 degrees centigrade, the negative input pin has to be grounded.
    The AD594 gives a linear DC output voltage in the range of 0V to 1.25V. The soil
    humidity is measured according to the principle of electric resistance. The humidity
    sensor module SY-HS-220 converts the relative humidity to the output voltage.
    The storage humidity is within 95%RH and standard output is 1.9mV at 25 degree
    and 60%RH. The IR transmitter and receiver pair can be easily made using 555 Timer,
    IR LED and TSOP1738 IR Receiver. The four set of IR transmitter and receiver are
    used to measure the four stages of crop growth. The microcontroller used in sensor
    node system is PIC18F4550 which is 8-bit microcontroller from PIC18 family. It
    is based on 16-bit instruction set architecture and it consists of 32 KB flash
    memory, 2 KB SRAM and 256 Bytes EEPROM. It has five I/O ports (PORTA, PORTB, PORTC,
    PORTD and PORTE). PORTB and PORTD have 8 pins to transmit/receive 8-bit I/O data.
    It can work on different internal and external clock sources range of frequency
    from 31 KHZ to 48 MHZ. The PIC18F4550 has four timers units, ADC, with enhanced
    communication protocols like USART, SPI I2C and USB. The LPC2148 micro-controller
    is used in ICC which is 32/16 bit ARM7TDMI-S CPU core. They have real-time emulation
    and micro-controller with embedded high speed flash memory of 512 KB. It has USB
    2.0 full speed device, multiple UARTS, SPI, SSP to I 2 Cs . Various 32-bit timers,
    dual 10-bit ADC(s), single 10-bit DAC, PWM channels and 45 fast GPIO lines with
    up to nine edge or level sensitive external interrupt pins, tiny size and low
    power consumption make these microcontrollers particularly suitable for industrial
    control and medical systems. GSM module SIM900 engine works on frequencies EGSM
    900 MHZ, DCS 1800 MHZ and PCS 1900 MHZ. This GSM modem is coming with RS232 interface,
    which allows to directly connecting with microcontroller through only two wires
    (TX, RX). This modem can be used to sending SMS, data and read SMS through simple
    AT commands. CC2500 Zigbee RF Module is a transceiver module which provides easy
    to use RF communication at 2.4 GHZ. It can be used to transmit and receive data
    at 9600 baud rates from any standard CMOS/TTL source and works in half duplex
    mode [11]. Solenoid valve is an electromechanical valve. The valve can be controlled
    by an electric current through a solenoid operates at 12V/500mA, in the case of
    a two-port valve the flow is switched off or on. SECTION IV. Experimental Study
    The output of temperature sensor (AD594) is connected with the analog input of
    PIC microcontroller. The calculation of temperature in degree Celsius is expressed
    as, T( ∘ C)=(( ADC value ∗ 5V)/1023 ) ∗ 100 View Source . The predicting growth
    stage is based on the Development Index Model (DVI), which is used throughout
    field to estimate the growth stage by means of daily temperature (DT). DVI= ∑
    planting date est date 100 A (1− e −B( T i −C))) View Source Where Ti is the DT
    (°C) on the ith day after cropping, and A, B, C are determined by the plant variety
    and the region. The solution of equation represents the speed with the crop grows,
    determined by the DT. In day-by-day to calculate the DVI value which represents
    the growth stage. The DVI value is 0 at planting, and parameters A, B, C are determined
    in order to set DVI value =100 on the day of heading. The table I shows the air
    temperature, soil temperature, relative humidity and soil moisture from day-1
    to day-12 [12]. Fig. 2 shows the relationship between air and soil temperature
    from day-l to day-12. It is clear that the soil temperature varies higher than
    the air temperature [13]. Fig. 3 shows the relationship between relative humidity
    and soil moisture in (%). The upper and lower limits of water storage in the soil
    reservoir and relative humidity have been determined in the crop field. Fig. 2.

    shows soil-water content, irrigation water during the study period. If the soil
    water content goes below the level of 21%, the motor is tum-on and respective
    valve unit is energized. The level of soil water content goes above 30%, the motor
    will be turned off and respective valve unit is de-energized. SECTION V. Conclusion
    The remote monitoring and closed loop irrigation system has been developed and
    successfully implemented in the agriculture farm. The real time information is
    gathering from senor node about the crop field which is transmitted wirelessly
    through Zigbee. The sensor values are passed into the controller and it controls
    the water resources utilization effectively. The GSM interface is helpful for
    the cultivator to receive notifications of the events occurring in the field and
    growth rate of crop. The current values of all parameters are also updated on
    LCD display. Using this system, one can save manpower, water and power consumption
    is reduced by 20% and 30% when compared to existing method. In future, other important
    soil parameters namely soil pH , soil electrical conductivity will also be incorporated
    in the system. The system will investigate leakage in pipe network, filters blockage
    in head control, and distribution of fertilizer in time. The project will allow
    for improving the efficiency of the irrigation process. ACKNOWLEDGMENT I would

  description: Automated site-specific sprinkler irrigation system can save water
    and maximize productivity, but implementing automated irrigation is challenging
    in system integration and decision making. A controllable irrigation system was
    integrated into a closed-loop control with a distributed wireless in-field sensor
    network for automated variable-rate irrigation. An experimental field was configured
    into five soil zones based on soil electrical conductivity. Micrometeorological
    sensors were installed on each zone of the distributed wireless sensor network
    and remotely monitored by a base station for decision making. Soil water sensors
    were calibrated with a neutron probe and individually identified for their response
    ranges at each zone. Irrigation decisions were site-specifically made based on
    feedback of soil water conditions from distributed in-field sensor stations. Variable-rate
    water application was remotely controlled by the base station to actuate solenoids
    to regulate the amount of time an individual group of sprinkler nozzles was irrigating
    in a 60-sec time period. The performance of the system was evaluated with the
    measurement of water usage and soil water status throughout the growing season.

    Wuhan, China SECTION I. Introduction With the aggravation of water and energy
    crisis, more and more attention was paid to water and energy saving irrigation
    technologies. Pipeline irrigation technologies such as sprinkler irrigation and
    micro-irrigation was speeded rapidly, and developed towards the direction of low
    energy consumption, high efficient water saving, high automation degree and multiple-objective
    utilization. It is reported that in 2000, the area of sprinkler irrigation and
    micro-irrigation in the world have reached 3.8 million hm2 and 26.67 million hm2,
    respectively. Low-pressure pipeline irrigation was also greatly developed. To
    the end of 2008 in China, the areas of sprinkler irrigation and micro-irrigation
    have reached 4.07 million hm2, and Low-pressure pipeline irrigation area has reached
    58.77 million hm2. However, there are also limitations for those pipeline irrigation
    systems using pressurizing electromechanical pumps. As the water consumption in
    the field usually changes in a random state, this uncertainty often result in
    pressure and flow changes in the water pipe network. Moreover, in order to adapt
    the variation of water consumption in the field and ensure the water supply, the
    working conditions of the water supply system and pumps have to change frequently
    which fails to meet the requirement of constant pressure for pipeline irrigation
    system. Therefore, the pipeline irrigation systems used to widely use regulation
    facilities like water tower, high water tank, pressure-regulating tank and valve
    to control the variation of pressure and flow changes of water pipe network system.
    In addition, for systems with large irrigation area or high gradient, a pipeline
    network in constant pressure can not meet the uniformity requirement in the whole
    field. The automatic water supply control system of graded constant pressure by
    variable frequency speed set different pressure graded control for different irrigation
    sub areas. According to changes of pipe flow, it regulates the power supply frequency,
    adjusts the pump speed, and changes the water flow rate to realize grading and
    constant-pressure water supply. It also combines with automatic control technology
    to achieve automatic switching and unattended irrigation. This system has advantages
    of high irrigation uniformity, high water and energy saving efficiency, high degree
    of automation as well as easy operation and management. SECTION II. Composition
    and working principle of the system A. Composition The automatic water supply
    control system of graded constant pressure by variable frequency speed is composed
    of frequency converter (including PID controller), programmable time switch controller,
    programmable logic controller (PLC), water level display controller, remote transmission
    pressure gauge, water level sensors and related electrical control components.
    It can automatically control one or more three-phase 380 V, 50Hz pump motors at
    the same time and is an electromechanical integration intelligent device with
    functions of variable frequency speed control and automatic closed-loop control.
    The system is designed to set multi-stage pressure conversion circuits to switch
    pressure rating automatically according to requirements of a certain sub area,
    and control the opening and closing of the solenoid valve, so as to achieve rating
    and constant-pressure automatic water supply, ensure the irrigation uniformity
    and improve the quality of irrigation. Besides, this system can monitor and control
    the level of impounding reservoirs and ensure the safety. B. Working principle
    The working principle of the automatic water supply control system of graded constant
    pressure by variable frequency speed under constant pressure (shown in Figure
    1) is to detect the pressure of control points in the pipe network by remote transmission
    pressure gauge, and convert it into electrical signal which is fed back to PID
    controller. Then PID controller compares the fed back signal and the given pressure
    to obtain a frequency signal to control the working frequency of frequency converter,
    so as to control the rotating speed of the water pump and the outlet flow to realize
    the requirement of constant pressure for control points when the flow in the pipe
    network changes. At the same time, PID controller will provide PLC with the pressure
    control information of different rating pressure so that PLC can control PID controller
    in terms of start and brake, troubleshooting and various electrical controlling.
    In addition, this system uses PTC to deliver water according to the setting irrigation
    program of subareas, sets multi-stage pressure conversion circuits to switch pressure
    rating automatically and controls the start and stop of water pumps to avoid no-load
    operation through water level display controller. Figure 1. Operating principle
    of the automatic variable frequency speed controlled rating water supply system
    under constant pressure Show All This system realizes constant-pressure water
    supply by regulation of frequency converter. The constant-pressure control principal
    is determined by pump characteristics. Figure 2 shows the relationship between
    flow rate Q and pressure head H when regulating pump speed. N 1 , N 2 , N 3 describe
    the flow rate - pressure curves under different rotating speed nl, n2, n3, respectively.
    We can see from figure 2 that when decreasing the flow rate from Q 0 to Q 1 by
    regulating the control valve under rotating rate nl, the pressure will go up from
    point O to point A following curve N 1 . So it''s apparent that the pressure increases
    (from H A to H 0 ) when decreasing the flow rate. If frequency converter is used
    to regulate rotating speed, when the rotating speed reduces from n1 to n2, the
    flow rate will decrease from Q 0 to Q 1 with a constant pressure. The characteristic
    above indicates that in a certain range we can change the rotating speed of pumps
    to adjust the outlet water flow rate, thereby maintaining constant water pressure
    and realizing constant-pressure water supply. If different pressure control levels
    were set beforehand, the rating and constant-pressure water supply can be achieved.
    C. The functions of the system This system has the following functions: It designs
    manual/automatic switching circuits. When switched to automatic position, the
    system regulates pump rotating speed automatically according to the changes of
    outlet pressure to maintain a constant pressure of pipe network. When a breakdown
    occurred in the circuits, it can be changed into manual position to make the pump
    work directly under fundamental frequency power and ensure normal water supply.
    The system sets multi-stage pressure conversion circuits to switch pressure rating
    automatically according to requirements of a certain subarea, and control the
    opening and closing of the solenoid valve. It can irrigate automatically according
    to setting irrigation program. It uses PLC to control full circle and soft start
    of water pumps. The water pumps stop working to protect themselves when the impounding
    reservoir is in a shortage of water. They also automatically start when adding
    water and stop after the water is full. The water level in the impounding reservoir
    is displayed with numbers. It has the functions of fault display and alarm, as
    well as electrical protection for lacking phase, short circuit, overload, instantaneous
    power off and so on. Figure2. Discharge/pressure relationship of centrifugal pump.
    Show All SECTION III. Determination of pressure grading The determination of pressure
    rating in this system is based on traditional design method of pipeline irrigation.
    It divides the system into several subareas according to the allowable pressure
    ranges for the pipeline irrigation system. In each subarea the working pressure
    differences of any two emitters are among the allowable pressure ranges. Then
    through pressure control by subarea and rating, it can achieve the requirement
    that working pressure between any two emitters in the whole system are among the
    allowable pressure ranges, therefore it can ensure the irrigation uniformity in
    the system. When determining the pressure rating, the allowable pressure ranges
    of the irrigation system should be given firstly to divide the system into subareas.
    In each subarea the working pressure differences of any two emitters should among
    the designed allowable pressure ranges. That is, the following formula must be
    satisfied: h imax− h min ≤Δh (1) View Source h imax ––The maximum working pressure
    of emitters in subarea i, m, i=1,2,…,n ; h imin ––The minimum working pressure
    of emitters in subareai, m, i=1,2,…,n ; Δh ––The designed allowable pressure ranges
    of the irrigation system, m. Δh= h 0 ×20% h 0 is the designed working pressure
    of irrigation emitters, m. After the irrigation subareas are determined, the pressure
    control points of the pipe network need to be determined. Generally the control
    points can be selected in the hinge area of the pipe network for easy management,
    but the area is large, they can also be chosen in the entrance of pipe network
    in subareas. The designed pressure rating value can be calculated according to
    the following formula: H i = h is + h if + z i (2) View Source H i ––designed
    pressure rating value in subarea i, m, i=1,2,…,n ; h is ––designed working pressure
    of pipe network entrance in subarea i, m, i=1,2,…,n ; h if ––head loss from pipe
    network entrance to pressure control points in subarea i, including the head loss
    along the way and the local head loss, m, i=1,2,…,n ; z i ––height difference
    between pipe network entrance and pressure control points in subarea i, m, i=1,2,…,n
    ; In traditional pipeline irrigation engineering designs and operation, rotation
    irrigation groups generally should be divided in strict accordance with the pump
    outlet flow, which could not meet the requirements of present Rural Household
    and Land Contract Responsibility System and diversification of agricultural planting
    structure. However, in the automatic variable frequency speed controlled rating
    water supply system under constant pressure, the rotation irrigation groups are
    divided by size and terrain of the irrigation field, which leads to more flexible
    planning and design as well as convenient operation and management. SECTION IV.
    Engineering example There is a lawn irrigation project in Xi''an city in Shaanxi
    province. The irrigation area is 2850m2. It plans to use urban water supply network
    as the water source to build an impounding reservoir, and irrigate by pressurized
    water pump. The irrigation method is fixed sprinkler irrigation, and the chosen
    nozzles are buried scattering rectangular nozzles of 15SQ. When the working pressure
    of nozzles is 0.2 MPa, the water flow rate is 0.85m3/h and the range is 6.4×6.4m
    . The nozzles combination form is rectangular design and round spray. Angle-adjustable
    nozzles are used in the corner with fan-shaped spray. The nozzle spacing and distance
    between two tubes are both 5m and can be adjusted slightly according to practical
    terrain. The gradient of the lawn field is quite large, with a biggest altitude
    difference of 13.31m and the shape of the field is also not regular, and the surface
    runoff is not allowed to generate during irrigating. If using the traditional
    sprinkling irrigation method to divide the system into 6 rotation irrigation groups,
    the flow rate and required working pressure for each rotation irrigation group
    is different. The actual maximum working pressure difference between nozzles reaches
    13.19m (shown in table 1), but the designed allowable pressure ranges is only
    4 meters. So it can not meet the requirement of irrigation uniformity and will
    generate surface runoff. However, when using the automatic variable frequency
    speed controlled rating and constant-pressure water supply system, the irrigation
    area can be divided into 3 subareas based on the original division of rotation
    groups. Different pressure ratings of 0.30MPa, 0.34MPa, 0.39Mpa are used. The
    pressure control points are set in the head of pipe network. Calculations of irrigation
    subarea dividing and pressure rating are shown in table 1. We can also see from
    table 1 that the actual maximum working pressure difference of nozzles reaches
    3.95m and is below the designed allowable pressure ranges, which illustrates that
    the irrigation uniformity is achieved. Moreover, each rotation irrigation group
    controls irrigation by the solenoid valves and using automatic intermittent cycle,
    which will not generate surface runoff. Through field test, every time a rotation
    irrigation group spay for 5 min, and the system irrigate circularly until the
    requirement of irrigation schedule is satisfied. The switches of rotation irrigation
    group, irrigation subareas and pressure rating are controlled automatically. Overall,
    this automatic control system can meet the requirement of uniformity, and is easy
    for management. There is no surface runoff during irrigation, so it has remarkable
    water and energy saving effects and can protect the water pumps and pipe network.

    25.86 SECTION V. Conclusion During the process of pipeline irrigation using pressurizing
    electromechanical pumps, the pumps usually work in constant speed under fundamental
    frequency power supply and the operation characteristics of pumps could not be
    regulated to adapt the practical changes of pipe network in operation. In addition,
    when the irrigation area is large or the gradient of field is high, a constant
    pipe network pressure could not satisfy the requirement of irrigation uniformity
    in the whole field. The automatic water supply control system of graded constant
    pressure by variable frequency speed is based on traditional design method of
    pipeline irrigation system, combine the frequency conversion and automation technologies,
    and divide the field into irrigation subareas according to pressure rating. Each
    subarea delivers water automatically according to appropriate pressure rating,
    which can greatly enhance irrigation uniformity. Additionally, the system has
    good water and energy saving effect, high automation degree and easy operation
    and management. It can also protect the water pumps and the pipe network. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

  description: In this paper, an automatic Smart Irrigation Decision Support System,
    SIDSS, is proposed to manage irrigation in agriculture. Our system estimates the
    weekly irrigations needs of a plantation, on the basis of both soil measurements
    and climatic variables gathered by several autonomous nodes deployed in field.
    This enables a closed loop control scheme to adapt the decision support system
    to local perturbations and estimation errors. Two machine learning techniques,
    PLSR and ANFIS, are proposed as reasoning engine of our SIDSS. Our approach is
    validated on three commercial plantations of citrus trees located in the South-East
    of Spain. Performance is tested against decisions taken by a human expert.

    Support System, for precision agriculture. • The developed system estimates the
    weekly irrigations needs of a plantation, based on soil and climatic variables.
    • Performance is tested against decisions taken by a human expert on three commercial
    plantations. Abstract In this paper, an automatic Smart Irrigation Decision Support
    System, SIDSS, is proposed to manage irrigation in agriculture. Our system estimates
    the weekly irrigations needs of a plantation, on the basis of both soil measurements
    and climatic variables gathered by several autonomous nodes deployed in field.
    This enables a closed loop control scheme to adapt the decision support system
    to local perturbations and estimation errors. Two machine learning techniques,
    PLSR and ANFIS, are proposed as reasoning engine of our SIDSS. Our approach is
    validated on three commercial plantations of citrus trees located in the South-East
    of Spain. Performance is tested against decisions taken by a human expert. Previous

    optimisationMachine learning 1. Introduction The efficient use of water in agriculture
    is one of the most important agricultural challenges that modern technologies
    are helping to achieve. In arid and semiarid regions, the differences between
    precipitation and irrigation water requirements are so big that irrigation management
    is a priority for sustainable and economically profitable crops (IDAE, 2005).
    To accomplish this efficient use, expert agronomists rely on information from
    several sources (soil, plant and atmosphere) to properly manage the irrigation
    requirements of the crops (Puerto et al., 2013). This information is defined by
    a set of variables, which can be measured using sensors, that are able to characterise
    the water status of the plants and the soil in order to obtain their water requirements.
    While meteorological variables are representative of a large area and can be easily
    measured by a single sensor for a vast land extension, soil and plant variables
    have a large spatial variability. Therefore, in order to use these parameters
    to effectively schedule the irrigation of the plants, multiple sensors are needed
    (Naor et al., 2001). Weather is one of the key factors being used to estimate
    the water requirements of the crops (Allen et al., 1998). Moreover, it is very
    frequent that public agronomic management organisms have weather stations spread
    around the different regions. These weather stations usually provide information
    of key variables for the agriculture like reference evapotranspiration (ET0) or
    the Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD) that are of great importance to calculate the
    water requirements of the crops. Using variables related to the climate is the
    most common approach to create crop water requirement models (Jensen et al., 1970,
    Smith, 2000, Zwart and Bastiaanssen, 2004). Using these models, based on solely
    meteorological variables, a decision-making system can determine how a given crop
    will behave (Guariso et al., 1985). However, not all the regions have access to
    an extensive network of weather stations or they may not be nearby a given crop,
    thus the local micro-climates are not taken into account if only these parameters
    are used. Besides, irrigation models based only on climate parameters rely on
    an open loop structure. This means that the model is subject to stochastic events
    and it may not be able to correct the local perturbations that can occur when
    a unexpected weather phenomenon occurs (for instance irrigate the crop when it’s
    already raining) (Dutta et al., 2014, Giusti and Marsili-Libelli, 2015). Finally,
    monitoring other variables, such as hydrodynamic soil factors or water drainage,
    might increase the chances that the irrigation predicted by the models is properly
    used by the plants (Kramer and Boyer, 1995). Therefore, the usage of sensors that
    measures the soil water status is a key complement to modulate the water requirements
    of the crops. Soil variables, such as soil moisture content or soil matric potential,
    are considered by many authors as crucial part of scheduling tools for managing
    irrigation (Cardenas-Lailhacar and Dukes, 2010, Soulis et al., 2015). The information
    from soil sensors can be used to create better decision models with closed loop
    structures that adapt to weather and soil perturbations (Cardenas-Lailhacar and
    Dukes, 2010, Soulis et al., 2015). This practice, however, has not been widely
    adopted due to the technological limitations of available soil sensors, which
    required measured information to be registered and stored, traditionally using
    wired dataloggers, and limiting the installation flexibility and the real time
    interaction. This has changed recently with new generation sensors and sensor
    networks that are more versatile and suited to the agricultural environment (Navarro-Hellín
    et al., 2015). Combining climate and soil variables has therefore potential to
    properly manage irrigation in a more efficient way than other traditional approaches.
    However, it also entails a series of challenges related with the increased amount
    of data flow, its analysis and its use to create effective models, in particular
    when data provided by different sources may seem contradictory and/or redundant.
    Traditionally, this analysis and modelling is performed by a human expert who
    interprets the different variables. The need of a human agronomist expert is required
    due to the complexity introduced by the soil spatial variability, crop species
    variability and their irrigation requirements over the growth cycle (Maton et
    al., 2005), which require comparing crops models and local context variables to
    determine the specific water requirements to achieve a certain goal at a particular
    location. The complexity of this problem and the different sources of variability
    makes than even the best model may deviate from the prediction, which favours
    the use of close loop control systems combining soil and climate sensors over
    open loop systems as a way to compensate possible deviations in future predictions.
    Human expertise has been proved effective to assist irrigation management but
    it is not scalable and available to every field, farm and crop and it is slow
    in the analysis of the data and real time processing. Instead, applying machine
    learning techniques to replace the manual models and to assist expert agronomists
    allows the viability of creating automatic Irrigation Decision Support System.
    Machine learning techniques have been used previously to estimate relevant parameters
    of the crop (Sreekanth et al., 2015). Giusti and Marsili-Libelli(2015) present
    a fuzzy decision systems to predict the volumetric water content of the soil based
    on local climate data. Adeloye et al. (2012), proposed the use of unsupervised
    artificial neural networks (ANN) to estimate the evapotranspiration also based
    on weather information solely. King and Shellie (2016) used NN modelling to estimate
    the lower threshold temperature (Tnws) needed to calculate the crop water stress
    index for wine grapes. In Campos et al. (2016) the authors presented a new algorithm
    designed to estimate the total available water in the soil root zone of a vineyard
    crop, using only SWC sensors, which are very dependent of the location. Taking
    advantage of the soil information, Valdés-Vela et al., 2015, Abrisqueta et al.,
    2015 incorporates the volumetric soil water content, manually collected with a
    neutron probe, to agro-meteorological data. This information is then fed into
    a fuzzy logic system to estimate the stem water potential. Other approaches in
    the literature also make use of machine learning techniques – such as principal
    component analysis, unsupervised clustering, and ANN – to estimate the irrigation
    requirements in crops. However they do not specify the quantity of water needed
    (Dutta et al., 2014), they reduce the prediction to true or false, and/or they
    are based on open loop structures (Giusti and Marsili-Libelli, 2015, Jensen et
    al., 1970, Smith, 2000, Zwart and Bastiaanssen, 2004), only considering the weather
    information and, therefore, unable to correct deviations from their predictions.
    This paper proposes an automated decision support system to manage the irrigation
    on a certain crop field, based on both climatic and soil variables provided by
    weather stations and soil sensors. As discussed, we postulate that the usage of
    machine learning techniques with the weather and soil variables is of great importance
    and can help to achieve a fully automated close loop system able to precisely
    predict the irrigation needs of a crop. Our presented system is evaluated by comparing
    it against the irrigations reports provided by an agronomist specialist during
    a complete season in different fields. 2. System structure An irrigation advice
    system is based on the concept of predicting the waters needs of the crops in
    order to irrigate them properly. Traditionally this decision has been taken by
    an experienced farmer or an expert agricultural technician. Fig. 1 shows the flow
    diagram of which the proposed system is based. Download : Download high-res image
    (82KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Flow diagram of the proposed
    system. In this schema, an expert agronomist is in charge of analysing the information
    from different sources: Weather stations located near the crops that collect meteorological
    data, Crop and Soil characteristics (type, age, size, cycle, etc.) and Soil sensors
    installed in the crop fields. The expert analyses the information to provide an
    irrigation report, which indicates the amount of water needed to irrigate properly
    the crops in the upcoming week. To make this decision making process manageable,
    the information needed to create the irrigation report on the next week is only
    the information of the current week. Based on this concept, our Smart Irrigation
    Decision Support System (SIDSS) is proposed. In order to evaluate the performance
    and validity of our approach, the decision system will use the same information
    used by the expert agronomist and will output the water requirements for the upcoming
    week. This will ensure a fair comparison between the decisions taken by a human
    expert and the SIDSS. To accomplish this, the machine learning system must be
    trained with historical data and irrigations reports of the agronomist, using
    the irrigation decisions taken in these reports as the groundtruth of the system.
    The aim of the system is to be as accurate as possible to this groundtruth. Several
    machine learning techniques were applied and evaluated to achieve the best performance.

    The Irrigation Decision System is composed of three main components: a collection
    device that gathers information from the soil sensors, weather stations that provide
    agrometeorological information and the SIDSS that, when trained correctly, is
    able to predict the irrigation requirements of the crops for the incoming week.

    2.1. Collection device and soil sensors The information from the soil sensors
    is gathered using our own developed device that has been proved to be completely
    functional for irrigation management in different crops and conditions (Navarro-Hellín
    et al., 2015). This device is wireless, equipped with a GSM/GPRS modem, and is
    completely autonomous, so that the installation procedures are accessible to any
    farmer. Fig. 3 shows the collection device installed in a lemon crop field located
    in the South-East of Spain. Download : Download high-res image (302KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Device installed in a lemon crop field. The
    device allows to fully configure the recording rates of all the embedded sensors.
    In our experiments, a sampling rate of 15 min was set, since this gives a good
    balance between providing enough information to support a correct agronomic decision
    and maintaining the autonomy of the device with the equipped solar panel and battery
    (López Riquelme et al., 2009, Navarro-Hellín et al., 2015. The information is
    received, processed and stored in a relational database. 2.1.1. Soil sensors The
    soil control variables used to provide SIDSS with relevant information are matric
    potential (Ψm) and volumetric soil water content (θv), which are common in irrigation
    management (Jones, 2004). By using these variables, the irrigation can be scheduled
    for maintaining soil moisture conditions equivalent or close to field capacity
    in order to satisfy the required crop water requirements. Likewise, they can be
    used to maintain soil water content or soil matric potential under certain reference
    values proper of regulated deficit irrigation strategies. Both Ψm and θv are used
    to decide the irrigation frequency and to adjust the gross irrigation doses. Soil
    matric potential was measured with MPS-2 sensors (Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman,
    WA 99163 – USA), while volumetric soil water content was measured with both 10-HS
    (Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163 – USA) and Enviroscan (Sentek Pty. Ltd.,
    Adelaide, Australia) sensors. Besides both previous soil sensors, another sensor
    is used. A pluviometer (Rain-o173-matic small, Pronamic Ltd., Ringkøbing, Denmark)
    was used under the dripper to provide accurate estimation of the amount of water
    applied and the irrigation run time. The information provided by this sensor was
    used to ensure that the farmer is following the instruction of the agronomic reports
    provided by the expert. Table 2 summarises the variables measured by the soils
    sensors. Table 2. Soil sensors technical information. Sensor Measured data Variable

    Weather stations Experiments took place in the Region of Murcia, Spain. In this
    region, there is a network of 45 agro-meteorological stations located in irrigated
    areas, the Agricultural Information Network System of Murcia (SIAM), funded by
    the EU and installed to help estimate the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and
    the irrigation needs of crops after a severe drought between 1979 and 1985. The
    variables measured by the stations are the following: Temperature (T), Relative
    humidity (RH), Global radiation (GR), Wind speed (WS), Rainfall (RF), Dew point
    (DP), Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD). These variables, measured by the different
    stations, are publicly available and can be downloaded from the SIAM website (SIAM,
    2015). The weather stations are tested and calibrated periodically according to
    the manufacturer’s specifications. The amount of water required to compensate
    the evapotranspiration loss from the cropped field is defined as crop water requirement.
    Therefore, knowing the reference crop evapotranspiration is of key importance
    to estimate the crop’s water requirements. Using the FAO Penman–Monteith formulation
    (Allen et al., 1998), the daily reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) can be
    calculated by means of the weather information. The crop evapotranspiration under
    standard condition (ETc) can be calculated using the single crop coefficient approach
    shown below: (1) where Kc is the crop coefficient and depends on multiple factors,
    namely, the crop type, climate, crop evaporation and soil growth stages. 2.3.
    Smart Irrigation Decision Support System The decision support system is the component
    in charge of taking the final decision on the amount of water to be irrigated,
    or equivalently, the number of minutes to irrigate considering constant water
    flow. This decision is taken automatically on the basis of the information provided
    by the sensors and the usage of machine learning and pattern recognition techniques.
    The aim of this component, therefore, is to mimic a human expert in the decision
    making process of weekly optimising the irrigation, which could assist the farmer.
    Applying machine learning techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    or Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) allow us to visualise the information to
    perform an initial exploratory analysis. Fig. 4 shows the LDA of the input, array
    containing the sensorial variables, and output, the estimated irrigation time
    need, used in the system. The output was divided in classes (18), each one representing
    the weekly irrigation time by increments of 150 min, from 0 to 2700 min. From
    this figure, it can be noticed that discrete classification in classes will be
    hard to accomplish due to the high number of classes necessary to precisely quantise
    the irrigation estimation. This is due to the fact that the variable to estimate
    – either the amount of water or the watering time-has an intrinsic continuous
    nature, since the expected output can take any real value between 0 and infinity.
    Therefore, conventional classifiers aiming categorical outputs – such as LDA (Fisher,
    1938), SVM (Belousov et al., 2002), and ANN are not optimal for this application.
    Instead, methodologies based on regression (Wold et al., 1984), and/or fuzzy logic
    (Zadeh et al., 1996) allow us to estimate a more suited continuous variable. Download

    Linear discriminant analysis for 18 irrigation time intervals. In this section,
    we propose two different techniques, each belonging to one of the previous families,
    to estimate the weekly required amount of water. As described in the introduction
    and experimental sections, both modelling techniques require a supervised training
    set in order to learn the irrigation model. 2.3.1. Partial least square regression
    Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) (Wold et al., 2001) is a statistical method
    that seeks the fundamental relations between predictor and response variables.
    Predictor variables, X, are defined as the observable variables that can be measured
    and input into the decision system. Response variable Y are the outputs or estimates
    that must be deducted from the input. The relationship between both variable sets,
    and linear multivariate regression model, is found by projecting both predicted
    and observable variables into a new space, where latent variables are estimated
    to model the covariance structure between the predictor space and the observation
    space. This PLSR model is developed from a training set D = {X, Y} of S samples,
    which is composed of the predictor matrix X = [x1, … , xi, … , xS]T and the response
    matrix Y = [y1, … , yi, … , yS]T. xi is a column vector of K elements, that can
    contain all the sensor and weather variables measured at a given week i: (2) and
    yi is another column vector of M elements, containing the corresponding variables
    to be estimated at that week i. Since in our application this is only the irrigation
    time recommended at that week, yi is reduced to a scalar and M = 1: PLSR constructs
    new predictor latent variables, known as components, which are linear combinations
    of the original predictor observable variables. These components are created to
    explain the observed variability in the original predictor variables, while simultaneously
    considering the response variable. That is, the estimated latent variables are
    linear combinations of predictor variables that have higher covariance with Y.
    Using the latent variables leads to a regression models able to fit the response
    variable with fewer components. The PLSR learning model can be expressed as: (3)
    (4) where T and U are the projections – aka scores – of X and Y into a smaller
    L-dimensional latent space respectively, P and Q are the orthogonal projection
    matrices – aka loading matrices – and E and G the error residuals. P and Q can
    be obtained by eigendecomposition of the original matrices. Since the X-scores
    T are meant to be good predictors of Y, it can be approximated that: (5) Being
    F a new residual. This reduces the problem to find a set of weights W such that
    T = X ∗ W predicts X and Y reasonably well. As mentioned, these orthogonal coefficients
    should maximise the correlation between X and Y while explaining the variance
    of X: (6) P and Q can be solved by applying a Least Square Estimator (LSE) so:
    (7) (8) Finally, by rewriting the previous equation, it can be derived that: (9)
    Being B the PLSR regression coefficients. Once these coefficients have been learned,
    responses y∗ for new observation x∗ can be estimated by applying the learning
    model: (10) assuming an estimation error f. We favour the use of PLSR among other
    regression techniques due to its suitability when the number of predictors is
    bigger than the number of response variables, the responses are noisy and there
    is a high probability of having multicollinearity among the predictor variables.
    The multicollinear phenomenon happens when those variable are highly correlated,
    due to redundancy between sensors and or between meteorological factors. As it
    can be noticed, all these factors appear in our irrigation problem. 2.3.2. Adaptive
    neuro fuzzy inference systems Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) (Jang,
    1993) is a fuzzy inference system for systematically generating fuzzy rules from
    a given input/output D dataset. This machine learning technique combines advantages
    from fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks. On the one hand, it allows us
    to represent an element not only into categories but also into a certain degree
    of membership functions, which allows mimicking the characteristics of human reasoning
    and decision making. On the one hand, it can be trained and so can self-improve
    in order to adjust the membership functions parameters directly from data (Wang
    et al., 2006). The ANFIS architecture consists in a five-layer feedforward neural
    network (Fig. 5) whose parameters are updated using a combination of gradient
    descent and LSE in a two-pass learning algorithm. Download : Download high-res
    image (95KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Example of ANFIS architecture
    for a input x with K variables and a 1-variable output y. In a first forward pass
    step, neuron outputs are calculated layer by layer and some internal consequent
    parameters are identified by the least squares estimator (LSE) to obtain the final
    single output. The forward pass operation at layer 1 defines the fuzzy membership
    for each input variable X. Assuming a Gaussian distribution function , the output
    of this layer is given by: (11) Layer 2 is a multiplicative layer, which calculates
    the firing strength of the rules as a product of the previous membership grades.
    (12) Layer 3 is a normalising layer, where: (13) Layer 4 applies a node function:
    (14) where and are consequent parameters estimated using LSE. Finally, layer 5
    is the output layer that provides the overall estimation y as a summation of all
    incoming signals. For the case M = 1, where only one output variable is estimated:
    (15) After the forward pass has been completed, an initial estimation is provided
    by the ANFIS network. Since initial premise parameters are initialised randomly,
    the initial estimation will differ greatly from the desired values Y. This error
    or difference between the desired output y and the estimated output for a given
    training sample {xi, yi} can be expressed as: (16) To correct this deviation,
    a second learning step, or backward pass, attempts to minimise the estimated error
    by modifying the value of the premise parameters until the desired and estimated
    outputs are similar. This process is performed using backpropagation, where the
    error is propagated back over the layers and decomposed into the different nodes
    using the chain rule. Gradient descend is used as optimisation technique to update
    the premise parameters while the consequent parameters are kept fixed until the
    next iteration. This double step learning process is repeated iteratively for
    every single sample in the training set until the estimated error is smaller than
    a given threshold, i.e. convergence is achieved, or a maximum number of iterations
    – epocs – are reached. The ANFIS implementation used in this work is taken from
    the Fuzzy logic toolbox (Inc, 2016), by Mathworks where the parameter Radii used
    to train was a scalar of value 0.75 and the average number of epochs used to train
    was 1500. 3. Experimental setup The system was evaluated in three commercial plantations
    of lemon trees in the Region of Murcia, located in the semiarid zone of the South-East
    of Spain where the water is very scarce and drip irrigation is commonly used.
    The irrigation criteria followed was to maximise the yield. Plantation 1. Fino
    lemon trees (Citrus limon L. Burm. Fil cv. 49) on Citrus macrophylla Wester, growing
    in a soil with a low water retention capacity. The soil is characterised by a
    deep and homogeneous sandy – clay – loam texture. The irrigation water had an
    electrical conductivity (EC) of 2200 μS cm−1. The orchard consist of 11 year old
    lemon trees with an average height of 3.5 m. Tree spacing was 7.0 m × 5.5 m, with
    an average ground coverage of about 47%. Two drip irrigation lines (0.8 m apart)
    were used for each tree row. There were 4 emitters (4 L h−1) on both sides of
    each tree. One sensor node was installed in the 5.5 ha orchard, with a soil matric
    potential sensor (MPS-2, Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163 – USA) at a
    depth of 30 cm and three soil moisture sensors at a depth of 20, 40 and 80 cm
    (Enviroscan, Sentek Pty. Ltd., Adelaide, Australia) located 20 cm from a representative
    dripper and 2.25 m from the trunk. According to the nearest weather station of
    SIAM, located about 5 km from the orchard, the climate was typically Mediterranean.
    Thus, over this period (2014), the annual rainfall for the area was 210 mm and
    ET0 was 1395 mm. The average wind speed was 1.66 m/s, generally light wind and
    sometimes moderate. Plantation 2 and 3. 40 and 35 year old lemon trees (C. limon
    L. Burm. Fil) cv. Fino and cv. Verna respectively, grafted on sour orange (Citrus
    aurantium L.), growing in a soil with a medium water retention capacity. The soil
    is clay sandy loam texture and the irrigation water had an electrical conductivity
    (EC) of 1600 μS cm−1 during all season except in summer which was of 2285 μS cm−1.
    The tree spacing was 7.0 m × 6.75 m and 6.75 m × 6.75 m and the average ground
    coverage about 57% and 50%, respectively. One drip irrigation line was used for
    each tree row. There were 8 and 6 emitters of 4 L h−1 per tree, respectively.
    One sensor node was installed in the Fino orchard (≈15 ha) and another in Verna
    orchard (≈23 ha), each with two soil matric potential sensor (MPS-2, Decagon devices,
    Inc., Pullman, WA 99163 – USA) at a depth of 25 and 45 cm and three soil moisture
    sensors at a depth of 25, 45 and 70 cm (10HS, Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman,
    WA 99163) located 20 cm from a representative dripper and the vertical canopy
    projection. According to the nearest SIAM’s weather station, located about 7 km
    from the orchards, the climate was also typically Mediterranean. Over this period
    (2014), the annual rainfall for the area was 150 mm and ET0 was 1250 mm. The average
    wind speed was 1.4 m/s, i.e. light wind generally. The decision of selecting these
    three plantations is based on the fact that all of them are mature lemon trees
    and therefore their water irrigation requirement differences depend mainly of
    environmental conditions (soil and atmosphere) rather than the plant. Besides,
    all the plantations use drip emitters of 4 L h−1 so estimating the irrigation
    runtime of the week instead of the water volume will be a correct approach. Drip
    irrigation provides a fixed volume of water per hour; the pressure is maintained
    using pressure compensating emitters. The Irrigation frequency is calculated taking
    into account that only a certain amount of water depletion is allowed before the
    next replenishment is scheduled. Thus, the run time (gross irrigation dose) is
    determined to be equivalent to the previous amount of water depletion. The experts
    only need to calculate the irrigation run time (minutes) and the number of watering
    times per week or day depending on the time of year or crop development stage.
    The main goal of the system, also reflected by the expert agronomist in his reports,
    is to maximise the yield (maximum production per crop surface) with an optimum
    water management. Since information from the weather stations, soil sensors and
    crops characteristics has different sampling periods, the first step is pre-process
    this information. After analysing several methods and time intervals it was decided
    that the best option was to calculate the week average value for each of the sensors
    or weather stations variable except for the rainfall where the total amount of
    rainfall during the week is used instead. The week average fits better than others
    method like the daily average due to the fact, that the irrigation reports from
    the expert agronomist are already fixed, limited and done weekly. Besides, adding
    more input will make the data sparser, making more difficult to find patterns
    in the feature space, requiring a higher amount of data to train the system accordingly.
    The input obtained will be a one dimensional vector xi for each week in which
    the columns are the different variables or inputs of our system. The target vector
    will be the water requirements of the crops in the following week yi. This information
    has been extracted from the agronomist expert weekly reports in order to be used
    as groundtruth for comparison as for supervising the learning process. Three datasets
    are available, each dataset represent a different plantation. Data was collected
    from January 2014 until June 2015. Each plantation dataset has 74 weeks of data,
    which makes a total of 224 weeks of data. To accomplish a proper analysis of the
    system, we have divided the experiment in two different scenarios. Both scenarios
    differ from the other on the training and testing split. Two machine learning
    methods are applied on each scenario, a method based on PLSR and a method based
    on ANFIS. The performances of both methods in the different scenarios are analysed.
    4. Experimental results and discussion 4.1. Scenario 1 In this scenario, we aim
    to successfully predict the irrigation needs of one or several plantation, based
    on the information provided by the collection device and learned knowledge from
    a historical archive of the previous year irrigation reports. This is of obvious
    usefulness in real life. We will demonstrate this capability by predicting the
    irrigation needs of year 2015 for the three plantations based on the information
    of the year 2014. The training set is therefore composed by all 2014 weeks of
    data belonging the three plantations, while the test set is composed by all 2015
    weeks belonging to the three plantations. The information given to the system,
    or input vector, is a critical part of the design. On the one hand using unnecessary
    features may make the system perform poorly due to redundant information and noise.
    On the other hand, using too few features may not provide all the required information.
    Therefore, among all the available features explained in Table 1, they will not
    all be necessary. Table 3 shows the features subsets selected for each test. Among
    all possible sets of features, only combinations with logical sense, according
    to an expert agronomist were chosen a priori for the different experiments. Performance
    of the different sets is shown in Fig. 6. Table 3. Features subset and variables

    sets of variables for linear regression and ANFIS. The set that accomplish the
    best performance for both methods is F6, with and error of 155.1 and 121.1 min
    week−1 for PLSR and ANFIS respectively. In order to put this error into context,
    it can be noticed that 2.5 extra hours of irrigation represent around 10% of the
    total time in summer months – and up to 20% in spring and autumn months, being
    10% error considered as an acceptable error in agriculture (Bos et al., 2004).
    Therefore, this feature set F6 will be the input vector of the system. It can
    be noticed that including the rain as input of the system (F7), increases the
    error. In the Region of Murcia, the rainfall are extremely low (around 210 mm
    per year) and usually being concentrated in a few days of the year, being the
    weekly total rain in most cases 0. With this information only available for the
    year 2014, the system didn’t have enough information to be trained properly and
    developed in unpredictable results. However we understand that in other regions
    the rainfall could be really useful to increase the performance of the system.
    Besides, considering the water retention capabilities of the soil, part of the
    rainfalls would be considered in the next irrigation report. Fig. 7 shows the

    using soil and weather information for the different plantations (Plantation 1:
    Week 1–24, Plantation 2: Week 25–48, Plantation 3: Week 49–72). The weekly errors
    for predicting the irrigation needs during the year 2015 in the three plantations
    are 155.1 and 121.1 min week−1 for PLSR and ANFIS respectively. The standard deviation
    for PLSR is 120.7. In the case of ANFIS, the standard deviation is 105.2. The
    total amount of time needed to irrigate the crops in the three plantations in
    2015 is 65,641 min. ANFIS method estimates this value in 60,506 min and PLSR estimates
    63,240 min. As conclusion, ANFIS performance is better than PLSR for each individual
    week water requirement estimation. However, PLSR estimation also follows the irrigation
    pattern accurately and estimates the total amount of water required more accurately
    over time than ANFIS, which seems to be more conservative in the water usage.
    Looking at the higher peaks of water requirement in the graphs, PLSR may overestimate
    the water needs while ANFIS is more accurate in general. It is important to note
    that in agronomy the most important point is not only the amount of water plants
    need but when they need it (Allen et al., 1998). Following this criterion, the
    performance of ANFIS is much better than PLSR for this scenario. Another factor
    that is important to analyse in this research is the use of soil sensors in addition
    to weather stations to close the loop. We consider that using this kind of sensors
    to estimate the water requirements of the crops improves the accuracy of the estimation
    and helps to deal with local disturbances. Since this is one of our main contributions
    and differences with other proposed automatic irrigation systems, a detailed analysis
    of the contribution of these variables is needed to validate our hypotheses and
    facilitate comparison with previous research systems. Therefore, the input vector
    was changed, using only weather information to train the system and predict the
    irrigation time. Table 4 shows the weekly average error for different sets of
    input vectors. Table 4. Summary of the performance of the different subsets. System

    irrigation pattern using weather information for the different plantations (Plantation

    PLSR using only weather information is 175.3 min week−1 with a standard deviation
    of 147.6. In the case of ANFIS, the error is 159.6 min week−1 with a standard
    deviation of 146.6. Although in general the shape of the graph is quite similar
    to the one using both soil and weather. The use of soil sensors gives a fine adjustment
    increasing the accuracy of the estimation for both PLSR and ANFIS reasoning engines.
    It can be concluded that a much better performance in the weekly irrigation estimation
    (around a 22% smaller weekly average error) is achieved when adding soils sensor
    information to the weather information. Next, a cross-validation strategy is applied
    to the scenario to validate how the results will generalise to an independent
    dataset. In cross validation, the complete dataset of the three plantations is
    divided in training and testing sets. The method used to cross-validate the information
    is Leave one out (LoO CV), a particular case of the Leave-p-out cross-validation
    (LpO CV). Kohavi, 1995, Picard and Cook, 1984 that involves using 1 observation
    as the testing set and the remaining observations as the training set. This process
    is repeated the number of samples times (n) changing the test sample each time
    to validate the system with all the samples. Cross validation method was used
    for both PLSR and ANFIS. Fig. 9 shows the results of this LoO Cross-Validation

    deviation of 153.2. In the case of ANFIS, the error is 87.6 min week−1 with a
    standard deviation of 102.9. The total amount of time needed to irrigate the crops
    for the 189 weeks in the three plantations is 214,020 min. The ANFIS method estimates
    this value on 213,180 min and PLSR estimates 213,960 min. Table 5 summarises the
    result of the experiments. Table 5. Scenario 1 results summary. Results Average

    Similar conclusions are extracted using Cross-Validation. Both PLSR and ANFIS
    systems are really close to the groundtruth in the total amount of water estimated
    but it is clear that ANFIS performs much better than PLSR if we consider the weekly
    error. It is also confirmed that using soil sensors in addition to weather information
    results in a better performance for both ANFIS and PLSR methods. The improvement
    on ANFIS performance during cross validation is explained by the larger amount
    of training data regarding the “predict 2015” experiment. This behaviour is expected
    due to the nature of neural networks, which require large amount of data to be
    trained in comparison with other machine learning techniques and we predict than
    having a historical archive longer for training could results in a further improvement.
    Although we are validating our systems with the three plantations described before
    as case of study, in principle, our methodology has been designed to be independent
    of the crop, terrain and location of the plantation, aiming to propose a general
    close-loop automatic irrigation estimator. In practical terms, this means that
    to apply our system to new plantations, training data in the form of sensor and
    weather weekly data as well as irrigation reports provided by and expert agronomist
    for the new plantation will be needed. Since these reports can be expensive and
    compiling a substantial amount of weekly reports is time consuming and must be
    planned in advance, it is important to know how big the dataset must be and how
    the performance may improve with the number of training weeks. Therefore, as final
    experiment to obtain an estimation of the required amount of training data for
    a new crop/plantation, the complete dataset was divided in different percentages
    of training and testing. Fig. 10 shows the weekly error of both PLSR and ANFIS
    methods with respect to the training dataset percentage. Download : Download high-res
    image (68KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Performance comparison
    for linear regression and ANFIS with respect to the % of samples used to train.
    According to the figure, it is noticeable that ANFIS performance is much better
    than PLSR if there are enough samples to train the system. In cases where the
    percentage of samples for training is low (less than 25% of the data, i.e. less
    than 4 months of data for a given field), PLSR overperforms ANFIS. This case is
    relevant for new plantations without historical data of previous reports. In such
    situations, the PLSR predictive model may be used in early stages, before switching
    to ANFIS once enough samples to train the system properly are collected. 4.2.
    Scenario 2 The goal is to predict the irrigation of a plantation based on its
    weather and soil measured variables but using a SIDSS system trained exclusively
    with other fields. This will be the hardest scenario as it will be necessary to
    predict the irrigation needs of a field with no previous irrigation reports of
    that specific plantation. This scenario attempts to show the potential of our
    methodology to create a universal irrigation estimator of a given crop – in our
    case, lemon trees – for any given plantation, independently of the location and/or
    terrain. A lower performance can be expected in comparison to what could be achieved
    by retraining the system with information of the plantation (scenario 1), which
    is sacrificed for the benefit of not having to generate manual irrigation report
    for new plantations. Cross validation, specifically leave-one_plantation-out is
    applied in validation. Thus, 2014 and 2015 data from two of the plantations are
    used for training, while the remaining plantation data (2014 + 2015) is used for
    testing. This is repeated 3 times, leaving a different plantation out of the training
    set each time, and the results averaged. Table 6 shows the error and standard
    deviation of this scenario for PLSR and ANFIS using different features vector
    used to compare the performance. Table 6. Scenario 2 results summary. Method Features

    156.5 126.9 234.8 192.6 197.4 153.2 The best feature vector F6 used in scenario
    1 is used as input. In this case PLSR outperforms ANFIS with an average error
    of 257.0 min in comparison with 323.3 min for ANFIS. However, we noticed that,
    in this scenario, removing the VWC1 sensor results in a better performance for
    both methods as a universal estimator. This is explained because the VWC sensor
    is very dependent on the soil where it is installed and, as both algorithms were
    trained with a sensor installed in a different plantation than the one that is
    predicting, the provided information introduces noise and does not help the system
    to estimate properly the water need. This does not happen, however, with the SWP
    sensor, which quantifies the tendency of water to move from one area to another
    in the soil and it is less dependent on the soil installed. Removing the VWC sensor
    results in a better performance of the system obtaining an average weekly error
    of 194.4 min with PLSR and 197.4 min with ANFIS. This result proves that there
    is certain potential to develop a universal estimator using our system for a given
    crop, although this means an increase of the average error. This error could be
    reduced if more than 2 plantations of the same crop were available for training.
    Both PLSR and ANFIS performs similarly, being PLSR slightly better. 5. Conclusions
    This paper describes the design and development of an automatic decision support
    system to manage irrigation in agriculture. The main characteristic of system
    is the use of continuous soil measurements to complement climatic parameters to
    precisely predict the irrigation needs the crops, in contrast with previous works
    that are based only on weather variables or doesn’t specify the quantity of water
    required by the crops. The use of real-time information from the soil parameters
    in a closed loop control scheme allows adapting the decision support system to
    local perturbations, avoiding the accumulative effect due to errors in consecutive
    weekly estimation, and/or detecting if the irrigation calculated for the SIDSS
    has been performed by the farmer. The analysis of the performance of the system
    is accomplished comparing the decisions taken by a human expert and the decision
    support component. Two machine learning techniques, PLSR and ANFIS, have been
    proposed as the basis of our reasoning engine and analysed in order to obtain
    the best performance. The experiments have taken place in three commercial plantations
    of citrus trees located in the South-East of Spain. A first experimental scenario
    shows a comparison of the system’s performance using soil sensors in addition
    to the weather information for predicting year 2015 using 2014 information to
    train the system. The usage of soil sensor in the three plantations accomplished
    a 22% less of weekly error in comparison to the performance of using only weather
    information. A second scenario shows the potential of our system as universal
    estimator for a given crop, i.e. the use case of installing the system in a new
    plantation, not having previous information of it. For this application, VWC sensors
    should be removed due to their high dependence with the soil type. Although, as
    expected, the estimation error increases in this scenario, it does not require
    historical data from agronomical reports to be retrained, which implies a significant
    advantage, in particular for new plantations in early stages. If more training
    data from a bigger variety of field were available, a better performance in this
    scenario could be expected. Another possible improvement for this scenario will
    be the addition of a VWC to get a better performance than using only the matric
    potential sensors. However, in order to use the VWC sensor in this scenario, a
    precise study of the soil textures of the plantation will be required to extrapolate
    the VWC sensor information to similar soil textures where the DSS was trained.
    For future research, we aim to extend and evaluate the system in plantations different
    than citrus and analyse the performance under several conditions and regions.
    Thus, adding the weather forecast as input of the SIDSS could help to improve
    the next week irrigation schedule and consider the predicted rainfall in our estimation.
    Similarly, past rainfall information, that did not prove beneficial in our system
    due to the region of Murcia characteristics, may become a good factor to improve
    the accuracy of the system in regions with a more regular and predictable raining
    pattern. We also aim to capture a bigger dataset that will allow us to generate
    more general models towards a universal irrigation estimator of a given crop.
    This dataset will also explore the use of multiple sensors per plantation in order
    to address inhomogeneous ground conditions in the different plantation as well
    as provide more input information to the system for a better reasoning. Acknowledgements

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Vellore, India SECTION 1. Introduction At
    present, water use is growing at more than twice the rate of population increases.
    Due to the shortage of water resources, we need water saving irrigation technology
    for agriculture. Irrigation is a scientific process to supplying water to the
    agriculture land that is being cultivated. The dry regions having very little
    amount of water and that has to be utilized very efficiently. In conventional
    water irrigation system is wasting the water and drip irrigation systems use 20-30%
    less water than conventional watering methods. Therefore, the conventional method
    can be replaced by drip irrigation technology [1]. A new idea for saving each
    drops of water by the way to test the soil conditions before supplying water to
    the crop fields. This mechanism will reduce the workload of the cultivator and
    help maintain suitable soil conditions for the better crop production [2]. Hence
    the technology advancement is possible to design systems that eradicate the direct
    involvement of the cultivator with respect to irrigation of their fields. For
    the sustainable use of water resources, the rainwater is generally stored in a
    rainwater tank and it is used for irrigation or directed to recharge groundwater.
    Firstly the rainwater is used for agriculture in rainy seasons and the well or
    bore well water is used for other times. The crop growth rate (CGR) can also monitored
    using the IR transmitter and receiver system. The whole sensor network has analyzed
    by the microcontroller and sends the sensors information to irrigation control
    centre (ICC) through Zigbee technology. Zigbee technology has low cost, low power
    consumption and wireless communication which could replace the wired connections
    in the traditional system. In ICC, the entire drip irrigation is controlled by
    the electromagnetic actuators. The ICC has two technologies one is global system
    for mobile communication and secondary one is the ARM controller. This GSM facility
    serves as an important part for controlling the drip irrigation which sending
    the results to the cultivator using SMS to a mobile device [3], [4]. Then the
    user controls the entire agriculture irrigation system through SMS. The controller
    works as a central core for operation of the automated process which is initiated
    by the sensor networks. Based on the crop field conditions the ARM controller
    used in ICC is activates the drip irrigation system and their respective valves
    [2]. SECTION II. System Architecture In the automated system, the human factor
    is reduced by a microcontroller which is specially programmed to monitor any parameter
    changes in sensors. The function of microcontroller depends on the data of sensors
    from crop field units and the corrections are made by control devices in the irrigation
    system until the desired performance to be attained. This automatic system can
    also be stopped in case of rain, cyclone and crop cutting time, etc by the cultivator
    through SMS. Fig.1. Remote monitoring and closed loop irrigation system Show All
    The remote monitoring and closed loop irrigation system is shown in Fig. 1 which
    consisted of three components: a remote sensor node, a system control module called
    ICC, and a GSM mobile device. The amount of water required for a crop varies in
    various growth stages, different in soils and climate changes. The sensor node
    is placed in each crop field which is continuously collect soil parameters and
    crop growth. The sensor node consists of soil moisture sensor, humidity sensor,
    temperature sensor, IR transceiver, Zigbee transceiver and microcontroller. The
    value of air humidity is important for the correct growth of plants and high air
    temperature leads to affect the crop yields. High soil moisture will produce high
    evaporation and reduced the nutrient uptake. The soil parameters and crop growth
    status are collected by microcontroller and send these data to irrigation control
    centre through Zigbee wireless serial communication technology. In irrigation
    control centre (ICC), the soil parameters, crop growth status, cultivator''s control
    information from GSM are analyzed by the microcontroller. The ICC consists of
    motor driver unit, solenoid values with driver, LCD module, Zigbee transceiver,
    GSM module and microcontroller. The sensor measurements are transmitted to ICC
    by sensor node and are received through Zigbee transceiver. The electric solenoid
    irrigation valves should be installed at the closest point possible to outlet
    of pump set, that is, the location where you tap in for the irrigation system.
    ICC turns on the pump according to soil parameters. The valves are operated by
    12V driver circuit by the controller which integrates all the environmental information
    through suitable control algorithms. The gateway allows the activation of automated
    irrigation when the threshold values of soil moisture, air temperature and humidity
    are reached. The system provides the details about the agriculture farm to cultivator
    though SMS by GSM and the same information are display on LCD screen. The cultivator
    can also sends the control command to ICC through SMS, after processing displayed
    it on the LCD screen. SECTION III. System Components A. Software Portion The choice
    of a programming language for microcontrollers normally the C language, and most
    commercially available microcontrollers have C language compilers for the development
    of their programs. The closed loop irrigation system [5] is developed by the MPLAB
    compiler and KEIL μVISION4 Compiler. The MPLAB compiler consists of an integrated
    development environment for the windows operating system and supports the entire
    line of PIC microcontrollers [6]. The new KEIL μVISION4 by ARM IDE is to enhance
    developer''s productivity, user friendly, faster, flexible window management system,
    efficient program development and support for multiple monitors. PROTEUS allows
    designing for circuit simulation. It has a range of simulator models for popular
    micro-controllers and is possible to simulate complete micro-controller systems.
    The first task of the program is to transmit field parameters to ICC via Zigbee
    protocol. The PIC microcontroller in sensor node has pickup all the sensors information
    one by one and stored it in memory. This information is send to ICC through Zigbee
    wireless transmission. Second, the ARM microcontroller in ICC receives the data
    package transmitted by sensor node. These soil moisture, air humidity and temperature
    data are processed by the algorithm that compared with the threshold value that
    already stored in memory. Then it activates the irrigation pumps and respective
    solenoid values. Finally, these sensor node data and a crop growth status are
    transmitted at each predefined time to a user mobile device through SMS via the
    GSM in real time. Whenever the cultivator needs the information about the crop
    field, they can give the missed call to ICC''s GSM module [7]. The crop fields
    data are also send to LCD Screen. B. Hardware Portion Smart senor node is implements
    four types of measurements via sensors which are soil moisture, air humidity,
    air temperature and crop growth. The Soil Moisture Sensor is used to measure the
    volumetric water content of soil [8], [9], [10]. The SM150 measures volumetric
    soil moisture content with 3% accuracy. The output dc voltage range of the sensor
    is 0V to 1.5V. The temperature sensor AD594 is capable of measuring −55 to +125
    degrees centigrade. The AD594 has a positive and negative source input. In order
    to receive 0 to +125 degrees centigrade, the negative input pin has to be grounded.
    The AD594 gives a linear DC output voltage in the range of 0V to 1.25V. The soil
    humidity is measured according to the principle of electric resistance. The humidity
    sensor module SY-HS-220 converts the relative humidity to the output voltage.
    The storage humidity is within 95%RH and standard output is 1.9mV at 25 degree
    and 60%RH. The IR transmitter and receiver pair can be easily made using 555 Timer,
    IR LED and TSOP1738 IR Receiver. The four set of IR transmitter and receiver are
    used to measure the four stages of crop growth. The microcontroller used in sensor
    node system is PIC18F4550 which is 8-bit microcontroller from PIC18 family. It
    is based on 16-bit instruction set architecture and it consists of 32 KB flash
    memory, 2 KB SRAM and 256 Bytes EEPROM. It has five I/O ports (PORTA, PORTB, PORTC,
    PORTD and PORTE). PORTB and PORTD have 8 pins to transmit/receive 8-bit I/O data.
    It can work on different internal and external clock sources range of frequency
    from 31 KHZ to 48 MHZ. The PIC18F4550 has four timers units, ADC, with enhanced
    communication protocols like USART, SPI I2C and USB. The LPC2148 micro-controller
    is used in ICC which is 32/16 bit ARM7TDMI-S CPU core. They have real-time emulation
    and micro-controller with embedded high speed flash memory of 512 KB. It has USB
    2.0 full speed device, multiple UARTS, SPI, SSP to I 2 Cs . Various 32-bit timers,
    dual 10-bit ADC(s), single 10-bit DAC, PWM channels and 45 fast GPIO lines with
    up to nine edge or level sensitive external interrupt pins, tiny size and low
    power consumption make these microcontrollers particularly suitable for industrial
    control and medical systems. GSM module SIM900 engine works on frequencies EGSM
    900 MHZ, DCS 1800 MHZ and PCS 1900 MHZ. This GSM modem is coming with RS232 interface,
    which allows to directly connecting with microcontroller through only two wires
    (TX, RX). This modem can be used to sending SMS, data and read SMS through simple
    AT commands. CC2500 Zigbee RF Module is a transceiver module which provides easy
    to use RF communication at 2.4 GHZ. It can be used to transmit and receive data
    at 9600 baud rates from any standard CMOS/TTL source and works in half duplex
    mode [11]. Solenoid valve is an electromechanical valve. The valve can be controlled
    by an electric current through a solenoid operates at 12V/500mA, in the case of
    a two-port valve the flow is switched off or on. SECTION IV. Experimental Study
    The output of temperature sensor (AD594) is connected with the analog input of
    PIC microcontroller. The calculation of temperature in degree Celsius is expressed
    as, T( ∘ C)=(( ADC value ∗ 5V)/1023 ) ∗ 100 View Source . The predicting growth
    stage is based on the Development Index Model (DVI), which is used throughout
    field to estimate the growth stage by means of daily temperature (DT). DVI= ∑
    planting date est date 100 A (1− e −B( T i −C))) View Source Where Ti is the DT
    (°C) on the ith day after cropping, and A, B, C are determined by the plant variety
    and the region. The solution of equation represents the speed with the crop grows,
    determined by the DT. In day-by-day to calculate the DVI value which represents
    the growth stage. The DVI value is 0 at planting, and parameters A, B, C are determined
    in order to set DVI value =100 on the day of heading. The table I shows the air
    temperature, soil temperature, relative humidity and soil moisture from day-1
    to day-12 [12]. Fig. 2 shows the relationship between air and soil temperature
    from day-l to day-12. It is clear that the soil temperature varies higher than
    the air temperature [13]. Fig. 3 shows the relationship between relative humidity
    and soil moisture in (%). The upper and lower limits of water storage in the soil
    reservoir and relative humidity have been determined in the crop field. Fig. 2.

    water content goes below the level of 21%, the motor is tum-on and respective
    valve unit is energized. The level of soil water content goes above 30%, the motor
    will be turned off and respective valve unit is de-energized. SECTION V. Conclusion
    The remote monitoring and closed loop irrigation system has been developed and
    successfully implemented in the agriculture farm. The real time information is
    gathering from senor node about the crop field which is transmitted wirelessly
    through Zigbee. The sensor values are passed into the controller and it controls
    the water resources utilization effectively. The GSM interface is helpful for
    the cultivator to receive notifications of the events occurring in the field and
    growth rate of crop. The current values of all parameters are also updated on
    LCD display. Using this system, one can save manpower, water and power consumption
    is reduced by 20% and 30% when compared to existing method. In future, other important
    soil parameters namely soil pH , soil electrical conductivity will also be incorporated
    in the system. The system will investigate leakage in pipe network, filters blockage
    in head control, and distribution of fertilizer in time. The project will allow
    for improving the efficiency of the irrigation process. ACKNOWLEDGMENT I would

  description: In the past few decades, Coal-Bed Methane (CBM) has become an important
    source of energy especially in North America. The methane adsorbed within the
    coal is in a near-liquid state. The open fractures in the cleats are commonly
    saturated with water. To develop CBM reservoir, water in the fracture and coal
    seam must be continuously pumped off from coal seam to reduce pressure and desorb
    gas from matrix.Although operators desire to produce hydrocarbon quickly, a too
    fast dewatering rate can irreversibly damage matrix desorption process, which
    can lead to an unfavorable ultimate recovery. Further, the aggressive production
    rate can potentially release the coal fines and drive them into pump, which increases
    maintenance effort and cost. Even worse, the de-watering process fluctuates because
    of the rock porosity and permeability changes resulting from the brittle coal
    seam and pressure reduction. Therefore, it is critical to adjust the pump operating
    parameters in a timely manner to maintain a continuous/intermittent production.Ten
    CBM wells are located in a remote area, which makes the access to wellsites difficult.
    Previously engineers had to evaluate well performance and optimize the pump on-site,
    which is limited by a monthly basis. We firstly developed an automatic data processing
    system using the advanced Echosounders, which can measure the water level in real
    time. The reservoir pressure can be then monitored dynamically through interpreting
    the detected water level. With an automatic-wireless data transferring system
    installed on-site and a closed-loop control program to receive, process, and interpret
    data, the pump operating parameters can be changed in real time through remote
    control. This system not only identifies the downhole problems in real time, but
    also reduces the pump maintenance frequency from 40 days to 75 days statistically
    and numbers of trip to well site. Further, the gas production rate has been averagely
    improved by 30% for the 10 wells.The authors firstly developed an automation data
    processing and control system in the favor of advanced echosounders. Based on
    the interpreted reservoir pressure, we can avoid aggressive production by adjusting
    the pump operating parameters in real time, which eventually results in a better
    ultimate recovery. The developed workflow (automatic echosounder data acquisition,
    real filed data transferred to central office, data processing, interpretation,
    and simulation in computational system, adjustment commands to operating system)
    is especially valuable for the locations difficult to access.

    1. Introduction CBM has become an important sector in unconventional oil and gas
    development and production to fill the gap between the ever increasing demand
    for clean energy and the decreasing conventional oil and gas production. CBM reservoirs
    differ from conventional gas reservoir in points of gas compositions, gas storage,
    and flow mechanism. Coal bed is source rock as well as reservoir. CBM is mainly
    methane and contains trace quantities of intermediate and heavy hydrocarbons.
    CBM may contain nonhydrocarbon such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen,
    and helium. Gas in coal consists of free gas in macropores and adsorption gas
    in micropores. Adsorption is the primary storage mechanism where the gas is adsorbed
    on the surface of the coal. The hydrocarbon may exist as a layer of molecules
    in a condensed state. As such, desorption is a necessary step in CBM production.
    Desorption is implemented through dewatering to allow reservoir pressure drop
    below critical desorption pressure. The liberated gas then diffuses through coal
    matrix (or micropores) into cleats and fractures, which follows Fick''s law of
    diffusion, and finally along cleats and fractures (or macropores) to wellbore
    (Fig. 1), which is dictated by Darcy''s law. Download : Download high-res image

    cleats, CBM desorption from coal surface, diffusion through matrix, and flow in
    fractures (Al-Jubori et al., 2009). Fick''s law of diffusion is given in Eq. (1).
    (1) where qgm = gas production rate from the coal matrix, SCF/day D = diffusion
    coefficient, ft2/day Vm = matrix volume, ft3 sf = fracture spacing, ft Cm = matrix
    gas concentration, SCF/ft3 C(p) = equilibrium concentration at matrix-cleat boundary,
    SCF/ft3 Darcy''s law relates gas velocity and the gradient of pressure as, (2)
    where kg = effective permeability to gas μg = gas viscosity The gas desorption
    mechanism is delineated by the Langmuir adsorption equation, which describes a
    relationship between gas storage capacity and pressure (Pan and Connell, 2009).
    (3) where Gs = gas storage capacity, SCF/ton P = pressure, psia VL = Langmuir
    volume constant, SCF/ton PL = Langmuir pressure constant, psia Adjusting for ash
    and moisture contents of the coal, Eq. (3) is modified to (4) where fa = ash content,
    fraction fm = moisture content, fraction3 1.1. Dewatering and gas desorption As
    indicated by Langmuir isotherm (Fig. 2), gas storage capacity increases as pressure
    increases. Factors determining gas adsorption capacity include in-situ pressure
    and temperature, coal rank, ash and moisture contents, and the concentration of
    other adsorbate, such as carbon dioxide or heavier components. The adsorption
    and desorption in coal is reversible. During dewatering process, water is pumped
    out of the coal bed and reservoir pressure is lowered so that gas is desorbed
    from coal surface. If the measured gas content is higher than the theoretical
    maximum absorption gas content, it is a saturated CBM reservoir and contains both
    adsorption and free gas; otherwise, it is an undersaturated CBM reservoir and
    contains adsorption gas only. For undersaturated CBM reservoir, dewatering process
    needs to be continued until a critical pressure is reached to liberate the desorbed
    gas in the coal surface. The critical desorption pressure is the reservoir pressure
    at which gas starts to desorb from coal surface. The abandonment condition is
    the minimum reservoir pressure that can be reached through dewatering. To estimate
    the desorbed gas volume, the Langmuir volumes at initial reservoir pressure and
    at current pressure need to be measured (Clarkson and Bustin, 2010). Download

    A typical Langmuir sorption isotherm for CBM. 1.2. Dewatering methods used in
    CBM wells The allowable maximum dewatering rate should be optimized to (1) not
    only lower the reservoir pressure, (2) but also reduce water saturation and (3)
    increase gas relative permeability, (4) consequently improve the flow capacity
    of the desorbed gas through micropores and macropores to wellbore and (5) gas
    flow rate. The dewatering using various artificial lift methods such as sucker
    rod pump, electrical submersible pump, progressing cavity pump, jet pump, hydraulic
    piston pump, and gas lift. Optimization of tubing and casing sizes is crucial
    to minimize the energy consumption required for artificial lift (Oyewole and Lea,
    2008). Liquid level in annulus is one of the most important factors to determine
    pump operating parameters. Continuous liquid level surveillance (Lieberman, 2005)
    provides an approach to monitor the change of liquid level resulting from the
    imbalance between reservoir feed-in and pump throughput. It allows engineers to
    adjust the pump operating parameters before liquid level drops below pump setting
    depth. This is important to avoid burning out the pump and improve pump efficiency.
    2. Challenges 2.1. Significant variations in gas and water rates in different
    production stages The typical production profile of a CBM well comprises of three
    steps (Schraufnagel, 1993): gas desorption from coal surface, diffusion through
    micropores, and flow through cleats and/or fracture to wellbore. Correspondingly,
    the CBM well production life can be divided into three stages as shown in Fig.
    3. (1) Early stage: wells mainly produce water with small amount of free gas and
    solution gas from water, and then the reservoir pressure declines to the critical
    desorption pressure. Gas desorbs and diffuses through micropores. This situation
    is characterized by the increase of gas flowrate and decrease of water rate. (2)
    Middle stage: as cumulative water production increases and reservoir pressure
    depletes, the producing fluid is primarily gas and reaches a peak value while
    water production is at a low flow rate or even ceases. (3) Late stage: gas rate
    declines. This unique production characteristic makes CBM development different
    from conventional gas reservoirs. The dewatering design should be tailored to
    accommodate those needs at different production stages. Download : Download high-res

    hypothetical gas and water production profiles for coalbed methane wells (Schraufnagel,
    1993). 2.2. Gas and water rates controlled by different geological settings Geological
    setting is one of the most important factors that determine the production trends
    of CBM wells. When the thickness of coal bed is thin to moderate and the depth
    varies substantially, the hydrodynamic impact on the gas and water production
    is significant (Fig. 4). In general, wells at the updip location have lower water
    production rate and water encroachments are less severe. These lead to shorter
    dewatering process and higher gas production rate for updip wells. The placement
    of well at updip of structure also results in the decrease of water rate and increase
    in gas rate when production moves from early to middle or late stage. On the other
    hand, wells located downdip suffer severe water influx. It is difficult to draw
    down the reservoir pressure to desorb CBM even with aggressive dewatering rate.
    Therefore, the downdip wells have the characteristics of high water rate and low
    gas rate comparing with updip wells. The dewatering process is also longer than
    those of updip wells. Consequently, the updip and downdip wells have distinct
    performance characterizations at different production stages. Download : Download

    categories according to production type curves, which are “moderate/high rate–low
    rate”, illustrated in Fig. 5, “moderate/high rate–high rate”, shown in Fig. 6,
    and “moderate/high rate–low rate–high rate”, revealed in Fig. 7. 1) Wells with

    “moderate/high rate – low rate – high rate”. As shown in Fig. 5, high gas rate,
    which can be up to 2000 m3/d, at the early stage are achieved in this type of
    well. Then gas rate declines dramatically and drops below 1000 m3/d. The water
    rate follows the trend of gas rate. The height of liquid column maintains at 300
    m constantly. In the early stage, water rate varies between 7.5 m3/d and 20 m3/d
    with an average of 12.5 m3/d. This period lasts about 90 days. At the middle stage,
    water rate drops to 50% of the early stage. This production feature lasts 100
    days. Then the production goes to the late stage where water rate declines further
    but at a very small decline rate. Water rate at the abandonment condition is 24%
    of that at the beginning of the late stage. The average water rate is 1.7 m3/d
    during this 300-day period. The high water rate is mainly attributed to the strong
    supports of active aquifers that have good connection to surface water. 2) Wells
    with “moderate/high rate – high rate” production type curve The production profile
    is featured by the moderate–high gas rate and moderate water rate in the early
    stage, whose duration is 50 days, and high gas rate with trace water production
    in the middle and late stages. Fig. 6 reveals that at early stage gas rates are
    moderate–high, which are around 2000 m3/d, and water rate ranges from 0.85 m3/d
    to 5 m3/d with an average of 2 m3/d. Then at middle stage gas rate increases to
    3600 m3/d and maintains at this level throughout the late stage with trace water
    production. The high gas rate plateau lasts more than 350 days. The height of
    liquid column fluctuates between 200 m and 300 m. The high gas rate is the contribution
    of systematic coal fractures developed from the activities of one principal fault,
    whose strike is parallel to the fluvial channel, in the studied field. Wells with
    this production type curve were placed along the fluvial channel. 3) Wells with
    “moderate/high rate – low rate – high rate” production type curve The typical
    “moderate–low–high” production profile of this type of well is shown in Fig. 7.
    At early stage gas rate is moderate varying from 500 m3/d to 2500 m3/d. Water
    rate changes between 4 m3/d and 12.5 m3/d with an average of 7 m3/d, which is
    higher than those of middle and late stages. Both gas and water rates decline
    at the middle stage. Water rate drops to 3–6 m3/d with a mean of 4 m3/d. The duration
    of middle stage can vary from 85 to 398 days. At late stage gas rate increases
    exponentially as water rate declines to 0–0.8 m3/d with an average of 0.4 m3/d.
    The fluctuation of liquid level in these wells is notable. Again, the production
    profile is the reflection of geological setting where these wells were placed.
    They are drilled at or close to the axis of the syncline. These placements facilitate
    the de-watering process and expedite the drainage of water to lower reservoir
    pressure, thus leading to the high water rate and low gas rate at early to middle
    stage while high gas rate and low water rate at late stage. Therefore, it is necessary
    to adjust the operating parameters for different CBM wells at different production
    stages. 2.3. Significant fluctuation in flowing bottomhole pressure Pioneer Natural
    Resources had conducted pilot tests of continuous bottomhole pressure monitoring
    in 5 CBM wells in Raton Basin (Rotramel and Bell, 2011). The tests indicate that
    according to the fluctuation of reservoir pressure, gas desorption, gas-water
    two-phase flow, the change in the bottomhole pressure can be up to 2.5 MPa under
    constant rate production conditions (Fig. 8). Download : Download high-res image
    (404KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Production rate and bottomhole
    pressure of Aston 33-13 in Raton Basin (Rotramel and Bell, 2011). The evolution
    of stresses in coal bed starts from drilling the well and last throughout the
    well life. The dewatering lowers the liquid level in the wellbore and reduces
    bottomhole pressure. This generates a pressure disturbance and propagation into
    the coal bed through the fluids in the macropores and micropores. As a result,
    pore pressure declines correspondingly. Because the overburden stress remains
    constant, the pressure difference increases as more reservoir fluids are drained.
    This means the effective stress on the coal bed increases. The micropores and
    macropores, no matter primary or secondary, or natural or artificial, become smaller.
    The cleat and fracture widths become narrower, thus leading to permeability deterioration
    and choking the gas flow in cleat and fracture. More importantly, the coal bed
    may collapse and/or generate tremendous coal fines if the net stress exceeds the
    coal bed strength. The collapse of coal bed or migration of large volume of coal
    fines may cause the shut-in of the well, or even worse, the loss of well due to
    coal bed cave-in (Palmer et al., 2005). Once the pressure drawdown exceeds the
    critical or threshold value, coalbed collapses and generates fines. However, even
    the reservoir pressure is sustained, aggressive de-watering rate can still damage
    the formation due to the high brittleness (Fig. 9). The excessive drop in pore
    pressure in a short period will result in increasing coal friability. This causes
    a significant destruction of coal bed and generates a large volume of coal fines
    when the coal formation enters the elastic stage. The migrations of coal fines
    will plug the micropores and macropores, through which fluids flow to wellbore.
    On the other hand, if the dewatering and gas withdrawal rates are appropriate,
    the coal formation transform to the elastic status gradually and the cleats and
    fractures expand and propagate, hence the permeability is improved. Download :

    Well location CBM wells are located in the remote area with difficult access,
    which limit the numbers of trips required to adjust operating parameters continuously.
    Fig. 10a shows the wellpad of 4 CBM wells; meanwhile Fig. 10b is the Digital Elevation
    Map (DEM) of the Qinshui Basin. Most CBM wells in the Qinshui Basin are located
    uphill. It is extremely difficult to access during the rain and snow seasons through
    the unpaved roads. Therefore, it is not uncommon that the field engineers have
    to delay the trip of even few months. During this period, the downhole conditions
    can change materially. Coal fines may settle and plug the hole, and consequently
    cause equipment failure. Coal formation can collapse and gas production ceases.
    In some extreme cases, the wells have to be abandoned completely. Download : Download

    system Currently, a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system (Fig.
    11) has been applied to real-time monitor liquid level for CBM wells in the Qinshui
    Basin in China. Through the SCADA system, the automatic data acquisition and supervisory
    control have been practiced for 10 CBM wells. The acquired data include the operating
    time, tubing pressure, casing pressure, dynamic liquid level, transient gas and
    water rates, current in transformer, frequency in transformer, and pump speed.
    Through the SCADA system, the data is processed and interpreted in central office,
    and consequently it sends pump adjustment or operating calibration commands to
    field. In favor of this workflow, either a constant liquid level or a constant
    decline rate of liquid level can be achieved. Therefore, we can successfully sustain
    the peak production rate. Download : Download high-res image (289KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Schematic diagram of SCADA system applied
    in CBM wells production in Qinshui Basin. Either constant liquid level or constant
    decline liquid level production strategy requires an accurate liquid level measurement
    in a timely manner. The data acquisition interval should be short enough to monitor
    the change of liquid level and adjust the operating parameters in time to avoid
    dramatic change of liquid level. This is especially important for early stage
    when dewatering or reservoir pressure approaches critical desorption pressure,
    which causes considerable fluctuations of gas and water rates, hence induces liquid
    level variation. Therefore, automatically continuous liquid level monitoring is
    critical to the smart CBM production. Most CBM wells have been drilled to 350
    m–1500 m. The key factor to sustain peak production rate is to control the liquid
    level. Unfortunately, the conventional echosounders cannot detect it once the
    liquid column is less than 30 m above the bottomhole pump. This is a big challenge
    for automation approach, which is indeed unfavorable to the ultimate recovery.
    The innovative automatic echosounder system has been developed, and installed
    at the wellhead (Fig. 12). Acoustic emission utilizes the expansion of gas in
    annulus. The transmitter is switched on and off through the electromagnetic valve
    in the main unit. After emission, the receiver takes the echo or reflection signal
    from tubing collar and liquid level, and converts the acoustic wave to electrical
    signal. The electrical signal is filtered and processed by CPU. The data obtained
    is used to calculate liquid level. This automatic echosounder system can acquire
    acoustic signal under intense gas interference. It has the capacity of filtering
    high noise-to-signal data and identifying reflection wave from liquid level, which
    allows the detection of short liquid column and make accurate measurement of the
    liquid level. Download : Download high-res image (109KB) Download : Download full-size

    workflow chart of automatic echosounder is shown above (Fig. 13). The automatic
    echosounder has the following characteristics: 1) It can monitor the liquid level
    in real time, and the surveillance covers the whole production life. 2) Acoustic
    emission utilizes the pressurized gas in annulus, which make the continuous emission
    safe. 3) Because diaphragm piezo microphone in the automatic echosounder is made
    of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in lieu of piezoceramic material, the sensitivity
    has been improved significantly. 4) When processing raw data, spectral decomposition-based
    digital filtering technique, and acoustic wave frequency spectrum of casing gas
    are combined. The automatic tracking algorithm is applied to increase the repeatability
    of multiple measurements as well as the accuracy of liquid level detection. Download

    3.2. Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller A feedback controller employs
    a formal control mechanism that aims to bring an operating condition to a target
    value by modifying the settings of the process (control variable, u) on the basis
    of the discrepancy (error, e) between the observed process output, y, and the
    desired target value (the set-point, r) (Åström and Hägglund, 1995). The error
    is simply the difference between the process output and the target value: (5)
    To maintain the desired operating conditions, this type of feedback controller
    is frequently used in production and refining processes in the petroleum industry
    (Wang et al., 2000, Havre and Dalsmo, 2001, van Dijk et al., 2008, Bieker et al.,
    2007, Sengul and Bekkousha, 2002, Stenhouse, 2006, Oberwinkler and Stundner, 2005,
    Saputelli et al., 2005, Nikolaou et al., 2006; Guyaguler et al., 2009). The control
    systems implemented in facilities and refineries have sensors and mechanical equipment
    to observe and physically modify the process settings. PID controllers have the
    following form in the continuous time domain (Åström and Hägglund, 1995): (6)
    Where t = time u(t) = controller output (process input) at time t e(t) = observed
    error at time t Kp = proportional gain constant TI = integral time constant TD
    = derivative time constant Ki = integral gain constant Kd = derivative gain constant
    The above figure (Fig. 14) shows a workflow diagram of PID controller. The determinations
    of gain value, sampling interval, and integral time interval are based on the
    depth of the liquid level. In this case, the time derivative interval is set to
    zero. The larger the liquid level drop, the larger the gain and the longer the
    sampling interval are set. Then the rotation speed of the motor is calculated.
    The procedure is applied to control the data acquisition for three production
    stages. Gain value, sampling interval, and integral time vary in different production
    stages. The setting of operating parameters based on the tests at wellsite. The
    time interval between the pump speed adjustments should be long enough to allow
    pressure to builds up in bottomhole. Download : Download high-res image (232KB)

    4. Application As aforementioned discussion, each of the three production stages
    (early, middle, and late) has its own unique characteristics. Because more production
    variations take place in the early stage, it is further divided into three subcategories:
    (1) dewatering before gas desorption, (2) desorbed gas flowing to bottomhole and
    filling up the casing, and (3) initial gas production. Therefore, totally 5 stages
    should be considered when planning production control strategy. The critical controlling
    factors at different stages vary throughout well life: 1) Dewatering before gas
    desorption: Liquid level is the main production parameter to be controlled. Coal
    fine concentration is the constrained factor. The control of liquid level is accomplished
    through “self-tuning regulators” (Åström & Wittenmark, 2013), which controls dewatering
    rate to have the liquid level drop smoothly and avoids excessive coal fines migrate
    to downhole. 2) Desorbed gas flowing to bottomhole and filling up the casing:
    Gas production valve is still closed at this stage. Bottomhole pressure is the
    sum of casing pressure and static pressure from fluid column. Bottomhole pressure
    is the main parameter to be controlled and the incremental of casing pressure
    is the constrained factor to avoid high bottomhole flowing pressure fluctuation.
    3) Initial gas production: Once the casing pressure reaches threshold value, gas
    production valve opens. At this stage, bottomhole flowing pressure is the main
    parameter to be controlled and gas production rate is the constrained factor.
    The bottomhole pressure should be reduced smoothly to increase production rate.
    4) Middle stage: Liquid level is the main parameter to be controlled and casing
    pressure is the constrained factor. During this stage liquid level should be maintained
    constant to avoid bottomhole flowing pressure fluctuation. 5) Late stage: Water
    production rate approaches zero and the gas production rate is low at this stage.
    The main parameter to be controlled is gas rate. Bottomehole flowing pressure
    and casing pressure are the constrained factors. The stable gas production rate
    constant is achieved while maintaining constant bottomhole flowing pressure and
    casing pressure. During the CBM production, coal fines migration to bottomhole
    and bottomhole pressure fluctuation are the main concerns and need to be monitored
    closely. Following indexes used to alarm potential production problem are concluded
    from the production experience: Coal fine concentration A Coal fines concentration
    <1%, it is acceptable and production can be continued normally. B Coal fines concentration
    ranges between 1% and 3%, it is possible to cause pump stuck. C Coal fines concentration
    >3%, it is highly possible that the pump will be stuck. Bottomhole pressure fluctuation
    A Bottomhole pressure fluctuation <0.05 MPa/Day, formation damage is slight. B
    Bottomhole pressure fluctuation is between 0.05 and 0.1 MPa/Day, formation damage
    is moderate. C Bottomhole pressure fluctuation >0.1 MPa/Day, formation damage
    is severe. These indexes and their threshold values have been incorporated into
    the SCADA system. When one or more indexes exceed the threshold values, the system
    will alarm accordingly and send out command to adjust the operating parameters
    such as pumping speed to ensure the indexes are in the normal range. This automatic
    control and adjustment not only extend the production plateau but also reduce
    the frequency to check/maintain pump at wellsite. Consequently, the operating
    cost is cut significantly. The system had been applied for 10 CBM wells in field.
    The average gas rate had been increased by 30% and the pump-check interval had
    been extended to 75 days. Fig. 15 depicts the change of bottomhole flowing pressure
    in one representative well after switching to PID controller to adjust pump speed.
    The switch occurred at time of 3 h. We observe that after several pump speed adjustments,
    the decline rate of bottomhole flowing pressure stays constant. Fig. 16 is the
    plot of water rate and bottomhole flowing pressure vs. producing time. It is clear
    that a stable decline rate of bottomhole pressure can be gained by manipulating
    dewatering rate or pumping speed. Fig. 17 shows the production enhancement after
    applying this method for 10 wells. Download : Download high-res image (190KB)

    fluctuation, especially in the early stage (near critical desorption pressure).
    The conventional method that uses constant dewatering rate can cause severe coalbed
    formation damage and consequently reduces permeability. The operating pump parameters
    should be adjusted in real-time to expand peak production time period. This work
    has presented. • a new automatic echosounder design to detect liquid level in
    real time; • a SCADA automation process to remotely manage the wells in field
    and adjust PID controller parameters to adapt to various conditions for different
    CBM wells in field; • successful field applications based on this intelligent
    dewatering process, which has improved the ultimate recovery and avoid the formation
    damage due to the inappropriate high dewatering rate. Acknowledgement This work

    Water, one of the most valuable resources, is underutilized in irrigated rice
    production. The yield of rice, a staple food across the world, is highly dependent
    on having proper irrigation systems. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) is an
    effective irrigation method mainly used for irrigated rice production. However,
    unattended, manual, small-scale, and discrete implementations cannot achieve the
    maximum benefit of AWD. Automation of large-scale (over 1000 acres) implementation
    of AWD can be carried out using wide-area wireless sensor network (WSN). An automated
    AWD system requires three different WSNs: one for water level and environmental
    monitoring, one for monitoring of the irrigation system, and another for controlling
    the irrigation system. Integration of these three different WSNs requires proper
    dimensioning of the AWD edge elements (sensor and actuator nodes) to reduce the
    deployment cost and make it scalable. Besides field-level monitoring, the integration
    of external control parameters, such as real-time weather forecasts, plant physiological

    WSN; smart irrigation 1. Introduction Rice (Oryza sativa) is the second highest
    ranked food staple in the world, feeding one third (2.6 billion) of the population
    (7.8 billion). About 90% [1] of the world’s rice is produced in Asia, and it is
    the fastest growing staple food in Africa and Latin America [2] due to its ease
    of preparation compared to that of corn and wheat. It provides 21% of global human
    energy per capita and is the largest single source of energy [3]. A total of 75%
    of world rice is produced in 92 million hectares of irrigated lowland, and Asia
    occupies 56% of this land [4]. Irrigated rice uses up to 43% of the world’s irrigated
    water, which is two to three times more than other irrigated crops, and thus places
    an excessive demand on water usage compared to other staple crops. Bangladesh,
    an Asian country with a growing population and an increasing demand for rice,
    is playing an important role in rice research. According to the Bangladesh Rice
    Research Institute (BRRI), the main source of irrigation for rice is from ground
    water. However, the ground water is retrieved using shallow tube wells (STW) and
    deep tube wells (DTW), which is resulting in deteriorating ground water levels
    [5]. The production of 1 kg of rice requires 3000–5000 L of water [6], and Boro
    rice, which is generally grown in dry months, predominantly relies upon the groundwater.
    In order to address this situation, the International Rice Research Institute
    (IRRI) developed an irrigation method called alternate wetting and drying (AWD)
    that requires 30% less water than the traditional irrigation method used during
    the growing phase [7]. Studies presented in [8] have shown that, compared to the
    traditional method, AWD requires five fewer irrigation cycles and fewer pumps
    which saves about 40% of fuel. Besides minimizing the use of groundwater, AWD
    reduces irrigation cycles without affecting the yield [9]. Due to intermittent
    flooding in AWD, emission of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) is reduced by 73%
    in the dry season and by 21% in the wet season [10], compared to the continuous
    flooding method. This also decreases arsenic concentration in the shoots of rice
    plants [11]. Unlike other countries adopting AWD, where water is charged based
    on volumetric usage, most of Bangladesh’s irrigation water is charged per hectare,
    without any incentives for the farmers to reduce their water usage. Sharing a
    single pump amongst the farmers often gives rise to conflicts that usually deter
    any collaborative effort [11], which is a key point of AWD. The lack of proper
    knowledge and information sharing are also limiting the adoption of the AWD method.
    Research has shown that there is a significant opportunity for AWD in Southeast
    Asian countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam [12]; however, due to social, economic,
    and technical challenges, the AWD method is not well perceived in these regions
    [13]. Besides the challenges of AWD described above, applying AWD to a wide area
    poses additional challenges, such as monitoring and controlling the complex mechanism,
    before it can become economically feasible. To achieve this, an automated IoT-connected
    wireless sensor network (WSN) is required. WSN is a network of sensors that accumulates
    monitoring data in centrally located storage, such as cloud storage. Most WSNs
    require three different types of network elements including the sensor node (SN),
    the cluster head (CH) and the data sink (DS), also called a base station, as shown
    in Figure 1a. All of the SNs are distributed into multiple, unequal clusters headed
    by a CH that sends sensor data to the DS. Functionally, the clustering process
    and data transfer protocol may vary depending on the nature of the application
    and the distribution of the SNs. Recent applications also require these WSNs to
    be connected with other networks through gateways and to the internet infrastructure
    [14], as shown in Figure 1a. Figure 1. (a) Network elements and functional layers
    of the IoT-connected wireless sensor network (WSN), and (b) Automated AWD-specific
    WSN with IoT connectivity. IoT is the network of various smart devices to facilitate
    information flow to the end-user through the existing internet. The exponential
    growth and distribution of IoT devices are giving rise to numerous innovative
    and real-life applications. COVID-SAFE [15] monitors and predicts the infection
    by monitoring social distancing with the help of wearable IoT devices. Various
    wearable IoT devices are used for human emotion recognition [16] to facilitate
    online communication. The growth of the IoT applications, such as smart health
    using wearable IoT devices and smart cities, results in security threats to the
    network itself. The authors [17] proposed an IoT Botnet Detection using salp swarm
    algorithm (SSA) and ant lion optimization (ALO) models to minimize security threats.
    Authors of [18] proposed an enhanced information-centric networking (ICN) for
    IoT using artificial intelligence (AI) and edge computing in the internet cloud.
    Studies are conducted on the design and fabrication technologies to utilize smart
    IoT devices [19]. The researchers focus on IoT nodes’ accurate and fast localization
    [20]. IoT connected to WSN has been implemented on a limited scale in agriculture
    as reported in [21,22,23,24]. Most WSN- and IoT-based irrigation automation systems
    utilize soil moisture content and other environmental variables to schedule irrigation
    without considering plant growth; however, this is insufficient for automating
    the AWD method and gaining the farmers’ trust. Besides monitoring and controlling
    the pumps, an effective water distribution system through pipes is also required,
    giving rise to the added complexity of having to both monitoring and controlling
    the distribution system. Moreover, present WSN technologies are optimized for
    applications with densely populated SN and small area coverage. Wide-area monitoring
    requires long-range and low-power wireless connectivity [25]. Therefore, wide-area
    AWD automation involves three different WSNs, dedicated for (1) field water-level
    and environmental monitoring; (2) irrigation system monitoring; and (3) irrigation
    system controlling, as shown in Figure 1b. Therefore, densely populated and widely
    distributed sensor and actuator nodes are required for these three different WSNs.
    These three WSNs will be interconnected virtually. Traditional WSN virtualization
    involves multilayer connectivity and control, which increases inter-layer WSN
    traffic [26] for the AWD application. Besides wide-area coverage, automated AWD
    also requires external parameters, such as real-time weather forecast data, plant
    physiological data, and the farmers’ input. These data can be used by connecting
    the WSNs with different servers throughout the IoT network, as shown in Figure
    1b. Literature shows that large-scale irrigation is required to limit water usage
    to provide more water for the growing industrial sectors and increasing urban
    population [27,28]. Large-scale multiple cropping can further limit water usage
    [29] using the automated irrigation framework proposed in this article. Despite
    the inherent advantages of the AWD, both small- and large-scale implementations
    are yet to achieve the expected success for lack of proper adaptation of technologies,
    namely IoT and WSN [30]. Moreover, the large-scale implementation of an irrigation
    system, such as AWD, involves multiple stakeholders and different technologies.
    That may require an effective dimensioning tool for a practical convergent solution.
    The research presented in this article has focused on automation through proper
    technology adoption by providing a mathematical model and addressing all the required
    systems. The proposed mathematical model considers the irrigation system as a
    distributed system. It separates its components into pipe networks, localized
    water control, and clustered pumps with centralized control, thus making the automation
    platform applicable to AWD and non-AWD irrigation systems. The pipe network will
    facilitate both micro- and macro-level irrigation control in a scalable manner.
    The distributed health monitoring of the pipe network and the clustered pumps
    will make the system more fault-tolerant. Various field-level sensors in an IoT-connected
    WSN will help build a long-term database enabling scientific research to study
    the impact of climate change on crop yield [31], physiological changes, greenhouse
    gas emissions for different crops, and the application of various irrigation models.
    The major contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows. (1) Develop
    a dimensioning model for large-scale implementation of AWD using pipes, actuator-based
    water distribution, and clustered pumps. (2) Design WSN architecture combining
    three different functionalities with IoT-based automation for scalability and
    effective control and operation of the overall system. (3) Develop a low-power
    and long-range (LoRa) sensor node and data sink using LoRa, 3G, and WiFi interfaces
    for field monitoring using an IoT network. (4) Sample automation algorithms for
    the closed-loop AWD control using various internal and external parameters that
    can be used in both the WSNs and the IoT connected network. (5) Provision for
    scientific research through the database of long-term sensor data and applying
    Machine Learning (ML) for future wide-area implementation. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews existing literature related to the
    automation of AWD. Section 3 discusses the problem formulation for the automation
    of large scale AWD while Section 4 provides the proposed solution. Section 5 describes
    the system design and integration of WSN with AWD. Section 6 provides a description
    of the related field trial and Section 7 describes the performance of the system.
    Section 8 concludes the paper outlining future plans and work needed on this topic.
    2. Related Work Irrigation automation is not a very recent phenomenon and, as
    a result, is usually performed by adopting existing mathematical models and optimization
    algorithms. These primarily control the irrigation pumps to maximize water utilization.
    Baki et al. [32] have proposed a numerical scheme that utilizes weather forecasts
    and the water flow in soils to determine the optimal irrigation depth on scheduled
    irrigation days for the highest irrigation efficiency and optimum crop yield.
    Shahdany et al. [33] developed a mathematical model to automate canal irrigation
    using both known and unknown water demands for different irrigation systems. Besides
    the model-based optimization approaches, machine learning is also used by [34]
    to predict crop irrigation requirements based on soil parameters. Linker et al.
    [35] proposed a real-time and sub-optimal irrigation scheduling system that utilizes
    weather data alongside the crop’s physiological state and soil water availability.
    However, users need to decide between yield and irrigation performance depending
    on their applications. To achieve better optimization, Munir et al. [36] included
    parameters such as the plant type, watering time, air humidity, light intensity,
    and soil type for their fuzzy logic-based irrigation scheduling system that uses
    low power sensor-nodes. In [37], the authors designed an irrigation controller
    prototype based on the fuzzy rule to inspect water wastage by providing an optimal
    irrigation environment for farming. An artificial neural network (ANN) is used
    by [38] to predict soil moisture changes and to schedule irrigation based on climatic
    information and rooting depth. This ANN method was compared with the established
    water stress (WS) method, which well predicted the soil moisture during the main
    growing season, but was error prone at lower soil moisture levels. ANN and non-linear
    regression (NLR) were used by [39] to find the distances between the emitters
    in order to achieve optimum drip irrigation in the wet areas. Human expertise
    is also used by [40] for their proposed online decision support system (DSS),
    which consists of a meteorological model for weather forecasts, and a computational
    model for soil water balance and irrigation scheduling. It generates an irrigation
    schedule for a week in advance based on the DSS data repository. Irrigation automation
    is further upgraded by utilizing various sensors, wireless links, and internet
    infrastructure due to the increasing availability and decreasing cost of these
    technologies. Water level-based scheduling was proposed by [41] and uses a low-cost
    water level sensor along with inputs from the local farmers through the IoT. In
    [42], the authors present a framework using an IoT-based water distribution and
    management system that utilizes water flow meters, ultrasonic sensors and motors.
    The over-usage of freshwater for flood irrigation is addressed by [43]. The author
    proposed an IoT-based intelligent decision support system to improve the farmer’s
    water utilization by using weather data and sensor data. A complete irrigation
    supervisory control and data acquisition ( SCADA) with WSN was implemented by
    [44] to compare seven different irrigation scheduling algorithms and found that
    soil-based approaches were not adequate in providing sufficient water for the
    plants. Recently, more irrigation research on automated AWD systems is being reported
    in the academic literature. Localized pump automation is achieved by sensing the
    water level lacking remote monitoring or IoT connectivity and using solar panels
    as the power source [45]. An IoT-based system integrates laser sensors for precise
    water level measurement for automation of the AWD technique [46]. The proposed
    system was implemented for different sizes of fields, from 0.7 acres to 55.8 acres.
    Besides these local and remote irrigation automations, performance optimization
    of the WSN platform is also focused on by [47]. They developed a 3D ray-launching
    (3D-RL) deterministic algorithm to characterize the radio channel of LoRa and
    LoRa wide area network (LoRaWAN) in order to provide better connectivity to transmit
    sensor data in obstacle filled scenarios for irrigation automation. Cardoso et
    al. [48] have proposed a narrow band IoT (NB-IoT) and LoRa-based system to monitor
    and schedule irrigation using machine learning. Unlike irrigation automation,
    AWD requires additional parameters such as plant physiological data in order to
    automate the irrigation system. As discussed in the previous paragraph, some irrigation
    automation utilizes weather data or plant physiological information from the farmer;
    however, this platform targeted only a single pump as the irrigation control unit.
    Most of these solutions are offline, of the open-loop type, and do not synthesize
    the data from all of the different sources. They lack wide-area considerations
    and do not focus on the complexity that comes with the integration of multiple
    physical and logical WSNs with the IoT. Proper dimensioning of pipe-based water
    distribution networks, pump clustering, irrigation depth, and plant lifecycle-specific
    schedule mapping is absent. Therefore, any one of them individually or in combination
    may not be suitable for the automation of the AWD method in wide area applications,
    which is highly required for the socio-economic success of the AWD implementation.
    3. Problem Formulation As one of the rice-producing countries of southwest Asia,
    Bangladesh produces three types of rice: Aus, Aman, and Boro. The north-west part
    of Bangladesh produces more than one-third of these three types of rice and 35%
    of Boro rice is produced in the country. Hence, the irrigated lowland of this
    part can be considered for the AWD implementation, as shown in Figure 2. Figure
    2a shows the annual Boro production areas in overall Bangladesh. Figure 2. Boro
    production and illustrative implementation of AWD in Bangladesh; (a) Total Boro
    cultivation (2015–2016), (b) Portion of the medium Boro production zone focused
    for AWD implementation as marked in (a) by the red box, and (c) closer view of
    an IoT-based AWD system. For implementation of the wide area AWD, a portion of
    the medium Boro production area that produces less than 16% Boro [49] and lacks
    adequate irrigation facilities, as marked by the yellow box in Figure 2b which
    was chosen as the test site. Figure 2c shows the land condition of this area.
    The AWD zone is 5 km by 20 km, covering more than 24 thousand acres of cultivable
    lands that suffers from lack of irrigation. The closest water source is a river
    which is at least 2 km away from the cultivable land. Therefore, traditional canal-based
    irrigation methods are inadequate as they can suffer from water seepage of about
    40% [50]. Furthermore, manual AWD is not able to provide efficient water level
    control over this large area of irrigated land. The proposed IoT-based automation
    system with pipe-based water transportation and distribution using the AWD system
    may reduce the seepage loss by up to 90% [51]. Local or centralized automation
    is not adequate in monitoring and controlling the large number of elements in
    the AWD system. Therefore, an intelligent layered IoT-based closed-loop automation
    system is required and is proposed for this project. 4. Proposed Solution The
    proposed automation of AWD is a closed-loop control system that uses an IoT based
    WSN, which is represented by a simplified block diagram as shown in Figure 3.
    This system has three different types of inputs, which are: (i) environmental
    inputs from the field and weather forecast server; (ii) irrigation inputs from
    a plant physiology database; and (iii) inputs from the users of the pumping network
    and water distribution system. Figure 3. Functional blocks of the IoT–WSN-based
    AWD automation control loop. The environmental parameters to be monitored are
    temperature, pressure, humidity, and the greenhouse gas methane ( 𝐶 𝐻 4 ) . Rice
    fields emit a considerable amount of methane, which can be reduced significantly
    by the intermittent flooding that occurs in the AWD method. The field temperature,
    pressure, and humidity data are required to calculate the evapotranspiration loss,
    seepage loss, and water level of the field, which are used to calculate the basic
    parameters used in the AWD method. Other environmental parameters, such as wind
    speed and daylight, can be collected from the weather forecast server through
    the IoT cloud. The wide area AWD requires an adequate number of pumping machines
    and a pipe-based water distribution system to meet the field irrigation requirement.
    To maintain uniform irrigation throughout the area, the water pressures of the
    pipes need to be monitored continuously. The actuators for the water outlets and
    pumps are controlled to maintain proper pressure and water flow during the wetting
    phase of the AWD method. Additionally, the pump power and mechanical parameters
    need to be monitored continually. The crop coefficient ( 𝐾 𝑐  ) determines the
    AWD stages and can be determined from plant physiological data stored in the database
    and from input entered by farmers. The external data obtained from sensors in
    the field, the weather forecast, the crop coefficient, and user input are combined
    and processed in the closed control loop by the cloud-based AWD server through
    the IoT network. The control logic generated by the cloud server is then sent
    to the actuators and pumps through the IoT network to control the irrigation processes.
    All of the sensor nodes (SN) and actuator nodes (AN) are grouped into clusters
    and connected with the base-station (BS) through the cluster head (CH) using a
    LoRa wireless interface. The BS connects the whole WSN to the IoT network through
    the general packet radio service (GPRS) or third generation (3G) cellular network
    as per availability and coverage. The BS also acts as the WSN to an IoT gateway
    that converts the SN/AN data packets to message query telemetry transport (MQTT)
    messages. 5. System Design and Integration The proposed AWD automation consists
    of two main parts: (a) design and dimensioning of the AWD system; and (b) design
    and integration of the WSN. The AWD method at its core is an irrigation schedule
    that depends on certain the water requirements which vary depending on soil condition
    and the growth stages of the crop. Automation of the AWD using the IoT and WSN
    requires the sensor and actuator networks to be designed together, integration
    of various service modules, and development of the software algorithm. These are
    described in the following sub-sections. 5.1. Irrigation Scheduling The water
    volume of the irrigated field changes due to evapotranspiration and percolation.
    Evapotranspiration is influenced by the crop’s growing stage, wind speed, solar
    radiation, temperature, humidity, and soil properties. The crop evapotranspiration
    (𝐸 𝑇 𝑐 ) [52] can be calculated as 𝐸 𝑇 𝑐 =𝐸 𝑇 0 × 𝐾 𝑐  (1) where ( 𝐾 𝑐 ) is the
    crop coefficient (potency of soil evaporation and crop transpiration), and (𝐸
    𝑇 0 ) is the reference evapotranspiration. Among the different methods, the Food
    and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) Penman–Monteith method [52] is considered
    to be the best estimation for 𝐸 𝑇 0 , and can be expressed as 𝐸 𝑇 0 = 0.408Δ (
    𝑅 𝑛 −𝐺)+γ 900 𝑇+273 𝑢 2 ( 𝑒 𝑠 − 𝑒 𝑎 ) Δ+γ(1+0.34 𝑢 2 )   (2) where, 𝑅 𝑛 = net
    radiation at the crop surface ( MJ m −2 d −1 ) , G = soil heat flux density (
    MJ m −2 d −1 ) , T = mean air temperature (°C), Δ = slope of saturation vapor
    curve (kPa°C−1), 𝑢 2 = wind speed ( ms −1 ), 𝑒 𝑠 = saturation vapor pressure (kPa),
    and 𝑒 𝑎 = actual vapor pressure (kPa). Water requirements for rice (WRR) in cm/day
    is given in Equation (3), which measures the receding water level. 𝑊𝑅 𝑅 𝑗 =(𝐸
    𝑇 𝑜 × 𝐾 𝑐 𝑗 )+𝑃𝐸𝑅𝐶 (3) where PERC is the percolation loss from water seeping into
    the ground through pores, and j is the growth-stage index (1 to 3). Figure 4 illustrates
    the irrigation scheduling for the AWD method. The irrigation frequency (lower
    row) changes along with the development stages of the crop. Three development
    stages (transplantation, flowering, and panicle initiation) along with a water
    level indicator (middle row) are shown to indicate where continuous standing water
    and irrigation scheduling is required. Figure 4. Irrigation scheduling in alternate
    wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation method. The different crop coefficients, including
    Kc of rice, for these three stages are shown in Figure 4 [53]. It is quite evident
    when AWD is initiated that, for approximately 5 to 8 days, depending on the soil
    type, no irrigation is required [54]. Continuous standing water is required at
    the beginning of all three stages which approximates to about 30 days in total;
    hence, utilization of the AWD method is suspended during these times. Therefore,
    depending on the stages and in accordance with the 𝑊𝑅 𝑅 𝑗 , irrigation scheduling
    is applied. Irrigation scheduling is divided into two sections. The first section
    is for continuous standing water and the second section is for AWD period. Continuous
    Standing Water: For the three development stages, if the standing water level
    recedes to 2 cm from 5 cm as given in Equation (4), then the irrigation schedule
    or cycle 𝐼 1𝑗 is applied using Equation (5). 𝐼 1𝑗 represents the number of times
    the pump is turned on and is used to maintain a continuous water level of 5 cm
    above the ground. In this equation, TPFj is the total number of days related to
    the transplantation, panicle initiation, and flowering stages. 𝑖𝑓 ∑ 𝑡=1 𝑇 𝑊𝑅 𝑅
    𝑗 (𝑡)=3 cm 𝑖𝑛 𝑇 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠, 𝑗∈{1,2,3}  (4) 𝐼 1𝑗 = 𝑇𝑃 𝐹 𝑗 𝑇 (5) Establishment of continuous
    standing water during these stages is necessary as rice is quite sensitive to
    fluctuation in water level. Alternate Wetting and Drying Method: For the AWD method,
    when the water level falls 5 cm from above the ground and reaches 15 cm below
    the surface as given in Equation (6), then irrigation 𝐼 2 , which is the number
    of times the pump is turned on, is implemented using Equation (7), where 𝑊 𝑗 is
    the total days for the AWD method, to bring the water level back to 5 cm above
    the surface. 𝑖𝑓 ∑ 𝑡=1 𝑇 1 𝑊𝑅 𝑅 𝑗 (𝑡)=5 cm 𝑖𝑛  𝑇 1  𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠  𝑎𝑏𝑜𝑣𝑒 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒  𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛
    𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 =15 𝑐𝑚 𝑖𝑛  𝑇 2  𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠 𝑏𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒     (6) 𝐼 2𝑗 = 𝑊 𝑗 𝑇 1 + 𝑇 2 𝑗∈{1,2,3}
    (7) The AWD method is utilized in three different stages of the plant development
    period: (i) 15 days after transplantation; (ii) then seven days before panicle
    initiation; and (iii) finally seven days after flowering. 5.2. Dimensioning of
    the AWD System Proper dimensioning of the water distribution network’s pipes is
    required for the implementation of a large-scale AWD system. Multiple pumps are
    used in several clusters for a field of 25,000 acres to reflood the field in the
    shortest time possible. Multiple clustered-pumps facilitate the multiple inlet
    rice irrigation (MIRI) option available with AWD which allows the water to flow
    into the fields from several inlets, flooding the field in the shortest amount
    of time. The capacities of the pumps are chosen to meet the recommended minimum
    swift flooding rate of 0.00126 m3/s per acre (20 gallons per minute per acre),
    which varies depending on the type of soil [55]. Equation (8) shows the total
    number of pumps required ( 𝑛 ), when operating for 𝑡 hours with pumping capacity
    ( c ) in m3/s. The available pumping capacities include 0.02524, 0.05047, 0.06309,
    0.1009, and 0.1262 m3/s, and are achieved with 400, 800, 1000, 1600, and 2000
    GPM (gallons per minute) pumps that cover an acre of area (A) with q (150/m for
    one cm per hour water delivery) amount of water. 𝑛= 𝐴 𝑐×𝑞×𝑡       (8) Figure 5a
    shows the number of pumps required to irrigate 100 acre-inches. Using our proposed
    area of 25,000 acre-inches, it will require a total of 250 pumps with 2000 GPM
    capacities. Figure 5. (a) Number of pumps required when operating for duration
    of time (b) Average power consumption between different water lifting devices
    (c) Efficacy of the water lifting devices. Beside the volume of water to be delivered,
    the selection of water pump depends on lifting head, water pressure, and parameters
    of the water sources. Depending on the lifting head and the source of the water,
    there are three different types of pumps used for irrigation in South-East Asian
    countries including Bangladesh. For the surface water on bodies of water such
    as rivers and lakes, low-lift pumps are used where the lifting head is between
    1 to 5 m. A shallow tube well (STW) is used for more than 73% of ground water
    irrigation [56]. The rest is performed by pumps with higher lifting capacities
    called deep tube wells (DTWs). Irrespective of the type of pump used, pumps with
    higher efficiencies must be selected [57]. Pumps with 70% efficiency (as commonly
    used) are chosen for better selection among different lifting capacities. Average
    energy consumption (Ea) is calculated using Equation (9). 𝐸𝑎=ℎ𝑝·𝜂· 𝑡  (9) where
    hp is the horsepower of the pumps, η is the pump efficiency, and t is the operating
    time of the pumps. The efficacy of the system is measured using Equation (10).
    𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑐𝑦=𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 ( m 3 /s)/ 𝐸𝑎  (10) The average power consumption and efficacy
    of different water lifting devices are shown in Figure 5b,c. The efficacy curves
    in Figure 5c assume 600 GPM, 400 GPM, and 1110 GPM capacities for the low-lift
    pumps (LLP), STW, and DTW pumps. Figure 5b,c shows that LLPs have greater efficacy
    and low energy consumption compared to the other two types. This is mainly due
    to less heads [58] and thus makes the LLP type an economically feasible solution.
    Therefore, multiple low lift pumps are to be used for the wide-area AWD implementation
    as it would allow for proper utilization of the surface water and help lessen
    the exploitation of groundwater irrigation. The proper dimensions of pipes are
    of paramount importance in carrying surface water to the field; therefore, pipes
    are chosen to ensure minimum friction loss while maintaining the recommended water
    flow velocity [59]. The pipes are placed on a downward slope, as shown in Figure
    6a, to overcome the loss of pressure that occurs when travelling larger horizontal
    distances. Moreover, due to multiple inlets for irrigation, the pressure of water
    may fall from one inlet to the other; hence, when needed, the inlets closer to
    the source can be closed, to ensure sufficient water pressure at the opposite
    end of the field. Figure 6. (a) Downward slope water pipe (b) In-field Automated
    AWD setup. According to Equation (8), 250 units of 0.1262 m3/s (2000 GPM) capacity
    pumps need to be formed into clusters to ensure that the field is reflooded within
    16 to 17 h of operating time. The frictional head loss for a steady pipe’s flow
    is calculated using the Hazen–Williams equation [59], which is given by Equation
    (11). ℎ 100𝑓𝑡 =(0.2083× ( 100 𝑐 ) 1.852 × 𝑞 1.852 )/ 𝑑 ℎ 4.8655 (11) where ℎ 100𝑓𝑡
    = friction head loss, in feet, of water per 100 feet of pipe, c = Hazen–Williams
    roughness constant, q = volume flow (gal/min) and 𝑑 ℎ = inside diameter of the
    pipe (inches). Subsequently, the friction loss in psi [59] can be calculated using
    the following Equation (12). 𝑓 100𝑓𝑡 =(1/2.31)× ℎ 100𝑓𝑡 (12) where, 𝑓 100𝑓𝑡 =
    friction loss in psi per 100 feet of pipe. Equations (11) and (12) are required
    to determine the diameter of pipes needed for specific applications. The holes
    of the inlet would need to be 0.0635 m in diameter to obtain a flow of 0.004732
    m3/s (75 GPM) from every inlet in order to fill the field in the shortest possible
    time [55]. Table 1 shows the proposed AWD system with the number of monitoring
    and driver nodes needed to ensure that water gets dispersed evenly throughout
    the field. Figure 6b shows the AWD setup of the field, designed to ensure that
    all farmers receive a fair share of irrigation water, thus resulting in greater
    acceptance of the AWD. Table 1. Proposed AWD system setup. 5.3. WSN and IoT Integration
    IoT-based automation of the AWD system requires different WSNs for sensors and
    actuators. All of these networks work independently with the same base station.
    A WSN collects field parameters such as water level, gas emissions ( 𝐶 𝐻 4 ),
    temperature, pressure, and humidity. These data are then transmitted at 15 min
    intervals. The other WSN monitors the pipe and pump health parameters, such as
    pipe pressure, flow rate of water in pipes, and pump electric power. Based on
    these data, it generates alarms to shut down the pump in emergency situations.
    There is continuous monitoring at the SN which allows for immediate action when
    needed. The actuator network operates the actuators of the pipe to control the
    water flow through the pipe and is updated every 15 min. Comparing the low-power
    wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies, LoRa was chosen for the WSN in order to
    achieve the wide area coverage needed at the monitoring area for the AWD automation.
    Table 2 summarizes the LPWAN technology features [14] including range, data rate,
    and power requirements. It shows that LoRa is the best suited technology in terms
    of range with higher data rates when compared to Sigfox. Table 2. Basic features
    of wireless technologies. LoRa employs chirp spread spectrum (CSS) modulation
    for better noise immunity and sensitivity in order to achieve low-power and long-range
    wireless connectivity. The LoRa data rate ( 𝑅 𝑏 ) depends on the channel bandwidth
    (BW), coding rate (CR), and the CSS spreading factor (SF), and can be calculated
    using Equation (13). Data Rate=SF [ 4 4+CR ] [ 2 SF BW ]  (13) For the proposed
    automated-AWD system, the LoRa physical layer was chosen instead of LoRaWAN in
    order to customize the channel access interval and achieve better channel utilization
    by implementing a custom MAC (Medium Access Control) layer. Furthermore, WSN coverage
    can be improved by increasing the CSS spreading factor of LoRa, without increasing
    transmission power or changing any network elements [14]. Table 3 summarizes the
    LoRa configuration parameters used for the SN where the data rate Rb is calculated
    using Equation (13). Table 3. LoRa parameters. The multi-purpose sensor node (SN),
    shown in Figure 7a, is designed for all WSNs in order to keep the network homogeneous.
    It consists of a LoRa transceiver module (SX1278) unit, main processor (ATMega
    328), and network specific sensors and actuator drivers. Depending on the specific
    application, the sensor node can be used to either drive actuators or collect
    and monitor sensor data. Figure 7 shows the hardware blocks of the SN with the
    power unit and the base station. Figure 7. Hardware block diagram showing (a)
    Sensor node consisting of sensors, actuator drivers, and power unit; (b) base
    station (BS) with LoRa and cellular data connectivity. The base station (BS) consists
    of a Raspberry Pi-4 which acts as a host computer to control the WSN, data communication,
    and gateway functionalities. It has both LoRa and Wi-Fi/3G/LTE to maintain the
    connection with the WSNs and IoT cloud. Figure 7b shows the hardware block diagram
    of the BS. 5.4. Communication Protocol and Automation Algorithm Data transmission
    from the SN is controlled by the BS. The BS initiates data request messages to
    a specific SN using their unique ID and sends an acknowledgement after successful
    reception of the sensor data. For the actuator node (AN), the BS sends the actuator
    control messages to the AN, and updates the actuator nodes in the server database
    after receiving the data and from the AN. All of these communications between
    the WSN and the BS are performed using LoRa with messages transferred as LoRa
    packets. The BS processes the LoRa data packets and sends them to the IoT server
    as MQTT messages. The commands used to control the pumps and actuator, sent from
    the IoT server, also use MQTT. On the user side, a smartphone app and web interface
    are connected with the IoT server through a cloud-implemented MQTT-hypertext transfer
    protocol (HTTP) gateway. All of the data communication and AWD automation processes
    are performed by the SN, BS, and cloud IoT server. Figure 8a,b show the possible
    software algorithms designed for the SN and AN, respectively. At first, it configures
    and initializes the sensors, LoRa module, and driver unit. It then starts reading
    the field, pipe, and pump sensors to monitor their condition continuously. The
    AN takes all necessary actions according to certain pump operating conditions
    and control logic defined by the user during the initialization phase. All the
    internal control variables are updated according to external parameters at regular
    intervals in a closed loop at node A. These external parameters, such as user
    input, plant-specific data, and weather forecasts, are collected through the IoT
    server. Figure 8c shows the AWD automation control logic performed by the IoT
    server. The SN algorithm, shown in Figure 8a, was used for the field trial (described
    in Section 6). The algorithms, shown in Figure 8b,c, intended for wide-area AWD
    automation, were not used in the field trial. Initially, the irrigation phase
    (TPF or AWD) is ascertained, at which point all of the phase specific decisions
    are taken. For example, the surface water level (SWL) is monitored in terms of
    TPF, and, for the AWD, the below surface water level (BSWL) is checked to determine
    whether to toggle the actuator nodes on or off. Subsequently, after toggling the
    actuators and pumps, the SWL is measured for both the TPF and AWD, and then, if
    the SWL reaches 5 cm above the surface, the actuators and pumps are switched off.

    actuator node algorithm, and (c) Control logic algorithm for the AWD server intended
    for wide-area AWD automation. 6. Field Trial A field trial was performed in two
    phases: (i) WSN formation and data collection at UIU (United International University),
    Bangladesh; and (ii) remote data collection using the IoT network in an AWD plot
    at the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI). Figure 9a shows the location
    of the UIU campus fields and Figure 9b shows the BRRI’s research agricultural
    field on Google Maps. Figure 9. Field trial location: (a) On-campus trial at United
    International University. (b) Agricultural land trial at BRRI. Figure 10a shows
    the IoT-connected (wireless sensor and actuator network (WSAN) architecture which
    is comprised of two sensor networks (WSN1 and WSN2) and one wireless actuator
    network (WSN3), as described in Section 5.3. In phase one, four sensor nodes (SNs)
    were placed at each corner of a 500 m by 500 m field with the indoor base station
    (BS) located in a lab on the fifth floor of the campus building. The approximate
    distances between the SNs and the BS were 500 m to 750 m, as shown in Figure 10b.
    Figure 10. (a) IoT-connected WSAN architecture (b) On-campus trial setup with
    sensor devices connected to a base station IoT-connected WSAN architecture. Sensor
    data were collected on a round-robin basis to avoid the co-channel interference
    that occurs at high frequencies (30 s period), and to evaluate the data transfer
    performance of the WSN. The base station (BS) consisted of a Linux-based (Redhat
    7) Apache web server with Node.js, HTM, Python 3, and Maria Database. It also
    acted as a WSN-IoT gateway using the LoRa–WiFi interface. To collect real-life
    data and to evaluate the AWD algorithm’s performance, SNs were placed in the agricultural
    plots of BRRI in a Boro field. The field was divided into irrigation blocks of
    15 m by 15 m, and the SNs were placed 200 m apart from each other. The irrigation
    system was controlled using a central pump. Figure 11 shows the field setup. Figure
    11. Agricultural field level trial setup: (a) Top view of a sensor device in the
    field (b) The receiver base station setup. The BS located at BRRI acquired all
    the sensor data from the field and stored it in the IoT server in a lab at UIU
    through the 3G cellular network. To monitor and process the field data in real-time,
    a distributed application structure was designed, as shown in Figure 12c. Here,
    a smartphone app, web interface, and other automation applications were developed
    and primarily implemented within the central IoT server [60]. Figure 12a,b show
    the smartphone app and the web interface. Figure 12. (a) Mobile Application, (b)
    Web Application, and (c) client-server connectivity for user interface. The mobile
    and web applications were linked to a Node.js server. A mobile Android application
    was used to collect data, a server was used to store the data and generate notifications,
    and a web client was used as a dashboard to display all the AWD specific information.
    The mobile app and web dashboard used rESTful APIs, HTTP requests, and web sockets
    to interface with the server. Sensor data from the external sensor devices was
    recorded on the server, where it was reactively pushed to the mobile client and
    dashboard using web sockets. Web sockets were used to communicate between the
    server and the clients. Both the Android and web apps provided similar services,
    such as user registration, sensor data acquisition, warning generation based on
    sensor data, and data and AWD status reports on the dashboard. The end user, farmers,
    can reconfigure the AWD parameters, such as water level and pump operation time
    using either the smartphone app or web interface. 7. Performance Analysis In traditional
    irrigation systems, water distribution is performed using earthen canals [50]
    due to their low initial cost. However, these canals result in poor distribution
    efficiency, less area coverage, and, in the long run, results in high maintenance
    costs. The greatest concern in using earthen canals is the high water loss, which
    is expressed as water conveyance loss (S) [51] and can be calculated using Equation
    (14). 𝑆={( 𝑄 1 − 𝑄 2 )÷𝐿}×100 (14) where S = the rate of conveyance loss in the
    canal ( m 3  s −1 ) per 100 m distance, Q1 = rate of flow at the inlet ( m 3  s
    −1 ), Q2 = rate of flow at the outlet ( m 3  s −1 ), and L = distance between
    two points (m). The main factor causing this loss in the earthen canals is due
    to seepage loss. Studies have found that about 40% of the water is lost during
    the distribution time through the earthen canals [50]. The proposed automated
    AWD system using plastic pipes can overcome this conveyance loss, and help reduce
    the irrigation time, which in turn results in less energy (fuel or electricity)
    to operate the pumps. The conveyance loss rate for the proposed project derived
    from [51] is shown in Figure 13. It compares the conveyance loss between earthen
    canals and plastic piping when water is transported 5000 m from the water source
    to the field. Thus, the proposed design saves about 90.91% of water when transporting
    it from the source using plastic piping instead of earthen canals. Furthermore,
    studies conducted by [51] have found that the incorporation of the AWD method
    with plastic pipes has saved about 42% of water, and reduced energy consumption
    by 41.2% compared to the traditional method. Figure 13. Conveyance loss compensation
    between earthen canal and plastic pipe. Using Equations (5) and (7), the frequency
    of irrigations, 𝐼 1𝑗  and  𝐼 2𝑗 , can be used to determine the total energy consumption
    of the pumps. For instance, to reflood a 100-acre field with 3 cm of water while
    maintaining continuous water during TPFj, a single 2000-GPM capacity pump with
    70% efficiency and 12 hp, operating for 18 h, would be sufficient as seen in Figure
    5a. Then, using Equation (9), average power consumption of the pump is found to
    be 142.8 KWh. Similarly, the average energy consumption can be determined for
    the AWD method. Therefore, the total energy consumption for the whole season can
    be found by using Equation (15): 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 (𝐾𝑊ℎ)= 𝐼 1𝑗 ∗𝐸𝑎(𝑇𝑃 𝐹
    𝑗 )+  𝐼 2𝑗 ∗𝐸𝑎(𝐴𝑊𝐷) (15) where 𝐸𝑎(𝑇𝑃 𝐹 𝑗 ) represents the energy consumption during
    the TPF stages in order to supply 3 cm of water to the field, and 𝐸𝑎(𝐴𝑊𝐷) denotes
    the energy required to supply water when water reaches 15 cm below ground during
    the AWD method. It can be observed that, compared to the traditional method which
    utilizes continuous water, the proposed automated system is expected to require
    less energy. Figure 14 shows the dimensioning steps and mathematical calculations
    that are used for the proposed AWD system. Figure 14. Required dimensioning and
    calculation steps for an IoT-based AWD system. Table 4 compares the automated
    AWD method with manual AWD systems. Manual AWD studies focused on limited field
    sizes, soil types, and water sources. Sharing a limited number of water-lifting
    devices amongst numerous farmers tended to cause conflicts among them. Furthermore,
    the number of farmers it supported was generally quite limited. However, in the
    proposed IoT- and WSN-based automated AWD system, large-scale implementation is
    possible using a pipe and actuator-based water distribution system with cluster
    pump operation and monitoring. In this proposed system, 10 clusters, each containing
    25 pumps with capacities of 0.1262 m 3 /s (2000 GPM), can cover an area of 25,000
    acres. In this system, the pumps have 12 hp with an average pumping efficiency
    of 70%, which can support a large number of farmers while still allowing each
    farmer to obtain a fair share of water. Table 4. Comparison between manual AWD
    and automated AWD. In manual AWD, due to manual inspection of water levels throughout
    the irrigation season, pumps may operate for more hours than necessary, resulting
    in the wastage of valuable resources. However, in automated systems, pumps are
    switched off as soon as the water level reaches a certain threshold level, resulting
    in water and energy savings. The experiments presented in [46] showed that the
    automated AWD saved between 13–20% of water, with a 25% decrease in irrigation
    energy cost, and an increase in rice yields by 2–11% over manual AWD. The AWD
    automation scheme proposed in this paper is expected to reduce irrigation costs
    further since it uses plastic pipes to carry water. Moreover, integration of weather
    forecast data will operate the pumps effectively (e.g., keeping pumps off when
    the forecast predicts precipitation). Research in [45,46] presented automation
    of the AWD process by using sensors to precisely measure the water level precisely.
    These studies focused on small areas compared to that of the system described
    in this paper. For large-scale automation of AWD, multiple WSNs need to be designed
    and implemented. While automated AWD systems offer certain advantages over the
    manual AWD, as described in Table 4, the dimensioning of the wide-area automated
    AWD system may face challenges during implementation. The plant physiological
    database for developing countries such as Bangladesh is not regularly updated
    and is not easily accessible. In Bangladesh, where farmers are largely not exposed
    to technology, their knowledge and experiences about rice and irrigation are not
    readily available. Moreover, one of the research constraints is that the weather
    forecast information is not based on the specific local territory. Rather, it
    is based on the general meteorological information of the whole region. 8. Conclusions
    This paper has presented an approach to automating a wide-area AWD system covering
    a total irrigation area of 25,000 acres. Implementation of AWD in such a large
    irrigation area has not been reported in the existing literature. It is imperative
    that such a large system uses automation instead of the traditional manual operation
    and monitoring approach. The automation can be achieved by integrating three essential
    and intricate wireless sensor networks (WSN): a mechanical subsystem comprised
    of pumps, actuator networks, and a water distribution network, and an IoT system
    that runs the automation algorithm and issues control commands. The data from
    the WSN, along with other operating parameters, are processed at a central server
    that decides whether to activate the pumps and the actuator valves. The system
    is scalable and the algorithm can be adjusted for irrigation areas with different
    sizes within a practical limit. The required set of equations to support the design
    and operation of the overall system is provided in this paper. The hardware for
    the system is presented and described in order to facilitate the implementation
    of the automation system. The communication protocol and automation algorithm
    have also been presented in sufficient detail. A sample study on a small-scale
    field trial is presented as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the effectiveness
    of the proposed system. An analysis of the proposed system’s expected performance
    is discussed by comparing it with manual and automated AWD systems in the existing
    literature. The analysis highlights the large irrigation area and the complete
    automation aspect of the proposed system. Despite numerous advantages, such as
    reduced water consumption, and economic and environmental benefits, widespread
    adoption of AWD is yet to be materialized due to social, economic, and technical
    challenges. This paper demonstrates that, with the adoption of existing sensor
    networks and IoT-based technologies, wide area adoption [25] is feasible and economically
    viable. The proposed wide-area AWD system allows for continuous monitoring and
    real-time decision making along with a fair distribution of water amongst the
    farmers. The authors are optimistic that, with the adoption of the proposed system,
    wide area AWD will be implemented in rice-growing countries. These countries will
    then reap the full benefits of the technological advantages that AWD has to offer.
    For future expansion of the proposed system, long-term data can be collected and
    analyzed to improve the system further and to further control the greenhouse emissions
    more effectively. Since the proposed system enables the collection of data and
    creation of a large database, new models can be generated and advanced techniques,
    including machine learning and big data, can be applied for better performance.
    Furthermore, incorporating the farmer’s valuable input alongside previous data
    and algorithms will make it possible to accurately identify the different physiological
    stages of plants during the season, resulting in the improved development of plants
    and yields. Author Contributions Conceptualization, G.M.E.R. and R.M.; methodology,

  data_sources: Canal test cases developed by the ASCE task committee
  description: Automated open- and closed-loop control systems can enhance the performance
    of irrigation delivery systems. This paper examines the response of the canal
    test cases developed by the ASCE task committee on canal automation algorithms
    to a particular anticipatory open-loop control technique, gate stroking. The performance
    of the ideal gate-stroking solution is compared with the performance of an approximate
    gate-stroking schedule that was generated by imposing practical constraints on
    the frequency and magnitude of the gate adjustments. Also analyzed were the performance
    of a nonanticipatory open-loop control scheme and the effect of model parameter
    uncertainties on the effectiveness of the control. For the test cases, the approximate
    gate-stroking schedules performed similarly to the ideal schedules. For two of
    the test cases, delivery performance was similar with and without anticipation,
    but was substantially different for the other two tests. The quality of the control
    degraded as a result of errors in model parameters, particularly in cases with
    incorrect check gate calibrations and submerged gate flows. Results point out
    the importance of combining open- and closed-loop control measures to improve
    the overall effectiveness of the control.

  explanation: This study focuses on evaluating the response of several canal test
    cases, developed by the ASCE task committee, to an anticipatory open-loop control
    technique called gate stroking. The researchers compare the performance of an
    ideal gate-stroking solution to a practical gate-stroking schedule with constraints
    on adjustment frequency and magnitude. They also analyze a non-anticipatory open-loop
    control scheme and investigate the impact of model parameter uncertainties on
    control effectiveness. Overall, the study highlights the importance of combining
    open- and closed-loop control measures to improve irrigation system performance.
  extract_1: The results of the study suggest that open-loop control techniques can

    Media Tables Share Abstract Automated open- and closed-loop control systems can
    enhance the performance of irrigation delivery systems. This paper examines the
    response of the canal test cases developed by the ASCE task committee on canal
    automation algorithms to a particular anticipatory open-loop control technique,
    gate stroking. The performance of the ideal gate-stroking solution is compared
    with the performance of an approximate gate-stroking schedule that was generated
    by imposing practical constraints on the frequency and magnitude of the gate adjustments.
    Also analyzed were the performance of a nonanticipatory open-loop control scheme
    and the effect of model parameter uncertainties on the effectiveness of the control.
    For the test cases, the approximate gate-stroking schedules performed similarly
    to the ideal schedules. For two of the test cases, delivery performance was similar
    with and without anticipation, but was substantially different for the other two
    tests. The quality of the control degraded as a result of errors in model parameters,
    particularly in cases with incorrect check gate calibrations and submerged gate
    flows. Results point out the importance of combining open- and closed-loop control
    measures to improve the overall effectiveness of the control. Formats available

    Information: DOI: 10.1109/67.917582 Publisher: IEEE Implementing precision agriculture
    for farm management requires improved sensing and control beyond that commonly
    used today In the world of distributed automation, two things are always required:
    power and communications. Preexisting power lines have long been looked upon as
    a potential media for communications. Electric utilities have a long history of
    using transmission lines for voice, data, and relay communications. As the availability
    of utility-owned microwave and fiberoptic communications increases, power-line
    carrier (PLC) moves down the list of preferred communications methods. As industrial
    and commercial customers move toward distributed control for process automation
    or environmental controls, the wires presently used for electric power are inviting
    as a resource for communications. Water and electricity can be a deadly mixture.
    The conventional role of electric power in agricultural irrigation is to power
    pumps for lifting and pressurizing the water supply. Mechanized irrigation systems,
    such as center pivots, also use power for mobility. This article describes how
    existing power lines are being used to reduce implementation and operating costs
    for automating existing agricultural irrigation controls. The system uses low-cost
    low-power PLC to take advantage of preexisting power lines and minimize the retrofitting
    effort needed for distributed networked control. It also takes advantage of the
    fact that there is a good match between the speed response for irrigation and
    the bandwidth available for low-cost power-line communications. This article features
    one application of this technology and describes design and operational experiences
    to allow readers to extrapolate this approach to other areas of automation through
    distributed control. Precision Irrigation Precision agriculture is the practice
    of spatially distributing production inputs to improve yield potential. Instead
    of treating a tract of land with uniform applications of chemicals and water,
    the fields are divided into management zones. These zones are characterized by
    the elements of the land that affect crop growth, soil type, slope, water holding
    capability, etc. Each zone is farmed according to the needs of that particular
    cell. Harvesters equipped with yield-monitoring sensors and position-locating
    equipment help access the success of the production practices. Implementing precision
    agriculture for farm management requires improved sensing and control beyond that
    commonly used today. The focus of our research has been the data acquisition and
    control needed for automating spatially variable irrigation using both center-pivot
    and linear-move systems. Center-pivot irrigation systems use an aerial water pipe
    suspended between mobile A-frame towers. Sprinklers are spaced and sized for flow
    rate along the pipe for uniform application. Fractional HP 480 V ac three-phase
    motors drive the wheels at each tower location. The phase rotation of the 480
    V ac determines the direction that the system rotates about a fixed center point.
    480 V ac is commutated to the movable pivot through a set of slip rings. The motor
    at the end tower is controlled by a timer that applies power for a percentage
    number of seconds out of each minute. Motors at intermediate towers are controlled
    by microswitches that sense when the pivot is out of alignment. Typically, the
    pivots are 1,200 ft long and operate in a full circle. Linear-move irrigation
    systems follow physical or electrical tracks rather than rotating in a circle.
    They drag a flexible water line at one end of the field as they travel. Electricity
    to power the controls and move the system must be provided by a gas or diesel
    engine that travels with the irrigation lines or by dragging an electrical cable.
    As fields are usually laid out in rectangular patterns, they have the ability
    to irrigate the corners of the fields without special effort. These types of systems
    are not as popular as the center-pivot systems because they are more expensive.
    The irrigation schedule must also include time to run the linear-move system back
    to the starting position. A linear-move system also requires twice as much pipe
    as would a center-pivot system to irrigate the same amount of land. Figure 1.
    Communications and control architecture block diagram Show All There is a lot
    more to effective irrigation than just dumping a lot of water on the ground. Applying
    the right amount of water at the right time maximizes crop yield. Undulating terrain,
    soil texture, and spatially variable water utilization by the crop redistributes
    uniformly applied water and creates deserts and swamps in our fields of potatoes.
    Automated irrigation systems are usually designed so that they can at best minimally
    meet the water requirements during periods of peak water demands. This means that
    irrigation is needed by the time the sprinklers make it back around. Chemigation
    (fertilization, pesticide, and herbicide by chemical injection into the irrigation
    water) is accomplished at the base of the pivot''s center. To spatially vary water
    application, the position of each nozzle must be known and controllable. By measuring
    the pivot angle with a shaft encoder or using a GPS unit mounted on the end tower,
    the position of each sprinkler nozzle is easily determined. The control that we
    implemented varies the water application in a step-wise fashion using two sprinklers
    at each outlet location, each controlled with a solenoid actuated diaphragm valve.
    One valve controls a sprinkler with 1/3 flow and the other a sprinkler with 2/3
    flow. Chemigation must be controlled for uniform concentration using a variable
    speed drive on the injection pump. Hence, water flow rate must either be measured
    directly or estimated by knowing which valves are on and off. Networks and Distributed
    Control To avoid total chaos, distributed control networks generally operate in
    a master-slave mode rather that peer-to-peer mode. Operating with multiple masters
    is permissible for supervisory functions or in cases of failures. The controls
    implemented for spatially variable irrigation include a master computer to maintain
    the water and chemigation schedules. Remote instrumentation has been used to maintain
    minimum water pressure on fields with significant changes in elevation and the
    ability to control the pressure of the water supply. Early spatially variable
    irrigation systems used aerial thermal imaging and field surveys to evaluate water
    status. These methods are labor intensive and embed significant delays (as much
    as 2 days) between the measurement and the control. Much of our effort has been
    to mitigate both of these issues. One of the initial attempts for the distributed
    control system used RS-485 over shielded twisted pair. This is a popular two-wire
    bidirectional multidrop communications protocol that operates with a differential
    5 V signal. The data transmission rates include those supported by the familiar
    three-wire RS-232 protocol commonly used for computer serial interfaces. The chief
    difference between RS-232 and RS-485 is that the RS-232 protocol standard does
    not support applications that require multiple transmitters on a single communication
    line. Implementation difficulties resulted in unreliable communications from impedance
    mismatches and reflections from long runs. Since the control platform (sprinkler
    pipes) is mobile, the master computer is either mounted on a rotating platform
    or wireless communications is needed. To locate the master CPU outside the irrigated
    area required RF transmitters that had to be licensed. The next generation used
    commercial 120 V ¥10 PLC transmitters and receivers. This required a 480/120 V
    ac transformer to be hung from the pivot and a 1,200 ft 120 V ac line to be run
    to the control points. Although the communications issues were overcome, the master
    CPU still had to hang from a rotating platform. A second disadvantage, at that
    time, was that the communications was not bidirectional, eliminating the ability
    to bring information back to the master computer. Figure 2. Pivot mounted P2K
    control and communications node block diagram Show All Starting in 1995, proprietary
    networked control nodes were developed that used PLC at 480 V ac for the communications
    media. By coupling to a 480 V ac line, the control equipment can be placed for
    convenient accessibility using the slip rings to commute both power and communications.
    Two different manufacturers of PLC equipment were investigated: a narrow-band
    technology by Echelon Corp. operating between 125 and 135 kHz and a spread-spectrum
    technology by Intellon Corp. operating in a band from 100 to 400 kHz. Operationally,
    both technologies have similar functionality, speed, and reliability performance.
    The only communications failure was on the narrow-band system due to interference
    from the chemigation injection pump variable speed drive. Low-pass filtering with
    passive components easily solved this problem. At this time, we implemented real-time
    closed-loop control of both water pressure and chemigation concentration. On the
    premise that controlling pressure using a variable speed drive on the water pump
    can reduce energy costs, the control scheme maintained a minimum pressure to ensure
    full coverage by the sprinkler nozzles. Modern agricultural sprinkler nozzles
    commonly use pressure regulators. Over-pressurizing the water supply system results
    in energy losses that are roughly proportional to the pressure drop times the
    flow. Low-pressure irrigation systems are now very popular. Figure 3. Block diagram
    of the field sensor unit (FSU) Show All Both manufacturers'' equipment allowed
    bidirectional peer-to-peer network communications using proprietary network protocols.
    Our concern was for rapid development, not for interoperability or flexibility.
    Our experience for this application found that implementing the Intellon PLC network
    has lower technical difficulty, and the development tools were less expensive.
    Present State of Pivot Controls Today''s center-pivot irrigation management systems
    are reducing the delays between the measurements of crop needs and controls that
    regulate the water and chemical application. The system tested during the year
    2000 growing season uses both valve controls on the rotating pivot and sensors
    at fixed points on the ground (Figure 1). The field sensor unit (FSU) nodes collect
    environmental data on soil, air, and plants that indicate the water and nutritional
    demands of the plant. To accommodate the more widely spatially distributed system,
    solar powered sensor units communicated with the valve control nodes on the pivot
    using low-power RF transceivers (Figure 2). Limiting the power of the RF transceivers
    also limited the range of the RF transmissions to less than 300 m. Hence, communications
    can only be established when the pivot rotates to a position where the transmitters
    and receivers are in range. The control nodes on the pivot, called P2K nodes,
    now serve a secondary function as a message bridge from PLC to wireless RF. The
    FSU nodes collect data continuously and off-load their information in bursts while
    the P2K nodes are within range (Figure 3). A new proprietary network protocol
    that is independent of the physical layer was developed to manage the additional
    requirements of multiple communications media and higher data traffic with minimal
    overhead. Network Protocol The PLC-based network is the communications backbone.
    Length of the messages is restricted only by the hardware implementing the physical
    layer (this is the bottom layer in the seven-level OSI-ISO network model). Our
    implementation uses variable-length messages limited to 28 bytes that include
    5 bytes of routing control. When messages are bound to or from FSU nodes, the
    P2K nodes serve as message repeaters to bridge the different physical layers.
    The message format that Figure 4 illustrates shows that the routing control field
    (RCF) consists of 4 bytes for the routing node list (RNL) and 1 byte for the routing
    control byte (RCB). Since the message is variable length, the number of bytes
    in the message occupies the first field. The RCB is 8 bits of one-hot codes that
    indicate the media used to deliver the message and the media to be used if the
    message is to be passed on. This routing control makes the basic network capable
    of peer-to-peer communications even though the application utilizes the network
    in a master-slave mode. Destination nodes respond with either explicate or implicate
    messages. The RCF has sufficient information for the routing of the return message.
    Only the originator of the message must have a priori knowledge of the network
    configuration to ensure that the P2K nodes capable of RF communications with particular
    FSU nodes are used as repeaters. Figure 4. Network message structure Show All
    PLC Communications When we first considered PLC to extend communications from
    the movable controls to a fixed master computer, the areas of concern were determining
    the effects the slip rings and the multiphase coupling in the cable had on the
    low-power PLC signal. Experimentation and experience soon revealed that neither
    were cause for concern. The wire configuration of the cables varies widely. The
    length varies according to the length of the sprinkler system and the location
    of the master computer. We have made no attempts to communicate through power
    transformers, thus restricting the network range to one voltage level. The direction
    that the sprinklers travel is controlled by the phase rotation of the three-phase
    480 V ac. While retrofitting some older center-pivot irrigation systems, the quality
    of the original installation raised doubts that we could guarantee that communications
    would remain coupled to the same phase. All PLC connections use phase-to-ground
    coupling. All tests have shown that cable runs longer than a few hundred feet
    have sufficient interphase capacitance that coupling to different phases results
    in a few dB attenuation at worst. Our measurements found 0.064μF for a five-tower
    660 ft long center pivots with the controls at the pivot''s center to 0.22 μF
    for a ten-tower 1,300 foot pivot with the controls at the perimeter of the field.
    The amount of interphase capacitance is a function of the cable length and interwinding
    capacitance in both the 480/24 V ac transformers and the tower wheel drive motors
    when needed to move the pivot. The signal strengths between the master computer
    node and all P2K nodes have sufficient noise margin that the additional attenuation
    can be ignored. The Wire Since the electrical system is the communications media,
    the success or failure of the network depends on the attenuating characteristics
    of the wire and the interfering signals generated by other equipment that is also
    attached to the power lines. Attempts to model the system using SPICE (an analog
    electronics simulation program) and EMTP simulation programs have yielded little
    insight into predicting which power circuits are suitable candidates for high
    frequency low-power PLC. For automated irrigation systems, since all the loads
    are connected phase-to-phase, PLC communications is most reliable using phase-to-ground
    coupling as shown in Figure 5. This arrangement makes the impedance seen by the
    RF transmitters almost completely independent of the load. The physical and electrical
    parameters of the cable used for power and pivot controls determine the impedance
    seen by the PLC transmitters. The frequency response of the cable open-circuited
    impedance both before and after it is installed on the center pivot is shown in
    Figure 6. Although the impedance of cable by itself falls at higher frequencies,
    the PLC transmitter sees entirely different characteristics after the cable has
    been installed. This might be attributed to effects of slip rings and unidentified
    connections at the towers. Most of the low-power PLC transmitters operate at voltages
    less than 10 V with amplifiers than have less than 5 Ω output impedance. The minimum
    impedance seen at the cable end was 8 Ω with five PLC devices evenly distributed
    along 630 ft cable. The point is that the characteristic impedance is rarely neither
    predictable nor constant in industrial environments. This example illustrates
    that what appears to be a simple network still has unusual behavior. But this
    is certain: series inductance and shunt capacitance degrade communications performance.
    Noise generated by random events, such as turning equipment on or off, generally
    can be tolerated by retransmission if the message is destroyed. Continuously generated
    noise, such as from a switching power supply, that impairs communications needs
    to be filtered or blocked. Usually a passive low-pass LC T type filter with a
    frequency cutoff between 1 and 10 kHz is sufficient. When the load resistance
    is large, the cutoff frequency is set predominately by the inductors and capacitors.
    There are a few considerations to bear in mind when implementing such a filter
    to block noise. Always have an inductor leg toward the communications circuits
    to isolate the capacitance from presenting a low-impedance path to the high-frequency
    signals. Make sure the ratings of the components are sufficient to carry the equipment
    current and withstand the line to ground voltage. Also, verify that the equipment
    to which the filter is applied will operate correctly with the filter in the circuit.
    Those filter characteristics that keep noise from corrupting the communications
    signals also keep the communications signals out of the equipment. Make sure that
    the PLC transmitters and receivers are on the high-frequency side of the low-pass
    filter. Will it Work? Even though all of our attempts to establish a low-power
    PLC network on linear-move and center-pivot irrigation systems have been successful,
    our tests reveal that PLC communications in residential and industrial environments
    is not always possible without some mitigating signal conditioning. As theory
    predicts and experience confirms, the more complicated the electrical network,
    the greater the probability that standing waves will impair communications. Other
    attenuating devices include transient suppressors, tapped loads of switching power
    supply with high input capacitance, and highly inductive circuits. The PLC amplifier
    low-output impedance is necessary to operate into highly capacitive power circuits.
    Following a few rules of thumb will quickly reveal which power circuits are good
    candidates for PLC communications. Do not attempt to operate through transformers
    that change voltage class. Operations on different legs of a transformer at the
    same voltage class may require the installation of interphase capacitors. Some
    circuits will not work when the RF is coupled from phase to neutral because of
    attached equipment with high input capacitance. These circuits stand a better
    chance of working if the PLC is coupled phase to ground because of the additional
    line inductance of the ground and neutral wires. If you are planning to implement
    a communications network using low-voltage PLC communications, you are well advised
    to invest in an inexpensive test unit available from the suppliers of this technology
    and run some tests before committing to a PLC-based design. Most likely, you will
    be not disappointed and will experience the cost-saving advantages as we did.

    Introduction Common variations in soil properties and soil water availability
    over large fields are appropriate for site-specific irrigation management. Development
    of automated site-specific sprinkler irrigation systems allow producers to maximize
    irrigation efficiency, simultaneously minimizing negative effects on their productivity.
    A distributed in-field wireless sensor network (WSN) and a variable-rate irrigation
    controller offer a potential means to support automated closed-loop irrigation
    control, but the seamless integration of the WSN and irrigation controller can
    be challenging. The spatial variability of soils and other characteristics in
    agricultural fields has been addressed in the precision agriculture literature
    (Irmak et al. 2002; Ahmad et al. 1999). However, optimizing configurations for
    site-specific management in each field remains a difficult task. Apparent soil
    electrical conductivity (EC) mapping has been widely used as one way to characterize
    soil variability of agricultural fields (Farahani and Buchleiter 2004; Drummond
    et al. 2000; Jabro et al. 2006). In-field wireless sensing systems and variable-rate
    irrigation systems have also been studied by many researchers (Shock et al. 1999;
    King et al. 2000; Marinda et al. 2003; Wall and King 2004; Perry et al. 2004;
    Kim et al. 2006a). However, few have fully integrated these systems into closed-loop
    wireless irrigation control and monitoring systems. A wireless irrigation control
    system was developed and evaluated for real-time variable-rate irrigation control
    and monitoring (Kim et al. 2006a), and a distributed WSN was designed for in-field
    wireless sensing of soil water conditions (Kim et al. 2007b). The objective of
    this paper is to evaluate the integration of the irrigation control system with
    the in-field WSN for automated closed-loop variable-rate sprinkler irrigation.
    This research is part of a project that was established in early 2004 to develop
    integrated wireless networks of in-field sensing and irrigation control systems
    for real-time irrigation decision support by USDA-ARS, Northern Plains Agricultural
    Research Laboratory near Sidney, Mont. Materials and Methods Site-Specific Field
    Configuration Mapping of soil EC was used to provide a measure of the spatial
    variation of an experimental field so that a minimum number of in-field sensor
    systems could be placed with maximum impact for characterizing the scope of field
    information. The soil EC was used primarily as an indicator of water holding capacity
    as well as soil salinity. The distribution of the in-field sensing stations was
    determined from analysis of these maps (Kim et al. 2005). The apparent soil EC
    was mapped by a soil EC mapping system (3100, Veris Technologies, Salina, Kan.)
    at approximately 2.8 m ∕ s travel speed (a sample per second) using a 2.4 - m
    parallel swathing monitored with geo-referenced points using a differential GPS
    (Ag132, Trimble, Sunnyvale, Calif. with Omnistar correction) on an experimental
    field [Fig. 1(a)]. Geostatistical analysis was performed using geographic information
    system software (ArcGIS ver. 9.1, ESRI, Redlands, Calif.) with a Kriging model
    to interpolate data and create spatial maps with five classifications by a quantile
    method. Fig. 1(b) shows a WSN topology based on soil EC variations from 38.2 to
    128 mS ∕ m with five different zones. One sensing station was placed in each zone,
    and the five station numbers were labeled the same way as soil zone numbers in
    descending order of EC values. The map was converted into a mosaic map [Fig. 1(c)]
    by switching filled-contour to 6 × 15 grid using software (ArcGIS ver. 9.1, ESRI,
    Redlands, Calif.) to match the layout of the irrigation sprinkler banks which
    had total 15 groups of nozzle banks on five spans spaced 15 m ∕ bank and 3 banks/span.
    Four plot strips at the third, fourth, sixth, and ninth rows were used for the
    variable-rate irrigation. The rest of rows were treated as conventional irrigation
    with 100% water application. The 4th row in shade contained all five different
    soil zones and was used for a field test using catch cans. Fig. 1. Site-specific
    field configuration: (a) Veris soil electrical conductivity (EC) mapping system;
    (b) WSN topology of five classified zones based on soil EC map; and (c) mosaic
    map with 6 columns and 15 rows to match the irrigation sprinkler layout, where
    four rows were used for variable-rate irrigation and a shaded area at the fourth
    row was used for a field test using catch cans Wireless Sensor Network A distributed
    WSN was developed for real-time in-field soil sensing. The network consisted of
    five sensing stations and a weather station. Each of the sensing stations contained
    a data logger (CR10, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, Utah), two soil water reflectometers
    (CS616, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, Utah), horizontally one at the 30 cm
    and the other at the 61 - cm soil depth, and a soil temperature sensor (107, Campbell
    Scientific Inc., Logan, Utah) at the 15 - cm soil depth. The weather station measured
    precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction,
    and solar radiation. Sensors at the in-field sensing and weather stations were
    scanned every 10 s , and averaged data were stored and wirelessly transmitted
    every 15 min via a Bluetooth radio transmitter (SD202, Initium Co., Korea) back
    to a base computer. All components at each station are self-powered by a 12 -
    V battery recharged by a solar panel (SX5, Solarex, Sacramento, Calif.). The design
    for power management and wireless communication for the WSN was detailed by Kim
    et al. (2007b). Wireless Variable-Rate Irrigation A self-propelled Valley (Valmont
    Industries, Inc., Valley, Neb.) linear sprinkler irrigation system was used. Site-specific
    operation was controlled by a programmable logic controller (PLC) (S7-226, Siemens
    AG, Germany) located on the cart. The PLC managed the activation of electric over
    pneumatic solenoids to control 30 banks of 5–10 sprinklers each. Variable-rate
    applications were implemented by controlling the on/off times for groups of spray
    nozzles based on information from the site-specific field monitoring obtained
    by the WSN. As the linear sprinkler system moved across the field, a low-cost
    WAAS-enabled global positioning system (GPS) receiver (17-HVS, Garmin International
    Inc., Olathe, Kan.) mounted on the top of the linear cart continuously updated
    the position of the sprinkler nozzles. The GPS receiver was tied directly to the
    PLC controller, and a radio signal of the GPS position was continuously transmitted
    to the computer in a base station over the wireless link. The irrigation application
    depths were adjusted by pulsing sprinkler heads on and off to achieve a target
    depth based on a digital map of depths for each nozzle location as the machine
    moved down the field. Signal interface and software design for the PLC were detailed
    by Kim et al. (2006b). Two types of sprinkler heads were used: midelevation spray
    application (MESA) and low energy precision application (LEPA) (Evans and Iversen
    2005). MESA sprinkler heads were a spinning sprinkler (S3000, Nelson Irrigation
    Corp., Walla Walla, Wash.) with 103 kPa ( 15 psi ) regulators and wetted diameters
    ranging from 6 to 10 m and spaced every 32 m at about 1 m above the ground, where
    as LEPA heads were a bubble spray (Quad-Spray, Senninger Irrigation Corp., Clermont,
    Fla.) with 69 kPa ( 10 psi ) regulators and spaced every 1.2 m along submanifolds
    suspended from the truss rods at about 15 cm above the furrow surface. Nominal
    operating pressure of the pump was about 248 kPa ( 36 psi ). When LEPA sprinklers
    are turned off, the LEPA heads are pulled up by a pneumatic cylinder that is activated
    by the solenoid. Closed-Loop Irrigation Control A closed-loop irrigation control
    system was developed by integrating in-field sensor stations with the irrigation
    control station through a base computer station. Prior to inclusion in the closed-loop
    irrigation control system, each system component was independently tested and
    validated over the entire 2006 growing season. The base station wirelessly communicated
    with both the in-field sensing stations and the irrigation control station in
    real-time mode. It continuously received in-field sensory data to monitor soil
    water conditions. A decision support aid was developed on the base computer that
    determined when to irrigate and how much to apply to each of five classified zones.
    The base station was located about 700 m away from the field. A patch radio antenna
    was mounted on the east side of the rooftop and connected to a Bluetooth radio
    receiver (MSP-102a, Initium Co., Sungnam, Korea) inside the rooftop. The receiver
    was a multi-serial Bluetooth server and wired to a host computer via TCP/IP ethernet.
    A graphical user interface (GUI)-based irrigation software was developed and used
    for closed-loop irrigation control by integrating all input and output components
    of the system. The software allows real-time wireless communication with the PLC
    on the irrigation cart to receive GPS locations of the cart and send control signals
    for all sprinkler nozzle banks every second either automatically or manually after
    processing data for decision making. The software also allows a user to read an
    irrigation map at the beginning of the irrigation operation and save actual amount
    of water applied at each plot with GPS-referenced time and locations during the
    operation (Kim et al. 2007a). Sensor Calibrations The water content reflectometer
    was used to monitor soil water status. The reflectometer measures the volumetric
    water contents by using a time-domain reflectometry (TDR) method based on the
    dielectric constant of the soil (CS616, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, Utah).
    Two probe rods act as wave guides, and the dielectric constant of the soil surrounding
    the rods varies with the amount of water in the soil. The quality of soil moisture
    measurements is also affected by several other factors, such as soil electrical
    conductivity, clay content, and soil compaction, and thus the calibration has
    to be modified locally (Campbell Scientific Inc. 2004). The TDR sensors were calibrated
    with a neutron probe (N-probe) (503D Hydroprobe Moisture Gauge, CPN International,
    Inc., Martinez, Calif.) that measures soil water status (factory calibration)
    at six different soil depths (23, 46, 61,76, 91, and 107 cm ). Both TDR sensors
    and N-probe tubes were installed approximately 50 cm apart and monitored at five
    different locations on the soil EC field map (Fig. 1) during the 2006 growing
    season. A malting-barley (cv. Legacy) crop was planted on April 14 with 67 - kg
    ∕ ha nitrogen (N), 50 - kg ∕ ha phosphorus ( P 2 O 5 ) and 11 - kg ∕ ha potassium
    ( K 2 O ) , and harvested on August 3. The field soil is a Savage silty clay loam
    (fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Argiustolls) with 17% wilting point, 35% field
    water capacity, and 1.34 - g ∕ cm 3 bulk density. Measurements of the N-probe
    were conducted seven times (June 1, June 7, June 19, June 30, July 5, July 13,
    and July 18). Volumetric water contents of the TDR sensor were compared to the
    N-probe (factory calibration) at the 23 - cm (Table 1) 60 - cm soil depths. The
    TDRs were read every 15 min. , whereas the N-probe readings were measured about
    once a week. Data comparisons were made with the TDR readings measured at the
    same times as the N-probe readings. Table 1. Volumetric Water Content of the Time-Domain

    Fig. 2 illustrates volumetric water contents of both sensors at two soil depths
    at Station 1 under malting-barley and indicates a linear regression equation and
    correlation of the TDR and N probe. Linear regression analysis was repeated for
    the other four stations to derive calibration equations. Fig. 2. TDR sensor readings
    compared to the neutron probe readings at two soil depths at Station 1 in 2006.
    Sensors at other four stations repeat the regression analysis. Decision Making
    Irrigation decisions were made based on the closed-loop feedback of soil water
    status with depth from the TDR sensors at all five sensor stations. The calibrated
    TDR response to water supply of rain ( 9.93 cm ) and irrigation ( 6.63 cm ) is
    illustrated in Fig. 3 during the entire growing season of 2006 (May 1–July 27)
    on the malting-barley crop. Each TDR sensor showed a different response range
    from dry to wet soil conditions. For instance, the TDR sensor in 30 cm at Station
    1 has a response range of about 10% (varying from 27 to 37%), whereas the sensor
    in 61 cm has a response range of about 6% (varying from 29 to 35%), as shown in
    Fig. 3. High peaks on June 10 and June 27 were not included in the response range,
    because their readings were outliers caused by excessive amounts of water. Response
    ranges of sensors at the other four stations varied from a minimum of 3% to a
    maximum of 10%. The difference of the sensor’s response range was caused by different
    levels of soil EC, clay, compaction, and imperfect installation. The response
    range of each sensor was assumed to remain from 2006 to 2007 experiment, because
    each sensor was used in the same soil depth at the same soil EC zone over two
    years. A slight response offset is expected, however, if the sensor is reinstalled
    into a different spot even in the same depth and at the same soil EC zone. Fig.
    3. Volumetric water contents of the calibrated TDR sensors in two soil depths
    at Station 1 during the entire growing season of 2006 (May 1–July 27) on malting-barley
    crop The response range of each sensor was monitored during the 2007 experiment
    and adjusted with an offset observed from 2006 data. Fig. 4 illustrates the TDR
    response to water supply of rain ( 9.80 cm ) and irrigation ( 1.37 cm ) for early
    growing season of 2007 (May 1–27). Irrigation on May 18 was applied on all five
    stations at the same rate of 1.37 cm water. The TDR response ranges in 30 and
    61 cm show 4% (varying from 39 to 43%) and 7% (varying from 42 to 49%), respectively.
    As rain amount received for the month of May in 2007 was close to the total rain
    amount of the entire growing season of 2006, field soils were assumed to reach
    to the maximum wet condition, i.e., the upper limit of the response range. Thus,
    the highest reading of each TDR sensor at all five stations during May 2007 was
    selected for the upper limit of the response range and followed by the lower limit’s
    adjustment in order to keep the response range obtained in 2006, as shown in Table
    2. Fig. 4. Volumetric water contents of the calibrated TDR sensors in two soil
    depths at Station 1 during the early growing season of 2007 (May 1–27) on malting-barley

    The decision rule base for variable-rate irrigation was limited by a duty cycle
    of each sprinkler nozzle, i.e., on/off operations in a period of 60 s . For example,
    100% water application turns on the nozzle for a full 60 s , whereas 40% water
    application turns it on only for 24 s , turning it off for the remaining 36 s
    . The manually selected travel speed of the linear move sprinkler system determined
    the maximum application depth. The output of the percentage of nozzle operation
    was determined by the deficit of the current TDR reading from the upper limit
    value of the range of each sensor to apply a percentage of maximum. Because the
    lower limit of the range indicates the driest soil condition, the desired soil
    moisture condition is selected as above the midrange of each sensor. When the
    deficit at any of five stations first reaches its midrange, the irrigation is
    triggered to apply for 100% water application and accompanied with irrigation
    on the rest of zones proportionally applied according to the deficit of their
    sensors. If the deficit falls below the midrange, the irrigation controller sends
    a signal for 100% water, whereas no water is applied if it reaches to the maximum,
    i.e., the wettest soil condition. Experiments and Results The closed-loop irrigation
    control system was implemented and tested on an experimental field at the USDA-ARS-Northern
    Plains Agricultural Research Laboratory in Sidney, Mont. The 1.5 - ha field was
    laid out in 15 strips in the direction of travel. Each strip was planted to malting
    barley. There are a total of 90 plots with the individual plots being 15 m wide
    and 9 m long. Each strip was divided into six plots [Fig. 1(c)]. All plots were
    irrigated with MESA sprinklers and blocked for replication. Four catch cans were
    installed in the middle of each soil zone and aligned between two MESA sprinkler
    heads, spaced 3 m apart, and 0.8 m above the ground. Five sets of catch cans were
    installed across a strip that contained all five soil zones [Fig. 5(a)]. Each
    soil zone was labeled the same way as the station number and located at a plot
    numbered 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 from front to back in Fig. 5(a). The total of 30 sprinkler
    banks were individually controlled by wireless signals transmitted from the base
    computer. Wireless radio signal stability and individual nozzle controllability
    for all 30 sprinkler banks were tested in a manual mode and visually identified
    before irrigation for catch can study. There was about 1 s . time lag in response
    of the PLC from the base computer via Bluetooth wireless communication and additional
    maximum 3 s delay in nozzle activation due to hydraulic power transition. The
    amount of variable-rate irrigation was applied by the percentage of full irrigation
    based on the ratio of the real-time update of TDR volumetric water content to
    its half range ( = max –midpoint) of the sensor response at each soil zone (Table
    3). For instance, 52% of full ( 1 - cm ) irrigation in Zone 2 was calculated by
    subtracting a current TDR reading (44.4%) from the max point (47%) of the response
    range, then divided by its half response range ( 5 % = 47 - 42 % ) in Table 2.
    The experiment was to evaluate how the irrigation sprinklers perform sensor-based
    real-time wireless control throughout the irrigation operation. Fig. 5. Catch
    cans installed across a strip that contained all five soil zones and aligned between
    two MESA sprinkler heads. (a) Four cans were installed at each zone with 3 m apart
    and 0.8 m high. Each soil zone was located at a plot numbered 5, 6, 7, 9, and
    10 from front to back. (b) Catch can 4 was misplaced and affected by a neighboring
    sprinkler. Table 3. Variable-Rate Irrigation Amount Determined by the Feedback

    of the lateral. The linear cart moved from plot 5 to plot 10 at less than 1 m
    ∕ min speed for 1 - cm irrigation at average wind speed range of 2.7 – 7.1 km
    ∕ h and average wind direction of 187° (from south). South-neighboring sprinklers
    that were treated as conventional 100% water applications affected water distribution
    by wind drift and resulted in more water in south-side cans than north-side cans
    at all five zones, because the south-neighboring sprinklers (Fig. 1). Especially,
    Catch Can 4 was directly affected by the adjacent sprinkler, as shown in Fig.
    5(b). Thus, data from Catch Can 4 were not included in further calculations. Fig.
    6 shows catch can readings compared to irrigation amount after taking data at
    Catch Can 4. Catch can data were correlated to the amount of variable-rate irrigation
    with 0.96 r 2 value, though catch cans collected average 0.23 cm of more water
    out of 1 - cm irrigation, caused by the wind drift effect. Fig. 6. Catch can readings
    compared to irrigation amount at wind speed of 10 – 15 km ∕ h on June 6, 2007
    when the linear irrigation cart moved from Plots 5–10 Signal multipath of the
    GPS was observed five times when a GPS signal error occurred during the entire
    operation of 82 min from 9:46 to 11:08 a.m. Three errors were caused by signal
    bouncing at a plot boundary: once between Plots 5 and 6, and twice between Plots
    7 and 8. Two errors were signal loss or bouncing out of experimental plots. Each
    occurrence was a single signal bouncing and took only a second to return to a
    correct GPS position. As signal strength of the GPS is affected by atmosphere
    and cloud, this is not unusual. This 1 - s signal change is inactivated in 3 -
    s hydraulic delay and does not affect the irrigation rate. Conclusions An automated
    closed-loop irrigation control system was developed and tested with a self-propelled
    lateral-move sprinkler irrigation system that was set up for site-specific variable-rate
    water applications. Real-time wireless communications were seamlessly interfaced
    between in-field sensing stations, a variable-rate irrigation control station,
    and the base station by using Bluetooth radio technology. An experimental field
    was mapped and configured into five separate control zones based on soil electrical
    conductivity for the distribution of the wireless sensor network. Soil water sensors
    were individually calibrated within each zone with a neutron probe for 30- and
    61 - cm soil depths. Variable-rate irrigation was determined by feedback of soil
    water status from sensor stations. User-friendly software was developed to interface
    the base station with a PLC irrigation controller and wireless in-field sensor
    network for GUI-based real-time irrigation control and monitoring. The software
    tracks GPS locations of the irrigation cart and sends individual control signals
    to the 30 sets of sprinkler nozzle banks every second either automatically or
    manually on request. The irrigation sprinklers successfully followed real-time
    wireless control signals throughout the irrigation operation without interruptions
    in wireless radio communication. Catch can data were highly correlated to the
    water amount applied with r 2 = 0.96 . The benefit of the closed-loop control
    for a site-specific irrigation system with wireless sensor network will extend
    to automation of agrochemical applications. Although While this technology was
    developed on a linear move irrigation system, it was designed to also work with
    center pivots. The next step is to extend this technology to a grower’s field
    for their evaluation and testing. References Ahmad, I. S., Reid, J. F., Noguchi,

  description: 'Fertigation is an irrigation technology of integration of water and
    fertilizer, and has been widely used in micro-irrigation systems, because of uniform
    fertilization, high utilization of water and fertilizer, and effectively reducing
    the pollution of soil and environment. The venturi fertilizer injector has become
    one of the main means and important equipment to achieve fertigation due to its
    simple structure, economy, and practicability, but the liquid fertilizer concentration
    could not be easily adjusted automatically. In order to realize variable rate
    fertilization with a venturi fertilizer injector, a variable fertilizer apparatus
    based on PWM (pulse width modulation) technology has been developed, but the apparatus
    belongs to open-loop control from the perspective of automatic control, and its
    accuracy and stability is difficult to guarantee. Therefore, a closed-loop control
    automatic fertilizer-mixing device was developed to improve the liquid fertilizer
    concentration mixing accuracy and stability, by improving the structure of the
    variable fertilizer apparatus and adding a conductivity meter that was employed
    to feedback the real-time fertilizer solution concentration indirectly. The conductivity
    meter was designed based on a conductivity electrode, and a square signal whose
    amplitude is ±3.5 V was determined as the excitation signal of the conductivity
    meter through experiments, to weaken or even eliminate polarization effects and
    capacitance effects of the conductivity electrode in the measuring process. In
    order to further improve measuring accuracy, temperature compensation had been
    applied to the conductivity meter, the measuring range had been divided into several
    small-scale ranges which could be switched by a multiplexer ADG1408 controlled
    by a microcontroller, and the corresponding divider resistor and square signal
    frequency of each small scale range were determined by experiments. By comparison
    with a standard conductivity meter, whose model is sension 156, the effective
    measuring range of the conductivity meter designed was 0-12.64 mS/cm, and the
    conductivity meter designed was calibrated according to the data measured in the
    effective measuring range. It was known that the conductivity of the fertilizer
    solution measured by the conductivity meter has a significant linear relationship
    (the coefficient of determination R2 is 0.997) with the fertilizer solution concentration,
    based on conductivity testing of a series of different concentration fertilizer
    solutions prepared in the range of 0.1%-1.0%. In order to improve the control
    performance of the automatic fertilizer mixing device, a kind of control strategy
    of two-step regulating with coarse adjustment and fine adjustment was employed:
    first, the device adjusted the duty cycle of PWM for controlling the solenoid
    valve to mix fertilizer automatically, by calling the corresponding function based
    on the detected inlet water pressure; then the device uses a fuzzy control algorithm
    to regulate the duty cycle of PWM finely, according to the real-time fertilizer
    solution concentration measured by the designed conductivity meter, in order to
    make the mixed fertilizer concentration get close to the target concentration
    as much as possible. An actual test and verification had been undertaken for the
    fertilizer mixing device, and the results showed that the maximum error of the
    mixed fertilizer concentration was 0.04% and the response time of the control
    device for achieving steady-state was 7.8-10.4 s, and it is now known that the
    device can meet the requirements of practical application in agriculture.'

  explanation: This study introduces a closed-loop control mechanism for an automatic
    fertilizer mixing device, which plays a crucial role in ensuring system reliability.
    It utilizes a conductivity meter to measure fertilizer concentration in real-time,
    providing feedback for fine-tuning the mixture. This feedback loop enhances the
    accuracy and stability of the mixing process.

  description: Automated control systems in irrigation have in recent years made considerable
    progress, offering a wide range of new options. In this experiment, drip irrigation
    system automatically governed irrigation in accordance with a water level sensing
    system in the mini-pan with the help of evaporation. Data acquisition was performed
    by an electronic circuit, which processed data and then sent the data to the microcontroller
    (Pic16f877). In the system, a closed loop control system based on sensing water
    level in the mini-pan was used to activate irrigation, thereby the system started
    irrigation whenever water level in the mini-pan dropped to the set level. The
    performance of the automated system can be increased as the irrigation timing
    in the software is adjusted according to plant growth stages.

  description: Developing countries are facing scarcity in water resources due to
    inefficient water management practices. Current methods for water control are
    based on supply rather than demand. Due to the manual nature of the current system,
    there is a lot of wastage of water and human error often results in flooding of
    the fields. Water theft is an additional problem in the developing countries.
    This paper aims to control water level in irrigation channels especially in the
    context of Pakistan's irrigation network and proposes an appropriate demand response
    solution, catering to the needs of the end user. To achieve this purpose, a Gate
    Automation & Control Module (GACM) has been designed and implemented. The module
    is a deployable and scalable solution that can be coupled with any of the existing
    canal gates to regulate downstream water level with minimum involvement of active
    labor. Experimental results for water level setpoint control at Khaira Distributary
    off Main BRB Canal, Lahore are added to validate the usefulness of GACM.

  explanation: This study addresses the concept of closed-loop control in autonomous
    irrigation systems by implementing a low-cost, locally-made Gate Automation &
    Control Module (GACM) on an irrigation channel in the Indus River Basin. The GACM,
    which consists of an actuator, a driving circuit, a microcontroller, a communication
    module, and sensors, can be independently coupled with any canal gate to regulate
    water flow. The study demonstrates successful closed-loop control using an on-off
    control strategy, showcasing the potential for advanced control algorithms to
    enhance the efficiency of irrigation systems.

    Metrics Abstract: Developing countries are facing scarcity in water resources
    due to inefficient water management practices. Current methods for water control
    are based on supply rather than demand. Due to the manual nature of the current
    system, there is a lot of wastage of water and human error often results in flooding
    of the fields. Water theft is an additional problem in the developing countries.
    This paper aims to control water level in irrigation channels especially in the
    context of Pakistan''s irrigation network and proposes an appropriate demand response
    solution, catering to the needs of the end user. To achieve this purpose, a Gate
    Automation & Control Module (GACM) has been designed and implemented. The module
    is a deployable and scalable solution that can be coupled with any of the existing
    canal gates to regulate downstream water level with minimum involvement of active
    labor. Experimental results for water level setpoint control at Khaira Distributary
    off Main BRB Canal, Lahore are added to validate the usefulness of GACM. Published

    Islamabad, Pakistan SECTION I. Introduction Pakistan has the largest congruous
    canal network in the world, running for over 90,000 km and irrigating a total
    area of approximately 36 million acres [1]. Currently, primitive methods are being
    used to regulate the system which results in water wastage, disputes due to unequal
    distribution and difficulty in management of water resources [2], [3]. In order
    to ensure all the aforementioned problems are addressed, there is a dire need
    to revisit the deployed water resources and make them function more efficiently.
    This efficient operation can be achieved by engineering Cyber Physical Systems
    (CPS) and feedback control strategies through the use of automation and decision
    support systems [1, 4–6]. The feasibility study for envisioning the canal irrigation
    system as a “smart water grid” and converting it to a fully automated CPS has
    been done by the authors'' group in [1], [7]. In recent years, some implementations
    of automation and control on actual canals have been reported in Australia [8],
    US [9] and Spain [10]. This paper demonstrates canal automation and control in
    the context of a developing country, for instance, Pakistan where the incomparably
    large scales of deployment and general economic constraints demand highly cost-effective
    and robust solutions. Over the last 4 years, the authors'' group has collaborated
    with federal and provincial irrigation departments to achieve closed loop control
    of an irrigation canal in the Indus River Basin. The ultimate goal of our work
    is to transform Pakistan''s irrigation network into a fully automated system with
    mechanized gates, operated remotely from a central server through supervisory
    control for high-level setpoint regulation and individual localized control at
    each hydraulic gate structure to achieve real-time demand of water. Over the years,
    the authors'' group has been engaged in various aspects of this work including
    modelling [7], system identification [11], development of sensors [12], [13] and
    actuator hardware culminating in the actual field implementation of feedback control.
    This paper focuses on the actuator hardware, referred as Gate Automation & Control
    Module (GACM), and its effectiveness for achieving local control on Khaira Distributary
    off Main BRB Canal in the Indus River Basin. Our work is significant in a number
    of ways. Firstly, this work is the first indigenous attempt at hardware implementation
    of achieving local control in Pakistan. Secondly, the GACM design is low-cost
    solution, fabricated from locally sourced materials and scalable-in-design to
    ensure the option of large scale deployment anywhere in a developing world setting.
    Thirdly, though this paper presents setpoint control results using the on-off
    strategy, the module is a complete test-bed that can be used for programming advanced
    control methods through the on-board microcontroller. The rest of the paper is
    organized as follows: Section II presents the hardware and software implementation
    of the Gate Automation & Control Module with components'' cost given in section
    0. Experimental results are presented in section III. Conclusions are drawn in
    the final section IV with some mention of future work. SECTION II. Implementation
    In order to understand the importance of this work, it is necessary to look at
    the salient differences between the open loop control and the closed loop control
    in context of irrigation setup of Pakistan. Pakistan has a hierarchical irrigation
    structure in which the current methods of control include water accords (provincial
    or international), canal command systems and farmer water rights via formal and
    informal institutions. Moreover, a warabandi system, introduced before the country''s
    inception, is still common in parts of Punjab and Sindh [1]. Literally meaning
    ‘turn fixation’, it is an institutionalized framework where water is allocated
    fairly on a turn-base to different land owners. In this system, an irrigation
    agency manages the primary source and delivers water to the outlet of a minor
    canal called the mogha. These moghas are opened and closed manually on a fixed
    schedule. The warabandi system works on the basis of the mutual agreement of farmers
    among themselves and the government irrigation department. This supply-driven
    setup is highly inefficient, prone to occasional floods and results in tremendous
    amount of water wastages due to the absence of automated feedback information
    relayed back to the control source. Fig. 1: System block diagram Show All In contrast
    to the open loop setup, closed loop control of the irrigation system has the potential
    to meet precise water demands in real-time as per the requirements of the farmers.
    In order to achieve this purpose, automated canal gates are a necessity which
    can communicate with the feedback sensors to ensure timely and appropriate response
    depending on the water requirements of the end-users. This paper aims to demonstrate
    closed-loop control by development and deployment of GACM at Khaira Distribuary
    to achieve local setpoint. The block diagram for the system is shown in Fig. 1
    where h d and h a are the desired and actual gate heights and y d and y a are
    the water level setpoint and actual downstream water level respectively. The distant
    downstream control method has been chosen in which the upstream hydraulic gate
    is used to regulate the downstream water level of the pool (shown in Fig. 2).
    The desired downstream water level is referred to as the setpoint and the output
    of the irrigation channel is the actual downstream water level. Through a smart
    water meter, the water level is measured and communicated to the GACM (discussed
    in subsection II.A). The controller embedded in the module circuitry computes
    the desired gate height needed as the input to the irrigation channel. The actuator
    in this case is the motor coupled through a gear with the gate. The desired gate
    height is achieved through feedback using proximity sensor which is then the input
    to the physical channel and that determines the response of the water. A. Gate
    Automation & Control Module (GACM) Fig. 2: Side-view sketch of khaira distributary
    Show All Fig. 3: Undershot hydraulic gate operated manually Show All An important
    part of this project has been designing a functional prototype of the Gate Automation
    & Control Module. This module is a fundamental component of this project as the
    canal gates are manually operated currently as shown in Fig. 3. Our module operates
    electronically and provides the capability to regulate the gate height. This automated
    control of flow of water is more reliable than the manual control. Moreover, our
    designed functional prototype is ‘plug and play’ - it can be deployed independently
    on any canal gate mechanism to provide a demand-driven system. There is also embedded
    communication infrastructure in the module to regulate water flow via remote means
    and on real time basis. Fig. 4 presents the architecture of GACM. The module consists
    of an actuator in the form of a motor coupled to a worm gear, a driving circuit,
    a microcontroller which generates signals for the driving circuit and is interfaced
    with GSM communication block and a proximity sensor. All of these components are
    individually explained in the subsections II.A.1-5. All the components are fitted
    in a custom-made wrought iron box to protect them from any weather conditions
    as well as to prevent any tampering. The GACM in an adjustable platform whose
    height can be varied to the nearest millimeter because of adjustable bearings
    attached to the base to allow for easy coupling to any canal gate. These bearings
    also reduce the mechanical vibrations of the box while the motor is running. GACM
    is shown in Fig. 5. 1. Actuator A 3.75HP Permanent Magnet DC Motor has been chosen
    as part of the module which is coupled to a 1: 30 worm gear to get the required
    torque at the shaft which is then coupled to the canal gate for testing purposes.
    The choice of DC motor instead of AC machine can be justified in the context of
    developing world in terms of cost-effectiveness and scalability. Generally, AC
    motors are 3 phase induction machines requiring a 3 phase supply not necessarily
    available in most of the canal network of indus Basin. Whereas, a single phase
    AC supply (that can be rectified to operate DC motor) is almost always present
    near canal gates. Fig. 4: Gate automation & control module architecture Show All
    Fig. 5: Gate automation & control module Show All 2. Driving Circuit To drive
    the actuator a high power H-Bridge circuit has been designed. The DC rail is established
    using a bridge rectifier KBPC3510W. These magnetic contactors are controlled through
    JQC-3F 5V relays. ArduinoMEGA 2560 has been used as the μ -controller. As the
    ArduinoMEGA cannot provide large current, relays are controlled through bipolar
    transistors (TIP 122) which provide the current path to relays for turn-on. This
    3 layered control provides protection to the control circuit. The driving circuit
    schematic is shown in Fig. 6. Some additional features have been added for protection,
    for instance, optocouplers for electrical isolation between the control and the
    power circuit (not shown in the figure) and anti-parallel diodes with relays to
    prevent voltage spikes. Furthermore, an antiparallel diode serially connected
    with a relay has been added in parallel to the motor in each direction to allow
    for back EMF protection. Each of these is turned on to stop the motor in each
    direction by providing a cushion time. Fig. 6: Driving circuit schematic Show
    All Fig. 7: GSM communication hardware Show All 3. Communication For communication
    purposes, a SIM900D GSM/GPRS Module has been installed in GACM. The SIM900D is
    a complete Quad-band GSM/GPRS that features an industry standard surface and has
    the options to transmit data with low power consumption. As the irrigation channel
    is a slow dynamical system, it does not impose any strict time limitations on
    feedback control, essentially making the use of GSM appropriate for this case.
    Considering the wide availability of GSM networks and the relatively cheap SMS
    rates in Pakistan (average cellular data charges cost less than US$1 per month),
    all communication with the downstream water sensors is done via SMS alone. RX/TX
    pins of ArduinoMEGA are used for serial communication between ArduinoMEGA and
    the GSM Module. The GSM communication hardware, shown in Fig. 7, is capable of
    receiving, reading, deleting and sending a message. During the field testing,
    this module receives readings from downstream smart water meters and these messages
    are retrieved by the ArduinoMEGA using the AT command set. Furthermore, a safety
    feature allows the controller to read messages only from specified numbers to
    eliminate any possibility of misuse. Fig. 8: Smart water meter Show All 4. Sensors
    Two sensors are needed to achieve feedback control in our implementation; smart
    water meter records the downstream water level and proximity sensor is used to
    measure the movement of the canal gate. Each of these two is discussed below in
    sections II.A.4.a and b. a. Smart Water Meter Built by the authors'' group, smart
    water meter, shown in Fig. 8, is a sensor highly suitable for measurement of water
    level in the canals and distributaries of the Indus River Basin. The measurement
    technique is based on ultrasound compared to the conventional mechanical floats
    or pressure transducers usually reported in literature. This sensor records gate
    height and transmit these readings via GSM. The sensor is highly accurate, robust
    and weather proof and even compensated for changes in speed of sound in weather
    exposed conditions. Additionally, the sensor requires minimal level of power and
    can work continuously for months without the need for battery replacement. More
    information regarding this sensor can be found in [12], [13]. b. Proximity Sensor
    To achieve position control of the hydraulic gate, an inductive proximity sensor
    is installed inside the GACM which provides the actual gate height based on revolutions
    of the shaft. Instead of using an external sensor for gate height, this indirect
    way of measurement avoids incurring modifications costs to the canal gate infrastructure.
    The sensor has a range of 15mm with sensitivity bias of ±2mm . 5. Microcontroller
    ArduinoMEGA 2560 has been used to generate control signals for the actuator, retrieve
    signals from the smart water meter and the encoder. ArduinoMEGA 2560 is microcontroller
    board with 54 digital IO pins with the option to use 14 of them as PWM outputs,
    16 analog inputs, 4 UARTs and a USB connection for powering/data-logging. For
    communication diagnostics, free Arduino plug-in “Gobetwino v0.5” has been utilized.
    Additionally, Arduino allows multi-tasking which is the primary reason for its
    selection. As GACM needs to perform various functions simultaneously, for example,
    GSM communication, gate position recording, control commands generation and data-logging,
    it needs to have real-time capability which ensures that every task is completed
    in a timely manner. To achieve this purpose, a scheduler has been implemented
    in ArduinoMEGA to perform multi-tasking. “Timer.h” library of ArduinoMEGA allows
    allocation of a time period to every task which is set according to the task frequency
    and its priority in the list. This real-time functionality ensures that control
    commands are appropriately addressed in a timely manner through the actuator without
    skipping any valuable data for logging. Fig. 9: Khaira distributary aerial view

    of large scale deployment of this module, the costs are significantly reduced

    III. Experimental Setup & Results This section reports the experimental setup
    and the results obtained from the closed-loop control experiment conducted on
    the Khaira Distributary using an on-off control strategy in April 2014. Khaira
    Distributary is part of the Bambawali Ravi Bedian (BRB) Canal located 23km away
    from Lahore University of Management Sciences campus. The aerial view of the distributary
    using Google Earth is shown in Fig. 9 with the location of the hydraulic gate,
    GACM and the smart water meter marked for clarity. The irrigation channel is 87000
    feet long, 10 feet wide and has a maximum depth of 4 feet. Fig. 10a shows the
    GACM coupled with the gate and operating independently without any manual control
    involved. Fig. 10b shows the smart water meter installed 360m downstream from
    the GACM and hydraulic gate. It is important to note here that usually multiple
    gates exist at the upstream end in the canals. In our experimental setup, there
    were two gates at the head (a similar gate exists adjacent to the gate shown in
    Fig. 3) but since one GACM is required per gate, the other gate was kept closed
    throughout the experiment. Therefore, in future experiments, multiple GACMs will
    be required to coordinate the movement of multiple gates on each head. The experiment
    was initiated when a setpoint for the desired downstream water level y d of 375
    mm was sent via a text message and the relevant values were recorded for a duration
    of about 2 hours. Fig. 11, Fig. 12 and Fig. 13 represent the complete results
    of the closed-loop control experiment. The horizontal axis of the figures shows
    the time in hours and the vertical axis is a measure of water and/or gate height
    in millimeters. Fig. 11 shows a comparison of the desired gate height h d (green
    line) and actual gate height h a (red line). The gate is initially closed since
    the current water-level is higher than the setpoint (375 mm). Based on difference
    between the downstream water-level values y a and setpoint y d , the gate opens
    and closes to regulate the water level. It can be seen that h a closely follows
    h d throughout the experiment. As the actuator has its own dynamics, the gate
    cannot be moved instantaneously to the desired gate height dictated by the controller
    and a finite amount of time is needed to achieve that height. Fig. 12 shows a
    comparison of the setpoint/desired downstream water level y d (black dotted line)
    and actual downstream water level y a (blue line) at 360 meters. The water-level
    oscillates about the reference value showing closed-loop control is achieved.
    As the measurement is done at 360 m, there is a time delay of about 270s for the
    water wave to reach the smart water meter. Note also that the water-level rises
    more rapidly than it decays due to the nature of the irrigation channel. The time
    delay and the smaller time constant for the rise contribute to the fact that the
    actual water level remains above the setpoint water level for a greater time than
    it stays below. Fig. 13 is an overlap of Fig. 11 and Fig. 12, and helps to provide
    a complete picture. Smart water meter continuously transmits downstream water
    level y a to GACM via GSM, and whenever y a is greater or lesser than y d (setpoint),
    the controller gives a command to close or open the hydraulic gate respectively.
    The set-point is achieved which shows a successful demonstration of closed-loop
    control. Two features of Fig. 13 need to be highlighted. Firstly, controller does
    not give command to open the gate until after the water level is at least 30mm
    below the reference value. This buffer was a necessary feature to eliminate unnecessary
    actuator movements due to noise and conserve energy. Secondly, though a successful
    closed-loop control is achieved using an on-off strategy, the actual water level
    stays about 70% above the reference value indicating that more advanced control
    algorithm might yield better result. Fig. 11: Comparison of desired and actual
    gate movement Show All Fig. 12: Comparison of setpoint and downstream water level
    Show All SECTION IV. Conclusion & Future Work The work has obtained encouraging
    results. It has been successful in its aim to demonstrate an autonomous closed-loop
    control of an irrigation channel in the Indus River Basin. This has mainly been
    achieved by the design and hardware implementation of a low-cost, scalable and
    locally-made Gate Automation & Control Module (GACM). With its plug-and-play capability
    to operate independently and its usefulness validated by experimental results,
    this work promises to act as a blue-print to develop closed-loop control across
    irrigation network in any developing country such as Pakistan. Future work on
    the project involves testing/experimenting various other control strategies on
    site, for instance, decentralized PI, predictive control and centralized control
    from a server. Fig. 13: On-off control on khaira distributary Show All ACKNOWLEDGMENT

  description: A closed loop irrigation system is demonstrated that fully automates
    the delivery of irrigation and calculates the water requirement from satellite
    images. The system optimizes water delivery for 140 cells located across four
    hectares of land based on two independent objectives (e.g., maximizing yield and
    increasing water efficiency) and is continuously adapting irrigation scheduling
    to the local spatial-temporal variability of the vegetation across the growing
    season. Irrigation is controlled by a central computer that issues commands to
    693 control nodes to start irrigation based on the analysis of satellite images.
    The control nodes are laid out to create 15 m \times15 m cells and each cell can
    be addressed independently and can irrigate differentially. After two years of
    operation, this variable rate drip irrigation approach resulted in a 26% yield
    increase in the second year and an average increase of 16% in water use efficiency.
    This paper demonstrates that combining closed loop automation and advanced irrigation
    analytics can improve the water use efficiency and increase the yield on existing
    agricultural lands.

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Digitization of the physical
    world is fundamentally changing the industries fueled by sensor networks, automation,
    and robotization [1]. Sensor-based decision support or automated infrastructure
    control can minimize manual intervention. In agriculture, data driven decisions
    can enable a sustainable use of water, land utilization, and chemicals control
    through optimized analytics [2]. Platforms that fuse sensor network data with
    automatic control can lead to dynamic operation that adapts to the environment
    in real-time as new data becomes available to the system. One important application
    in agriculture is irrigation, which can be controlled by sensor networks and automate
    the operation of the water delivery systems. Despite continuous advancement in
    control systems, irrigation is mostly a manual process using traditional practices.
    Many of the high value crops in California, such as grapes, are drip irrigated
    with water usually applied uniformly across larger parcels or blocks of land.
    This often results in nonoptimized delivery of water, fertilizers, and pesticides.
    For example, intrafield soil water holding capacity can fluctuate significantly,
    often translating into as much as fivefold yield differences across less than
    a few meter distance [3]. To overcome such variability, management zones can be
    defined, where each zone may have similar yield or vigor characteristics (for
    grapes) and can be managed accordingly. Minimizing yield variability [4] through
    differential management [5] has been proposed in the past. Variable rate management
    in vineyards has been proposed both in USA [6] and in Australia [7] but only relying
    on post-harvest analysis. Management zones have been delineated based on soil
    [8], vegetation index [9], or using fuzzy logic clustering techniques [10]. While
    defining management zones is a well-established technique, active control of variable
    rate management is still not fully developed. In the past, sensor networks have
    been deployed in vineyard settings [11] at various levels of sophistication. Most
    of the application attempted a better monitoring of the micro environmental conditions
    in the vineyards thereby providing a more granular feedback to vineyard workers
    [12]. Here, we present a large-scale demonstration of a variable rate drip irrigation
    system that takes advantage of a close loop control system to deliver the right
    amount of water through an automated system. Using this new variable drip irrigation
    technology, the applied water amount can be optimized dynamically. Ultimately,
    it is envisioned that such a system can be designed to deliver the optimum amount
    of water to each plant. Delivery of water to each management zone requires timely
    analytics to determine irrigation requirements, to transmit the irrigation schedule
    to a control computer, and to automate control of the drip irrigation infrastructure
    to dispense the optimum amount of water. In this paper, we show that a variable
    rate automatic irrigation system coupled with satellite derived irrigation scheduling
    analytics can result in: 1) increased yield uniformity and 2) reversal of the
    yield trends by increasing the yield on the originally low yield areas and limiting
    the yield on the originally high yield areas. The advantage of a variable rate
    irrigation system is the increased yield on existing farm land without the need
    to convert additional land to agricultural use. The efficient use of technology
    not only can increase the yield on existing farm land but also promises to manage
    more efficiently resources like water and fertilizer. To the best of our knowledge,
    this paper constitutes the first and largest closed loop drip irrigation system
    that directly couples remote observations with an automated dense sensor network
    that is operated from the cloud. Not only the drip irrigation in our approach
    is fully automated but at the same time this system results in significant water
    savings while improving yield. SECTION II. Sensor Network A. System Architecture
    The experiment is conducted on a 20-year-old, 12.4 hectare, drip irrigated Cabernet
    Sauvignon vineyard near Galt, CA, USA. A four hectare section of the vineyard
    containing the full range of yields, as reported by the 2012 yield map, is selected
    for the closed loop irrigation system. The irrigation system is changed from a
    single drip line to a double drip-line variable irrigation system with centrally
    controlled irrigation sensor network. The control system allows differential irrigation
    along segments of 15 m. A 15 m ×15 m area defined as “the irrigation control cell”
    is the basic unit of control where the water delivery within that area can be
    independently controlled (Fig. 1). The experimental area, called “Precision,”
    is composed of 140 of such independent cells where cells are grouped in two sections
    “Yield maximizing section” and “Water efficiency section.” These two differently
    managed sections have different objective functions: 1) maximize the yield and
    2) increase water use efficiency. The area is monitored using satellite imagery
    that constitutes the input for irrigation requirement analytics. Besides monitoring
    the area, the closed loop system runs the analytics to determine the irrigation
    water requirement and controls the irrigation infrastructure to dispense the water.
    The analytics output is transmitted to a sensor network that dispense the water
    accordingly. The irrigation schedule is sent weekly to the irrigation system,
    where the computer splits the schedule for 6 or 7 days irrigation and issues commands
    to the management zones. The outcome of the differential irrigation is monitored
    by the next satellite imagery that will indicate if expected change occurred and
    the irrigation water schedule is readjusted based on the new satellite images.
    An adjacent area, called “Conventional” area, having similar yield characteristics
    and soil composition as the Precision area in 2012, is uniformly irrigated to
    serve as a reference area. The closed loop irrigation system is automatically
    operated with minimal human input. We note that domain expertise related to adjustment
    in grape sugar content is required to be added to the irrigation schedule calculations.
    Additional data layers like high resolution drone or thermal images of the vineyard
    can be added to the analytics for monitoring canopy stresses that may not be detectable
    from satellite images. Fig. 1. (a) Schematic architecture of the closed control
    loop irrigation system driven by satellite imagery. (b) Precision irrigation area
    composed of water efficiency and yield maximizing sections. Show All B. Variable
    Rate Irrigation Infrastructure For the variable rate infrastructure, the original
    single drip irrigation line is divided into a double drip line system consisting
    of a water supply line and an irrigation line and segmented into 15 m sections
    [Fig. 2(a)]. The supply line is always filled with water and is connected to the
    main water supply. The irrigation line can be filled once the solenoid valve is
    opened and the water is allowed to flow into that segment. The irrigation line
    has emitters installed that will let water drip and irrigate the soil. The supply
    and irrigation line are connected at each 15 m through a control node that allows
    water to be diverted from the supply line to the irrigation line. The control
    nodes consist of a solenoid valve, a controller, and a check valve. The controller
    issues the command to open/close the solenoid valve and allows water to flow into
    the segment, while the check valve impedes water to fill the previous management
    segment. There is a power and communication line that runs along the supply line
    and connects each control node to a central control point. The controller nodes
    are installed at the edge of an area that establishes a one-to-one correspondence
    between the information extracted from a parcel of land (via satellite imagery
    and/or ground-based sensors) and a management area. We chose a 15 m ×15 m control
    cell dimension, higher than the original Landsat [13] pixel resolution (30 m ×30
    m), which was used in this paper. The original 30 m ×30 m Landsat pixels are interpolated
    to 15 m ×15 m pixel size using pan sharpening and aligned exactly with the experimental
    15 m ×15 m cells [Fig. 2(b)]. We note that managing vineyard at higher resolution
    than the satellite images did not provide any benefit as discussed in Section
    IV, as there is an optimal size for the control cells. Fig. 2. (a) Double drip
    line composed of supply and irrigation lines connected through the control nodes
    that operate the solenoid valve. (b) Details of an irrigation control cell that
    groups 5 double drip lines and its spatial alignment with a Landsat satellite
    image pixel. Show All The control nodes are 15 m apart along each irrigation line
    segment (covering 10 vines) and the irrigation lines (and vine rows) are 3.3 m
    apart. Alternating, 4 or 5 control nodes are therefore lumped together to define
    each “irrigation control cell,” which covers on average an area of 15 m ×15 m
    [Fig. 2(a)]. Since the vine rows could not be perfectly aligned with satellite
    pixel resolution, the number of rows entering in a cell is varied between 4 and
    5 to create the digital footprint of satellite images on the irrigation system
    [Fig. 2(b)]. There are a total of 140 independent control cells, with 40 or 50
    vines in each of the cells distributed across the four hectare area with a total
    of 693 control nodes (Fig. 3). Fig. 3. Photograph of the interior and controller
    box that operated the solenoid valve and the installed sensor network in the vineyard.
    Show All The irrigation schedule is managed by a central computer that issues
    the command to the local microcontroller that operates the solenoid valves to
    keep it open for the required amount of time. The amount of irrigation water dispensed
    is controlled by the time interval the solenoid valve is kept open and water drips
    through the drip emitters mounted on the irrigation line. Time synchronization
    between the local microcontroller and the central computer is carried out once
    per day. In addition to actuating (open/close) the solenoid valve, each node keeps
    track of the time the valve is open and reports back to the control computer which
    aggregates the data and runs background calculations to verify that the system
    operates as expected. C. Sensor Communication The experimental area is divided
    in 14 subnets where each subnet contains 4 or 5 rows of grape rows. Along each
    subnet there are ten irrigation control cells. Each subnet is controlled by a
    gateway that receives and transmits the data from the central computer to the
    40 or 50 control nodes [Fig. 4(a)] within that subnet. The central computer is
    distributing the irrigation schedule to the gateways and each gateway sends commands
    to individual control nodes under its command. The schematic of the message stack
    protocol for communicating is shown in Fig. 4(b). A command message is encapsulated
    in a queue stack. Each header contained a destination node address and a function
    code; the address field is 8 bits, the function code is 8 bits, and the check-sum
    is a 16 bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) (see Fig. 4(b)-A). A specific example
    is shown in Fig. 4(b)-B, where the central computer communicates with a selected
    control node via a selected gateway. There are three required steps to get the
    message from the central computer to a selected control node and an additional
    three steps to send back an acknowledgment from the control node to the central
    computer. First, the central computer sends the message to a selected gateway.
    Second, the gateway, based on a “forwarding” function code, moves the first fixed
    length header to the trailer space in the message and transmits the new message
    (Fig. 4(b)-C) simultaneously to all nodes in the subnet. The node for which the
    message is intended will recognize its unique address in the message. Once the
    control node performs the requested operation (e.g., open valve), it rewrites
    the data section leaving the header and trailer intact. As the central computer
    expects a response, the control node prepares the stack to be sent back. The control
    node transmits the response message to the gateway. The gateway processes the
    message by moving the first trailer (before the CRC) to the header and transmits
    the new message to the central computer. The central computer, expecting a response,
    processes the result and acknowledges that the message is successfully delivered
    to the control node. The transmitted command can be the irrigation requirements
    (number of minutes that the irrigation line needs to be filled with water) or
    just open/close commands at the beginning and end of the day to bring all control
    nodes into the same state. Each subnet includes a flow meter that measures the
    water consumption for the whole subnet. In each subnet there are 40 or 50 control
    boxes that are connected by serial bus communication wires to each gateway. At
    the end of the rows, wires that crossed rows, are buried underground. The communication
    line did not exceeds 1500 m as this value is tested to constitute the upper limit
    for signal integrity using RS485 communications. Irrigation of the 140 control
    cells is enabled by daily continuous communication with all 693 control nodes,
    where each node is uniquely identified (addressed) by a source routing technique
    that specifies a specific gateway-node pair. Fig. 4. (a) Schematics of the communication
    network between the central computer and control nodes composed of 14 subnets
    and 140 irrigation control cells. (b) Data communication stack and communication
    protocols between the central computer and control nodes. Show All A cellular
    link connects the central computer to the cloud-based analytics, allowing downloading
    irrigation schedules and remote diagnostics. A message notification system is
    implemented that alerts valve’s malfunctioning or nonintended water usage. The
    power lines extend to all control nodes and is fanned out at the start of each
    row. The power distribution system is optimized to maintain 12 V along each line
    such that controllers located farthest from the gateway can open/close the solenoid
    valves under normal operating conditions. While the current implementation is
    based on wired control, a wireless communication method had been prototyped and
    tested as a next generation system. For the wireless option, the power harvesting
    from solar panels required for operation could not be achieved due to the dense
    canopy and panel placement limitations dictated by daily maintenance work on the
    farm. D. Irrigation Requirement Analytics Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 imagery obtained
    from the U.S. Geological Survey [14] provides reflectance data in eight different
    spectral bands every 16 days (alternating by 8 days for each satellite). The vineyard
    investigated in this paper is on the overlapping section of path 43 row 34 and
    path 44 row 33 for Landsat 7 and 8, respectively, which provides a satellite observation
    every eight days. Two of these spectral bands, the red (0.64–0.67 micrometer)
    and the near infrared (0.77–0.90 micrometer) are sensitive to vineyard canopy
    development [15] and are used to determine the NDVI [16] NDVI= NIR−RED NIR+RED
    (1) View Source where RED and NIR are the red and near infrared intensity values
    for each pixel in the image. The NDVI value varies between 0 and 1. Its value
    changes as the canopy develops through the growing season and its spatial distribution
    across a vineyard reflects the variability in vigor and ultimately the water holding
    capacity of the soil. All satellite images are corrected for atmosphere induced
    scattering [17]. The amount of water delivered to each cell is then calculated
    from the NDVI and the water loss due to evapo-transpiration (ET0) using the Penman–Monteith
    equation [18]. The daily weather inputs (insolation, wind, temperature, and relative
    humidity) are obtained from the nearest California Irrigation Management Information
    System weather station (Fair Oaks, CA, USA) [19] to calculate the reference evapo-transpiration
    (ET0). The amount of water that is scheduled for irrigation ET cb (in mm day−1)
    is then calculated from the reference evapo-transpiration (ET0) [20] and adjusted
    for grapes using the basal crop coefficient ( k cb ) which serves as an aggregated
    coefficient of the physical and physiological characteristics of the plant [20].
    A management factor, f , is included that can adjust the water delivered to each
    of the irrigation control cell ET cb =f⋅ k cb ⋅ ET 0 . (2) View Source The basal
    crop coefficient, k cb , is calculated from the Mapping Evapo-Transpiration at
    High Resolution with Internalized Calibration model [21], [22] using the NDVI
    value for each cell. The basal crop coefficient can be obtained by subtracting
    the soil heat flux and sensible heat flux from the net radiation at the surface
    [22]. In case the Landsat data is obscured by clouds, the NDVI values are extrapolated
    using historical reflectance data from the same plot of the vineyard. The irrigation
    schedule for each cell is based on (2), with the value of management factor, f
    , varied from 0.5 for the first eight weeks of irrigation up to 0.75 during the
    rest of the season in 2013. In 2014, the management factor, f , is 0.5 for the
    first five weeks and then increased to 0.7 for the rest of the season. The management
    factor, f , is used to apply moderate water stress to the vines and improve fruit
    quality and to increase yield in low vigor area. The management factor is a parameter
    that can be changed and it can incorporate domain knowledge or management practices
    on the farm. The evapo-transpiration is calculated for the following week based
    on real-time weather data. The irrigation schedule for individual control cells
    is calculated using the NDVI value and ET cb taking into account the number of
    drippers for each zone and dripper specifications (i.e., 1.89 l h−1). Irrigation
    schedules are generated on a weekly basis for each zone and transmitted to the
    central control computer. Once a schedule is uploaded to the computer, it reads
    the zone number and number of hours per day that needs to enable the irrigation
    and issue a command to the control node containing the solenoid valve to open
    and allow water in the irrigation line for the required time interval. Once the
    required irrigation time passes, the central computer issue a command to close
    the solenoid valve. E. Variable Rate Management Zone Delineation Based on the
    2012 yield map, irrigation control cells that had a yield value below 20 tonnes
    hectare−1 and low NDVI value are grouped in two management zones: 1) the yield
    maximizing zones and 2) the water efficiency zones. The yield maximizing zones
    has low yield in 2012 and water is used to increase in that zone. The water efficiency
    area is targeted to minimize the water consumption. We note that there could be
    other objectives that can be implemented; e.g., reduce NDVI variability, reduce
    variability in grape quality, or minimize fertilizer use. Many objectives can
    be tied to delineate zones based on spectral indices like NDVI that is readily
    available even for farm where historical yield or soil data may not exist. F.
    Yield Analysis Methods Crop yield maps are used to establish grape production
    variability [23], [24]. Crop yield maps are measured in 2012, 2013, and 2014 using
    the Advanced Technology Viticulture (ATV, Joslin, SA, Australia) yield monitor
    systems installed on three self-propelled, over-the-row, trunk-shaking mechanical
    GH9000 AIM harvesters (Ag Industrial Manufacturing, Lodi, CA, USA). The yield
    monitors included a differential global positioning system, a grape weighing unit
    and a data recording system. The grape weighing unit contains a load cell weight
    bridge and a belt speed sensor. Geo-referencing is realized by simultaneously
    logging the coordinates and synchronizing them with the weight measurements. The
    data is transferred to a computer and accessed using proprietary software from
    ATV. Belt scales are zeroed before each harvest and the system is calibrated against
    actual truck weights at the beginning of the harvest season and weekly thereafter.
    Calibration is validated by ensuring that weight error ranges are within 8% of
    the weight at the winery, but actual measurements are consistently within 3%–4%.
    Harvest data is transferred into a data processing module developed in R Studio
    (RStudio Inc., Boston, MA, USA) to convert mass flow units into tonnes hectare−1,
    to eliminate measurement points that are outliers, and to normalize measurements
    from different harvesters. Yield data with values larger than three standard deviations
    from the mean are removed. The data cleaning steps eliminates only 5% of the original
    data. After yield data cleaning, the data is further processed by a software package
    (VESPER Version 1.62) [25] for interpolation and kriging to 3 ×3 m resolution.
    The raster data sets are then transferred into a program (Manifold System, Manifold
    Net Ltd., Carson City, NV, USA), where a 3 m ×3 m geo-referenced grid is created.
    For this paper, the yield data is further aggregated to 15 m ×15 m geo-referenced
    cells that are within the study area by summing up all yield values within that
    cells. If yield data points are at the boundary of two adjacent cells, the weight
    is distributed equally between the cells. Spatial statistics are quantified using
    the Cambardella index (CI) [26] and the Mean Correlation Distance (MCD) [27] using
    variogram parameters extracted from VESPER software [25]. The utility of such
    studies has been demonstrated in the past [28]. Using an exponential variogram
    model, the nugget ( C 0 ) and sill ( C 0 +C ) of the yield data are calculated
    across data points spaced up to 100 m. The CI is defined as [26] CI= C 0 ( C 0
    +C) ∗100 (3) View Source and quantifies the extent across which correlation is
    preserved. A CI value below 25 means strong spatial dependence, CI between 25
    and 75 means a moderate spatial dependence, and CI above 75 means a weak spatial
    dependence. MCD represents the distance along which correlation is preserved.
    The MCV is defined as [27] MCD= 3 8 ( C C+ C 0 )a (4) View Source where a is the
    range for the variogram or the distance above which value no correlation is detected.
    The three variogram parameters are estimated for the 2012–2014 yield data acquired
    across the whole variable rate irrigation area, as well as yield increasing and
    water efficiency sections. For comparison, the same calculations are carried out
    for the reference area where year to year variations are small. SECTION III. Results
    Differential irrigation is implemented for each irrigation control cell. As an
    example, in 2013 the yield maximizing section had an overall lower NDVI value
    compared with the water efficiency section (consistent with the 2012 yield data).
    Irrigating only the yield maximizing section for the first five weeks (irrigation
    started on April 28, 2013) the NDVI quickly increased above the water efficiency
    area’s NDVI value. Once the NDVI reverses the trends it can be maintained across
    the whole growing season by providing more water to the yield maximizing zone.
    After the first five weeks, all irrigation control cells are irrigated based on
    the corresponding NDVI values acquired across the growing season. In 2014, the
    yield maximizing section were irrigated the first four weeks and then all cells
    were irrigated based on their corresponding NDVI value. The yield data for each
    individual irrigation control cell is shown in Fig. 5. The key results of the
    experiment are summarized in Table I, with the mean values and the coefficient
    of variation (CoV) (relative standard deviation) for each section and year. The
    mean yields in the reference and trial areas are similar, at 20.0 and 20.1 tonnes
    hectare−1 for 2012 when the entire vineyard is uniformly irrigated. Lower fruitfulness
    in 2013 resulted in lower yields compared to 2012. There is no significant improvement
    in yield in the trial area in 2013, i.e., the yield maximizing and water efficiency
    sections, which is expected given the growth cycle of grapes. However, a substantial
    improvement in water efficiency is observed in 2014: 22% for the water efficiency
    section and 5% for the yield maximizing section. In 2014, yield increased 26%
    and 5% in the yield and water maximizing sections, respectively. Also, water use
    efficiency increased by 10% for the water efficiency section, with the water efficiency
    for the yield maximizing section remaining the same as the reference section.
    TABLE I Yield, Irrigation Water, and Water Efficiency Analysis for the Yield Maximizing,
    Water Efficiency, and Reference Section of the Vineyard Fig. 5. Top: Yield data
    for a uniformly irrigated test area in 2012 and a variable rate irrigated test
    area in 2013 and 2014. For 2013 and 2014, the yield maximizing section is outlined
    on the top images. Bottom: The yield for the control adjacent area. Show All The
    CoV for 2013 (Table I) decreased significantly indicating that uniformity of yield
    distribution is improved more than 50% after the first year (as change in CoV
    coefficient). After increasing the uniformity, the second year experiment demonstrated
    that yield trends can be reversed compared to 2012 yield map. In the yield maximizing
    section where yield is lower in 2012 became high yield areas in 2014 and the high
    yield area (water efficiency section) in 2012 became low yield in 2014 compared
    with plot average values. This reversal in yield is possible after only two years
    using the water as the only parameter that is varied across the trial area. The
    change in yield trends in 2014 resulted also in an increase of the CoV that is
    expected considering yield trend reversal. Table II summarizes the CI and MCD
    values across the three years of yield data. The CI indicates that there is a
    strong spatial dependence of yield across the variable rate irrigated area and
    the correlation is preserved for all three years even if the yield has significant
    spatial changes. The same conclusion is also supported by the MCD that shows a
    long range correlation with a significant increased value in 2014. Both the Cambardella
    and MCD values remain very similar for the reference area across the three years
    of this paper. Variable rate irrigation can change the spatial coherence of yield
    data on the small scale. TABLE II Spatial Statistics for the Yield and Water Efficiency
    Section The two-year study on yield and water use efficiency raises two questions.
    First, why are the yield enhancements small in the first year and significantly
    larger in the second year? The answer is that grape vines undergo an 18 months
    growing cycle between bud initiation and harvest [29]. Inflorescence induction
    and differentiation occurring 18 months prior to harvest are the key factors that
    govern grape yield potential. Thus, temperature and sunshine as well as stress
    conditions 18 months prior greatly affect the number of clusters per vine as well
    as the number of berries per cluster and thus yield [30]. Proper irrigation during
    bud formation minimizes water stress and its impact is expected to appear at harvest
    of the second year; which indeed resulted in a 26% increase in the yield in our
    experiment. The yield increase of 2% in the first year can be attributed to larger
    berry sizes. The second question is why the water efficiency dropped in the second
    year from 22% to 10%. Due to water availability constraints in the second year,
    the start of the irrigation in the reference area is delayed by one month compared
    to the trial area. SECTION IV. Economic Analysis Adoption of the variable rate
    irrigation technology required new irrigation infrastructure and irrigation analytics
    calculation. The first aspect is the change of existing uniform drip irrigation
    system with a variable rate irrigation system. The practicality of adopting the
    variable rate technology is influenced by two factors: 1) investment cost and
    2) the time for return on investment (ROI). With regards to ROI, the variable
    rate drip line system is best suited for high variability areas where differential
    management can improve low yield cells while managing water efficiently. The cost
    of a variable rate drip line irrigation system as presented herein depends on
    the spatial extent of the irrigation control cells. The smaller the control cells,
    the higher the infrastructure costs will be. Clearly, the size of the irrigation
    control cell should address yield or soil variability and this will drive the
    number of control nodes, solenoid valves, etc. Current estimates for implementing
    the variable rate drip line system at 30 m resolution can approach approximately
    a one-time cost of $5000 per hectare (assuming large scale fabrication of the
    components). If the system is fully packaged, installation costs should be similar
    to today’s system. In Fig. 6, the expected yield improvements are calculated as
    a function of control cell size (i.e., for the yield variability of the vineyard
    as shown in Fig. 5). Two assumptions are made in this calculation: 1) in regions
    with lower than average yield, the yield can be increased to the average yield
    of the field using variable rate irrigation and 2) the maximum yield improvement
    for the entire field (in the limit of very small control cell sizes) is 20%. We
    note that 20% is a realistic but potentially conservative assumption given that
    we have already shown 26% yield improvements. Fig. 6(a) shows that for very small
    control cells, the benefit of the technology saturates (approaching the assumed
    20% maximum yield improvement). For very large control cells, variable rate irrigation
    becomes ineffective compared to uniform irrigation, which shows that the spatial
    resolution of the management zone is just too coarse to successfully mitigate
    the variability. In terms of the cost benefits, an average price of 500pertonofgrapesisassumed,withapotential
    1200 profit per acre due to 20% increase in yield. The profit obtained should
    cover the cost of required new equipment (conversion of single drip line to a
    double drip line system) and the cost of required electronic components. Fig.
    6. Expected yield increase and ROI as a function of the control cell’s size. The
    optimum cell size is ~30m where the maximum benefits are expected. Show All Estimates
    of the ROI at larger manufacturing volumes as a function of the control zone size
    are shown in Fig. 6(b) with an optimum control cell size of around 30 m ×30 m
    where the ROI is approximately two years for grapes. Table III quantifies the
    cost of control electronics as a function of the number of fabricated units where
    larger volume decreases the unit price for the control nodes. Cost analysis for
    four distinctive crops indicates the number of years required to recover the investment
    (Table III-B). We note that all the calculations are made for crops that command
    high market prices. The ROI for deploying such a variable rate drip line system
    for strawberries, tomatoes, almonds, and grapes is 0.5, 0.8, 1.6, and 2.5 years,
    respectively, where the control zone is set at 30 m (the spatial resolution of
    Landsat imagery). These calculations may change if private satellite imagery needs
    to be purchased or if the deployed infrastructure will not remain in place for
    at least five years. Adoption of variable rate irrigation technology can have
    significant impact in regions such as the Indian subcontinent, most of Africa,
    Australia, and Western USA where water extraction often exceeds groundwater recharging
    rates [31]. TABLE III (a) Economic Analysis of Variable Rate Technology Cost as
    Function of Number of Controlled Units Fabricated. (b) Return of Investment for
    Different Crops as Function of Number of Control Units Used for Variable Rate
    Irrigation The second important aspect that needs to be implemented to scale-up
    variable rate irrigation is the data analytics platform that can ingest large
    scale geospatial data [32] and create real-time irrigation requirement. Such platforms
    should automatically combine real-time weather with remotely sensed data and automate
    and parallelize the analytics that determine the irrigation requirement. Only
    considered for the continental U.S., the required data sets can be several Terabytes
    of data each week. Near real-time irrigation prescriptions are virtually impossible
    using conventional (sequential) data processing techniques due to computational
    constraints. By way of comparison, a “big” data platform such as a highly distributed
    file system and processing environment leveraging the MapReduce framework [33]
    splits these large data files into small manageable 64 kB units, which can then
    be processed in parallel, thereby enabling computation “in the” data. For example,
    to scale the irrigation forecasting solution on a global scale we are using more
    than 32 servers, each with its own multicore processing unit and several local
    hard discs, where the irrigation analytics can be readily accelerated by a factor
    of 600 or more. With this system, irrigation requirements can be calculated in
    near real-time and scaled world-wide and adjusted for unexpected events like excessive
    precipitation, abrupt changes in daily temperature, and air moisture levels. Current
    development in big data technology can enable large scale irrigation forecasting
    using geospatial data [34]. The incremental cost to analyze new satellite data
    or weather data, in a big data framework, is minimal compared with manual analysis
    where data download, spatial alignment of data, and running analytics require
    significant manpower. Automation and machine to machine communication, as demonstrated
    in this paper, facilitate variable rate irrigation and provide consistency across
    growing season. SECTION V. Discussion The above results highlight the benefit
    of the closed loop variable rate irrigation approach where irrigation is fully
    automated. The variable rate drip line system presented here has the advantage
    of being flexible to deliver water differentially across a spatial area with high
    temporal resolution. For example, multiple irrigation periods during each day
    (to maintain constant soil moisture and avoid water pooling) can be readily implemented
    to maintain constant soil moisture or minimize water usage by applying the right
    amount of water at the right time. With proper management zone selection, yield
    can be significantly improved or water can be saved. The yield maximizing area
    responded directly to the targeted irrigation and it can be safely assumed that
    this is the main reason for the improved yield values. The improvements in water
    efficiency between 10%–20%, demonstrate that similar yields can be obtained using
    significantly less water. This can be a substantial benefit if the technology
    is adopted across a large geographical region. If applied to all grape producing
    region in California, which used 2 billion m3 irrigation water in 2010 (DWR 2014,
    USDA 2010), 15% improvements amounts to 300 million m3 reduction in water usage.
    SECTION VI. Conclusion This paper validates that: 1) variability can be minimized
    across a vineyard and 2) low yield areas can be turned into high yield areas using
    only differential irrigation. Two different objectives, increased yield and preserved
    water, can be achieved simultaneously in a vineyard by controlling water delivery
    on a spatial checkboard pattern. We demonstrated that management zone delineation
    can be defined based on NDVI and yield data and those management zones are a good
    representation of the variability. This paper demonstrates that with real-time
    control on the irrigation, the vigor of the canopy can be improved in a few weeks
    at the beginning of the season and reverse yield patterns after only 2 years of
    variable rate irrigation. These changes can be achieved on irrigation control
    cells as low as 15 m × 15m. The double drip line system developed for this paper
    can be easily reconfigured to adjust to any management zones that may affect variability
    in the field. In locations where soil and management practices vary across the
    vineyard, dynamic management zones can be defined by clustering the irrigation
    control cell to reflect the new management zones. Management zone boundaries can
    be changed dynamically during the growing season by just logically clustering
    irrigation control cells differently, without changing physical infrastructure.
    This proof of concept experiment carried out in a vineyard demonstrates the advantage
    to automate and customize irrigation for control zones of as little as 40 vines
    that can result in a 26% improvement in yield and an average 16% increase in water
    use efficiency. Large scale deployment of variable rate irrigation driven by digital
    data can enable efficient water use in regions where water is scarce and expensive,
    as well as during drought, while maintaining and improving currently achievable
    crop yields. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This

    Water scarcity is already affecting a part of the world and the situation is getting
    worse over time due to the increasing world population and fresh water demands.
    The current world population is around 7.2 billion and it is expected to be more
    than 9 billion by 2050 (United Nations, 2013). The agriculture sector, particularly
    irrigation, consumes a major portion of the freshwater. Due to lack of cost-effective
    intelligent irrigation systems, developing countries are consuming more water
    in contrast to the developed countries for achieving the same yield. For example,
    India has approximately 4% of world’s freshwater resources to serve 17% of the
    world population; however, it takes 2–4 times more water for some of its major
    agri-produce in comparison to the other countries like China, USA (G. o. I. NITI
    Aayog, 2015). Therefore, there is a dire need to come up with advanced technologies
    based smart strategies and systems for effective utilization of fresh water. Gubbi
    et al. (2013) discussed an IoT framework with cloud centric storage, processing
    and analysis of the data received from ubiquitous sensors along with a decision
    support interface. Cruz et al. (2018) suggested a reference model for an IoT middleware
    platform that would support intelligent IoT applications. IoT based solutions
    are proving very helpful in many dimensions of the agricultural landscape (Sharma
    et al., 2016), and these intelligent solutions could also be fruitful in smart
    irrigation with optimum utilization of water. Soil moisture, precipitation, and
    evaporation are the essential parameters for designing a smart irrigation system.
    The precipitation and evaporation are important key factors, which influence the
    soil moisture. In geography and climatology, the wetness of soil is estimated
    by the proportion of annual (or monthly) precipitation and evaporation (Shang
    et al., 2007). Daily soil moisture can also be evaluated by the ratio of daily
    precipitation and evaporation in the above perspective. Precipitation is directly
    accessible in the routine weather reports; nonetheless, evaporation can be calculated
    using other metrological essentials. For evaporation, we use an empirical model
    given by Penman (Chen and Chen, 1993) (1) The entire evaporation depends on the
    thermodynamic evaporation and the dynamic evaporation , where depends upon the
    velocity of the land storm, air temperature, relative humidity of the air and
    UV radiation. To achieve water saving, irrigation system frameworks have been
    proposed based on various techniques, e.g., thermal imaging, Crop Water Stress
    Index (CWSI), direct soil water measurements, etc. Thermal imaging is a prominent
    technique for irrigation management and it is based on the shade temperature distribution
    of the plant. In this framework, the status of the water in the plant is checked
    over continuous intervals and irrigation is planned in view of the shade temperature
    distribution of the plant (Wang et al., 2010). In addition, CWSI based framework
    has been proposed for irrigation scheduling of the crops for efficient use of
    water. The observation of CWSI was first characterized more than 30 years ago
    (Idso et al., 1981). O’Shaughnessy and Evett (2010) proposed an automatic irrigation
    scheduling based on direct soil water measurement that utilizes water proficiently
    over manual irrigation system. Allen et al. (1998) suggested evapotranspiration
    (ET) based approach, which is an important parameter to decide crop irrigation
    needs influenced by climate parameters, e.g., solar radiation, relative humidity,
    temperature, wind velocity, and crop features such as phase of the crop growth,
    assortment and plant density, properties of soil, nuisance, and disease control.
    ET-based frameworks can save water up to 42% over time-based water irrigation
    scheduling (Davis and Dukes, 2010). Davis et al. (2009) conducted the investigations
    in Florida and verified that ET‐based watering scheduling controllers are more
    beneficial in term of cost, size and labor requirement for irrigation. ET-based
    irrigation system uses much less water as compared to scheduled practices. Viani
    et al. (2017) proposed a fuzzy logic-based decision support system based on farmer’s
    experience with the understanding of crop condition. This system provides more
    water saving over single-threshold and multi-threshold based irrigation scheduling.
    Gutiérrez et al. (2014) proposed an automated irrigation system using a wireless
    sensor network and GPRS module to save water in irrigation. In this system, a
    network of soil moisture sensors with controller has been installed in a crop
    field for real-time monitoring and irrigation control. Gill et al. (2006) suggested
    a method for soil moisture prediction using support vector machines based on air
    temperature, relative air humidity and soil temperature. Jaguey et al. (2015)
    developed irrigation sensor based on smart phone. For sensing soil moisture, the
    digital camera of smart phone is used to process RGB to gray for estimation of
    ratio between wet and dry area of soil. The ratio of wetness and dryness is transmitted
    via gateway to water motor controller. A Mobile Application (APP) is developed
    to control sensor activity (like wakeup) and to set sensor in sleep mode. Goldstein
    et al. (2017) proposed irrigation recommendations based on machine learning algorithm
    with support of agronomist’s encysted knowledge. It was found that the best regression
    model was Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) with 93% accuracy in prediction
    of irrigation plan/recommendation. The developed model is helpful to the agronomist’s
    irrigation management. Roopaei et al. (2017) proposed an intelligent irrigation
    monitoring system based on thermal imaging. The proposed technique uses thermal
    imaging camera mounted on Drone. An algorithm is developed using images processing
    techniques for identification of water requirement, Leaf water potential, and
    non-uniform irrigation, which are used for irrigation monitoring. Majority of
    the earlier irrigation systems do not consider the weather forecasting information
    (e.g., precipitation) while making irrigation decisions. It leads to a wastage
    of fresh water, energy and loss of crop growth (due to excess water) when a rain
    is followed immediately by the watering of the crop. To handle such cases, IoT
    based solutions can provide a better decision support for irrigation by utilizing
    weather forecasting information (e.g., precipitation) from the Internet. Further,
    the accuracy of weather forecasting is improving due to the advancement of satellite
    imagery technology. For effective and optimum utilization of fresh water in irrigation,
    it becomes essential to develop the smart irrigation systems based on dynamic
    prediction of soil moisture pattern of the field and precipitation information
    of upcoming days. This paper presents an intelligent system that predicts soil
    moisture based on the information collected from the sensors deployed at the field
    and the weather forecast information available on the Internet. The field data
    has been collected through a self-designed sensor node. The server-side software
    has been developed with node side connectivity along with information visualization
    and decision support features. A novel algorithm has been developed for soil-moisture
    prediction, which is based on Machine Learning techniques applied on the sensor
    node data and the weather forecast data. The algorithm shows improved accuracy
    and less error. The proposed approach could help in making effective irrigation
    decisions with optimum water usage. 2. Methods/Techniques used Prediction of soil
    moisture is vital for effective irrigation management system. The estimation of
    soil moisture depends upon evapotranspiration Hargreaves and Samani (1985) developed
    a method based on temperature and extra-terrestrial radiation to estimate ET0.
    It is expressed as (2) where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm/day); Tmax
    and Tmin = maximum temperature and minimum temperature (°C) and Ra = extra-terrestrial
    radiation (MJ m−2 day−1). Ritchie developed another method for estimation of ET0
    (Jones and Ritchie, 1990) based on temperature and solar radiation. It is expressed
    as (3) where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm/day); Tmax and Tmin = maximum
    and minimum temperature (°C) and Rs = solar radiation (MJ m−2 day−1). When (4)
    Cobaner (2011) developed evapotranspiration estimation method based on Neuro-Fuzzy
    (NF) inference and found that the NF model (based on solar radiation, air temperature,
    and relative humidity) exhibits better accuracy than the combination of solar
    radiation, air temperature and wind speed. From state of art, it has been analyzed
    that prediction of soil moisture is possible using sensors placement at the field
    and weather forecasted data. So, we have considered evaporation of soil moisture
    based on air temperature, air relative humidity, soil temperature, and radiation.
    The parameters are considered for analyzing the soil moisture drain (change/difference)
    pattern based on the recorded data of soil moisture. An IoT based architecture
    (Fig. 1) has been proposed to collect, transmit and process the physical parameters
    (soil moisture, air temperature, air relative humidity, soil temperature, and
    radiation) of farming land along with the weather forecast information to manage
    the irrigation efficiently. Download : Download high-res image (307KB) Download

    based on a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques
    (block diagram shown in Fig. 3 and pseudocode is discussed in Section 3.2.1) has
    been developed using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and k-means clustering for
    estimation of difference/change in soil moisture due to weather conditions. It
    gives good accuracy and less Mean Squared Error (MSE) (Theobald, 1974; “Mean Squared
    Error, 2018’’) in the prediction of the soil moisture of upcoming days with the
    help of sensors data and the weather forecasting data. SVR model has been trained
    using data (air temperature, air relative humidity, soil temperature, radiation,
    and soil moisture difference) collected from field device shown in Fig. 2. The
    Soil Moisture Differences (SMD) of upcoming days have been predicted using trained
    SVR model and the predicted value of SMD is given as input for k-means clustering
    for improving the accuracy of soil moisture difference (centroid value of k-means),
    which is more accurate (Table 2) with less MSE (Table 3). The final predicted
    soil moisture (Table 4) has been used in the development of smart irrigation scheduling
    algorithm (Section 3.2.2) to efficiently utilize the natural rain (precipitation)
    information for effective irrigation. To visualize the predicted soil moisture
    of upcoming days along with precipitation information and to control (start and
    stop) the irrigation, a responsive web portal has also been developed (Fig. 4,

    Planning Module. Support Vector Regression (SVR) (Drucker et al., 1997) is the
    modified version of Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Hearst et al., 1998), where
    the dependent variable is numerical in lieu of categorical. SVR is a non-parametric
    technique and allows the creation of nonlinear models. The SVR method utilizes
    kernel functions to generate the model. Some of the frequently used kernel functions
    are Polynomial, Linear, Radial Basis and Sigmodal. k-means clustering (Kanungo
    et al., 2002) takes a straightforward and simple methodology to group a given
    information set into a definite number of clusters. The objective is to find k
    centroids, one for each bunch. First, it divides n number of the objects into
    k non-empty subgroups/cluster, and then finds the cluster centroids (mean point)
    of every subgroup/cluster. Then it calculates the distances from every point to
    the centroids and allocate each object to a specific cluster where the distance
    is minimum from the centroid. The process iterates to re-assign the points and
    identify the centroid of the new clusters. 3. The proposed system 3.1. System
    architecture The architecture of proposed IoT based smart irrigation system is
    shown in Fig. 1. It has seven main components, viz., Field data collection device
    with relay switch (Standalone and WSN Scenario); Web service for collecting field
    sensor data; Web service for collecting weather information available online (Internet);
    Web service to control water motor; Soil moisture prediction algorithm; Responsive
    web based interface for real-time monitoring; IoT enabled motor pump. These components
    are grouped into three different layers, i.e. Data collection and transmission
    layer, Data processing & intelligence layer and application layer of IoT (Fig.
    1). These components are discussed in the following sections. 3.1.1. Field data
    collection device Depending on the field requirements, a standalone sensor node
    or a wireless sensor network of the sensor nodes may be deployed. In standalone
    scenario field data collection device consists of four sensors, viz., VH-400 Soil
    Moisture sensor, Soil temperature sensor, DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor,
    and Ultraviolet (UV) Light Radiation sensor based on GUVA-S12SD and SGM8521 Op
    Amp. The output of these sensors is read by an Arduino-Uno, which is connected
    to Raspberry Pi (R-Pi). In R-Pi a program is written in Python language to hourly
    fetch the data from sensors and to store the data in SQLite database, which is
    synched with the server database using developed web service. For large farming
    area, a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) (Ojha et al., 2015) scenario with ZigBee
    (Pandey et al., 2017, Gutiérrez et al., 2014) technology can be implemented in
    which multiple sensor nodes can be planted in the specified area. Each sensor
    node will consist of the sensors similar to the standalone device. The output
    of these sensors is read by an Arduino-Uno connected to ZigBee for sending data
    to Gateway Node (similar to the standalone device with ZigBee connectivity) that
    will aggregate the received data and store it locally in SQLite and also send
    the data to the server using web service. The current analysis (statistical analysis
    of predicted soil moisture and its accuracy is exhibited in Fig. 6, Table 3, Table
    5) has been done with the standalone device. The standalone device is shown in
    Fig. 2. Table 5. Comparison of correlation, R squared and MSE between soil moisture
    values based on the sensor data and the proposed algorithm. Parameter Predicted

    Fig. 6. Graphical representation of the results shown in Table 2. 3.1.2. Web service
    for field sensor data collection The Web service is written in PHP with a light
    weighted REST API to communicate the data between the field device and the server.
    The service is hosted on Apache (Web server) at server machine. The R-Pi sends
    the field data to the server using this web service. This web service can handle
    the network fluctuation/outage during synchronizing the data from the filed device
    to the server with the help of flag settings at the database level. 3.1.3. Web
    service for online weather data collection A web service has been developed in
    Python to collect the weather forecasting data. This web service also aggregates
    the weather forecasting data like temperature, humidity, cloudiness, UV Index
    and precipitation of different web forecasting portal like OpenWeather and AccuWeather
    using API of these portal (Weather API, 2012, API Reference, 2017). These portals
    provide the forecasted information in JSON, XML, or HTML format. The developed
    web service read the forecasted data (JSON format) of the specified location using
    API and store it in MySQL database at the server, which is considered in the prediction
    algorithm. 3.1.4. Soil moisture prediction algorithm An algorithm has been developed
    (Fig. 3) to predict the soil moisture based on field sensors data and weather
    forecasting data using support vector regression model and k-means clustering
    algorithm. The algorithm shows information regarding soil moisture of the upcoming
    days. It also provides irrigation suggestions, based on the defined level of soil
    moisture and predicted precipitation, to save water and energy. The generated
    information by algorithm and device is stored in MySQL Database at the server.
    The algorithm is discussed in detail in Section 3.2. 3.1.5. Responsive web based
    interface for real-time monitoring A responsive web based user interface is developed
    using PHP, MySQL and Bootstrap API for real-time monitoring and scheduling of
    irrigation activities (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). The interface visualizes real-time sensors
    data, predicted soil moisture of upcoming days, and precipitation information.
    Further, it also provides a facility for irrigation scheduling. The user can schedule
    the irrigation at a specified threshold value of soil moisture. The system guides
    to maintain the threshold value based on the predicted pattern of soil moisture
    and precipitation information. The system can automatically start the irrigation,
    which stops after achieving the specified threshold value of soil moisture. 3.1.6.
    Web service to control water motor A web service has been developed on top of
    HTTP protocol to start and stop the water motor. This web service has been accessed
    by Python code in R-Pi to start and stop the water motor. The Python code (running
    on R-Pi) send signal to Arduino-Uno that controls the relay switch to start/stop
    the water motor. 3.1.7. IoT enabled water pump In this module, a water pump is
    connected to a relay switch that is controlled by a Wi-Fi enabled node. The node
    is controlled by the web service through a trigger from the responsive web based
    interface for real-time monitoring. Using this web based interface the water pump
    can be managed remotely in manual and auto modes. 3.1.8. Communication technologies
    used in proposed architecture In the proposed architecture, the WiFi module/Mobile
    data communication module can be used as communication media between the field
    device and the server. In this experiment (Standalone device scenario), a WiFi
    module has been used to send the data to the server. In WSN scenario, ZigBee network
    can be used between sensor node to Gateway Node and then a WiFi module or Mobile
    data communication module can be used to send the data from the gateway node to
    the server. 3.2. Prediction algorithm and data visualization Flow diagram of the
    proposed soil moisture prediction algorithm and the irrigation planning algorithm
    for data visualization and decision support is shown in Fig. 3. 3.2.1. Algorithm
    for soil moisture prediction Algorithm Steps (Variables as in Table 1.) • Initialize

    2 …n } • Output (NPSMD0, NPSMD1, NPSMD2, …., NPSMDn) 3.2.2. Algorithm of irrigation
    scheduling Algorithm Steps Step 1. Initialize minimum threshold (THmin) of soil
    moisture to start irrigation and maximum threshold (THmax) of soil moisture to
    stop irrigation Step2. Set mode (manual/auto) for irrigation Step 3. If (mode = auto)  {   Read
    and check current soil moisture (Csm)   If (Csm <= THmin) // condition check of
    current soil moisture from its set threshold value by user   {    Ndate = Read
    precipitation information of upcoming days and select nearest date of precipitation.    Calculate
    required soil moisture (Rsm) = sum (predicted SMD from current date to nearest
    date of precipitation (Ndate)) //Total change in soil moisture till nearest precipitation
    date    Set THmax = minimum ((THmin + Rsm), THmax) // selection of minimum soil-
    moisture required to maintain crop growth    while (THmax > Csm) // condition
    for watering till soil moisture reaches its minimum required value.    {    Send
    1 to relay to start irrigation //Signal to Start Water motor    }    Send 0 to
    relay to stop irrigation //Signal to stop the water motor  } Else   {    Send
    0 to relay to stop irrigation //Signal to stop the water motor   }  } Else  {   Enter/Set
    date to start irrigation    If (current_date >= irrigation_date) // condition
    to start the irrigation at specify date    {     while (THmax > Csm)     {      Send
    1 to relay to start irrigation //Signal to start the water motor     }    }    Else    {     Send
    0 to stop irrigation //Signal to stop the water motor    }  } 3.2.3. Experimental
    setup The main objective of this experiment is to collect the physical parameters
    of a farming land using sensors and to utilize these sensors’ data along with
    weather forecast information for developing an algorithm for prediction of soil
    moisture of the upcoming days. The algorithm uses a hybrid machine learning approach,
    as discussed in Section 3.2, to achieve higher accuracy in soil moisture prediction.
    It provides a probable estimate of soil moisture to plan and provision the optimum
    irrigation. Statistical measures, R squared (Table 5) and Mean Squared Error (Table
    3, Table 5), are used for estimation of accuracy and error rate of the proposed
    algorithm. The experiment shows that a good estimation (close to the actual value)
    of the soil moisture (Table 4), with the help of field data and forecasted information,
    can be utilized for optimum irrigation with an effective utilization of natural
    rain. As described in Section 3.1, one field data collection device (node) has
    been deployed in the garden of our organization to collect the field data (Fig.
    2). The data is collected at the server using the web services. Then, the data
    is analyzed using the proposed machine learning approach (Section 3.2.1). Further,
    a responsive web based interface has been developed for real-time monitoring,
    data visualization and decision support system, and for the scheduling of irrigation.
    Fig. 4 shows the GUI of responsive web based interface for real-time monitoring
    and decision support system, which shows the current soil moisture recorded by
    the sensor, and the predicted soil moisture generated by the algorithm. This information,
    predicted soil moisture and precipitation information, will help user/farmer in
    planning/scheduling of optimum irrigation. Fig. 5 shows the GUI of irrigation
    planning module to schedule the irrigation by setting Irrigation Date, and Threshold
    Levels for Soil Moisture. It works in two modes, viz., auto, and manual, as discussed
    in Section 3.2.2. In manual mode, the user takes the scheduling decision based
    on predicted soil moisture and precipitation information. In auto mode, user sets
    the Soil Moisture Threshold levels, and the system automatically schedules the
    irrigation date based on the predicted soil moisture and weather forecast (precipitation)
    information. For example, if rain is expected on the scheduled irrigation date
    or near to scheduled date, then the system will wait for the rain and it will
    suspend the artificial/manual irrigation or it will start watering (if needed,
    based on the algorithm) the field to maintain minimum soil moisture till the arrival
    of rain. Further, the system can handle the changes in forecasted precipitation
    values. 4. Results and discussion The smartness of the proposed system is dependent
    on the accuracy of the predicted soil moisture (Table 4, Table 5). To verify the
    accuracy of soil moisture prediction algorithm, the hourly field data for air
    temperature, air humidity, soil moisture, soil temperature, and UV is collected
    for three weeks. The three weeks’ hourly data has been averaged out on per day
    basis and the 21 days’ data is divided into a training set (70% of the data) and
    testing set (30% of the data) for applying the proposed algorithm. Initially,
    we have predicted SMD of upcoming days using the proposed algorithm (Fig. 3) and
    the predicted values of SMD has been used in prediction of soil moisture of upcoming
    days. The results are summarized in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5. The SVR + k-means
    approach has higher accuracy with lower mean squared error over SVR approach while
    calculating SMD (Table 2 and Table 3). The graph (Fig. 6) shows that predicted
    SMD using proposed algorithm (SVR + k-means) is nearer to actual SMD as compared
    to predicted SMD using SVR only. The SVR + k-means approach has the same accuracy
    with the lower mean squared error over SVR approach in soil moisture prediction
    (Tables 4 and 5). The predicted soil moisture shown in Table 4 has been calculated
    based on soil moisture and SMD of previous day, e.g. soil moisture on 14-11-2017
    is 26.8982 then the soil moisture of the next day (15-11-2017) will be equal to
    the difference of soil moisture on the previous day (i.e., 14–11-2017) and SMD
    difference predicted for 15-11-2017 (Table 2). From the Tables 2 and 3, we have
    observed that the prediction of SMD using SVR + k-means approach gives higher
    accuracy with less MSE as compared to SVR approach, and we have also observed
    the same accuracy (R squared = 96%) with lesser MSE in prediction of soil moisture
    using combined approach (SVR + k-means) (Table 5). It shows that the proposed
    algorithm (based on SVR + k-means) is better as compared to SVR based approach.
    Due to higher accuracy and minimum MSE, SVR + k-means based hybrid machine learning
    algorithm has been used in irrigation planning module. 5. Conclusion The soil
    moisture is a critical parameter for developing a smart irrigation system. The
    soil moisture is affected by a number of environmental variables, e.g., air temperature,
    air humidity, UV, soil temperature, etc. With advancement in technologies, the
    weather forecasting accuracy has improved significantly and the weather forecasted
    data can be used for prediction of changes in the soil moisture. This paper proposes
    an IoT based smart irrigation architecture along with a hybrid machine learning
    based approach to predict the soil moisture. The proposed algorithm uses sensors’
    data of recent past and the weather forecasted data for prediction of soil moisture
    of upcoming days. The predicted value of the soil moisture is better in terms
    of their accuracy and error rate. Further, the prediction approach is integrated
    into a standalone system prototype. The system prototype is cost effective, as
    it is based on the open standard technologies. The auto mode makes it a smart
    system and it can be further customized for application specific scenarios. In
    future, we are planning to conduct a water saving analysis based on proposed algorithm
    with multiple nodes along with minimizing the system cost. Acknowledgements Authors

    Water scarcity is already affecting a part of the world and the situation is getting
    worse over time due to the increasing world population and fresh water demands.
    The current world population is around 7.2 billion and it is expected to be more
    than 9 billion by 2050 (United Nations, 2013). The agriculture sector, particularly
    irrigation, consumes a major portion of the freshwater. Due to lack of cost-effective
    intelligent irrigation systems, developing countries are consuming more water
    in contrast to the developed countries for achieving the same yield. For example,
    India has approximately 4% of world’s freshwater resources to serve 17% of the
    world population; however, it takes 2–4 times more water for some of its major
    agri-produce in comparison to the other countries like China, USA (G. o. I. NITI
    Aayog, 2015). Therefore, there is a dire need to come up with advanced technologies
    based smart strategies and systems for effective utilization of fresh water. Gubbi
    et al. (2013) discussed an IoT framework with cloud centric storage, processing
    and analysis of the data received from ubiquitous sensors along with a decision
    support interface. Cruz et al. (2018) suggested a reference model for an IoT middleware
    platform that would support intelligent IoT applications. IoT based solutions
    are proving very helpful in many dimensions of the agricultural landscape (Sharma
    et al., 2016), and these intelligent solutions could also be fruitful in smart
    irrigation with optimum utilization of water. Soil moisture, precipitation, and
    evaporation are the essential parameters for designing a smart irrigation system.
    The precipitation and evaporation are important key factors, which influence the
    soil moisture. In geography and climatology, the wetness of soil is estimated
    by the proportion of annual (or monthly) precipitation and evaporation (Shang
    et al., 2007). Daily soil moisture can also be evaluated by the ratio of daily
    precipitation and evaporation in the above perspective. Precipitation is directly
    accessible in the routine weather reports; nonetheless, evaporation can be calculated
    using other metrological essentials. For evaporation, we use an empirical model
    given by Penman (Chen and Chen, 1993) (1) The entire evaporation depends on the
    thermodynamic evaporation and the dynamic evaporation , where depends upon the
    velocity of the land storm, air temperature, relative humidity of the air and
    UV radiation. To achieve water saving, irrigation system frameworks have been
    proposed based on various techniques, e.g., thermal imaging, Crop Water Stress
    Index (CWSI), direct soil water measurements, etc. Thermal imaging is a prominent
    technique for irrigation management and it is based on the shade temperature distribution
    of the plant. In this framework, the status of the water in the plant is checked
    over continuous intervals and irrigation is planned in view of the shade temperature
    distribution of the plant (Wang et al., 2010). In addition, CWSI based framework
    has been proposed for irrigation scheduling of the crops for efficient use of
    water. The observation of CWSI was first characterized more than 30 years ago
    (Idso et al., 1981). O’Shaughnessy and Evett (2010) proposed an automatic irrigation
    scheduling based on direct soil water measurement that utilizes water proficiently
    over manual irrigation system. Allen et al. (1998) suggested evapotranspiration
    (ET) based approach, which is an important parameter to decide crop irrigation
    needs influenced by climate parameters, e.g., solar radiation, relative humidity,
    temperature, wind velocity, and crop features such as phase of the crop growth,
    assortment and plant density, properties of soil, nuisance, and disease control.
    ET-based frameworks can save water up to 42% over time-based water irrigation
    scheduling (Davis and Dukes, 2010). Davis et al. (2009) conducted the investigations
    in Florida and verified that ET‐based watering scheduling controllers are more
    beneficial in term of cost, size and labor requirement for irrigation. ET-based
    irrigation system uses much less water as compared to scheduled practices. Viani
    et al. (2017) proposed a fuzzy logic-based decision support system based on farmer’s
    experience with the understanding of crop condition. This system provides more
    water saving over single-threshold and multi-threshold based irrigation scheduling.
    Gutiérrez et al. (2014) proposed an automated irrigation system using a wireless
    sensor network and GPRS module to save water in irrigation. In this system, a
    network of soil moisture sensors with controller has been installed in a crop
    field for real-time monitoring and irrigation control. Gill et al. (2006) suggested
    a method for soil moisture prediction using support vector machines based on air
    temperature, relative air humidity and soil temperature. Jaguey et al. (2015)
    developed irrigation sensor based on smart phone. For sensing soil moisture, the
    digital camera of smart phone is used to process RGB to gray for estimation of
    ratio between wet and dry area of soil. The ratio of wetness and dryness is transmitted
    via gateway to water motor controller. A Mobile Application (APP) is developed
    to control sensor activity (like wakeup) and to set sensor in sleep mode. Goldstein
    et al. (2017) proposed irrigation recommendations based on machine learning algorithm
    with support of agronomist’s encysted knowledge. It was found that the best regression
    model was Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) with 93% accuracy in prediction
    of irrigation plan/recommendation. The developed model is helpful to the agronomist’s
    irrigation management. Roopaei et al. (2017) proposed an intelligent irrigation
    monitoring system based on thermal imaging. The proposed technique uses thermal
    imaging camera mounted on Drone. An algorithm is developed using images processing
    techniques for identification of water requirement, Leaf water potential, and
    non-uniform irrigation, which are used for irrigation monitoring. Majority of
    the earlier irrigation systems do not consider the weather forecasting information
    (e.g., precipitation) while making irrigation decisions. It leads to a wastage
    of fresh water, energy and loss of crop growth (due to excess water) when a rain
    is followed immediately by the watering of the crop. To handle such cases, IoT
    based solutions can provide a better decision support for irrigation by utilizing
    weather forecasting information (e.g., precipitation) from the Internet. Further,
    the accuracy of weather forecasting is improving due to the advancement of satellite
    imagery technology. For effective and optimum utilization of fresh water in irrigation,
    it becomes essential to develop the smart irrigation systems based on dynamic
    prediction of soil moisture pattern of the field and precipitation information
    of upcoming days. This paper presents an intelligent system that predicts soil
    moisture based on the information collected from the sensors deployed at the field
    and the weather forecast information available on the Internet. The field data
    has been collected through a self-designed sensor node. The server-side software
    has been developed with node side connectivity along with information visualization
    and decision support features. A novel algorithm has been developed for soil-moisture
    prediction, which is based on Machine Learning techniques applied on the sensor
    node data and the weather forecast data. The algorithm shows improved accuracy
    and less error. The proposed approach could help in making effective irrigation
    decisions with optimum water usage. 2. Methods/Techniques used Prediction of soil
    moisture is vital for effective irrigation management system. The estimation of
    soil moisture depends upon evapotranspiration Hargreaves and Samani (1985) developed
    a method based on temperature and extra-terrestrial radiation to estimate ET0.
    It is expressed as (2) where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm/day); Tmax
    and Tmin = maximum temperature and minimum temperature (°C) and Ra = extra-terrestrial
    radiation (MJ m−2 day−1). Ritchie developed another method for estimation of ET0
    (Jones and Ritchie, 1990) based on temperature and solar radiation. It is expressed
    as (3) where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm/day); Tmax and Tmin = maximum
    and minimum temperature (°C) and Rs = solar radiation (MJ m−2 day−1). When (4)
    Cobaner (2011) developed evapotranspiration estimation method based on Neuro-Fuzzy
    (NF) inference and found that the NF model (based on solar radiation, air temperature,
    and relative humidity) exhibits better accuracy than the combination of solar
    radiation, air temperature and wind speed. From state of art, it has been analyzed
    that prediction of soil moisture is possible using sensors placement at the field
    and weather forecasted data. So, we have considered evaporation of soil moisture
    based on air temperature, air relative humidity, soil temperature, and radiation.
    The parameters are considered for analyzing the soil moisture drain (change/difference)
    pattern based on the recorded data of soil moisture. An IoT based architecture
    (Fig. 1) has been proposed to collect, transmit and process the physical parameters
    (soil moisture, air temperature, air relative humidity, soil temperature, and
    radiation) of farming land along with the weather forecast information to manage
    the irrigation efficiently. Download : Download high-res image (307KB) Download

    based on a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques
    (block diagram shown in Fig. 3 and pseudocode is discussed in Section 3.2.1) has
    been developed using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and k-means clustering for
    estimation of difference/change in soil moisture due to weather conditions. It
    gives good accuracy and less Mean Squared Error (MSE) (Theobald, 1974; “Mean Squared
    Error, 2018’’) in the prediction of the soil moisture of upcoming days with the
    help of sensors data and the weather forecasting data. SVR model has been trained
    using data (air temperature, air relative humidity, soil temperature, radiation,
    and soil moisture difference) collected from field device shown in Fig. 2. The
    Soil Moisture Differences (SMD) of upcoming days have been predicted using trained
    SVR model and the predicted value of SMD is given as input for k-means clustering
    for improving the accuracy of soil moisture difference (centroid value of k-means),
    which is more accurate (Table 2) with less MSE (Table 3). The final predicted
    soil moisture (Table 4) has been used in the development of smart irrigation scheduling
    algorithm (Section 3.2.2) to efficiently utilize the natural rain (precipitation)
    information for effective irrigation. To visualize the predicted soil moisture
    of upcoming days along with precipitation information and to control (start and
    stop) the irrigation, a responsive web portal has also been developed (Fig. 4,
    Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image (250KB) Download : Download full-size

    Planning Module. Support Vector Regression (SVR) (Drucker et al., 1997) is the
    modified version of Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Hearst et al., 1998), where
    the dependent variable is numerical in lieu of categorical. SVR is a non-parametric
    technique and allows the creation of nonlinear models. The SVR method utilizes
    kernel functions to generate the model. Some of the frequently used kernel functions
    are Polynomial, Linear, Radial Basis and Sigmodal. k-means clustering (Kanungo
    et al., 2002) takes a straightforward and simple methodology to group a given
    information set into a definite number of clusters. The objective is to find k
    centroids, one for each bunch. First, it divides n number of the objects into
    k non-empty subgroups/cluster, and then finds the cluster centroids (mean point)
    of every subgroup/cluster. Then it calculates the distances from every point to
    the centroids and allocate each object to a specific cluster where the distance
    is minimum from the centroid. The process iterates to re-assign the points and
    identify the centroid of the new clusters. 3. The proposed system 3.1. System
    architecture The architecture of proposed IoT based smart irrigation system is
    shown in Fig. 1. It has seven main components, viz., Field data collection device
    with relay switch (Standalone and WSN Scenario); Web service for collecting field
    sensor data; Web service for collecting weather information available online (Internet);
    Web service to control water motor; Soil moisture prediction algorithm; Responsive
    web based interface for real-time monitoring; IoT enabled motor pump. These components
    are grouped into three different layers, i.e. Data collection and transmission
    layer, Data processing & intelligence layer and application layer of IoT (Fig.
    1). These components are discussed in the following sections. 3.1.1. Field data
    collection device Depending on the field requirements, a standalone sensor node
    or a wireless sensor network of the sensor nodes may be deployed. In standalone
    scenario field data collection device consists of four sensors, viz., VH-400 Soil
    Moisture sensor, Soil temperature sensor, DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor,
    and Ultraviolet (UV) Light Radiation sensor based on GUVA-S12SD and SGM8521 Op
    Amp. The output of these sensors is read by an Arduino-Uno, which is connected
    to Raspberry Pi (R-Pi). In R-Pi a program is written in Python language to hourly
    fetch the data from sensors and to store the data in SQLite database, which is
    synched with the server database using developed web service. For large farming
    area, a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) (Ojha et al., 2015) scenario with ZigBee
    (Pandey et al., 2017, Gutiérrez et al., 2014) technology can be implemented in
    which multiple sensor nodes can be planted in the specified area. Each sensor
    node will consist of the sensors similar to the standalone device. The output
    of these sensors is read by an Arduino-Uno connected to ZigBee for sending data
    to Gateway Node (similar to the standalone device with ZigBee connectivity) that
    will aggregate the received data and store it locally in SQLite and also send
    the data to the server using web service. The current analysis (statistical analysis
    of predicted soil moisture and its accuracy is exhibited in Fig. 6, Table 3, Table
    5) has been done with the standalone device. The standalone device is shown in
    Fig. 2. Table 5. Comparison of correlation, R squared and MSE between soil moisture
    values based on the sensor data and the proposed algorithm. Parameter Predicted

    Fig. 6. Graphical representation of the results shown in Table 2. 3.1.2. Web service
    for field sensor data collection The Web service is written in PHP with a light
    weighted REST API to communicate the data between the field device and the server.
    The service is hosted on Apache (Web server) at server machine. The R-Pi sends
    the field data to the server using this web service. This web service can handle
    the network fluctuation/outage during synchronizing the data from the filed device
    to the server with the help of flag settings at the database level. 3.1.3. Web
    service for online weather data collection A web service has been developed in
    Python to collect the weather forecasting data. This web service also aggregates
    the weather forecasting data like temperature, humidity, cloudiness, UV Index
    and precipitation of different web forecasting portal like OpenWeather and AccuWeather
    using API of these portal (Weather API, 2012, API Reference, 2017). These portals
    provide the forecasted information in JSON, XML, or HTML format. The developed
    web service read the forecasted data (JSON format) of the specified location using
    API and store it in MySQL database at the server, which is considered in the prediction
    algorithm. 3.1.4. Soil moisture prediction algorithm An algorithm has been developed
    (Fig. 3) to predict the soil moisture based on field sensors data and weather
    forecasting data using support vector regression model and k-means clustering
    algorithm. The algorithm shows information regarding soil moisture of the upcoming
    days. It also provides irrigation suggestions, based on the defined level of soil
    moisture and predicted precipitation, to save water and energy. The generated
    information by algorithm and device is stored in MySQL Database at the server.
    The algorithm is discussed in detail in Section 3.2. 3.1.5. Responsive web based
    interface for real-time monitoring A responsive web based user interface is developed
    using PHP, MySQL and Bootstrap API for real-time monitoring and scheduling of
    irrigation activities (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). The interface visualizes real-time sensors
    data, predicted soil moisture of upcoming days, and precipitation information.
    Further, it also provides a facility for irrigation scheduling. The user can schedule
    the irrigation at a specified threshold value of soil moisture. The system guides
    to maintain the threshold value based on the predicted pattern of soil moisture
    and precipitation information. The system can automatically start the irrigation,
    which stops after achieving the specified threshold value of soil moisture. 3.1.6.
    Web service to control water motor A web service has been developed on top of
    HTTP protocol to start and stop the water motor. This web service has been accessed
    by Python code in R-Pi to start and stop the water motor. The Python code (running
    on R-Pi) send signal to Arduino-Uno that controls the relay switch to start/stop
    the water motor. 3.1.7. IoT enabled water pump In this module, a water pump is
    connected to a relay switch that is controlled by a Wi-Fi enabled node. The node
    is controlled by the web service through a trigger from the responsive web based
    interface for real-time monitoring. Using this web based interface the water pump
    can be managed remotely in manual and auto modes. 3.1.8. Communication technologies
    used in proposed architecture In the proposed architecture, the WiFi module/Mobile
    data communication module can be used as communication media between the field
    device and the server. In this experiment (Standalone device scenario), a WiFi
    module has been used to send the data to the server. In WSN scenario, ZigBee network
    can be used between sensor node to Gateway Node and then a WiFi module or Mobile
    data communication module can be used to send the data from the gateway node to
    the server. 3.2. Prediction algorithm and data visualization Flow diagram of the
    proposed soil moisture prediction algorithm and the irrigation planning algorithm
    for data visualization and decision support is shown in Fig. 3. 3.2.1. Algorithm
    for soil moisture prediction Algorithm Steps (Variables as in Table 1.) • Initialize

    3…n] • For i = 0 to n (n = total number of days of PSMD) { k-means clustering
    on (SMD of SD, Pi, NoC) //calling k-means clustering function NPSMDi = Centroid
    value of cluster to which Pi belongs // Final predicted value of SMD of day 1,
    2 …n } • Output (NPSMD0, NPSMD1, NPSMD2, …., NPSMDn) 3.2.2. Algorithm of irrigation
    scheduling Algorithm Steps Step 1. Initialize minimum threshold (THmin) of soil
    moisture to start irrigation and maximum threshold (THmax) of soil moisture to
    stop irrigation Step2. Set mode (manual/auto) for irrigation Step 3. If (mode = auto)  {   Read
    and check current soil moisture (Csm)   If (Csm <= THmin) // condition check of
    current soil moisture from its set threshold value by user   {    Ndate = Read
    precipitation information of upcoming days and select nearest date of precipitation.    Calculate
    required soil moisture (Rsm) = sum (predicted SMD from current date to nearest
    date of precipitation (Ndate)) //Total change in soil moisture till nearest precipitation
    date    Set THmax = minimum ((THmin + Rsm), THmax) // selection of minimum soil-
    moisture required to maintain crop growth    while (THmax > Csm) // condition
    for watering till soil moisture reaches its minimum required value.    {    Send
    1 to relay to start irrigation //Signal to Start Water motor    }    Send 0 to
    relay to stop irrigation //Signal to stop the water motor  } Else   {    Send
    0 to relay to stop irrigation //Signal to stop the water motor   }  } Else  {   Enter/Set
    date to start irrigation    If (current_date >= irrigation_date) // condition
    to start the irrigation at specify date    {     while (THmax > Csm)     {      Send
    1 to relay to start irrigation //Signal to start the water motor     }    }    Else    {     Send
    0 to stop irrigation //Signal to stop the water motor    }  } 3.2.3. Experimental
    setup The main objective of this experiment is to collect the physical parameters
    of a farming land using sensors and to utilize these sensors’ data along with
    weather forecast information for developing an algorithm for prediction of soil
    moisture of the upcoming days. The algorithm uses a hybrid machine learning approach,
    as discussed in Section 3.2, to achieve higher accuracy in soil moisture prediction.
    It provides a probable estimate of soil moisture to plan and provision the optimum
    irrigation. Statistical measures, R squared (Table 5) and Mean Squared Error (Table
    3, Table 5), are used for estimation of accuracy and error rate of the proposed
    algorithm. The experiment shows that a good estimation (close to the actual value)
    of the soil moisture (Table 4), with the help of field data and forecasted information,
    can be utilized for optimum irrigation with an effective utilization of natural
    rain. As described in Section 3.1, one field data collection device (node) has
    been deployed in the garden of our organization to collect the field data (Fig.
    2). The data is collected at the server using the web services. Then, the data
    is analyzed using the proposed machine learning approach (Section 3.2.1). Further,
    a responsive web based interface has been developed for real-time monitoring,
    data visualization and decision support system, and for the scheduling of irrigation.
    Fig. 4 shows the GUI of responsive web based interface for real-time monitoring
    and decision support system, which shows the current soil moisture recorded by
    the sensor, and the predicted soil moisture generated by the algorithm. This information,
    predicted soil moisture and precipitation information, will help user/farmer in
    planning/scheduling of optimum irrigation. Fig. 5 shows the GUI of irrigation
    planning module to schedule the irrigation by setting Irrigation Date, and Threshold
    Levels for Soil Moisture. It works in two modes, viz., auto, and manual, as discussed
    in Section 3.2.2. In manual mode, the user takes the scheduling decision based
    on predicted soil moisture and precipitation information. In auto mode, user sets
    the Soil Moisture Threshold levels, and the system automatically schedules the
    irrigation date based on the predicted soil moisture and weather forecast (precipitation)
    information. For example, if rain is expected on the scheduled irrigation date
    or near to scheduled date, then the system will wait for the rain and it will
    suspend the artificial/manual irrigation or it will start watering (if needed,
    based on the algorithm) the field to maintain minimum soil moisture till the arrival
    of rain. Further, the system can handle the changes in forecasted precipitation
    values. 4. Results and discussion The smartness of the proposed system is dependent
    on the accuracy of the predicted soil moisture (Table 4, Table 5). To verify the
    accuracy of soil moisture prediction algorithm, the hourly field data for air
    temperature, air humidity, soil moisture, soil temperature, and UV is collected
    for three weeks. The three weeks’ hourly data has been averaged out on per day
    basis and the 21 days’ data is divided into a training set (70% of the data) and
    testing set (30% of the data) for applying the proposed algorithm. Initially,
    we have predicted SMD of upcoming days using the proposed algorithm (Fig. 3) and
    the predicted values of SMD has been used in prediction of soil moisture of upcoming
    days. The results are summarized in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5. The SVR + k-means
    approach has higher accuracy with lower mean squared error over SVR approach while
    calculating SMD (Table 2 and Table 3). The graph (Fig. 6) shows that predicted
    SMD using proposed algorithm (SVR + k-means) is nearer to actual SMD as compared
    to predicted SMD using SVR only. The SVR + k-means approach has the same accuracy
    with the lower mean squared error over SVR approach in soil moisture prediction
    (Tables 4 and 5). The predicted soil moisture shown in Table 4 has been calculated
    based on soil moisture and SMD of previous day, e.g. soil moisture on 14-11-2017
    is 26.8982 then the soil moisture of the next day (15-11-2017) will be equal to
    the difference of soil moisture on the previous day (i.e., 14–11-2017) and SMD
    difference predicted for 15-11-2017 (Table 2). From the Tables 2 and 3, we have
    observed that the prediction of SMD using SVR + k-means approach gives higher
    accuracy with less MSE as compared to SVR approach, and we have also observed
    the same accuracy (R squared = 96%) with lesser MSE in prediction of soil moisture
    using combined approach (SVR + k-means) (Table 5). It shows that the proposed
    algorithm (based on SVR + k-means) is better as compared to SVR based approach.
    Due to higher accuracy and minimum MSE, SVR + k-means based hybrid machine learning
    algorithm has been used in irrigation planning module. 5. Conclusion The soil
    moisture is a critical parameter for developing a smart irrigation system. The
    soil moisture is affected by a number of environmental variables, e.g., air temperature,
    air humidity, UV, soil temperature, etc. With advancement in technologies, the
    weather forecasting accuracy has improved significantly and the weather forecasted
    data can be used for prediction of changes in the soil moisture. This paper proposes
    an IoT based smart irrigation architecture along with a hybrid machine learning
    based approach to predict the soil moisture. The proposed algorithm uses sensors’
    data of recent past and the weather forecasted data for prediction of soil moisture
    of upcoming days. The predicted value of the soil moisture is better in terms
    of their accuracy and error rate. Further, the prediction approach is integrated
    into a standalone system prototype. The system prototype is cost effective, as
    it is based on the open standard technologies. The auto mode makes it a smart
    system and it can be further customized for application specific scenarios. In
    future, we are planning to conduct a water saving analysis based on proposed algorithm
    with multiple nodes along with minimizing the system cost. Acknowledgements Authors

  description: In the traditional irrigation process, a huge amount of water consumption
    is required which leads to water wastage. To reduce the wasting of water for this
    tedious task, an intelligent irrigation system is urgently needed. The era of
    machine learning (ML) and the Internet of Things (IoT) brings it is a great advantage
    of building an intelligent system that performs this task automatically with minimal
    human effort. In this study, an IoT enabled ML-trained recommendation system is
    proposed for efficient water usage with the nominal intervention of farmers. IoT
    devices are deployed in the crop field to precisely collect the ground and environmental
    details. The gathered data are forwarded and stored in a cloud-based server, which
    applies ML approaches to analyze data and suggest irrigation to the farmer. To
    make the system robust and adaptive, an inbuilt feedback mechanism is added to
    this recommendation system. The experimentation, reveals that the proposed system
    performs quite well on our own collected dataset and National Institute of Technology
    (NIT) Raipur crop dataset.

  explanation: 'The study by Bhoi et al. (2021) proposes an automated irrigation system
    that uses IoT devices and machine learning (ML) algorithms to collect and analyze
    soil and environmental data, and then make irrigation recommendations to farmers.
    The proposed system consists of three levels: the crop field level, where sensors
    collect data on soil moisture, soil temperature, air temperature, and humidity;
    the cloud level, where the sensor data is stored and analyzed by ML algorithms
    to predict soil and environmental parameters and make irrigation recommendations;
    and the user level, where farmers interact with the system through an Android
    application to receive irrigation recommendations and control the irrigation system.'
  extract_1: From here onwards, the role of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence
    (AI) play an important role.
  extract_2: To make the system robust and adaptive, an inbuilt feedback mechanism
    is added to this recommendation system.

    irrigation process, a huge amount of water consumption is required which leads
    to water wastage. To reduce the wasting of water for this tedious task, an intelligent
    irrigation system is urgently needed. The era of machine learning (ML) and the
    Internet of Things (IoT) brings it is a great advantage of building an intelligent
    system that performs this task automatically with minimal human effort. In this
    study, an IoT enabled ML-trained recommendation system is proposed for efficient
    water usage with the nominal intervention of farmers. IoT devices are deployed
    in the crop field to precisely collect the ground and environmental details. The
    gathered data are forwarded and stored in a cloud-based server, which applies
    ML approaches to analyze data and suggest irrigation to the farmer. To make the
    system robust and adaptive, an inbuilt feedback mechanism is added to this recommendation
    system. The experimentation, reveals that the proposed system performs quite well
    on our own collected dataset and National Institute of Technology (NIT) Raipur

    text   Introduction Water is the essential natural resource for agriculture, and
    it is limited in nature (Kamienski et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Sahoo et al.,
    2019). In a country like India, a huge share of water is used for irrigation (Nawandar
    & Satpute, 2019). Crop irrigation is a noteworthy factor in determining plant
    yield, depending upon multiple climatic conditions such as air temperature, soil
    temperature, humidity, and soil moisture (Bavougian & Read, 2018). Farmers primarily
    rely on personal monitoring and experience for harvesting fields (Glaroudis, Iossifides
    & Chatzimisios, 2020). Water needs to be maintained in the field (Liu et al.,
    2020; Fremantle & Scott, 2017). Scarcity of water in these modern days is a hot
    issue. Such a scarcity is already affecting people worldwide (LaCanne & Lundgren,
    2018; Schleicher et al., 2017). The situation may worsen in the coming years.
    The uniform water distribution of traditional irrigation systems is not optimal.
    Hence, research effort has been exterted towards efficient agricultural monitoring
    system (Kim, Evans & Iversen, 2008). In this regard, standalone monitoring station
    is under development. For instance, a mixed signal processor (MSP430) has been
    developed with a microcontroller along with a set of meteorological sensors. A
    wireless sensor-based monitoring system has also been developed. It has made of
    several wireless sensor nodes and a gateway (Gutiérrez et al., 2013). It has been
    implemented as an easy solution with better spatial and temporal determinations.
    In addition, there is a demand for automating the irrigation system. Automation
    enables machines to apply intelligence by reading historical data and accordingly
    analyze and predict the output. This mechanism is more effective than the traditional
    rule-based algorithm (Chlingaryan, Sukkarieh & Whelan, 2018). From here onwards,
    the role of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) play an important
    role. The applications of ML in the field of agriculture domain is numerous (Jha
    et al., 2019). Starting from crop selection and yielding to crop disease prediction,
    different ML techniques like artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector
    machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and decision trees have shown huge success
    (Ge et al., 2019). After the great success of the combination of WSN and ML techniques,
    there is a requirement for more automation and without human intervention. The
    development of machine to machine (M2M) and the Internet of Things (IoT) allows
    devices to communicate with one another without much human intervention. These
    days, the usage of mobile devices is increasing, at the same time cloud computing
    is becoming a popular technology. The existing water monitoring system used wireless
    sensors for monitoring the soil condition for irrigation. These systems barely
    capture the data from the land and subsequently controls the electric motor for
    watering the land. Moreover, there is a high demand to analyze the real-time data
    based on the historical information for irrigating fields. Research on M2M system
    is limited, particularly regarding communication among devices to more intelligently
    perform analysis and recommendation. Realizing the water scarcity issue and at
    the same time the technological advancement, we are motivated to design a fully
    automated irrigation system. This system must be smart enough so that it can adapt
    to the local climatic conditions and precisely predict the decision on irrigation
    in a reliable way. There are many aspects of an efficient automatic irrigation
    system. As weather data is an important parameter for making irrigation decisions,
    the system must be smart enough to integrate the forecasted weather data (Goldstein
    et al., 2018). The next important aspect is to estimate the soil features properly
    so that the prediction error can be minimized in the irrigation recommendation
    system (Khoa et al., 2019). Once the weather data along with soil and environmental
    parameters are forecasted, the data can be used to make final decisions regarding
    irrigation. For this task, we need an efficient binary classifier to decide whether
    to irrigate or not. The advanced ML techniques and IoT may provide a solution.
    The two main motivations for this work are efficient water usage in irrigation
    to reduce water wastage and minimize human intervention as much as possible. The
    main objective of the work is to reduce water wastage in the agricultural field
    by introducing an IoT-enabled ML-trained recommendation system (IoT-IIRS). In
    this prototype, the analyzed information can be sent from the cloud server to
    the farmer’s mobile handset priorly. This system makes the decision of whether
    to water the field or not simple for farmers. The main contributions of this work
    are as follows: An IoT-IIRS is proposed for efficient water usage. IoT devices
    are deployed in the crop field to collect the ground and environmental details
    precisely. The gathered data such as air temperature, soil temperature, humidity,
    and soil moisture are forwarded through an Arduino and stored in a cloud-based
    server, which applies ML algorithms such as SVM, regression tree, and agglomerative
    clustering to analyze those data and suggest irrigation to the farmer. To make
    the system robust and adaptive, an inbuilt feedback mechanism is added to this
    recommendation system. Experimentation reveals that the proposed system performs
    well on our own collected dataset and NIT Raipur crop dataset. The remaining part
    of the paper is organized as follows. The next section introduces the related
    work. The proposed methodology section discusses the working steps for the solution
    framework. The results of the experiments are discussed in the result section.
    Finally, the last section ends with concluding remarks and further scope for improvement.
    Related work Communication is one of the most important aspects of the implementation
    of an automatic and intelligent irrigation system. In the last few years, significant
    research is carried out on smart irrigation. In Salas et al. (2014), the authors
    suggested the implementation of general packet radio service (GPRS) communication
    as a gateway between wireless sensor network (WSN) and the Internet. Numerous
    data transmission techniques have been applied in closed-loop watering systems.
    These are used to apply the required amount of water in the desired place in due
    time to conserve natural resources. Bhanu et al. presented a system to build a
    wireless sensor network-based soil moisture controller, which determines the water
    demand by differentiating the soil moisture with a preset threshold value (Bhanu,
    Hussain & Ande, 2014). Field authentication tests are regularly performed on distinct
    soils to estimate the soil moisture and water quantity in the soil to develop
    a productive watering system. If the preserved data do not match with the measured
    soil data, then an interrupt is passed to the pressure unit to stop the irrigation.
    Solar power-based intelligent irrigation system is proposed to provide the required
    amount of water to the crop field (Rehman et al., 2017). Soil and humidity sensors
    are deployed to measure the wet and dry states of the soil. Once sensing is completed,
    the sensor node transmits the signal to the microcontroller. In addition, they
    forward that signal to the relay to switch on and off the motor. In Kaur & Deepali
    (2017), the authors presented a WSN-based smart irrigation system for efficient
    water usage with the help of automated remote sensing and persistent analysis
    of soil parameters and environmental conditions using ML. Hema et al. proposed
    an approach to estimate the native real-time weather parameters for interpolation
    with the help of an automated weather station (ASW) (Hema & Kant, 2014). This
    intelligent system provides past, present, and future predictions utilizing nearby
    ASW data and control the irrigation process during conditions like rainfall. To
    control the irrigation, soil moisture and ASW data are exploited for error correction,
    where interpolated value is compared with soil moisture data. In Ashwini (2018),
    the authors stated that the smart irrigation system employing WSN and GPRS modules
    optimizes water utilization for any agricultural crop. This approach comprises
    of a distributed WSN along with different sensors, such as moisture and temperature
    sensors. Gateway components are employed to transfer data from the sensor unit
    to the base station. Direct order is sent to the actuator for regulating the irrigation
    process and handling data from the sensor unit. According to the need and conditions
    of the field, different algorithms are used in the system. It is programmed in
    a microcontroller that sends commands through an actuator to regulate water quantity
    with a valve unit. The entire framework is powered by photo-voltaic panels, where
    duplex communication takes place through cellular networks. Web applications control
    irrigation through regular monitoring and irrigation scheduling. In Leh et al.
    (2019), the authors designed hardware and software by analyzing the routing protocols
    of the sensor network. Mobile phones and wireless personal digital assistant (PDA)
    help to monitor the soil moisture content, as a result, irrigation system is controlled.
    Mohapatra et al. proposed an irrigation system based on WSN (Mohapatra, Lenka
    & Keswani, 2019). The designed system uses fuzzy logic and neural network to save
    water efficiently. The used fuzzy neural network is an integrated set of fuzzy
    logic reasoning and self-learning ability of a neural network. Sensor nodes measure
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity data. LAN or WAN helps
    to transfer the collected data to the irrigation control system via gateway nodes.
    The electromagnetic valve is controlled for precision irrigation based on the
    collected data. To predict the soil moisture, the authors in (Goap et al., 2018),
    developed an algorithm that works based on field sensor and weather forecasting
    data. The algorithm uses the support vector regression model and k-means clustering.
    This algorithm also provides a suggestion regarding irrigation based on the level
    of soil moisture. Collected device information and the output of the algorithm
    are stored in MySQL Database at the server end. In Gutiérrez et al. (2013), the
    authors presented a system that uses a camera to capture images. Captured images
    are processed to determine the water content of the soil. Depending on the level
    of water in the soil, water is pumped into the crop field. The camera is controlled
    from an Android application. The camera captures RGB pictures of soil using an
    anti-reflective glass window to find the wet and dry areas. The WiFi connection
    of the smartphone is used to transmit the estimated value to the gateway through
    a router to control the water pump. M2M communication is applied as a robust mechanism
    for effective water management during farm irrigation (Shekhar et al., 2017).
    In Vij et al. (2020), the authors proposed a distributed network environment using
    IoT, ML, and WSN technologies for efficient water usage and reduced soil erosion.
    Soil moisture prediction is one of the most important tasks for an automatic irrigation
    system. Many researchers contributed various methodologies and algorithms for
    this task (Adeyemi et al., 2018; Sinwar et al., 2020; Singh, Kaur & Kumar, 2020).
    Proposed methodology The proposed three-tier architecture along with the descriptions
    are mentioned in this section. The solution architecture of our smart irrigation
    system is given in Fig. 1. The details of each level are described below. Figure
    1: Solution framework.   Download full-size image DOI: 10.7717/peerj-cs.578/fig-1
    • Crop Field Level: The first one is the crop field level where different sensors
    are deployed in the field. Various sensors like soil moisture (EC- 1258), soil
    temperature (DS18B20), air temperature (DHT11), and humidity (DHT11) are used
    to gather all these soil and environmental attributes. All these sensors collect
    data and send them to the Arduino. The Arduino then forwards the sensor data to
    the cloud server. All these sensor data are collected twice a day and forwarded
    for cloud storage using a micro-controller device. The average value is calculated
    and stored as the final reading for the particular day. To eliminate the inter-dependency
    among the used parameters, the Pearson correlation is computed. It is found that
    there is no strong correlation exists. The Arduino is also connected to the motor
    pump through the breadboard and relay switch to turn on/off the pump for irrigation.
    Here, we use the Arduino microcontroller because it requires low energy. • Cloud
    Level: The second level is the cloud level where the cloud server is used to provide
    service to the user. The sensors’ data are stored in the database. The data are
    then feed to the ML-based model for analysis. This ML unit is the heart of this
    intelligent system, which has two sections. One is the regression model that is
    used to predict the soil and environmental parameters in advance. By doing so,
    it can be used effectively to improve the performance of the system. The parameters
    that are considered from forecasted weather data are the atmospheric pressure,
    precipitation, solar radiation, and wind speed. These predicted values are passed
    through a clustering model to reduce the predicted errors. The other ML-based
    model takes the results of the clustering model along with the forecasted weather
    data as input. This binary classification model categorizes the predicted samples
    into two predefined classes: irrigation required (Y) or not required (N). The
    results of these ML models are stored in the database for future actions. The
    last component of the cloud-based server is the handler used for coordination
    between the user and field units. Based on the suggestion of the ML model, the
    handler will send irrigation suggestions to the user via the Android application.
    Based on the agricultural literature, the formula used for calculating the water
    requirement is discussed in Eq. (1). (1) E V o ∗ C f = W need where, EVo = rate
    of evaporation Cf = crop factor Wneed = amount of water needed. • User Level:
    At the user level, the user interacts with an Android application to enter the
    details about the farmer and crop. Farmer credentials are used to authenticate
    the user through login operation. In crop details, the farmer may have to provide
    the information by selecting the drop-down menus like a session, crop name, total
    crop days, date of sowing, and so on. Through this application, the farmer may
    get all relevant information about the crop and field. Thus, upon receiving the
    sensor data along with the irrigation suggestion on the Android application, the
    user may order the on/off command to the microcontroller. Here, the system is
    an adaptive one that takes feedback from the user for each suggestion by the handler.
    If the farmer does not follow the recommendation, then feedback is sent to the
    server for updation. The system will be fine-tuned subsequently based on user
    feedback. The microcontroller upon receiving the on/off command from the user
    performs the motor on/off operation for the supply of water to plants. Thus, we
    have an automatic irrigation system, which can be used to increase the productivity
    of the crop by providing an optimal amount of water. The working steps of the
    proposed solution framework have shown in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1: Working steps
    for solution framework. Input: Authentication details for Login to Android application;
    All relevant crop information from the drop down list Output: Motor turn on/off
    1: Collect all sensor data at regular intervals through the Arduino. 2: Save the
    sensor readings in the cloud server database. 3: Using the weather forecasted
    data, the ML analyzer model analyzes these stored sensor data to check whether
    irrigation is required or not? 4: The recommendation of the ML model is forwarded
    to the Android through the handler. 5: Based on the ML recommendation and sensor
    readings the user will inform the Arduino to send an on/off signal to the motor.
    6: User may follow the recommendation and irrigate the field. 7: If the user does
    not follow the recommendation, then feedback will be sent and stored in the database
    for the corresponding sensor readings. DOI: 10.7717/peerj-cs.578/table-2 ML model
    As mentioned earlier, the ML analyzer is the main building block of our proposed
    system. On the stored sensor data, the regression tree (RT) algorithm is applied
    to predict future soil and environmental data. RTs may grasp non-linear relationships
    and are reasonably robust to outliers. These predicted parameters are further
    improved using the agglomerative clustering (AC) algorithm. It may be suitable
    for this task as the clusters are not supposed to be globular. The forecasted
    weather data are combined with the predicted soil data to be fed into the classification
    model. Then, the classifier categorizes the data sample whether irrigation is
    required or not at that time. This way, the ML technique helps the farmer with
    the suggestion for irrigation on the crop field. The details about this recommendation
    architecture is mentioned in Fig. 2. The working steps of the ML model are detailed
    in Algorithm 2. Figure 2: Architecture of ML-based model.   Download full-size

    Input: All sensor data and the forecasted weather data from Indian Meteorological
    Department (IMD) Output: Recommendation for irrigation required or not 1: Apply
    previously trained RT model on these sensor data to predict future soil and environmental
    data. 2: Apply AC algorithm for a more precise prediction of all these sensor
    parameters. 3: All predicted sensor parameters are combined with the forecasted
    weather data to prepare the final data samples. 4: Apply the previously trained
    SVM model on these final data samples. DOI: 10.7717/peerj-cs.578/table-3 RT RT
    is constructed via a procedure known as binary iterative splitting, which is a
    repetitive process that partition the data into branches, subbranches, and so
    on. Each decision node in the tree assesses the value of several input variable’s
    values. The leaf nodes of the RT carry the predicted output (response) variable
    (Torres-Barrán, Alonso & Dorronsoro, 2019). Here, the AdaBoost algorithm is applied
    using its library. AC AC is a type of hierarchical clustering that works on a
    bottom-up approach (Stashevsky et al., 2019). A fundamental assumption in hierarchical
    AC is that the merge operation is monotonic. Each scrutiny begins in its own cluster,
    and clusters merged as one moves up the hierarchy. This clustering may improve
    the performance of classical regression by partitioning the sample training space
    into subspaces. SVM SVM is a supervised ML model that works very well for many
    classification tasks (Lebrini et al., 2019). Once SVM is fed with sets of labeled
    training data for each class, they can be categorized into new samples. For non-linear
    classification, it performs well with a limited number of labeled training data.
    The prototype model and its deployment in the paddy field are depicted in Figs.
    3A and 3B separately. It contains all sensors, Arduino, GSM module, different
    connecting wires. Along with all these IoT devices, one power bank is used as
    the source of power. This power source may be replaced with a small solar panel
    with a battery in the future. The Arduino is used because of its low power consumption.
    The prototype of the android application is illustrated in Fig. 4A and the recommendation
    for the motor using the classification, of whether irrigation is required or not
    is shown in Fig. 4B. Figure 3: (A) Prototype model (B) Model deployment inside

    Results and discussion The performance of the proposed model has been evaluated
    using Python. All the ML models have been implemented using the Scikit-learn Python
    library. To validate the effectiveness of the system, our own collected data (GCEKIoTCommunity)
    (https://github.com/NitrrMCACommunity/Agriculture-Automation-) along with the
    Crops dataset of NIT Raipur (NitrrMCACommunity) (https://github.com/NitrrMCACommunity/Agriculture-Automation-/tree/master/Dataset)
    have been used. We have collected data like soil moisture, soil temperature, humidity,
    air temperature, and UV radiation by using the relevant sensors. The stored readings
    of each day are the average of all readings on that day. We gathered 150 samples
    from our simulation area. In the NIT Raipur dataset, there are 501 samples available.
    As mentioned earlier, we have integrated the forecasted weather data from Indian
    meteorological department site (IMD) (https://mausam.imd.gov.in/) by using weather
    application programming interface (APIs) (https://restapitutorial.com/). Through
    this, we have collected the data like next-day rainfall, amount of rainfall, precipitation,
    and so on of a particular area to make our irrigation accuracy even better. As
    the evening is the best time to irrigate, each day in the evening, the ML model
    runs. Based on its results, the handler sends irrigation suggestions to the farmer
    along with the stored and forecasted parameters. For the classification task,
    the five-fold cross-validation method is used for better generalization. The efficiency
    of the system is estimated based on the most extensively used measures, such as
    precision, recall, F1-measure, and accuracy (A). Mathematically, these measures
    are represented in Eqs. (2) to (4). (2) Precision( P r )= T p T p + F p (3) Recall(
    R c )= T p T p + F n (4) F1−measure(F1)= 2∗ P r ∗ R c P r + R c where Tp, Fp,
    and Fn are denoted as true positives, false positives, and false negatives, respectively.
    The results of different ML models for classification are given in Table 1. The
    different performance evaluations of the proposed model on our own collected dataset
    are shown in Fig. 5A and 5B respectively. Similarly, the performance evaluation
    of the proposed model on NIT Raipur crop dataset is depicted in Figs. 6A and 6B
    respectively. The experimental results show that the performance of our system
    is quite satisfactory for this automation task. The performance of this system
    may further improve with experience as new data will be collected. The user feedback
    will further fine-tune this system even if there are a few wrong suggestions.
    The experimental results clearly demonstrate that the SVM-based model outperforms
    other classification models on both datasets. Of the two datasets, the NIT Raipur
    crop dataset performs better, which may be due to the larger number of samples
    present in it. Figure 5: Performance evaluation of proposed model on our own collected

    future work In this work, a smart irrigation system prototype for efficient usage
    of water and minimal human intervention is proposed. The proposed recommendation
    system includes regression of soil and environmental attributes, which are further
    improved with the help of AC. Forecasted weather data are integrated with these
    predicted attributes to reduce the irrigation error. Finally, the classification
    model is used to categorize the combined set of attributes for the suggestion
    of irrigation is required or not. Based on these results, the system recommends
    the farmer for the next irrigation. If the farmer rejects the approval, then feedback
    is sent to the system. Further, it updates and fine-tunes the model subsequently.
    The experiment reveals that the SVM model outperforms other classification models
    on both datasets. As the ML-based models are data hungry, there is a strong intuition
    that the proposed system will perform even better with more samples. This system
    can be further extended to deciding on spraying appropriate chemicals for proper
    growth of crop. Supplemental Information Code and data. All the ML models have
    implemented using the Scikit-learn Python library. To validate the effectiveness
    of the system NIT Raipur and our own collected data have been used. DOI: 10.7717/peerj-cs.578/supp-1   Download

  description: In the semi-arid Pacific Northwest of USA, where less than 20 centimeters
    (8 in) of total annual precipitation occurs, exists the world's largest contiguous
    drip irrigated farm of 10 360 hectares (25 600 acres), managed by Greenwood Resources
    Inc. and known as the Boardman Tree Farm (BTF). On this farm, 10 000 000 fast-growing
    Pacific Albus (Hybrid Poplar) trees are irrigated by a massive and complex automated
    water distribution system. Irrigation pumping energy is a major crop production
    cost, so a very aggressive and determined effort is made to operate the irrigation
    system efficiently and cost effectively. Some of the practices are the use of
    innovative design for closed-loop drip irrigation system, Advanced Scientific
    Irrigation Management (ASIM), automated soil moisture sensing and the use of one
    of the most advanced and sophisticated Irrigation Supervisory Control and Data
    Acquisition (I-SCADA) systems in the world. Additionally the use of an original
    and innovative methodology incorporating a customized Advance Hydraulic Balanced
    Irrigation Scheduling (AHBIS) computer program, for smooth and steady multiple
    pump stations hydraulic operation. With the impressive use of innovative computerized
    irrigation water management methodologies, together with precise and accurate
    automated application of irrigation water quantities, the Boardman Tree Farm achieves
    astonishing high overall on-farm irrigation efficiencies. The Boardman Tree Farm
    offers a show-case example where latest computerized technology and human ingenuity
    are utilized to drip irrigate vast areas of semi-arid land, while minimizing the
    use of scare water and energy resources and still maintaining a eco-friendly sustainable
    rate of fiber production. On a global scale, the Boardman Tree Farm can help foster
    global advancement of large-scale drip irrigation projects that efficiently use
    water and energy to produce cost effective and sustainable eco-friendly production
    of Agro-Forestry crops and help mitigate effects of global warming.

  description: Automated control systems in irrigation have in recent years made considerable
    progress, offering a wide range of new options. In this experiment, a closed loop
    control system based on the relationship of electrical resistance and soil moisture
    was used to test the performence of the automated drip irrigation system for pepper
    (Capsicum annuum L.) growth. A main strategy for irrigation was determined before
    irrigation events and the pot (100kω) in the circuit was adjusted to the strategy
    determined before, thereafter a signal was produced by the electrodes embedded
    in the substrate whenever soil moisture reached to the threshold level. Therefore,
    the system took over irrigation events, started and stopped the irrigations throughout
    the entire growing season. The irrigation times and amounts of irrigation water
    applied by the system was not suitable for uniform crop production, because irrigation
    throuhout the whole growing season was commenced as almost 55% of the available
    soil moisture was depleted from field capacity (FC).

  description: A closed loop, remote sensing and control system for automatic irrigation
    scheduling was developed and implemented to demonstrate the effect of automatic
    scheduling on water conservation. The system was based on continuous sensing of
    the soil water potential, using transducer-tensiometers located at various locations
    and depths throughout the field area. The collected data were continuously analyzed
    for specified threshold level of soil matric potential to decide when to start
    and stop a center pivot irrigation system on wheat. When the condition for start
    or stop irrigation was met, the computer automatically sent commands to start
    (or stop) the irrigation cycle. The system worked satisfactorily under arid conditions.
    The results of the automatic scheduling technique demonstrated that the average
    yield for three seasons increased by 8% and the average water saving was 24% as
    compared with that obtained by common scheduling practice. The average reduction
    in machinery and equipment working hours was 26.8%.

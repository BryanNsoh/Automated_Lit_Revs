- explanation: 'This study introduces a novel irrigation scheduling framework that
    combines three machine learning paradigms (unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement
    learning) with model predictive control and multi-agent principles to design a
    precise irrigation scheduler for large-scale fields. The proposed framework offers
    several key advantages.

    - **Accurate and computationally efficient soil moisture modeling:** The framework
    employs long short-term memory (LSTM) models to directly model the dynamic behavior
    of root zone soil moisture content in each irrigation management zone, while accounting
    for the time-varying nature of the rooting depth.

    - **Management zone delineation tailored to agro-hydrological modeling:** A three-stage
    process with a k-means clustering approach is utilized to accurately delineate
    irrigation management zones. This process includes elevation and estimated soil
    hydraulic parameters as attributes, resulting in optimized management zones suitable
    for agro-hydrological modeling.

    - **Enhanced computational efficiency of the mixed-integer model predictive control
    (MPC) framework:** A multi-agent MPC paradigm is adopted where decentralized hybrid
    actor-critic agents and the concept of a limiting management zone are employed
    to enhance the computational efficiency of the scheduler.

  data_sources: null
  explanation: The objective of this study is to evaluate the potential of integrating
    real-time monitoring and remote control devices into existing flood irrigation
    practices in rice farming. The authors conducted a pilot study using a rice farm
    in Cascina Ca' Granda Milano, Italy, where they implemented a coordinated, centralized
    flowrate regulation system using automatic gates located at strategic points in
    the farm's irrigation network. The system was designed to maintain a predetermined
    ponding water level in the fields, ensuring consistent and reliable irrigation
    flows throughout the farm. The effectiveness of the automated system was compared
    to the traditional decentralized management of gates, which simulates the operations
    typically carried out manually by farmers.
  extract_1: The results show that the proportional-integral control reproduces the
    actions that the farmer uses when faced with situations of surplus of water in
    the fields or a shortage of water in the farm canal. In particular, the general
    coordination of the gates is lost, and the individual binomial field-gate prevails
    as an independent system in the farmer's operation.
  extract_2: Conversely, non-linear predictive control coordinates the gate operation
    to obtain a uniform ponding water level in the fields when there is a shortage
    of water, or significant water conservation when there is an excess of water as
    a result of rainfall.
  inline_citation: (Zoffoli and Gangi, 2023)
  key_findings: The study found that the centralized, non-linear predictive control
    approach outperformed the traditional decentralized, proportional-integral control
    approach for maintaining a predetermined ponding water level in the fields, with
    better coordination of gate operations and improved water conservation.
  limitations: The study was conducted on a single rice farm and the results may not
    be generalizable to other irrigation systems or different rice varieties.
  main_objective: To evaluate the potential of integrating real-time monitoring and
    remote control devices into existing flood irrigation practices in rice farming.
  relevance_evaluation: The study is relevant to the review because it directly addresses
    the issue of automating irrigation systems for real-time management of water resources
    in rice cultivation. The authors propose a centralized control approach that integrates
    real-time monitoring and remote control of gates to improve water use efficiency

    Mechanistic Crop Growth Model Predictive Control for Precision Irrigation in Rice.
    In 2021 European Control Conference (ECC). IEEE.
  data_sources: Experimental data from rice field simulations and weather forecasts
  explanation: This study by Cabrera et al. (2021) investigates the implementation
    of closed-loop control and feedback mechanisms to enhance irrigation management
    systems for rice cultivation. Using mechanistic crop growth models within a Model
    Predictive Control (MPC) framework, the authors propose a novel approach called
    Crop Growth MPC (CG-MPC). CG-MPC aims to mitigate the adverse effects of reduced
    water consumption on crop yield by integrating crop growth dynamics into the MPC
    framework.
  extract_1: '"Based on water savings and yield reduction, results show that Safe-AWD
    has the greatest irrigation conservation while WB-MPC and CG-MPC can be designed
    to have comparable water usage. However, CG-MPC produced the best yield reduction
    and has minimal variance across different field scenario simulations. This presents
    design opportunities for tuning risk trade-offs between yield reduction and water
    savings."'
  extract_2: '"By integrating crop growth dynamics into the MPC framework, our results
    indicate greater precision in mitigating the adverse effects of reduced water
    consumption across different fields and seasons."'
  inline_citation: (Cabrera et al., 2021)
  key_findings: The proposed CG-MPC approach demonstrated superior performance compared
    to traditional ponding irrigation, Safe-AWD, and WB-MPC in terms of yield reduction
    mitigation and water savings. CG-MPC achieved comparable water usage to WB-MPC
    while significantly reducing yield reduction and maintaining high precision across
    different field conditions.
  limitations: 'The study acknowledges several limitations:


    * The assumption of standard fertilizer application.

    * Ignoring the delaying effect on crop growth due to severe drought stress.

    * Considering a constant depth for crop root reach to available water in the soil.'
  main_objective: To develop and evaluate a novel Crop Growth MPC (CG-MPC) approach
    that integrates mechanistic crop growth models into a control framework to enhance
    irrigation management and mitigate the adverse effects of reduced water consumption

    closed-loop control and feedback mechanisms in automated irrigation management
    systems. The proposed CG-MPC approach fits well within the section and subsection
    focusing on monitoring and ensuring system reliability, specifically in relation
    to closed-loop control and feedback mechanisms. The study's findings are particularly
    applicable to the development of end-to-end automated irrigation systems that

  data_sources: Weather data, crop growth simulation data from DSSAT
  explanation: The provided paper investigates the use of model-based irrigation control
    using model predictive control (MPC) and the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology
    Transfer (DSSAT) crop simulator. The study evaluates the performance of an MPC-based
    irrigation control scheme in comparison to a rule-based irrigation plan from DSSAT.
    The MPC scheme leverages DSSAT to improve system modeling without field data and
    realistically assess the performance of different irrigation control strategies.
    Empirical results show that MPC can achieve similar crop yield with less total
    irrigation water amount compared to the DSSAT default plan.
  extract_1: '"It is shown that although the MPC model does not consider the water
    stress for the crop, which DSSAT uses for the rule-based irrigation plan, with
    a careful determination of a growth-stage-based moisture trajectory as the set-point,
    MPC can achieve similar crop yield with less total irrigation water amount."'
  extract_2: '"The total amount of effective irrigation is 156 mm after scaling with
    an irrigation efficiency factor [19]. The efficiency factor is set to 90% based
    on the default irrigation management setting of DSSAT. For MPC2, the total effective
    irrigation is 260 mm. The cumulative effective irrigation amounts are shown in
    Figure 5 where the default irrigation plan from DSSAT (with total effective irrigation
    of 274 mm) is also shown. It can be seen that MPC2 provides similar irrigation
    as the DSSAT default plan, except that at the beginning MPC2 irrigate significantly
    more in order to track the moisture set-point, while MPC1 almost stopped irrigation
    after 65 days after sowing (DAS)."'
  inline_citation: (Jang, Tian, & He, 2022)
  key_findings: MPC can achieve similar crop yield with less total irrigation water
    amount compared to a rule-based irrigation plan from DSSAT. The MPC-based irrigation
    control scheme can be effectively implemented using a DSSAT-based system model
    that incorporates crop growth dynamics.
  limitations: The paper acknowledges several limitations, including not considering
    uncertainties in the disturbances and the discrepancy between the system model
    and the simulator. These limitations could be addressed in future work.
  main_objective: To evaluate the performance of a model predictive control (MPC)
    based irrigation control scheme using the DSSAT crop simulator.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper is highly relevant to the point of implementing
    feedback loops and using control techniques for automated irrigation systems.
    It specifically focuses on the use of MPC, a closed-loop control technique, for
    optimizing irrigation schedules based on real-time data. The paper provides a
    detailed description of the MPC-based irrigation control scheme and its evaluation
    using the DSSAT crop simulator. This aligns well with the intention of the review
    to explore closed-loop control and feedback mechanisms for enhancing the reliability
    of automated irrigation systems.

    provides a practical example of implementing a closed-loop control system using
    a PID algorithm for automated irrigation scheduling. The use of real-time data
    to adjust irrigation schedules directly addresses the need for reliable and efficient
    irrigation management in soilless culture, where water and nutrients must be precisely

    “The efficient and effective use of water is considered the main driver for improving
    sustainability in irrigated agriculture. Conventional irrigation practices apply
    water uniformly over a field resulting in a high volume of water use. Overirrigation
    may also result from this practice which causes leaching of nitrates and nutrients
    into ground water sources. Precision irrigation presents a promising platform
    for improving sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This is especially hinged

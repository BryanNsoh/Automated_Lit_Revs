  explanation: The overarching goal of this systematic review is to examine the current
    state and future prospects of closed-loop, automated irrigation systems for real-time
    management applications. Specifically, it seeks to identify the potential benefits
    and limitations of these systems in terms of water conservation, agricultural

    at developing a model predictive control (MPC) strategy for water saving drip
    irrigation experiment that will regulate the soil moisture content within the
    desired field capacity and above the wilting point, while scheduling irrigation
    to replace the loss of water from soil and plant due to evapotranspiration in
    the greenhouse environment.

    the control water mixed with fertilizer. To achieve enhancement of controller
    an Internet of Things (IoT) integration was used for easy soil, weather, and plant
    monitoring which are used to update the MPC model for the irrigation control.

    plant water demand.

  data_sources: The primary data sources used in the analysis are discrete-time samples
    for the process states and known inputs.
  explanation: The study proposes a new approach to the constrained state estimation
    problem for nonlinear processes. This problem is solved by developing a data-driven
    moving horizon estimation (MHE) scheme, which is built upon a Koopman linear model.
    The Koopman linear model is obtained using the extended dynamic mode decomposition
    (EDMD) algorithm. The superiority of the proposed approach over the existing conventional
    methods is demonstrated through simulations on a four-reactor chemical process
    and experiments on a quadruple water-tank system.
  extract_1: In this paper, we address a constrained state estimation problem for
    general nonlinear processes within the Koopman operator framework. Specifically,
    we consider nonlinear processes of which the operation can be subject to various
    constraints on, for example, process states and disturbances.
  extract_2: The proposed method is based on the identified Koopman model and are
    capable of handling hard constraints on process states and noise.
  inline_citation: (Yin et al., 2018)

    MHE scheme can effectively handle constrained state estimation problems for general
    nonlinear processes. 2. The proposed approach outperforms the conventional methods
    both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. 3. The proposed approach
    can be applied to real-world scenarios, as demonstrated by the experiments on
    a quadruple water-tank system.'
  limitations: The choice of the basis functions can affect the EDMD-based Koopman
    modeling performance significantly. The proposed method is able to formulate a
    convex quadratic program instead of designing a nonlinear MHE estimator, such
    that non-convex optimization problems which may be encountered in the nonlinear
    context are bypassed.

    estimation problem for general nonlinear processes within the Koopman operator
    framework.

  explanation: The study focuses on addressing the challenge of sustainable water
    management by investigating cost-saving, environmentally friendly, and socially
    fair automated irrigation systems. The study's primary focus is to replace the
    current supply-based water allocation mechanism in the Indus Basin Irrigation
    System (IBIS) with a closed-loop demand-based system that integrates advanced
    sensing technology for water level monitoring and IoT based data transfer. VCG
    auction based pricing is proposed to ensure fair and efficient distribution of
    available water resources. The paper presents a case study to compare the proposed
    mechanism with the traditional warabandi water distribution mechanism.
  extract_1: In the proposed approach, each farmer is interested in buying a shared
    resource, i.e., surface water. The shared resource is regulated by a central planner
    or principal agent. The entire season is divided into intervals of fixed duration
    T. At the beginning of each interval, the principal-agent solicits the valuations
    and demands of the players regarding the shared resource. Then based on the valuations
    and demands received by the principal and the availability of the shared resource,
    the resource is distributed among the farmers.

    of a farmer participation in the bidding process. Note that in the bidding, if
    Dn(k) = 0, i.e., a farmer n who did not receive surface water in k’th interval
    will not have to pay.

    water and a corresponding reduction in wastage. The proposed mechanism also shows

  explanation: In this paper, the authors propose a crop growth model-based model
    predictive control (CG-MPC) scheme for precision irrigation in rice fields. The
    CG-MPC integrates crop growth dynamics into an MPC framework to improve the precision
    and robustness of irrigation management. Compared with traditional water balance-based
    MPC (WB-MPC) and the empirical rule-based Safe-Alternate Wetting and Drying (Safe-AWD)
    method, the proposed CG-MPC demonstrated superior performance in terms of mitigating
    adverse effects on crop yield while achieving significant water savings during
    the rice planting season. The model predicts crop growth (leaf area index, biomass,
    and grain yield) and water balance dynamics in the field. The study highlights
    the importance of considering crop physiological dynamics in irrigation management
    to optimize water use and minimize yield reduction, particularly under water scarcity
    scenarios due to climate change.
  extract_1: The proposed CG-MPC scheme leverages crop growth dynamics to improve
    the precision and robustness of irrigation management, leading to better mitigation
    of yield reduction and water savings compared to traditional WB-MPC and Safe-AWD
    methods.
  extract_2: Numerical simulations indicate that the CG-MPC approach outperforms WB-MPC
    and Safe-AWD in tracking optimal crop growth trajectories, resulting in minimal
    yield reduction and variance across different field scenarios.
  inline_citation: (Cabrera et al., 2021)
  key_findings: The proposed CG-MPC scheme achieved both significant water savings
    and minimal yield reduction compared to traditional WB-MPC and Safe-AWD methods.
    The CG-MPC approach demonstrated superior performance in tracking optimal crop
    growth trajectories, particularly in mitigating the adverse effects of water stress
    on yield. The integration of crop growth dynamics into MPC provides greater precision
    and robustness in irrigation management, enabling optimal trade-offs between water
    use and crop yield.
  limitations: The study assumes that fertilizer application is within standard management,
    ignores the delaying effect on crop growth due to severe drought stress, and considers
    the depth where crop roots can reach available water in the soil as constant,
    which may limit its applicability to certain conditions.
  main_objective: To develop and evaluate a CG-MPC scheme for precision irrigation
    in rice fields, considering both crop growth dynamics and water balance.
  relevance_evaluation: This paper addresses the integration of crop growth models
    and control techniques for real-time irrigation management, which aligns well
    with the focus on integration, interoperability, and standardization in the subsection
    on closed-loop control and feedback mechanisms. The authors propose a CG-MPC scheme
    that utilizes crop growth dynamics within an MPC framework, offering improved
    precision and robustness in irrigation management. The study compares the performance
    of CG-MPC to WB-MPC and Safe-AWD, demonstrating the advantages of the proposed
    approach in mitigating yield reduction while achieving water savings.

  data_sources: Intermittent soil moisture measurements from UAVs
  explanation: This study proposes a novel way to estimate soil moisture using intermittent
    data gathered by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The approach is model-free and
    relies solely on data, making it adaptable to various field conditions. The proposed
    method is based on the assumption that soil moisture dynamics can be described
    by a linear system influenced by external meteorological factors. The main objective
    is to develop a data-driven intermittent observer that can estimate soil moisture
    levels based on limited measurements from UAVs.

    presented in [26], [27], is based on intermittent soil moisture measurements provided
    by a certain number of UAVs flying over a specific area. The environmental conditions

  key_findings: The proposed data-driven intermittent observer can effectively estimate
    soil moisture levels based on limited measurements from UAVs. The method is model-free
    and relies solely on data, making it adaptable to various field conditions.
  limitations: One potential limitation of the proposed method is that it assumes
    a linear relationship between soil moisture dynamics and external meteorological
    factors. In reality, soil moisture dynamics can be influenced by various non-linear
    factors, such as soil heterogeneity, root water uptake, and evapotranspiration.
    Future research could explore the development of non-linear estimation techniques
    to address this limitation.
  main_objective: To develop a data-driven intermittent observer that can estimate
    soil moisture levels based on limited measurements from UAVs.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper is highly relevant to the point in my literature
    review that focuses on implementing feedback loops for automated irrigation systems
    using control techniques like PID, MPC, or FLC. The study provides a novel approach
    to estimating soil moisture, which is a critical input for designing effective
    irrigation control systems. The data-driven nature of the proposed method makes
    it particularly applicable to real-world scenarios where accurate soil moisture
    data is often limited or unavailable.

- explanation: 'There are several references in this paper ("Real-Time Flow Rate Spraying
    for Precision Requirement in Precision Agriculture Using Unmanned Aerial Spraying
    Systems: A Review") that discuss the role of sensors, specifically hyperspectral
    imaging sensors, in precision agriculture and the optimization of flow rates for
    different spraying needs. While many of the references touch on the use of sensors
    in a general sense, the following references provide more specific and detailed
    information on the use of hyperspectral imaging for precision agriculture and
    flow rate optimization:


    1. **Reference 1:** This reference discusses the use of hyperspectral imaging
    to detect plant diseases and pests, which can inform decisions about the application
    of pesticides and other chemicals. The reference also mentions the use of hyperspectral
    imaging to assess plant health and vigor, which can provide insights into the
    need for additional nutrients or other interventions.


    2. **Reference 2:** This reference presents a study that used hyperspectral imaging
    to classify weeds in a field. The study found that hyperspectral imaging was able
    to accurately identify weeds, which allowed for targeted spraying of herbicides,
    reducing the amount of chemicals used and the potential for environmental harm.


    3. **Reference 3:** This reference describes a system that uses hyperspectral
    imaging to map soil properties. The system can identify areas of the field that
    are deficient in nutrients, allowing for targeted application of fertilizers and
    other soil amendments. This precision approach can optimize crop yields and reduce
    the amount of chemicals used.


    These references demonstrate the potential of hyperspectral imaging for precision
    agriculture and flow rate optimization. By providing detailed information about
    the condition of crops and soils, hyperspectral imaging can help farmers make
    informed decisions about the application of pesticides, fertilizers, and other
    inputs. This can lead to increased yields, reduced environmental impact, and improved
    profitability.'

- explanation: Closed-loop control means that the output of a system is measured and
    used to adjust the input. In the context of real-time irrigation management, this
    means that the output (e.g., soil moisture) is measured and used to adjust the
    input (e.g., irrigation water flow). This ensures that the output is maintained
    at a desired set point. The paper proposes using proportional-integral-derivative
    (PID), model predictive control (MPC), or fuzzy logic control (FLC) to implement
    closed-loop control in the digital twin.

    is designed for an irrigation canal reach using a design technique called quantitative
    feedback control theory (QFT). The performance of this controller is compared
    to a proportional, integral, derivative (PID) controller and a linear quadratic
    regulator (LQR) controller. In this study, the QFT controller is designed for
    a single canal reach because it best demonstrates how a controller is designed.
    Previous research for this canal model provided data for comparison. For the operating
    conditions that are defined in this paper, the QFT controller is shown to have
    slightly better performance than the PID controller and better performance than
    the LQR controller. When the canal hydraulic roughness is increased, the QFT controller
    still performed better than the PID controller. Introduction Throughout the world,
    there is an increasing demand for fresh water. As rural, environmental, and urban
    demands increase, new approaches must be investigated to stretch the limited water
    supply. In some areas, people have limited water allocations and they have learned
    to conserve and achieve the greatest benefit from a limited supply. Through improved
    knowledge and skills, farmers with limited water supplies have improved crop yields.
    As farmers’ knowledge and skill improve, more timely and accurate water deliveries
    are required. Water supply companies and irrigation districts are also learning
    to conserve water through improved management methods. In some cases, water is
    conserved by upgrading the delivery system, while in other cases, water is conserved
    by automating existing canal gates (Walker and Stringam 1999). This paper discusses
    the design and testing of a downstream controller for a single reach (local controller).
    This controller is designed using a technique called quantitative feedback control
    theory (QFT). The controller is designed for a single reach because it serves
    as an example that best explains the design methods. This paper does not use the
    multiple reach examples defined by the ASCE test cases (Clemmens et al. 1998)
    because these cases are for multiple reaches in series. The QFT method is demonstrated
    for a canal model that is reported by Reddy (1990). This model is used because
    data are provided to make comparisons. A description of a QFT design for a single
    reach is required before a multireach design can be explained. QFT controllers
    can be designed to operate multiple reaches (global system or global controller)
    but the basic design techniques have to first be explained for a single reach.
    A global QFT controller will be reported in a subsequent paper. Background On
    the majority of canal systems, flow rates and water control depths are varied
    throughout the irrigation season. In addition, canal hydraulic parameters change
    over time. In control terms, the system is time varying. This is especially true
    for earthen canals because weeds grow throughout the year, embankments degrade,
    sediment collects in various places, and seepage changes throughout the season.
    Even concrete-lined canals experience changes (Rogers 1997). In addition, it is
    virtually impossible to determine exact canal parameters for many earthen canals.
    If the canal was constructed several years ago, the original design specifications
    may have been lost or misplaced. Even if the specifications were available, the
    canal system is not likely to be in the same condition as the day it was constructed.
    For these reasons, a control system that operates optimally must be sensitive
    to changes in canal system parameters and handle varied operational control-depth
    set points. The various automation methods that have been developed for canal
    automation are diverse in their design and implementation. The control methods
    that have been studied may be categorized into three areas: process control, heuristic
    control, and analytical methods. A simple mathematical model that simulates canal
    hydraulics may be used in process control design. However, canal hydraulics can
    be difficult to accurately model. This is especially true with earthen canals.
    Heuristic Control Heuristic methods (trial and error designs coupled with canal
    operations experience) were developed because of the difficulty of deriving an
    accurate canal model. Examples of heuristic canal controllers are the CARDD (Burt
    1983), BIVAL (Chevereau and Schwartz-Benezeth 1987), and UMA (UMA Engineering
    Ltd. 1989) methods. Parrish (1994) proposed a method similar to the UMA and CARDD
    methods. Analytical Control Analytical methods develop control algorithms based
    on hydraulic equations. Technically, the analytical methods described by Wylie
    (1969), Falvey and Luning (1979), and Liu et al. (1992) are feed-forward methods.
    Even though this paper describes a downstream feedback controller, the feed forward
    control method is mentioned because the desired outcome is to control a downstream
    water level. Process Control Methods Several process control methods have been
    developed over the past 50 years. The most prevalent and successful is proportional,
    integral, derivative (PID) control. This method is a subclass of the frequency
    design control method (Dorf 1992; Phillips and Harbor 1991; and Stephanopoulos
    1984). PID control has demonstrated a great degree of robustness in many applications.
    It is used extensively in industrial applications because of its robust nature.
    The Laplace form (Phillips and Harbor 1991) of this control equation is shown
    below G ( s ) = K d s 2 + K p s + K i s (1) where G ( s ) represents the controller
    or compensator transfer function; K p = proportional gain; K i = integral gain;
    K d = derivative gain; and s = Laplace operator term. A control algorithm may
    include all three components or some of these components. The majority of downstream
    controllers do not use the derivative component because it is hard to tune for
    long time delays. This controller can be designed/tuned using a system model equation
    and frequency design techniques. A controller can also be developed using an empirical
    design method such as the Ziegler-Nichols tuning method (Stephanopoulos 1984).
    El-Flo (Ploss 1987) used a simplified form of the PID controller where the derivative
    component is not used, but the proportional component and, to some extent, the
    integral component are used. Wahlin and Clemmens (2002) also used a proportional
    integral (PI) controller to operate a series of canal reaches. The PI controller
    was tuned by trial and error for one reach, then an additional reach was added
    to the system and the system was retuned. Wahlin (2004) developed a downstream
    controller with a feed-forward component. Litrico and Fromion (2006) used an analytical
    design method to develop a downstream PI controller. The PID equation has an additional
    “ s ” term [Eq. (1)] in the numerator, indicating that there is an excess of zeros
    (numerator roots) over poles (denominator roots). Thus, there is a potential for
    instability. A stable controller design will have equal poles and zeros or more
    poles than zeros. This makes tuning or selecting gains very important because
    poorly selected gains can create a controller that has ranges of instability.
    Often, systems exhibit varied responses throughout the entire operation range
    and multiple gains or gain scheduling (Stephanopoulos 1984) may be needed. State-space
    design is another process control method that has been used to develop canal controllers
    (Balogun et al. 1988; Reddy 1990; Clemmens et al. 1997; Schuurmans 1997). Reddy
    (1990) developed a single pool controller while the other researchers focused
    on multireach control systems. Reddy used linear quadratic regulator (LQR) theory
    to design the controller for a single research. State-space methods require a
    reasonable system model for controller design. Defining a reasonable model is
    as difficult for state-space design as it is for frequency design control methods.
    The system model must be linearized and often simplified to determine the required
    control gains. In the case of a canal system, the control routine requires a linearized
    system for one control depth, roughness, and flow rate. If any of these parameters
    change significantly, a new set of gains is required to optimally control the
    canal gates. This problem can be dealt with using a technique called gain scheduling,
    but this technique can be complicated and difficult to properly program into the
    control code (Stephanopoulos 1984). QFT A process control method termed QFT can
    be used to design control algorithms for systems that have uncertain or time-varying
    parameters (Horowitz 1993). QFT is a frequency design control method that is used
    to develop a feedback controller/compensator. This design method incorporates
    differential, integral, and proportional control components similar to PID, but
    these components are balanced to insure stability. This method was developed with
    the understanding that it is impossible to develop a mathematical relationship
    that exactly models a real system. This design method can be used to design a
    canal controller, but the variability in canal parameters must be determined for
    the entire operational range. These parameters are then used to construct a design
    region/boundary on a Nichols chart (Horowitz 1993). If the designer does not cross
    this boundary, the controller is guaranteed to be stable through the entire operation
    range. System Model QFT requires a system model or extensive testing to determine
    the design boundary. Schuurmans (1997) conducted extensive research to develop
    a simplified process model that can be used for canal controller design. The model
    is simpler than the St. Venant equations and takes the following form: P u ( s
    ) = e − T s A s (2) where P u ( s ) = variable that represents the “plant” or
    in this case the canal; e − T s = time -delay function; T = time delay (s); A
    = surface area of the backwater curve ( m 2 ) ; and s = Laplace operator. Schuurmans
    et al. (1999) described how values can be determined for A and T . Canal Model
    The canal dimensions that are used to design a downstream controller were taken
    from Reddy (1990). Reddy used a state-space method to design a local downstream
    controller. The canal has a length of 5,000 m, a longitudinal channel slope of
    0.0003, a side slope of 1.0, a bottom width of 1.70 m, a Manning roughness of
    0.016, an upstream reservoir elevation of 103.2 m, a downstream reservoir elevation
    of 101.14 m, an upstream canal invert of 102 m, a downstream canal invert of 99.94
    m, and a downstream target depth of 1.2 m. The canal model is initially operated
    with a constant flow rate of 3.02 m 3 / s . The turnout flow at the end of this
    canal is 2.50 m 3 / s and the flow at the end of the canal is 0.52 m 3 / s . QFT
    Controller Design While QFT can be used to design a global control system, the
    design of a local controller must first be understood. The remainder of this paper
    will describe the design of a local downstream controller for a single canal reach.
    A nonlinear model that numerically solves the St. Venant equations (Stringam 1998)
    was used to develop model parameters for A and T . The values were determined
    using a method described by Schuurmans (1997). Values ranging from 9,197 to 9,290
    m 2 were obtained for A and 1,200–1,300 s for T . These values where inserted
    into Eq. (2) and the frequency response of each equation was plotted on a Bode
    plot (Fig. 1). From the values for area and time, crossover frequencies of 1.01
    × 10 − 5 and 9.09 × 10 − 6 rad / s were measured on a Bode plot (Fig. 1). Fig.
    1. Bode plot for A = 9 , 120 m 2 and T = 1 , 300 s This plot is obtained by placing
    a range of frequencies into the model equation and the resulting values are placed
    on the Bode plot. The point where the plot of the system equation model crosses
    over the 0-dB line on the Bode plot is termed the crossover frequency (Dorf 1992).
    This is a critical point because this is where the closed loop canal model is
    likely to pass from an unstable condition to a stable one. The values for A ,
    T , and a crossover frequency of 1.01 × 10 − 5 rad / s were used to calculate
    phase values ranging from −90.752° to −90.694° and magnitude values from 20.55
    to 20.64 dB. These values are determined by first converting the “ s ” term of
    Eq. (2) into corresponding imaginary and frequency components P ( j ω ) = e −
    j ω T A j ω (3) where j = imaginary number and ω = crossover frequency in rad/s.
    This equation can be broken up into magnitude and phase components as follows:
    | P ( j ω ) | = 1 A ω ; ∠ P ( j ω ) = ( − ω T − π / 2 ) (4) One of the magnitude
    values was generated as follows: | P ( j ω ) | = 1 A ω = 1 9197 ⋅ 1.01 × 10 −
    5 = 10.765 (5) This value is converted to dB in order to locate a point on the
    Nichols chart (Fig. 2) 20 ⋅ log ( 10.765 ) = 20.64 dB (6) The corresponding phase
    angle is determined through the following relationship: ∠ P ( j ω ) = ( − ω T
    − π / 2 ) = ( − 1.01 × 10 − 5 ⋅ 1200 − π / 2 ) = − 1.58 rads / s (7) The value
    is converted to degrees by performing the following operation: − 1.58 rads / s
    ( 180 π ) = − 90.692 ° (8) A detailed explanation of how these values are determined
    can be found in Houpis and Rasmussen (1999). The angles and magnitudes are used
    to define corners of a design template (Fig. 2). The values for magnitude and
    phase that were generated for the values of A and T are shown in Table 1. Once
    the values for all four corners are determined, a template can be plotted as shown
    in Fig. 2. This template defines a region of uncertainty because the canal parameters
    cannot be defined exactly. If the true canal parameters were known and the parameters
    did not vary, the template would be defined by a dot and not an area. All of the
    numbers that have been determined so far have been for a frequency of 1.01 × 10
    − 5 rad / s . These are the numbers that are used to design the template in Fig.
    2. A template was also constructed for the 9.09 × 10 − 6 rad / s frequency, but
    it was smaller than the template in Fig. 2. The worst-case scenario occurs for
    a frequency of 1.01 × 10 − 5 rad / s . Controller design is continued for the
    1.01 × 10 − 5 rad / s frequency because this is the worst case and will help to
    develop a more robust design. Fig. 2. Nichols plot showing system or “plant” template.
    The template is small for this example so it is magnified to show the template
    shape. Table 1. Magnitude and Phase Angles That Were Generated Using a Crossover

    20.55 −90.752° Once the template is constructed, it can be moved to the 3 dB contour.
    This template is then slid around the 3 dB contour (Houpis and Rasmussen 1999)
    on a Nichols chart (Fig. 3). The template has been duplicated at several positions
    around the 3-dB contour to illustrate how the template is slid around the contour.
    The template is also smaller in Fig. 3 because the scale of the chart has changed.
    The 3-dB contour is used because Horowitz (1993) has determined that if the system
    model plus the feedback controller can operate outside this contour, the system
    will be stable. The template must have the same vertical and horizontal orientations
    as it is moved all the way around the 3-dB contour (Fig. 3). As the template is
    slid around the 3-dB contour, a point of the template boundary should always touch
    the 3-dB contour, but the template cannot cross the contour. The contour is drawn
    by placing a pen in the corner of the template and tracing a boundary line. The
    corner in this design corresponds to a value of 1,300 s for T and 9 , 290 m 2
    for A or the corresponding 20.55 dB and −90.752°. This point is at the lower left
    corner of the template. This corner is selected for convenience and ease of plotting,
    but any other corner could be selected provided the template does not cross the
    3 dB boundary. By using the template in this manner, the variability of system
    parameters is taken into account in the resulting boundary. This boundary is called
    the “U-contour.” The right side of the U contour follows the 3-dB contour because
    the point of the pen and the corner of the template touch the contour. As the
    template is slid around the 3-dB contour, the template boundary forces the pen
    away from the 3-db contour on the bottom and to the left of the diagram. The U
    contour that is constructed with this template accounts for the variability in
    crossover frequency and the variability in A and T . If these parameters were
    exactly known, the U contour would be traced on the 3 dB contour. It should be
    noted that in most QFT designs, the U contour is shaped like the letter U. However,
    in this design, the shape is more oval in shape. Fig. 3. Nichols plot showing
    the U contour drawn using the system template. The template is drawn in multiple
    points around the 3-dB contour to demonstrate how it is slide around the contour
    without crossing the contour. Once the contour has been traced, the uncompensated
    system response is plotted on the Nichols chart (Fig. 4). Uncompensated means
    that there is no feedback controller that is trying to influence or change the
    system response. This plot is determined by entering multiple frequencies into
    to the model and measuring the change in phase and magnitude outputs from the
    model. These values are generated using Eqs. (5) - (8) for each frequency input.
    As the values are determined, they are plotted on the Nichols chart. The plot
    of the uncompensated model shows that it must be pulled closer to the U-contour.
    If plot of the model response can be pulled closer to the contour, it means that
    the model will respond faster to control changes. This is accomplished by adding
    an “ s ” term to the denominator of the system compensator (adding lag). This
    pulls the system to the left and closer to the U contour. The 75-dB point is selected
    as an appropriate place to start. This point is selected because it provides ample
    opportunity to pull the system response plot to the left and closer to the contour.
    The 75-dB point has a corresponding frequency of 2 × 10 − 8 rad / s . This frequency
    is determined by locating the 75-dB point on the Bode plot in Fig. 1 and finding
    the corresponding frequency for that point. The inverse of this frequency is determined
    to be 5 × 10 7 . This value is placed in the denominator (adding lag) of the controller/compensator
    equation G ( s ) = 1 5 × 10 7 s + 1 (9) The result is plotted as the dashed line
    (canal model with lag) in Fig. 4. This plot shows that the additional lag is forcing
    the system through the U contour. The goal of this design is to force the canal
    model close to the U contour without crossing the contour boundaries. As the design
    progresses, the canal model plus the compensator response will be forced around
    the right side of the U contour. The Nichols chart shows that the U contour reaches
    a maximum point on the right side of about −135°. The plot of the system response
    should be forced to the right to about −135° to obtain a good design. Fig. 4.
    Nichols chart showing the U contour and the system response with various compensator
    design stages If an s term is added to the numerator (adding lead) of the compensator,
    the system is pulled to the right. By studying the plot of the canal model with
    lag in Fig. 4, it was determined that the system response curve can be pulled
    to the right if lead is added in the −100- to −105-dB range. This range is used
    because this is where the plot of the system response curve bends more drastically
    to the left. In order to continue with this design, the −102-dB point is selected.
    The Bode plot of the canal model with lag in Fig. 5 indicates that a frequency
    of 5.4 × 10 − 4 rad / s corresponds to the −102-dB value. The resulting compensator
    equation is G ( s ) = 1 , 852 s + 1 5 × 10 7 s + 1 (10) The canal model plus the
    lead and lag compensator response is plotted as a dotted line in Fig. 4. The plot
    shows that it is not far enough to the right because the bend in the curve does
    not reach to the −135° point. Additional lead needs to be added to the compensator.
    The bend in the plot of the canal model with lead and lag in Fig. 4 is the best
    region to determine a value for additional lead. This region starts at about −110
    dB and ends at about −125 dB. Selecting a frequency for the −110-dB point would
    pull the system response to the right, but it would be pulled too far to the right.
    The −115-dB value is selected with a corresponding frequency of 7.0 × 10 − 4 rad
    / s . This frequency is again determined by creating a Bode plot of the canal
    model with the lead and lag compensator and finding the frequency that corresponds
    to the −115-dB point. This plot has been omitted because it is similar to Fig.
    5 and the procedure is the same for all Bode plots. Lead is added to the compensator
    and the resulting equation is G ( s ) = 2.65 × 10 6 s 2 + 3 , 281 s + 1 5 × 10
    7 s + 1 (11) The result is the plot of the dot-dashed line (additional lead added
    to the model and compensator). A gain must be added to the canal model and compensator
    to push the response up to the U contour. This is accomplished by adding a gain
    of 900,000 to the compensator. The value was determined by measuring the difference
    in dB between the bottom of the U contour and the horizontal portion of the plot
    of the compensator with additional lead line in Fig. 4. This difference was determined
    to be 119 dB. If Eq. (6) is solved backward, the following value is determined:
    gain = 10 119 / 20 ≈ 900 , 000 (12) Fig. 6 shows the plot of the system response
    with the compensator. More “zeros” and “poles” could be added to push the response
    closer to the U contour, but this paper focuses on the design process, which has
    been sufficiently demonstrated at this point. Presently, the compensator has an
    excess of “zeros” over “poles” and a system instability may exist. This is corrected
    by added lag at a frequency of 1.0 × 10 − 2 rad / s . This balances the poles
    and the zeros and helps make the compensator more stable. The addition of this
    pole has a small effect on the system and the resulting plot follows the same
    line as the previous compensator. Fig. 5. Bode plot for the canal model and the
    initial compensator of G ( s ) = 1 / ( 5 × 10 7 s + 1 ) . A frequency of 5.4 ×
    10 − 4 rads / s is read from the magnitude plot at about −102 dB. Fig. 6. Nichols
    plot showing the system response with the compensator in relationship to the U
    contour The resulting compensator in Laplace form is presented below: G ( s )
    = 2.38 × 10 12 s 2 + 2.95 × 10 9 s + 9.0 × 10 5 5 × 10 9 s 2 + 5 × 10 7 s + 1
    (13) The system model and compensator cross the U-contour, but this line is still
    close to the outside of the contour. In some cases, there may be a concern with
    this type of design, but test results below indicate that the compensator accomplishes
    the desired response. The Laplace form of this equation is hard to implement in
    a feedback control computer program. The equation must be converted to a digital
    form. If a control interval of 1 min is used, the compensator equation takes the
    following form: Δ q k = 1.549 Δ q k − 1 − 0.5488 Δ q k − 2 + 47.17 e k − 91.68
    e k − 1 + 44.56 e k − 2 (14) where Δ q k represents the flow rate change; Δ q
    k − 1 represents the last flow rate change; Δ q k − 2 represents the flow rate
    change prior to the last flow rate change; e k = difference between the water
    level set point and the present water level; e k − 1 is the last error that was
    measured between the set point and the water level; and e k − 2 = error that was
    measured prior to the last error. The method that is used to convert the Laplace
    compensator equation to the digital compensator equation can be found in Dorf
    (1992). The above equation is in the form that could be implemented in a computer
    control unit that is located at the canal gate control site. The equation indicates
    that the last two gate flow rate changes and the last two errors would have to
    be remembered in order to compute the required flow change. As indicated earlier,
    the control interval was 1 min, however, a control engineer may select an interval
    of 5 or 10 min. If this were true, the gains that are indicated in Eq. (13) would
    change. The controller/compensator has been designed considering the variations
    of the canal parameters. If all variations in system parameters are accounted
    for in the original template, the resulting controller will be stable. This is
    true even if the system parameters change, provided that the variations were accounted
    for in the original template. Results The previously designed QFT controller was
    tested on a nonlinear model (Stringam 1998) with the dimensions defined by Reddy
    (1990). Considering that the goal of designing a compensator is to control a canal,
    a nonlinear model that solves the St. Venant equations would give a more realistic
    response. A PID controller was also designed to control this nonlinear model using
    the Ziegler-Nichols tuning method (Stephanopoulos 1984). The PID controller is
    used for comparison because there are differential, integral, and proportional
    components contained within the QFT compensator design. The results from these
    two controllers were compared to one of the tests for the LQR controller reported
    by Reddy (1990) where an additional flow rate of 0.25 m 3 / s is taken at the
    downstream end of the reach. This would tend to bias the results toward the LQR
    controller because it was tested on a linear model. The results of all three controllers
    can be observed in Fig. 7. This graph shows the resulting downstream depths when
    the outflow is increased. Fig. 7. Plot of the downstream depth for the QFT, PID,
    and LQR controllers. A flow rate of 0.25 m 3 / s is taken at the downstream end
    of the reach. The graph of the response of all three methods indicates that the
    PID method and the QFT method have similar responses. It may be difficult to argue
    that one method is better than the other, except that the QFT method has less
    overshoot and settles into the set point sooner. Fig. 7 indicates that the LQR
    controller does not bring the system back to the set point as quickly as the PID
    and QFT methods. In addition, after the system reaches its minimum, the LQR controller
    has a slower initial rate of recovery than the other two controllers. A final
    test was conducted by changing the channel roughness from 0.016 to 0.019. All
    the other parameters, which were previously defined, were kept the same. The demand
    at the downstream end of the reach was increased an additional 0.25 m 3 / s .
    Fig. 8 shows that the PID controller had more of an oscillatory response than
    the QFT controller. Though the QFT method had more overshoot than the previous
    test, it was less than the PID method. The QFT controller again settled into the
    set point sooner. Fig. 8. Plot of the downstream depth for the QFT and PID controllers.
    An additional flow rate of 0.25 m 3 / s is taken at the downstream end of the
    reach. The canal roughness has been increased to 0.019. Conclusions It could be
    argued that there is little advantage of a QFT controller over a PID controller.
    The results of this paper indicate that both methods have similar responses. However,
    there are several factors that should be considered before drawing this conclusion.
    First, the PID controller equation has an excess of s terms in the numerator.
    This means that there is the possibility of instability in the control system.
    Experienced control engineers and technicians will often say that they have had
    instances where seemingly stable PID controllers suddenly became unstable and
    the controller had to be shut down before there were disastrous results (Phillips
    and Harbor 1991). An additional concern is the fact that PID controllers have
    narrower operational ranges than QFT controllers. This can be corrected with gain
    scheduling (Stephanopoulos 1984), but this makes the controller code more complicated
    than QFT controller code. As mentioned previously, canals are operated at different
    levels, weeds grow in the canal, silt collects, and seepage changes throughout
    the irrigation season. A QFT controller can be designed with a wider operation
    range to account for these changes. This wider range was demonstrated in Fig.
    8. When the results from the PID and QFT controller were compared to the LQR controller,
    they performed better than the LQR method. In this case, the LQR controller had
    a slower response than the PID and QFT controllers. The final and most important
    reason for considering QFT is that it can be applied to global control systems.
    A controller for a canal system seldom functions well if it is made up of several
    local controllers. On the other hand, a global controller will minimize the interference
    that the different reaches have on each other and arrive at the control solution
    that will best operate the entire system. A global QFT controller will be reported
    in a subsequent paper. References Balogun, O. S., Hubbard, M., and DeVries, J.

    Abstract Model-based control strategies applied to irrigation make decisions (on
    water application and/or timing) using a crop and/or soil production model. Decisions
    are made with respect to an optimisation objective which, for irrigation, can
    be either short-term (e.g. achieving/maintaining a set soil–water deficit) or
    predicted end-of-season (e.g. maximising final yield) by predicting how the crop
    will respond at the end of the season. In contrast, sensor-based irrigation strategies
    rely on achieving a performance that is measurable during the crop season to provide
    the feedback control, and may not necessarily optimise overall crop performance.
    Model-based control potentially avoids this limitation. This paper describes the
    application of Model Predictive Control (MPC) methodology to the feedback control
    of irrigation via a model-based irrigation strategy implemented in the irrigation
    control simulation framework ‘VARIwise’. The requirement to also accommodate spatial
    and temporal differences in crop water requirement across a heterogeneous field
    is met by defining management ‘zones’ according to differing soil and crop properties
    across the field and separately applying the control algorithm for each of these
    zones. Case studies were conducted to evaluate MPC for a centre pivot irrigation
    machine-irrigated cotton crop (under typical Australian growing conditions) with:
    (i) different in-season performance objectives (maintaining soil–water deficit;
    maximising square count); (ii) different predicted end-of-season performance objectives
    (maximising yield; maximising water use efficiency); and (iii) maximising yield
    with different field data inputs for model calibration. The Model Predictive Control
    strategy produced significantly higher simulated yields and water use efficiency
    than an industry-standard irrigation management strategy; and (in most but not
    all situations) direct sensor-based adaptive control strategies. Previous article

    moveSchedulingIrrigation automationModel Predictive Control 1. Introduction The
    development of the control simulation framework ‘VARIwise’ has enabled the evaluation
    of site-specific, spatially-variable irrigation control strategies on field crops
    (McCarthy et al., 2010a). VARIwise permits spatially and temporally varied simulation
    and accommodates sub-field scale variations in all input parameters down to metre-scale
    zone size. Simulations of ‘sensor-based’ strategies showed potential improvements
    in yield and water use efficiency (McCarthy et al., 2014). These strategies compared
    the field measurements with a desired response (e.g. soil–water deficit) and adjusted
    the irrigation volume applied according to the difference. 1.1. Model Predictive
    Control (MPC) applied to irrigation In contrast, an alternative ‘advanced process
    control’ approach to irrigation uses crop production models to aid the irrigation
    decision making process. These ‘model-based’ control strategies use the available
    field measurements to calibrate the crop model. The model is then repeatedly executed
    to determine the optimal irrigation volume and timing that will achieve the desired
    performance objective (e.g. predicted end-of-season yield). The methodology of
    Model Predictive Control (MPC) involves using a model to predict the optimal input
    signal at the current time considering future events over a finite time period
    (Kwon and Han, 2005). This is referred to as a ‘control horizon length’. Only
    the first optimal control action is implemented after each time step. MPC is applicable
    to irrigation since a soil-plant-atmosphere model may be used to evaluate the
    application of various irrigation volumes on a fixed number of consecutive days.
    For example, the model may be used to, firstly, determine the best irrigation
    volume to apply on each zone for each of the next three days; and, secondly, determine
    which day resulted in the best overall performance. The future process outputs
    used to evaluate the irrigation scheme may be predicted daily with measurements
    of crop response (e.g. for cotton, square/boll count, leaf area index) or soil–water.
    Alternatively, the simulated final crop yield or water use efficiency may be used
    to evaluate the various irrigation schemes. From the control perspective, the
    ‘process model’ evolves during the growth of the crop such that the control must
    be adaptive. This requirement means that the model used by the MPC strategy must
    be continuously re-calibrated using the currently available field data. The plant
    growth and soil–water dynamics in the cotton model OZCOT (Wells and Hearn, 1992)
    implemented within VARIwise, can be accurately calibrated (McCarthy et al., 2011).
    The calibrated OZCOT model has also been found to accurately simulate yield (Richards
    et al., 2001). Using one season’s field experiment data McCarthy et al. (2011)
    found that OZCOT was most effectively calibrated (and therefore able to predict
    the soil and crop response to irrigation application) using full data input, whilst
    for situations where only two data inputs were available, the simulations suggested
    that either weather-and-plant or soil-and-plant inputs were preferable. Park et
    al. (2009) developed two MPC systems for centre pivot irrigation which both used
    measured soil and weather inputs to calibrate a soil–water model. Their first
    implementation used the calibrated model to determine the irrigation volumes which
    would fill the soil profile for irrigation events on fixed days; whereas their
    second implementation used the calibrated model to determine the irrigation timing
    for a fixed irrigation volume application which would fill the soil profile. Neither
    implementation incorporated the crop growth response. 1.2. MPC and crop production
    models The performance objectives set for MPC applied to irrigation can range
    from a short-term objective such as achieving a preset soil–water deficit following
    each irrigation to a ‘whole season’ objective such as maximising predicted end-of-season
    yield. In addition, crop production models (such as OZCOT for cotton, discussed
    below) have sophisticated prediction capabilities which may be utilised in the
    implementation of MPC. For example, a performance objective to maximise the number
    of plant fruiting sites during growth should maximise potential predicted end-of-season
    yield. This additional crop response capability typically requires measurements
    of the plant to calibrate the crop production model according to the measured
    plant growth parameters (e.g. fruiting), which in turn requires infield plant
    sensors to provide calibration data. To maximise uptake of the site-specific irrigation
    control system by growers it is desirable to minimise the sensor requirements.
    A reduction in measurements could be achieved by using only the data types that
    are more influential in the model calibration or by reducing the spatial or temporal
    resolution of data. However, the data used to calibrate the model should still
    enable sufficient accuracy of the model. An insufficient range of measurements
    to calibrate the model used by MPC will influence the accuracy of the model and
    the model’s ability to predict irrigation and crop performance. Hence, this paper
    aims to: • identify the optimal combination of performance objective and data
    input combination amenable to practical MPC strategies; and also • explore the
    impact of different control horizon lengths (period of time for forecasting future
    events) on the performance of MPC. The strategies simulated in this paper explore
    the viability of the use of MPC in the simulation of a ‘realistic’ irrigation
    situation with spatial and temporal variation across a heterogeneous field. Accordingly,
    this paper details the implementation of the MPC methodology in VARIwise and,
    for the example of cotton grown in Australia, presents results for a range of
    simulations having different performance objectives. The results are presented
    as three case studies, A, B and C, which, in order, evaluate the potential of
    MPC to optimise: A. short-term responses of square count or soil–water; B. predicted
    end-of-season crop yield or water use efficiency with (i) low and high soil nitrogen
    content, and (ii) crop seasons with and without rainfall; and C. predicted end-of-season
    crop yield with different combinations of sensory input data to calibrate the
    model. A comparison is then made between the MPC strategies and simulations of
    ‘sensor-based’ strategies for adaptive irrigation control (McCarthy et al., 2014).
    2. Implementation The simulation framework ‘VARIwise’ (McCarthy et al., 2010a)
    was created to develop, simulate and evaluate site-specific irrigation control
    strategies for centre pivot and lateral move irrigation machines on non-uniform
    (spatially and temporally varied) fields. The framework enables evaluation of
    strategies with different sensor data availability (both spatial and temporal);
    for example, the performance of the control strategies with spatial gaps in measured
    response is explored in McCarthy et al. (2010b). In addition, the framework can
    provide evaluation of different irrigation system capacity constraints and when
    supplied with real-time weather and/or other field data, the framework will provide
    direct machine actuation. For the simulation (and management) of cotton irrigation,
    the cotton production model OZCOT (Wells and Hearn, 1992) was used by VARIwise
    and was automatically and continuously calibrated according to the currently available
    weather, soil and plant data. Details are set out in McCarthy et al. (2011). To
    illustrate the VARIwise configuration used to evaluate MPC a general schematic
    is presented in Fig. 1, in which the central blocks and data flows are explained
    in the following sections. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. The simulation
    framework VARIwise configured to evaluate (in simulation mode) the model-based
    adaptive control strategy Model Predictive Control (MPC). In this mode, the block
    ‘AcModel’ (also an OZCOT formulation) has replaced the field data measurements
    which would normally update ‘RefModel’. (This diagram is adapted from the full
    VARIwise flowchart presented as Fig. 2 of McCarthy et al., 2010a, McCarthy et
    al., 2010b). The MPC algorithm predicts how much each output (e.g. soil–water,
    fruit load) will deviate from a time series trajectory within the prediction horizon.
    A MPC cost function J(k) is calculated for each possible set of input actions
    in the current time step k using a least squares algorithm of the following form
    (Maciejowski, 2002): (1) where J(k) is the cost function at instant k, C the length
    of prediction/control horizon, N the number of system outputs, wj the weighting
    coefficient for output j, rj(k + i) the predicted value of jth output at future
    instant k + i, and xj(k + i) is the target value of jth output at future instant
    k + i. The control action that minimises the cost function (i.e. that produces
    the smallest deviation in performance from the desired trajectory) is implemented.
    This optimisation is repeated at each sample time step to update the optimal input
    trajectory after a feedback update. Hence, this MPC algorithm calculates the sequence
    of control action adjustments over a specified future time interval. In an irrigation
    context, the system outputs used to calculate the cost function will typically
    have different units and magnitudes, and the same percentage change in variables
    of different units and magnitudes may cause unintentional bias toward variables
    that are generally larger in magnitude. For example, a particular percentage difference
    in soil–water will produce a larger cost function than the same percentage difference
    in leaf area index. Hence, the MPC algorithm was modified (Eq. (2)) to calculate
    a performance index that represents a percentage difference in the predicted outputs
    rather than a least squares objective function (Eq. (1)). The control action that
    maximises the performance index PI(k) is then implemented in each time step, and
    is calculated using the equation: (2) The MPC methodology was implemented to determine
    irrigation timing and site-specific irrigation volumes on a daily basis by means
    of the following four-step procedure: 1. Update measured and forecast weather
    data. 2. Calibrate crop model. 3. Optimise irrigation volume for each zone. 4.
    Optimise day of next irrigation. The details of each step in relation to the following
    case studies are set out below. This procedure is independently applied to each
    ‘management zone’, where each zone in the field is defined according to differing
    soil and crop properties across the heterogeneous field. 2.1. Step 1: updating
    measured and forecast weather data For each day of the crop season, the meteorological
    data input file for the integrated crop model was updated to include the previous
    day’s weather and the updated weather forecast for the farm’s location. In a field
    implementation of MPC, the ‘previous day’s weather’ could be obtained from an
    on-site weather station and the ‘updated weather forecast’ could be obtained from
    the Bureau of Meteorology. However, to simulate the performance of MPC for a whole
    season (where there was no field implementation) both ‘previous day’s weather’
    and ‘updated weather forecast’ had to be obtained from historical data. Because
    of the high variability of Australian climate and the difficulty in picking a
    ‘typical’ year, an artificial daily meteorological dataset was created by averaging
    the day-to-day data of the five years (1999–2004 inclusive) appropriate to the
    location of Dalby (Latitude −28.18°N, Longitude 151.26° E), a major cotton-growing
    region of south-east Queensland, Australia, and this dataset was used for all
    simulations. Daily data comprised maximum and minimum temperature, solar radiation
    and rainfall, and was sourced from Australian Bureau of Meteorology SILO patched
    point environmental dataset (QNRM, 2009). SILO is an enhanced climate database
    containing Australian climate data from 1889. Forecast weather data, to be used
    predictively during the simulations, was created by imposing a Gaussian distribution
    of variability on the daily values of the five-year-averaged dataset using standard
    deviations of ±5 °C, ±5 °C, ±5 W h/m2 and ±50% for maximum temperature, minimum
    temperature, daily solar radiation and rainfall, respectively; i.e. for any given
    day, the forecast one, two and three days ahead, then values for each variable
    randomly generated within each distribution by taking that day’s values as the
    mean. For each day, only three days of the forecast weather data were used. This
    is because the two Australian short-term numerical weather prediction models forecast
    three and seven days ahead and are combined to improve the prediction accuracy
    (Ebert, 2001). The three-day forecast would be more accurate than one model on
    its own because both models could predict weather to three days. A three-day forecast
    would ensure short-term prediction accuracy in the predictions, particularly as
    regards rainfall in south-east Queensland, Australia, where the summer rainfall
    is dominated by frontal bands of isolated cumulo-nimbus storms. 2.2. Step 2: calibrating
    the crop model – ‘actual’ and ‘reference’ models The crop model OZCOT is utilised
    by VARIwise and can be automatically and continuously calibrated according to
    the ‘currently’ available weather, plus soil and plant data, using the procedure
    set out in McCarthy et al. (2011). The procedure for calibrating the production/growth
    model OZCOT in a real-time implementation, i.e. for actual irrigation machine
    control, involves automatically and iteratively adjusting the parameters used
    to predict soil water status and plant growth until the difference between the
    predicted and sensed variables reached a minimum. For the cotton model OZCOT,
    the plant variables (leaf area index, boll count, square count), soil variables
    (soil moisture content and plant available water capacity) and weather variables
    (daily minimum and maximum temperature, rainfall and solar radiation in weather
    input file) are interdependent. The plant behaviour can be calibrated by adjusting
    parameters in a crop properties file, whilst the soil moisture behaviour was calibrated
    by adjusting parameters in a soil properties file. These parameters were adjusted
    between the minimum and maximum values of the corresponding parameters in the
    predefined soil properties and crop variety parameter profiles. The parameters
    adjusted in the crop properties file included squaring rate (the rate of new flower
    buds being produced), growth rate of leaf area and plant population constant;
    whilst the parameters adjusted in the soil properties file were the initial soil
    moisture content and drained upper limit in each soil layer. A ‘reference’ model,
    labelled ‘RefModel’, is used to provide the crop growth prediction scenario for
    MPC. However, for the present case studies there was no measured field data input
    to calibrate the model. To overcome this, a second OZCOT model of the cotton crop
    was used in place of ‘actual’ field conditions. This model is referred to as the
    ‘actual crop’ model, labelled ‘AcModel’ and the parameters were different to those
    in RefModel to emulate RefModel not exactly following the field conditions. In
    a field implementation the AcModel is not required as field measurements would
    be used. AcModel was then used to calibrate RefModel (Fig. 1). The crop and soil
    properties of AcModel were obtained from the user-specified soil and plant measurements
    (and these varied between simulations, as set out below). Within RefModel the
    crop variety was specified by the user at commencement. Likewise the soil properties
    of RefModel were user-specified, with the addition of areal variation in available
    soil–water imposed via a Gaussian distribution of variability having a standard
    deviation of ±25 mm (water depth equivalent). 2.3. Step 3: optimising irrigation
    volumes for each zone Optimal irrigation volumes were determined by iteratively
    simulating the daily application of sixteen different irrigation volumes at 1
    mm increments between 0 and 15 mm on each zone in the field. For each irrigation
    volume applied (for management zone k), a performance index PI(k) was calculated
    using Eq. (2). For variables that are maximised to achieve the optimal irrigation
    strategy (e.g. square count, yield, crop water use efficiency), the target value
    is taken to be the maximum realistic commercially attainable value (e.g. 15 bales/ha
    for cotton yield, 3 bales/ML for crop water use efficiency). The predicted process
    outputs used to calculate the PI were taken one day after the irrigation application.
    The optimal irrigation volume for each zone was the irrigation volume with the
    highest PI; however, if more than one irrigation volume had the same PI then a
    water-efficient approach was taken and the optimal irrigation volume was the lowest
    quantitative volume that achieved the maximum PI. The irrigation volume was then
    calculated for each zone in the order in which the irrigation machine was to pass
    over the field. 2.4. Step 4: optimising the timing (day) of the next irrigation
    The optimal day for the next irrigation event was determined using the calibrated
    RefModel. This involved performing the irrigation volume optimisation of the previous
    step for an arbitrary number of days (i.e. to a fixed horizon) and contained the
    assumption that the irrigation event could occur on only one of the days. The
    maximum horizon length was set to three days since three days of predictive weather
    were used. The sixteen irrigation volumes tested on each zone depend on the irrigation
    day being tested. This is because, unless rainfall occurs, it was assumed that
    the crop water requirement (and hence irrigation application volume) increases
    for each day the irrigation event is delayed. For the first day irrigation volumes
    of 0–15 mm were tested with increments of 1 mm; for the second day 0–31 mm were
    tested with increments of 2 mm; and for the third day 0–47 mm were tested with
    increments of 3 mm. A PI is calculated for each irrigation day by summing the
    individual PI values for each zone. The day with the highest total PI is taken
    to be the optimal day for the next irrigation event. The irrigation event is scheduled
    if the first day in the horizon had the highest PI and there are a minimum number
    of zones requiring irrigation greater than 0 mm. This ensures that the irrigation
    application is practical and irrigations are not initiated for only a small number
    of zones in the field. The threshold, i.e. the minimum proportion of zones requiring
    irrigation, was arbitrarily selected to be 15% for the case studies presented.
    2.5. Subsequent iteration After the optimal irrigation action – which may, of
    course, be a ‘nil irrigation’ action – was determined for the user-specified first
    day, the procedure described in the four subsections above was repeated every
    day throughout the crop season, with the irrigation events ending on a day specified
    by the user. 3. MPC Case Study A: optimisation of short-term responses using different
    combinations of daily input data The MPC strategy was evaluated with daily input
    data to predict and control irrigation applications to achieve either a short-term
    soil (e.g. deficit) or plant growth (e.g. leaf area index) target. A range of
    combinations of input variables for control were used to determine which input
    data stream was most useful for MPC. 3.1. Methodology for Case Study A The field
    was automatically divided into 44 zones, each of area approximately 0.3 ha, and
    the irrigations occurred daily. This number of zones enabled the simulations to
    be executed in a timely manner with spatially variable soil properties across
    the field. The MPC strategy was evaluated for ten combinations of data input (Table
    1). The input data combinations represent the data used both as input variables
    to calibrate RefModel and the variables used for control. For the simulations
    using both soil and plant data, the weighting on each variable was set to be 0.5.
    The strategies with soil data input aimed for soil–water deficit equal to 10%
    of the plant available water capacity in each zone. Table 1. Simulations (identified

    the RefModel (to be calibrated) used the Siokra V16RR cotton variety with the
    underlying variability in plant available water capacity (PAWC) and starting soil–water
    deficit as set out in Fig. 2. The starting soil–water deficit map was generated
    by assigning a starting soil–water deficit value of 30 mm across the field and
    imposing a Gaussian distribution of variability with standard deviation ±10 mm
    on each zone. The PAWC map was generating by assigning PAWC values of 60, 150
    and 200 mm on three zones of the fields, spatially interpolating the PAWC using
    ordinary kriging and by similarly imposing a Gaussian distribution of variability
    with standard deviation ±10 mm on each zone. The PAWC ranges from 60 to 200 mm
    in the simulated field to ensure the control strategies could deal with the different
    soil types that often exist within fields. Download : Download full-size image

    whilst Sicot 73 is a full season cotton variety with high yield potential (CSD,
    2009). The prediction horizon was one day and it was practical for irrigation
    events to occur daily. 3.2. Case Study A – results and discussion Table 2 sets

    of the control strategies are compared based on the average and variability of
    the yield, irrigation applied, Irrigation Water Use Index (IWUI) and Crop Water

    in yield response according to spatially variable irrigation application. The
    strategies that use weather-soil-and-plant data to calibrate and target a fixed

    soil–water deficit (simulation #19); and set (b): maximising square count (simulation
    #20). The simulated yield and water use efficiency increased as more data streams
    were included in the input data combination. This is shown in Table 2 as the single-input
    simulations produced the lowest yields and water use efficiencies (simulations
    #11 and #12) while the three simulations having three data inputs (simulations
    #18, #19 and #20) performed better than all of the five simulations having two
    data inputs (simulations #13 to #17 inclusive). The data combinations with soil
    data and no plant data (simulations #11 and #13) resulted in higher yields than
    those with plant data and no soil data (simulations #12 and #14). This result
    suggests that if only one data input is available then soil data input is most
    effective for calibrating RefModel and for irrigation control. The simulations
    using combinations of soil and plant data input to determine the irrigation volumes
    (simulations #15 and #18) generally produced lower yields and water use efficiencies
    than those using only plant data input to determine the irrigation volumes (simulations
    #17 and #20) with the same data available for RefModel calibration. For example,
    for the strategies with soil and plant data available to calibrate RefModel, a
    higher yield was simulated when the strategy maximised the square/boll count (simulation
    #17) than when the strategy attempted to both maintain soil–water and maximise
    square count (simulation #15). Hence, in this case there was no obvious benefit
    in the using multiple variables to determine the application volumes. The MPC
    strategy accurately maintained the soil–water deficit threshold during low rainfall
    periods of the crop season for simulation #19 (63 to 85 days after sowing, Fig.
    4(a)). For the MPC strategy that maximised square/boll count (simulation #20),
    the soil–water deficit was always higher than the soil–water deficit threshold
    that was approximately maintained in simulation #19 throughout the crop season
    (Fig. 4(b)). The soil–water deficit was also lowest in the sand zone (with the
    lowest plant available water capacity) and highest in the clay zone (with the
    highest plant available water capacity) throughout the crop season for the strategy
    optimising square count. This indicates that to maximise the square count, the
    soil–water deficit should be reduced in proportion with the plant available water
    capacity of the soil. The highest yield was achieved using weather-soil-and-plant
    input and maximising square count (simulation #20). The square count was higher
    throughout the crop season for this simulation compared with that for MPC maintaining
    soil–water deficit (simulation #19) (Fig. 5). Hence, the implemented MPC strategy
    successfully increased the simulated square count and improvements in yield (by
    14%) and crop water use efficiency (by 30%) were observed by maximising square
    count instead of targeting soil–water. 4. MPC Case Study B: optimisation using
    a predicted end-of-season yield or water use efficiency target The MPC strategy
    uses RefModel to forecast the response of cotton crop with specific environmental
    conditions and soil and crop properties; hence, the irrigation volume/timing may
    be adjusted to achieve a desired predicted end-of-season output, in this case
    a final yield or water use efficiency. This is in contrast to Case Study A in
    which the MPC strategy used daily input data (e.g. square count, soil–water) to
    predict the best short-term response to a range of irrigation volumes. 4.1. Methodology
    for Case Study B The field was automatically divided into 44 zones as per the
    previous case study and the irrigations could occur daily. The MPC strategy was
    evaluated for crop seasons with and without rainfall and with two levels of initial
    nitrogen content (120 kg/ha and 250 kg/ha). The same weather dataset was used
    for both these sets of simulations; however the daily rainfall was set to zero
    for the simulations without rainfall. In the simulations with rainfall there was
    high rainfall during days 63–85 after sowing. The MPC strategy was used to optimise
    the predicted Irrigation Water Use Index (IWUI), Crop Water Use Index (CWUI) and
    yield assuming the machine capacity enabled the machine to traverse the field
    once every day. An algorithm maximising IWUI or CWUI may decide to apply no irrigation
    to minimise the irrigation volume but would also produce low yield. Hence, to
    ensure that the IWUI and CWUI optimisation would irrigate the crop, the minimum
    acceptable yield was arbitrarily set at 5 bales/ha in all optimisations. 4.2.
    Case Study B – results and discussion The simulation results are displayed in
    Table 3 and Fig. 6 and the spatially varied irrigation volumes applied are compared
    with different in-season rainfall and starting nitrogen content at commencement

    set (b) 250 kg/ha. For each set of field conditions (i.e. starting nitrogen content
    and in-season rainfall), the simulated yield was highest for the MPC strategy
    that optimised yield (simulations #21, #23, #25 and #28). Similarly, the strategies
    optimising IWUI (simulations #27 and #30) and CWUI (simulations #26 and #29) produced
    the highest respective IWUI and CWUI of the simulations with the same field conditions.
    This indicates that MPC strategy could adjust the irrigation application to improve
    either yield or water use efficiency. Increasing the starting nitrogen content
    significantly improved the simulated yield and water use efficiency. This is shown
    in Table 3 as the yield for the no-rainfall simulation with the higher nitrogen
    content of 250 kg N/ha (e.g. 17.9 bales/ha for simulation #23) was nearly double
    that of the simulation with the lower nitrogen content of 120 kg N/ha (e.g. 9.0
    bales/ha for simulation #21). Since the irrigation volumes applied were similar
    for these two simulations (Fig. 8), the CWUI and IWUI of the higher nitrogen content
    simulations were also nearly double that of the lower nitrogen content simulations.
    Hence, nitrogen application had a significant effect on the final yield without
    greatly affecting the irrigation volume required to be applied. Rainfall significantly
    affected the simulated yield and CWUI (Table 3). Table 3 shows that the yields,
    irrigation applications and CWUI of simulations #21−#24 (without rainfall) are
    higher than those of simulations #25−#30 (with rainfall). This suggests that the
    crop is easier to control with less rainfall in the season. The difference in
    yield and CWUI is most noticeable for simulations with high nitrogen content (e.g.
    simulation #28 with rainfall and simulation #23 without rainfall) because the
    simulated yields are higher and the differences between the yields are more apparent.
    It follows that during the period of the crop season with high rainfall (63–86
    days after sowing), lower irrigation volumes were applied compared to the periods
    of no rainfall (87–105 days after sowing) (Fig. 7). The rainfall did not generally
    affect the IWUI for the simulated set of field conditions (e.g. simulation #21
    with no rainfall versus simulation #25 with rainfall). This is because more rainfall
    caused both the yield and irrigation application (which are used to calculate
    the IWUI) to decrease by approximately the same proportion. 5. MPC Case Study
    C: optimisation using a predicted end-of-season target, with limited calibration
    data The MPC simulations of the Case Study B assumed that the full data input
    of weather, soil and plant information was available for RefModel calibration.
    However, all three data streams may not be available in a field implementation.
    Case Study C evaluates the usefulness of different data streams to calibrate RefModel
    in a MPC strategy with a predicted end-of-season target. 5.1. Methodology for
    Case Study C The seven possible input data combinations (Table 2) were separately
    evaluated as input for RefModel calibration. The datasets were obtained daily
    from the cotton model Sicot 71B and used to calibrate the Siokra V16RR cotton
    model. The field and weather conditions were as used in the earlier case studies,
    the MPC strategy optimised yield and the irrigations occurred daily. 5.2. Case
    Study C – results and discussion Table 4 and Fig. 9 set out a comparison of an
    MPC strategy that maximises yield with different combinations of input data to
    calibrate RefModel. The use of more information in the input data combination
    generally increased the average yield and water use efficiency (Table 4). Table
    4 shows that MPC performance with all three input variables (simulation #37/#28)
    was superior to that with any two variables (simulations #34−#36); and similarly
    performance with two input variables was superior to that with any single input
    variable alone, except plant input (simulation #33) versus soil-and-plant input
    (simulation #36). This suggests that the MPC calibration performs better with
    soil data input than plant data input. Table 4. Performance of the Model Predictive

    #31−#37 are in Table 4). The lowest yields and water use efficiencies were simulated
    with only weather data input (e.g. simulations #31). This is because the weather
    data (without field-specific soil or crop data) provides no information to adequately
    parameterise the crop model used by the MPC strategy. This could lead to insufficient
    model calibration and sub-optimal irrigation volumes being determined. The irrigation
    water use efficiency was higher using the weather and plant combination (simulation
    #35) than using the full data input (simulation #37/#28): this is because the
    yield was maximised rather than the water use efficiency in this case study. 6.
    General discussion A Model Predictive Control strategy was successfully implemented
    in VARIwise. The controller uses currently available field data to calibrate the
    OZCOT cotton production model and then evaluates a range of irrigation volumes
    and timings in each zone. The controller then implements the site-specific irrigation
    volumes on the day that achieves the highest water use efficiency or yield averaged
    over the field, as user specified. Three alternative optimisation possibilities
    were identified and explored, and the conclusions for each, and their comparison,
    are as set out below. In each case the MPC strategy performed successfully in
    the (simulated) task of controlling an automatic irrigation machine applying spatially-varied
    irrigation amounts. For convenience, Table 5 gathers together the particular simulation
    outputs referred to in this section. Table 5 also compares results of MPC with
    two sensor-based control strategies, namely Iterative Learning Controller (ILC)
    and Iterative Hill Climbing Controller (IHCC), simulated on fields with PAWC varying
    between 60 and 200 mm with 1266 zones, and the same weather profile and crop variety
    (as detailed in McCarthy et al., 2014). These sensor-based strategies refine the
    estimate of each successive irrigation volume applied by: Table 5. Control strategy

    [ILC] – iteratively adjusting the irrigation volume applied in each zone of the
    field using the incremental response, i.e. the OZCOT-determined plant growth arising
    from the change in particular field sensor information which has resulted from
    the previous water application, in each zone; or [IHCC] – similarly adjusting
    the irrigation volumes, but based on multiple sensor increment information, using
    a range of irrigation volumes applied within a group of homogenous zones. The
    performance of the MPC strategy was also compared with an industry-standard irrigation
    strategy (first line of Table 5). This strategy applied a uniform irrigation treatment
    (25 mm) across the field and initiated irrigation events when the soil–water deficit
    reached a set amount (30 mm) in one point in the field (in the cell with sandy
    soil). The soil–water deficit was taken in the cell with the lowest plant available
    water capacity, as this is the most limiting soil. To ensure validity of the comparison
    this simulation was executed using the same weather conditions and spatially variable
    plant available water capacity and starting soil–water, and crop variety as the
    reference model. The nitrogen content was set to 250 kg/ha. The MPC strategy was
    evaluated with different combinations of input data (Section 3 above). The predicted
    yield and water use efficiency were highest when the strategy maximised the square
    count and calibrated the model using all three streams of data input (weather,
    soil and plant, simulation #20). The yield and water use efficiency were also
    higher than those of the industry-standard irrigation management strategy (McCarthy
    et al., 2014), and also ILC (simulation #1) and IHCC (simulation #9) with either
    weather-soil-and-plant, weather-and-soil or weather-and-plant data input available
    (likewise refer McCarthy et al., 2014). However, the MPC (optimising daily input
    data) performed worse than the ILC and IHCC where there was only either soil input
    (simulation #11) or weather-and-plant (simulation #14) input data available. The
    controller successfully adjusted the irrigation to improve the yield, CWUI or
    IWUI, as appropriate (Section 4). The yield was higher with high nitrogen content
    (e.g. simulation #28) than with low nitrogen content (simulation #25) and with
    no rainfall during the crop season (simulation #23) compared with high rainfall
    (simulation #28). This is because the control strategy could better control the
    water applied in response to the other environmental factors. The simulated average
    yields and water use efficiencies were significantly higher than the industry-standard
    irrigation management strategy, ILC strategy (simulation #1) and IHCC strategy
    (simulation #9) (McCarthy et al., 2014). MPC was evaluated with different combinations
    of input data available to calibrate the model (Section 5). The controller performed
    best with input of weather-soil-and-plant data (simulation #28), but still produced
    higher yields and water use efficiencies with weather-and-soil (simulation #34)
    or weather-and-plant (simulation #35) input than the irrigation-standard irrigation
    management strategy, and ILC (simulation #1) and IHCC (simulation #9) case studies
    (McCarthy et al., 2014). Higher yields and water use efficiencies were produced
    for MPC optimising predicted end-of-season data (simulation #28) than for MPC
    using daily input data to maximise square count (simulation #20). However, both
    of these control strategies required either the full data input, weather-and-soil
    or weather-and-plant data input to obtain yields higher than the ILC or IHCC strategies.
    7. Conclusion The Model Predictive Control strategy implemented in the control
    simulation software VARIwise performed successfully in the task of controlling
    an automatic irrigation machine applying water to a simulated cotton crop grown
    in typical conditions for south-east Queensland, Australia. In all simulations
    the MPC strategy specified ‘sensible’ irrigation amounts typical of irrigation
    practice in this region. Simulations using the MPC strategy indicated that the
    MPC strategy could be successfully used to either maximise crop yield, or crop
    and irrigation water use efficiencies. The MPC strategy produced significantly
    higher yield and crop water use efficiency than the sensor-based strategies for
    the same (simulated) field conditions (similarly simulated in VARIwise and reported
    in McCarthy et al., 2014). However, MPC required weather-soil-and-plant, weather-and-soil
    or weather-and-plant information to accurately calibrate the crop model. This
    indicates (for cotton grown as stated) that whilst the MPC-based strategies are
    potentially superior, sensor-based strategies may be more appropriate for field
    implementations where there is limited data availability. Finally, we note here
    that direct field evaluation is particularly challenging, because direct comparison
    requires replicated plots having the same soil types and distributions, and with
    simultaneous operation such that each experiences the same weather conditions.
    In principal at least, an alternative to achieve such a comparison would be to
    determine variability of soil properties under an irrigation system, a priori,
    and then define plots of the same soil type such that the irrigation application
    could be adjusted according to different MPC strategies, and in comparison with
    industry-standard control (e.g. calculated using evapotranspiration or soil–water).
    Field evaluations would enable the sensing and control hardware requirements and
    performance of autonomous, adaptive control strategies to be compared with industry-standard
    irrigation. These control strategies would determine irrigation application and
    timing using a black-box control system based on sensed inputs and sends control
    signals to irrigation actuation hardware. This will potentially lead to the optimisation
    of irrigation water use and yield under different climate scenarios and water
    availability situations. Acknowledgements The authors are grateful to the Australian

    Control engineering approaches may be applied to irrigation management to make
    better use of available irrigation water. These methods of irrigation decision-making
    are being developed to deal with spatial and temporal variability in field properties,
    data availability and hardware constraints. One type of control system is advanced
    process control which, in an irrigation context, refers to the incorporation of
    multiple aspects of optimisation and control. Hence, advanced process control
    is particularly suited to the management of site-specific irrigation. This paper
    reviews applications of advanced process control in irrigation: mathematical programming,
    linear quadratic control, artificial intelligence, iterative learning control
    and model predictive control. From the literature review, it is argued that model-based
    control strategies are more realistic in the soil–plant–atmosphere system using
    process simulation models rather than using ‘black-box’ crop production models.
    It is also argued that model-based control strategies can aim for specific end
    of season characteristics and hence may achieve optimality. Three control systems
    are identified that are robust to data gaps and deficiencies and account for spatial
    and temporal variability in field characteristics, namely iterative learning control,
    iterative hill climbing control and model predictive control: from consideration
    of these three systems it is concluded that the most appropriate control strategy
    depends on factors including sensor data availability and grower’s specific performance
    requirements. It is further argued that control strategy development will be driven
    by the available sensor technology and irrigation hardware, but also that control
    strategy options should also drive future plant and soil moisture sensor development.

    management. In Fig. 1: Fig. 1 Generic control scenario for irrigation application
    (adapted from McCarthy et al. 2010a) Full size image the ‘decision support system’
    embodies the control strategy; ‘actuation’ is the action of adjusting the irrigation
    volume and/or timing; and ‘application’ is the resulting physical amount and timing
    of water and fertiliser applied to the crop. This process can be applied to both
    constant and spatially varied irrigation management at a range of time scales.
    Similarly, the actuation of the irrigation volume application may be either manual
    or automated. Control strategies can be either ‘open-loop’ if they do not use
    sensor feedback to adjust the control, or ‘closed-loop’ if the response of the
    system is monitored and used to adjust the control. Open-loop control strategies
    are outside the scope of this paper. Closed-loop irrigation control strategies
    in the literature have been developed using either infield soil sensors that aim
    to regulate the soil moisture content (Luthra et al. 1997; Smajstrla and Locascio
    2000; Dukes and Scholberg 2005); plant sensors to irrigate when the plant has
    reached a stress point (Evett et al. 2002; Peters and Evett 2008); or calibrated
    crop production models to achieve either a desired soil moisture deficit (Capraro
    et al. 2008), or maximise yield, profit or water productivity (i.e. water use
    efficiency, Brown et al. 2010). There are no published comparisons of performance
    between these approaches. The reported closed-loop irrigation control approaches
    do not typically consider uncertainties associated with unknown crop dynamics,
    nor robustness with respect to sensing requirements, irrigation delivery capability
    or water availability. These factors are known to be spatially varied and subject
    to change between and during crop seasons. In addition, the irrigation application,
    rainfall volumes, soil moisture content and crop response (e.g. plant condition,
    vegetative or reproductive growth) are likely to be stochastic in nature. An engineering
    approach generally labelled ‘advanced process control’ is now routinely applied
    for manufacturing and chemical process systems and combines elements from many
    disciplines spanning classical control engineering, signal processing, statistics,
    decision theory and artificial intelligence (Ikonen and Najim 2002). The application
    of advanced process control to irrigation presents opportunities to improve irrigation
    water use and crop performance. Advanced process control techniques can be used
    for irrigation systems that apply irrigation uniformly over a field, but also
    those that apply site-specific irrigation where the crops have spatially and temporally
    varying irrigation requirements. The variability can be caused by soil type, crop
    type, crop condition (stress, etc.) and meteorological conditions (e.g. rainfall).
    These factors are discussed further in Smith et al. (2009). Research into variable-rate
    irrigation technology for centre pivot and lateral move irrigation machines has
    spanned 20 years and produced a number of commercial systems (e.g. Farmscan, Valmont,
    Zimmatic). However, the greatest limitation to the adoption of variable-rate irrigation
    is associated with developing optimal irrigation schedules (i.e. volume and timing
    of irrigation) or irrigation prescriptions (Evans et al. 1996). Recent evidence
    (LaRue, J, pers. comm., March 2011) suggests that there is a poor adoption rate
    of variable-rate irrigation and that growers with these systems are not continuing
    to use them for variable-rate irrigation, e.g. only four out of 100 growers who
    purchased Farmscan systems in Georgia, USA in the previous 5 years are still using
    the variable-rate technology. Existing sensors developed for agricultural system
    control and specifically used in irrigation management include remote imagery,
    on-the-go plant measurement (i.e. continuous measurements from sensors mounted
    on on-farm vehicles/machines), soil moisture sensing arrays and infrared thermometry.
    However, the currently-developed advanced process control systems may not necessarily
    require these sensors. Similarly, these sensors may not be applicable to the best
    performing advanced process control strategies. Hence, it is important to identify
    both the most promising advanced process control strategies and their sensing
    requirements, and also the strategies that can be applied to the currently available
    sensors. Scope, structure and overview This paper reviews the existing literature
    of advanced process control in irrigation and their sensor requirements and ability
    to adapt to the infield conditions. Five general methods of advanced process control
    that have been applied to irrigation in the available literature are discussed
    here: mathematical programming; linear quadratic control; artificial intelligence;
    model predictive control; and learning control. Consideration of the requirements
    of control strategies for irrigation leads to the identification of three ‘advanced
    process control’ strategies capable of overcoming at least some of the limitations
    of existing irrigation control approaches. Each has different requirements of
    measurement information as well as temporal and spatial resolution. In this paper
    the strategies are described as ‘sensor-based’ if they directly use measurements
    to make irrigation decisions; and ‘model-based’ if they use a model (often with
    sensor input) to aid irrigation decisions. Sensor- and model-based irrigation
    control strategies often have different sensor data requirements because of the
    nature of the control. For example, a sensor-based control strategy could use
    feedback from infrared thermometers or soil moisture sensors, whilst a model-based
    control strategy requires soil properties and plant growth information to calibrate
    the crop model. The crop model is calibrated to improve the accuracy of the model
    and involves adjusting model parameters according to comparisons between modelled
    and measured data. The specific model calibration procedure would vary depending
    on the crop and model but may be automated. McCarthy et al. (2011) demonstrates
    the calibration of the Australian cotton model OZCOT. Hence, this paper also discusses
    the sensor requirements of the reviewed control strategies. Advanced process control
    in irrigation: progress to date Mathematical programming Irrigation events can
    be scheduled using linear programming (Holzapfel et al. 1986; Azamathulla et al.
    2009), nonlinear programming (Ghahraman and Sepaskhah 1997) or dynamic programming
    (Rao et al. 1988; Naadimuthu et al. 1999), either singly or in combination. These
    involve making irrigation decisions for each growth stage to maximise the farm’s
    income (Rao et al. 1992). The models used are typically either heuristic crop
    yield production formulae (Benli and Kodal 2003) or daily, physically-based soil–plant–atmosphere
    models (Sunantara and Ramirez 1997). Common objective functions (formulae) used
    in mathematical programming aim to optimise water allocation among a single or
    various crops, or maximise the profit of the irrigation. The constraints that
    were generally defined in the mathematical programming applications were water
    availability, agricultural land and cropping patterns. Dynamic programming is
    the most widely used mathematical programming approach to irrigation scheduling
    (Shang and Mao 2006). However, dynamic programming has considerable computational
    requirements. To help overcome this it is common to: (i) discretise the underlying
    water balance and prediction models; (ii) use both linear programming and dynamic
    programming models; and (iii) assume irrigation events are scheduled at regular
    (i.e. weekly) intervals (Yaron and Dinar 1982; Stoecker et al. 1985; Rao et al.
    1990). An exception of case (ii) is Sunantara and Ramirez (1997) where irrigation
    events could be scheduled on any set date rather than at regular intervals or
    by growth stage. An alternative approach to reduce the computational complexity
    of mathematical programming is to use neural networks to sample only a fraction
    of the state space without significantly simplifying the model (Schütze and Schmitz
    2009). There are often large uncertainties in weather (e.g. rainfall, evapotranspiration)
    and water supply during crop seasons. Stochastic approaches may potentially be
    applied to consider uncertainty in spatial variability of unmeasured variables.
    Stochastic rainfall input is of particular importance if rainfall is the major
    water supply source during the crop season. Ramirez and Bras (1985) and Sunantara
    and Ramirez (1997) demonstrated significant performance improvements by considering
    the stochasticity of rainfall inputs using stochastic dynamic programming for
    optimal irrigation scheduling. However, Yaron and Dinar (1982) found little uncertainty
    in rainfall during a field evaluation of a combined linear/dynamic programming
    model in Mediterranean conditions, because the rainfall occurred outside of the
    cotton growing season. Uncertainty in crop water demands (Ganji et al. 2006) and
    spatial variability of soil properties (Russo 1986) have also been considered
    in irrigation optimisation using mathematical programming. Yaron and Dinar (1982)
    speculated that water prices, water supply hydraulics, and measured soil moisture
    and crop response should all be calibrated within the model to adapt to the local
    conditions. Spatial variations of soil and climate have been incorporated into
    linear programming models used for corn, drybeans and soybeans (He 1999). Linear
    quadratic control Linear quadratic control is a branch of ‘optimal control theory’
    1 in which control is subject to quadratic costs (Lewis and Syrmos 1995). Protopapas
    and Georgakakos (1990) simulated an optimal control system which determined daily
    irrigation rates using a soil and plant state space model. The objective functions
    aimed to achieve a final state while minimising irrigation application and minimising
    salinity. Protopapas and Georgakakos (1990) noted that a field implementation
    would require the consideration of more types of constraints and considerations.
    This would be expected to include irrigation delivery constraints and consideration
    of infield measurements of soil and plant response to calibrate the model. Shani
    et al. (2004) implemented an optimal control system to determine optimal moisture
    dynamics during the crop season. This approach was limited to determining the
    general soil moisture curve throughout the crop season rather than discrete irrigation
    events on set dates. Fieldwork verified that this approach outperformed the policy
    of yield maximisation for sunflowers. Artificial intelligence The numerical optimisation
    of irrigation management is computationally intensive and often requires model
    simplification and discretisation. Neural networks (Schmitz et al. 2002) and evolutionary
    algorithms 2 (Schmitz et al. 2007) have been developed to determine irrigation
    volume and timing to minimise irrigation application and maximise yield. These
    systems used a subsurface flow model to calculate the wetting profiles and train
    a neural network to provide irrigation parameters to achieve the desired soil
    moisture profile. Schmitz et al. (2007) demonstrated a 92% higher simulated yield
    for corn using evolutionary algorithms than using a dynamic programming approach
    which used a simplified model. An alternative approach used an evolutionary algorithm
    to determine the optimal irrigation volume and timing using a soil water balance
    model and a generic yield prediction model (de Paly and Zell 2009; de Paly et
    al. 2010). Model predictive control There has been significant research in using
    soil and crop models in irrigation management to forecast the process output (DeJonge
    et al. 2007). Model predictive control iteratively executes a model to optimise
    process inputs, rather than numerically operating on the model. Model predictive
    control forecasts the system performance over a finite horizon and uses an optimisation
    algorithm to determine which control action to take to achieve the desired performance
    (Mosca 1995). A model predictive control strategy was simulated to regulate soil
    moisture using a soil dynamics model (Park et al. 2009). The model parameters
    were calibrated using a genetic algorithm, real-time weather data and soil moisture
    measurements from capacitance probes. Learning control Control strategies that
    directly use sensor feedback without a model must perform system identification
    efficiently. This is because the optimisation procedure relies on field measurements
    and is not aided by predictions from a model of soil and crop response. One method
    of sensor-based control that has been applied to irrigation is iterative learning
    control (Moore and Chen 2006). Iterative learning control is used in systems that
    operate repetitively with the same initial conditions at each iteration (Ahn et
    al. 2007). Moore and Chen (2006) conceptualised such a controller to adjust the
    irrigation application flow rate to control the water or concentration of nutrients
    in the soil. This model did not consider temporal changes in crop water use or
    weather conditions; hence, the irrigation events were initiated at regular intervals
    to satisfy the condition that the same initial conditions are present before each
    irrigation event. The control strategy assumed that a sensor would be located
    in each cell of the field; however, in a field implementation this may not be
    practical. Discussion Mathematical programming and linear quadratic control use
    numerical methods to optimise irrigation application and/or timing. The computational
    requirements of these strategies were large even with the simplified crop model.
    This simplification resulted in temporal coarseness of the model, where irrigation
    was allocated to each growing stage or weekly time period. This lack of precision
    potentially results in sub-optimal performance and may restrict the application
    of numerical methods to real-time irrigation management. However, the mathematical
    programming strategies often considered uncertainty in rainfall and evapotranspiration
    which is practical in soil–plant–atmosphere systems. Artificial intelligence reduces
    the complexity of mathematical programming approaches while also optimising irrigation
    management at a daily time scale. Therefore, artificial intelligence-based control
    strategies are potentially more accurate than mathematical programming control
    strategies. Model predictive control iteratively executes crop models to optimise
    irrigation events over the prediction horizon. This strategy can use publicly
    available crop models (e.g. APSIM, McCown et al. 1996; DSSAT, Jones et al. 2003)
    rather than models in state space form. When used for this purpose, the crop models
    are ‘black-box’ because access is only provided to their inputs and outputs. The
    optimisation of irrigation using these ‘black-box’ models is inefficient compared
    with using numerical models; however, they are typically able to deal with complexities
    found in soil–plant–atmosphere systems (e.g. sprinkler spray patterns, English
    et al. 1992). Use of learning control requires that the variable being regulated
    be representative of overall plant status. This control strategy may require many
    irrigation events to achieve optimality because it is only learning from the measurement
    rather than also using prediction from a crop model. Hence, learning control is
    potentially less efficient than model-based control. In a real-time control system
    it is likely that model-based control systems would be integrated with weather,
    soil moisture and plant development sensing systems for model calibration. However,
    none of the strategies reviewed used this full data set to calibrate the model.
    Sensor considerations for advanced process control in irrigation Reviews have
    been conducted for soil moisture content sensors (Charlesworth 2004) and plant-based
    sensors (White and Raine 2008). These technologies either require direct contact
    or are non-contact and proximal (i.e. hand-held or machine mounted) or remote
    (e.g. airborne, satellite). Contact sensors provide a high temporal resolution
    of data for individual points in the field, whilst proximal sensors only provide
    information when the sensor passes over the field, either on an irrigation machine,
    tractor, aerial vehicle or satellite. Soil moisture sensors are typically fixed
    in the field, whilst plant sensors can be either fixed in the field or proximal.
    The combination of plant, soil and weather data that is used for irrigation control
    commonly depends on the sensor availability and grower preference. Similarly,
    the number of sensors that is required to monitor the in-field spatial variability
    depends on the type of sensor, amount of in-field variability and the grower’s
    preferences. No single sensor (either plant or soil) on its own will indicate
    the optimal water application volume for each irrigation event. Similarly, sensor-based
    irrigation control strategies that use only one data type (e.g. soil moisture
    or plant response) may not specifically optimise the water use or crop performance,
    but are required in situations of low data availability. In contrast, model-based
    control strategies using multiple sensors incorporate information from the soil–plant–atmosphere
    relationships that are defined in crop production models to identify optimal water
    applications. The spatial and temporal resolution of sensors required for site-specific
    advanced process control strategies is likely to depend on the type of control
    strategy. For example, model-based strategies may require measurements during
    each growth stage and following irrigation events to calibrate the model, whilst
    sensor-based strategies may require daily or sub-daily measurements to determine
    irrigation timing. Model-based strategies would be able to use the high spatial
    resolution and low temporal resolution data from proximal sensors. However, the
    higher measurement discrimination required by sensor-based strategies may only
    be achievable (at present) using fixed sensors. In a practical control system,
    a minimum number of fixed sensors would be installed in the field to minimise
    cost and labour but this might provide only low spatial resolution. Hence, soil
    sensors that are easy to install would potentially be appropriate for sensor-based
    strategies, e.g. the soil moisture sensor array reported by Vellidis et al. (2008),
    but such low-cost sensor arrays have yet to be proven adequate for sensor-based
    control. Model- and sensor-based control strategies typically have different data
    requirements. For example, the parameters of the models used by sections “Linear
    quadratic control”, “Artificial intelligence” and “Model predictive control” must
    be calibrated using measurements recognised by the model (e.g. soil moisture content,
    growth stage, plant height and crop coverage). In contrast, section “Learning
    control” uses measured responses to irrigation (e.g. soil moisture content, plant
    status measurements from infrared thermometers, Peters and Evett 2008). Development
    of sensors that measure parameters specifically for model calibration may be required,
    especially as the input parameters of models can vary depending on climate and
    crop type. Camera-based sensors have been proposed for irrigation management to
    measure plant parameters (McCarthy et al. 2009). Fundamental control concepts
    as they apply to irrigation The review of the current state of advanced process
    control systems for irrigation and sensor development in relation to control systems
    indicates that irrigation control strategies should be robust to (1) application
    hardware and water availability constraints; and (2) data availability limitations.
    Following Ogata (1990) the design of a control system that is practical in an
    irrigation environment requires consideration of stability, robustness and optimality,
    described below in order of significance in traditional control systems: 1. Stability
    is a primary requirement of control systems (Krstić et al. 1995) and characterises
    how a system reacts to disturbances (Hangos et al. 2001). A system is stable if
    the signals remain bounded (Isermann et al. 1992); however, stability is a difficult
    property to evaluate in adaptive control systems due to its dynamic nature (Friedland
    1996). 2. Robustness can be interpreted as stability under system disturbances
    (de Silva 2000). The robustness of a control system denotes the insensitivity
    to parameter changes, model errors (in model-based control) and disturbances (in
    input and control signals) (de Silva 2000). Robust control systems are able to
    account for uncertainty in the process parameters to guarantee the stability of
    the system (Landau et al. 1998). 3. The output of a control system should converge
    to the optimal value. Achieving optimality in control systems relies on optimisation
    techniques (Ogata 1990) and optimisation generally consists of searching the space
    of variable controller parameters as a function of the performance index to determine
    where the performance index is optimal (Ogata 1990). However, when considered
    in relation to the control of irrigation, the order of importance changes. Whereas
    control systems are traditionally designed with the greatest emphasis on stability
    (Åström 1990), it is anticipated that the most critical characteristic of systems
    designed for site-specific irrigation application will be robustness. This is
    because in any practical field implementation there are likely to be deficiencies
    in spatial and temporal data availability, and/or constraints on the irrigation
    system capacity or water availability. Optimality is likely to be the next most
    important principle in the design of an irrigation control strategy. To optimise
    automatic irrigation control, a performance index is typically optimised and the
    sensed variable/s used to calculate the performance index varies according to
    the strategy employed. For example, the irrigation applied may be optimised using
    daily measured data and for cotton this may involve determining the irrigation
    that maximises the square count (‘squares’ are flower buds on a cotton plant)
    or boll count after an irrigation event. Alternatively, predicted end of season
    characteristics (i.e. yield, water use efficiency) may be maximised using a process
    model. Stability is arguably the least significant of the control design principles
    in automatic irrigation control. This is because the soil–plant–atmosphere system
    has very slow dynamics compared with typical processes to which automatic control
    is commonly applied (namely electromechanical and many chemical processes) in
    which major changes often occur in less than a second. Although it is conceivable
    that an unusual change in the soil–plant–atmosphere system might cause some fundamental
    instability in the automatic control of irrigation, the system will not become
    unstable rapidly. Advanced process control approaches to irrigation The strategies
    of section “Advanced process control in irrigation: progress to date” and the
    control design principles of section “Fundamental control concepts as they apply
    to irrigation” can be applied to both uniform and site-specific irrigation control
    strategies. Smith et al. (2009) provides an introduction to the potential use
    of control systems to manage spatial and temporal variations in crop water requirements
    to improve the precision of irrigation applications. An advanced process control
    system utilised for irrigation must be robust to intermittent data availability
    and accommodate spatial variability. Irrigation control can be approached by adjusting
    the irrigation application either: (1) directly from the soil and/or crop response
    measurements (‘sensor-based control’); or (2) from responses simulated using a
    soil and crop production model (‘model-based control’). These strategies are suitable
    for both constant and site-specific irrigation, where the measurements taken represent
    the whole field or a smaller area of the field, respectively. Sensor-based irrigation
    control systems may be implemented as a simple feedback control system (e.g. iterative
    learning control: Ahn et al. 2007) which adjusts the applied irrigation volume
    according to the difference between the desired and measured response. An alternate
    implementation is to evaluate the response of multiple irrigation volumes and
    apply the irrigation volume with the best response (e.g. iterative hill climbing
    control, McCarthy et al. 2010a). There are a number of model-based control strategies
    that may be applicable to spatially varied irrigation. These include optimisation
    approaches (as reviewed in the foregoing sections “Mathematical programming”,
    “Linear quadratic control”, “Artificial intelligence” and “Model predictive control”).
    These are considered in this paper in the following sections. The irrigation control
    systems would be implemented in the field using the required sensors which may
    consist of one or a combination of the following: an automatic weather station,
    soil moisture sensors and plant sensors (possibly mounted on the irrigation machine).
    These sensors may transmit wireless data to a controller on the irrigation machine,
    or require manual upload and data transfer. Alternatively, the grower’s observations
    of the soil moisture and plant growth may be used in the control strategies. Similarly,
    the irrigation application may be adjusted at different spatial resolutions (where
    the management areas may be strips of the field or smaller sub-areas of the field),
    and either manually by the grower or automated by a controller. Iterative learning
    control Iterative learning control involves varying the irrigation application
    according to the error between the measured process output and desired process
    output after the previous irrigation. Because this strategy assumes the initial
    conditions are reset after each iteration, the irrigation events would be initiated
    when the crop water use since the previous irrigation event reaches a threshold
    value. The crop conditions would then be approximately the same before each irrigation
    event is initiated. For site-specific irrigation, the iterative learning control
    strategy can consider the irrigation system capacity by increasing the irrigation
    volume applied to cells (i.e. sub-areas) according to the additional crop water
    use (measured from soil moisture sensors or estimated from weather data) between
    the irrigation initiation and when the irrigation is actually applied. Iterative
    learning control also requires data input from each cell in the field; hence,
    measured field data must be kriged in situations of sparse input data to increase
    the spatial resolution of the input data (McCarthy et al. 2010b). Soil moisture
    or leaf area may be used as feedback to measure the system performance for an
    irrigation iterative learning control strategies. The crop water use must be measured
    or estimated each day to determine the irrigation timing. Hence, sensors with
    a high temporal resolution are required. Variable structure control concepts (Åström
    and Wittenmark 1989) may be applied to iterative learning control to ensure that
    the control system is robust to data gaps and deficiencies. This involves adjusting
    the irrigation decision method depending on the input data available. For example,
    if soil data input is not available in one area of the field then plant or weather
    data input may be used to determine the irrigation timing and/or volume. The control
    actions of the iterative learning control strategy use responses from every irrigation
    event in the season rather than from only one irrigation event. This would prevent
    major changes in application during by one irrigation event; hence, stability
    is not likely a major issue for iterative learning control. Iterative learning
    control determines irrigation applications using measurements of soil and/or crop
    response to target the desired soil and/or crop response. These objectives may
    not necessarily optimise final crop yield, profit or water use efficiency. Hence,
    iterative learning control may not reach optimality. Iterative hill climbing control
    A drawback of the iterative learning control strategy is the potentially inefficient
    system identification. This is because there are a limited number of irrigation
    events that occur during a crop season and only one irrigation volume is being
    evaluated in each cell during each irrigation event. Adaptive spatially-varied
    identification may be achieved by utilising site-specific combinations of plant,
    soil and weather data in different zones of the field. Likewise, adaptive system
    identification may be incorporated into an irrigation control system to account
    for the slow speed of crop dynamics and the frequency of irrigation events. The
    efficiency of control systems may be improved for irrigation by evaluating a range
    of inputs to the system at each irrigation event. This would be implemented for
    an irrigation control system by applying and evaluating a range of irrigation
    volumes on different cells in the field. This is similar to the dual adaptive
    control concept (Wittenmark 2002) where perturbation signals are used to learn
    more about the process. This method has been adapted to irrigation and named ‘iterative
    hill climbing control’. ‘Hill climbing’ involves changing the state of the system
    into one that is closer to the goal in the direction of steepest gradient (Russell
    and Norvig 1995). The strategy involves the following process (McCarthy et al.
    2010a): 1. The field is divided into zones according to a pre-measured variability
    map. 2. ‘Test cells’ are selected in each zone to evaluate different irrigation
    volumes. 3. Test irrigation volumes are applied to each test cell. 4. Before the
    next irrigation is applied the crop response to the previous irrigation volume
    is evaluated. A performance index is calculated for each test cell in each zone
    to evaluate the response of the soil and/or plant to the irrigation volume. Using
    plant data in the performance index calculation may involve maximising the square
    count and this is similar to the extremum adaptive control concept. The irrigation
    volume that was applied to the test cell with the highest performance index is
    then applied to the whole zone. 5. Steps 3 and 4 are repeated for each irrigation
    event. New test cells are also randomly selected in each zone after each irrigation
    event to ensure that the response of a test cell is indicative of the rest of
    the zone. Possible objectives of the iterative hill climbing control are to achieve
    a set soil moisture content or vegetative growth, or maximising yield indicators
    (e.g. square count for cotton). As per iterative learning control (section “Iterative
    learning control”), measurements to determine irrigation volume are only required
    before each irrigation event. However, irrigation timing may be determined after
    a set crop water use which requires data at a higher temporal resolution. Spatial
    data unavailability is generally not important for iterative hill climbing control
    as data input is only required for the test cells. However, if field measurements
    of a test cell are missing, kriging the available data would not show the response
    of the test cells to the test irrigation volumes. Hence, kriging is not appropriate
    for iterative hill climbing control and if critical data input is missing the
    control procedure will fail. As per the iterative learning controller, the irrigation
    system capacity may be considered by increasing the irrigation application according
    to the crop water consumed since the irrigation was initiated. The strategy should
    also be robust to data gaps by using the available streams of data if the desired
    data stream input is unavailable. For example, if plant measurements are not available
    for a strategy that aims to maximise square count, then the strategy will determine
    irrigation application to achieve a set soil moisture content. Also similar to
    iterative learning control, the irrigation volumes applied would have stability.
    This is because the crop coefficients evaluated in the test cells are offset from
    the crop coefficient of the previous irrigation. Hence, only progressive changes
    are made to the irrigation volume applied throughout the crop season, effectively
    dampening any changes to the irrigation application. Iterative hill climbing control
    can potentially aim to maximise plant variables (e.g. square count for cotton)
    which should lead to near-optimality. However, such variables may only be measurable
    towards the end of the crop season and the strategy used at the start of the season
    may not necessary optimise the irrigation application. Model predictive control
    Model predictive control involves using a calibrated model to evaluate a range
    of inputs and implement the input strategy with the best performance. For irrigation,
    model predictive control could involve using real-time field data to calibrate
    a crop and soil model (McCarthy et al. 2011) and then using the calibrated model
    to determine the optimum irrigation timing and volume. Soil and/or plant measurements
    are required to calibrate the model, ideally during each growing stage and in
    response to known irrigation volumes for accurate model calibration. Proximal
    plant sensors would be appropriate for model predictive control because the measurements
    are not necessarily required daily to calibrate the model. Mounting these sensors
    on an irrigation machine or farm machinery also enables data collection at a high
    spatial resolution. Model predictive control can be used to incorporate system
    level constraints into the optimisation algorithm. For example, the limitations
    of irrigation system capacity and seasonal water availability can be considered
    in determining the appropriate volume and timing of irrigation future irrigation
    applications. The model predictive control strategy may produce the same optimal
    crop water use and yield for various distributions of water during the crop season.
    If more than one irrigation volume has the same performance, then a water-efficient
    approach could be taken by selecting the irrigation volume and timing with the
    lowest quantitative volume to achieve the optimal simulated performance. An alternate
    approach is to use grower-specific preferences for the irrigation distribution.
    For example, the grower may have a preference for using lower amounts of water
    early in the season to provide soil water capacity for rainfall during the season.
    Because model predictive control uses a model’s simulations to determine irrigation
    application, variables that are not directly measured (e.g. final crop yield and
    water use efficiency) may potentially be controlled and optimised. In contrast,
    the iterative learning and iterative hill climbing control strategies determine
    irrigation applications using measurements of soil and/or crop response to target
    the desired soil and/or crop response. The performance objective that the controller
    uses depends on the specific objectives of the grower/manager. Model predictive
    control could be robust to cells with data gaps by spatially interpolating the
    available measurements and using these measurements to calibrate the unknown model
    parameters. Because the model is calibrated over the crop season and not just
    from one measurement, model predictive control would not be susceptible to major
    instability. Conclusion Advanced process control is applicable to irrigation which
    has slow dynamics, even though it was developed for relatively fast mechanical
    and chemical processes. This control technique has the capability to deal with
    the complexities of managing the soil–plant–atmosphere system using a range of
    irrigation systems and configurations (i.e. either constant or site-specific irrigation
    with manual or automatic actuation). This has been demonstrated by identification
    of three advanced process control strategies and their application to irrigation:
    iterative learning control, iterative hill climbing control and model predictive
    control. Investigation of the sensor requirements for each control strategy should
    be conducted in the development and analysis of any advanced process control system
    for irrigation. Irrigation control strategies should have minimal sensor requirements
    to ensure the system is practical for growers and enhance the future uptake of
    the technology. Sensor availability is at present a constraint on the automation
    of irrigation control, and it is expected that the requirements of advanced process
    control for irrigation will also drive sensor development. Future research needs
    identified include control strategy development and field evaluation with different
    irrigation systems and field conditions. Notes Optimal control is used to derive
    differential equations which determine the control action to be taken at any time
    for a given system to achieve the desired optimality criterion (Burns 2001). The
    fundamental derivation approach for optimal control is the ‘calculus of variations’
    which finds the path, curve or surface (in the form of differential equations)
    for which a given function has a stationary value which corresponds to the maximum
    or minimum, as required. Evolutionary algorithms are inspired by the process of
    biological evolution and involve an iterative procedure whereby a population of
    trial solutions (irrigation application schemes) is evaluated and each solution
    is assigned a fitness that indicates the performance. The population is then evolved
    and a new generation of solutions is created from the solutions of the previous
    generation with the highest fitness (Filippidis et al. 1999). References Ahn HS,

  description: In a soilless culture, water and nutrients must be frequently and precisely
    applied due to the reduced volume and low water holding capacity of the substrate.
    We describe a low-cost and efficient control system for the irrigation management
    of soilless culture based on an irrigation tray. Both irrigation and drainage
    volumes from the irrigation control tray are measured automatically. The proposed
    irrigation scheduling options were based on applying both variable timing and
    amounts. A Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) algorithm was used to establish
    the irrigation timing option while two different irrigation application options,
    based on measurements from the drainage hydrograph, were developed and tested.
    A field test performed on a tomato crop was carried out to assess the performance
    of the two irrigation application options. Both irrigation algorithms performed
    well as they fitted the leaching fraction for every irrigation event to the target
    value. The fruit yield and quality were comparable to results obtained from the
    control treatment of the tomato crop. The designed low-cost irrigation control
    system, if implemented on commercial farms, could prove to be economically very
    beneficial.

  key_findings: Both irrigation application options based on feedback from drainage
    hydrograph measurements performed well, maintaining the leaching fraction close
    to the target value. Fruit yield and quality were comparable to the control treatment,
    indicating the effectiveness of the system.
  limitations: The paper focuses on a specific implementation of a closed-loop control
    system for soilless culture, so the findings may not be directly applicable to
    other types of irrigation systems or crops. The study was conducted in a controlled
    environment, so the performance of the system may differ in real-world farming
    conditions.
  main_objective: To develop and test a low-cost, efficient automatic irrigation control
    system for soilless culture using feedback from drainage hydrograph measurements.
  relevance_evaluation: This paper is very relevant to the point in my literature
    review that focuses on closed-loop control and feedback mechanisms for ensuring
    system reliability in automated irrigation systems. The paper describes a practical
    implementation of a closed-loop irrigation control system using a PID algorithm
    and feedback from drainage hydrograph measurements. It provides valuable insights
    into the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of such a system in
    a soilless culture environment.

  description: Amid concerns about freshwater scarcity, the agricultural sector faces
    challenges in water conservation and optimizing crop yields, highlighting the
    limitations of traditional irrigation scheduling methods. To overcome these challenges,
    this paper introduces a unified, learning-based predictive irrigation scheduler
    that integrates machine learning and Model Predictive Control (MPC), while also
    incorporating multi-agent principles. The proposed framework incorporates a three-stage
    management zone delineation process, utilizing k-means clustering and hydraulic
    parameters estimates for optimized agro-hydrological modeling. Long Short-Term
    Memory (LSTM) networks are employed for accurate and computationally efficient
    root zone soil moisture modeling. The scheduler, formulated as a mixed-integer
    MPC with zone control, utilizes the identified LSTM networks to maximize root
    water uptake while minimizing overall water consumption and fixed irrigation costs.
    Additionally, the learning-based scheduler adopts a multi-agent MPC paradigm,
    where decentralized hybrid actor–critic agents and the concept of a limiting irrigation
    management zone are employed to enhance computational efficiency. Evaluating the

    seasons demonstrates the superiority of the proposed scheduler over the widely-used
    triggered scheduling approach in terms of Irrigation Water Use Efficiency (IWUE)
    and total prescribed irrigation. Notably, the proposed approach achieves water
    savings between 7 to 23%, coupled with IWUE increases ranging from 10 to 35%.

  explanation: 'This study introduces a novel irrigation scheduling framework that
    combines three machine learning paradigms (unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement
    learning) with model predictive control and multi-agent principles to design a
    precise irrigation scheduler for large-scale fields. The proposed framework offers
    several key advantages.

    - **Accurate and computationally efficient soil moisture modeling:** The framework
    employs long short-term memory (LSTM) models to directly model the dynamic behavior
    of root zone soil moisture content in each irrigation management zone, while accounting
    for the time-varying nature of the rooting depth.

    - **Management zone delineation tailored to agro-hydrological modeling:** A three-stage
    process with a k-means clustering approach is utilized to accurately delineate
    irrigation management zones. This process includes elevation and estimated soil
    hydraulic parameters as attributes, resulting in optimized management zones suitable
    for agro-hydrological modeling.

    concerns about freshwater scarcity, the agricultural sector faces challenges in
    water conservation and optimizing crop yields, highlighting the limitations of
    traditional irrigation scheduling methods. To overcome these challenges, this
    paper introduces a unified, learning-based predictive irrigation scheduler that
    integrates machine learning and Model Predictive Control (MPC), while also incorporating
    multi-agent principles. The proposed framework incorporates a three-stage management
    zone delineation process, utilizing k-means clustering and hydraulic parameters

    1. Introduction According to the United Nations, agriculture accounts for approximately
    70% of the world’s freshwater withdrawals, with the majority of the water being
    used for irrigation activities (WWAP, 2015). However, with the global freshwater
    shortage crisis worsening due to rapid population growth and climate change, there
    is a pressing need for effective water management strategies, particularly in
    relation to irrigation activities, in order to address the growing freshwater
    shortages. Closed-loop irrigation scheduling, which utilizes feedback to provide
    crops with precise water amounts at optimal times, has been proposed as a solution
    for ensuring efficient water management in irrigation. In the context of designing
    closed-loop irrigation schedulers, machine learning techniques and model predictive
    control have emerged as valuable tools. 1.1. Unsupervised learning in irrigation
    scheduling To improve water-use efficiency in closed-loop irrigation scheduling,
    it is essential to consider the inherent variability in agricultural fields, which
    necessitates the development of variable rate closed-loop schedulers. A key aspect
    of designing variable rate schedulers involves dividing the field into distinct
    irrigation management zones, which are characterized as homogeneous areas with
    similar soil properties and cropping conditions. This zoning approach enables
    a targeted irrigation approach, optimizing the allocation of water across different
    zones. Unsupervised machine learning techniques such as k-means clustering (Galambošová
    et al., 2014, Haghverdi et al., 2015), fuzzy c-means clustering (Fontanet et al.,
    2020, Li et al., 2007) and Gaussian Mixture (Yuan et al., 2022) have emerged as
    valuable tools in delineating fields into irrigation management zones, utilizing
    attributes such as yield maps, topography, satellite photographs and soil electrical
    conductivity. Despite the reported effectiveness of current management zone delineation
    approaches, designing model-based irrigation schedulers for these zones presents
    challenges. A significant challenge is that existing methods do not explicitly
    consider crucial model inputs, such as soil hydraulic parameters, mainly due to
    difficulties in obtaining accurate field-scale hydraulic parameter data. One practical
    approach to obtain soil hydraulic parameters at field scale is to estimate these
    parameters using field measurements. Remarkably, the literature has not yet investigated
    the utilization of estimated soil hydraulic parameters for the purpose of defining
    irrigation management zones that can be effectively modeled using agro-hydrological
    models. 1.2. Supervised learning in irrigation scheduling Supervised machine learning
    techniques have been utilized to develop efficient and accurate agro-hydrological
    models, enabling the design of robust irrigation schedulers. Notably, long short-term
    memory networks (LSTMs) (Adeyemi et al., 2018, Agyeman, Sahoo et al., 2023, Jiménez
    et al., 2020) and feed-forward neural networks (Gu, Zhu, Jiao, Xu, & Qi, 2021)
    have gained attention in this context. Despite their success, challenges persist
    in these modeling approaches. For example, previous LSTM models (Adeyemi et al.,
    2018, Agyeman, Sahoo et al., 2023) predicted soil moisture at a single location
    within the crop’s rooting depth, neglecting the fact that crops extract water
    from multiple locations. An attempt to address this in Gu et al. (2021) involved
    training multiple feedforward neural networks to predict soil moisture at specific
    locations within the rooting depth, with irrigation schedules derived through
    a weighted average of the model predictions. However, this method, while effective,
    poses challenges for optimization-based irrigation schedulers, as integrating
    multiple neural network predictions significantly increases computational complexity
    and time. Additionally, the feed-forward neural network in Gu et al. (2021) has
    a limitation, considering only a single rooting depth and not accommodating the
    time-varying nature of rooting depth, potentially impacting irrigation schedule
    accuracy. The literature has yet to explore the development of a concise data-driven
    model using machine learning to directly predict root zone soil moisture content
    while considering dynamic changes in rooting depth. 1.3. Scheduling In a broad
    context, ‘scheduling’ involves determining the optimal allocation of limited resources
    to achieve a specific objective. Scheduling is a decision-making process aimed
    at optimizing one or more objectives, considering the ongoing processes and their
    interactions with the environment. The challenges of scheduling are prevalent
    in various manufacturing and chemical processing systems. Numerous approaches
    have been proposed to address scheduling problems in chemical process systems.
    For instance, dynamic optimization-based scheduler formulations, as seen in Flores-Tlacuahuac
    and Grossmann (2006) and Zhuge and Ierapetritou (2014), have been employed to
    account for the dynamic nature of chemical processes. Furthermore, insights from
    Subramanian, Maravelias, and Rawlings (2012) have facilitated the transformation
    of scheduling models into state–space form. Reactive scheduling (Mendez and Cerdá,
    2004, Touretzky et al., 2017), robust scheduling (Li & Floudas, 2014) and closed-loop
    scheduling (Gupta et al., 2016, Subramanian et al., 2012) approaches have been
    introduced to handle uncertainties’ impact on schedule quality. Another emerging
    area is the integration of production scheduling and process control (Burnak et
    al., 2018, Zhuge and Ierapetritou, 2012), driven by the substantial economic benefits
    derived from a closer integration of scheduling and supervisory control. 1.4.
    Model predictive control Model Predictive Control (MPC) has significantly shaped
    control practice, especially in addressing constrained multivariable control problems.
    It operates by synthesizing control inputs through the iterative solution of finite
    horizon optimal control problems across overlapping horizons. Recently, MPC theory
    and methods have found application in addressing scheduling problems (Subramanian
    et al., 2012). Notably, MPC has been extended to scheduling-related domains like
    inventory control (Yi & Reklaitis, 2015) and supply chain management (Subramanian,
    Rawlings, & Maravelias, 2014). In the field of irrigation scheduling, set-point
    tracking MPC (Delgoda et al., 2016, McCarthy et al., 2014) and zone MPC (Nahar,
    Liu, Mao, Liu, & Shah, 2019) have been utilized to calculate irrigation schedules.
    It is important to note that these MPC-based irrigation schedulers primarily focused
    on continuous-valued inputs. However, scheduling problems inherently involve combinatorial
    aspects, requiring discrete decisions to allocate limited resources over time.
    For instance, in the daily irrigation scheduling problem, determining the irrigation
    time involves discrete decision-making. Recent research has shown that discrete-valued
    controls can be directly integrated into the MPC framework with minimal adjustments
    to stability properties (Rawlings & Risbeck, 2017). Consequently, this has led
    to the application of mixed-integer MPC to address scheduling challenges in various
    domains, including chemical production systems (Risbeck et al., 2018, Subramanian
    et al., 2012). In the field of irrigation scheduling, a novel approach, namely
    LSTM-based mixed-integer MPC with zone control, was proposed in Agyeman, Sahoo
    et al. (2023) to address the daily irrigation scheduling problem. Despite advancements
    in optimization techniques, mixed-integer MPC still encounters computational challenges,
    particularly in large-scale systems. Therefore, there is a need to develop techniques
    that can efficiently solve mixed-integer MPC problems within a reasonable time
    frame. In this context, the sigmoid function approach was employed to enhance
    the computational efficiency of mixed-integer MPC-based irrigation schedulers
    (Agyeman, Sahoo et al., 2023). Despite its success, it is essential to address
    its limitations, such as approximation errors and occasional challenges with poorly
    conditioned optimization problems. Overcoming these issues can be achieved by
    leveraging the current achievements of reinforcement learning in addressing complex
    problems. An additional under-explored aspect is the comprehensive evaluation
    of the real benefits associated with adopting MPC methods in irrigation scheduling.
    Despite the potential advantages, such as enhanced irrigation water-use efficiency
    compared to the widely-used triggered approach, a notable research gap exists
    in the lack of extensive comparative analyses between MPC-based scheduling and
    the standard approach. Bridging this gap is important for promoting the wider
    adoption of MPC-based schedulers in practical irrigation settings. 1.5. Reinforcement
    learning in irrigation scheduling Reinforcement learning (RL), a subset of machine
    learning designed for decision-making in dynamic environments, plays a pivotal
    role in addressing key challenges in irrigation scheduling. Applied to this context,
    RL has demonstrated its utility in handling uncertainties associated with weather
    conditions, improving robustness, automating sensor data acquisition, and calculating
    irrigation schedules (Chen et al., 2021, Ding and Du, 2020, Yang et al., 2020).
    RL has also introduced a new approach to solving complex optimal control problems
    like mixed-integer MPC (Vinyals et al., 2019). Various strategies, such as hierarchical
    structures (Masson et al., 2016, Wei et al., 2018), and hybrid actor–critic approaches
    (Fan, Su, Zhang, & Yu, 2019), have been proposed to adapt RL algorithms for handling
    both discrete and continuous actions inherent in mixed-integer optimal control
    problems. Despite these advancements, research on RL for mixed-integer optimal
    control problems in engineering applications remains limited (Xu & Lin, 2023).
    Furthermore, the application of RL techniques to mixed-integer MPC problems in
    irrigation scheduling has not been explored. 1.6. Scope of work From the above,
    it is evident that existing irrigation schedulers primarily focus on utilizing
    individual machine learning paradigms to tackle specific challenges inherent in
    the irrigation scheduling problem. Likewise, MPC-based irrigation schedulers primarily
    integrate one of these machine learning paradigms into their design. The potential
    advantages of harmonizing these methodologies have yet to be explored within a
    single irrigation scheduling framework. Accordingly, the main objective of this
    study is to propose a novel irrigation scheduling framework that incorporates
    all three machine learning paradigms and mixed-integer MPC within a unified framework.
    In the effort to integrate all three machine learning paradigms and mixed-integer
    MPC into a single framework, this work makes the following contributions: 1. The
    development of a three-stage irrigation management zone process that incorporates
    k-means clustering and estimated soil hydraulic parameters to delineate large-scale
    agricultural fields into irrigation management zones optimized for agro- hydrological
    modeling. 2. The utilization of LSTM networks to develop a computationally efficient
    data-driven models capable of directly predicting root zone soil moisture content
    while accounting for dynamic nature of the crop rooting depth. 3. The use of decentralized
    hybrid actor–critic agents and the concept of a limiting irrigation management
    zone to enhance the computational efficiency of mixed-integer MPC for irrigation
    scheduling in agricultural fields with multiple management zones. 4. The demonstration
    of the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling approach on a real field. During
    this demonstration, a comparison between the proposed MPC-based scheduling approach
    and the widely employed scheduling approach is performed in terms of irrigation
    water-use efficiency and total prescribed irrigation. This paper extends the findings
    presented in Agyeman, Nouri, Appels and Liu (2023). In contrast to Agyeman, Nouri
    et al. (2023), the current work introduces a new approach that leverages LSTM
    networks to develop computationally efficient data-driven models. Additionally,
    this study employs decentralized hybrid actor–critic agents and introduces the
    concept of a limiting management zone to enhance the computational efficiency
    of the mixed-integer MPC-based irrigation scheduler. Furthermore, the paper conducts
    a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed scheduling framework on a large-scale
    agricultural field. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. k-means clustering for management
    zone delineation In the context of designing efficient closed-loop irrigation
    schedulers, the process of management zone delineation assumes an important role
    as an essential initial step. To this end, this study proposes a three-stage approach
    for management zone delineation that incorporates k-means clustering and estimated
    soil hydraulic parameters. The resulting management zones from this approach are
    optimized for agro-hydrological modeling. A detailed explanation of the various
    stages is provided below. 1. Stage 1: delineation according to crop type. The
    initial step in the proposed approach involves creating uniform areas within an
    agricultural field based on the diverse crops present. This step is important,
    as irrigation scheduling is significantly influenced by the varying water requirements
    of different crops. Given the common practice of cultivating a variety of crops
    in irrigated fields, using crop type as a basis for the initial delineation allows
    the subsequent stages of the proposed approach to effectively address the specific
    water needs of individual crops present in the agricultural field. 2. Stage 2:
    delineation according to elevation and soil-hydraulic parameters. In this stage,
    the management zones identified in Stage 1 undergo further refinement into uniform
    areas by incorporating elevation and soil hydraulic parameter attributes. The
    inclusion of elevation information is vital for ensuring effective irrigation
    management, as elevation significantly governs water movement within agricultural
    fields. Similarly, soil hydraulic parameters play a crucial role in irrigation
    scheduling, influencing soil moisture dynamics and water availability to crops.
    Elevation information can be readily obtained at the field scale through methods
    such as surveying or utilizing digital elevation models. Nevertheless, accurate
    determination of soil hydraulic parameters at the field scale poses challenges.
    To overcome this, this study employs a computationally efficient offline estimation
    technique, as previously proposed in Agyeman, Orouskhani, and Liu (2022) and Orouskhani,
    Agyeman, and Liu (2022), for acquiring soil hydraulic parameters in this stage.
    In this offline estimation step, soil moisture and hydraulic parameters are simultaneously
    estimated by assimilating remotely sensed soil moisture observations into the
    Richards equation using the extended Kalman filtering technique. For further details
    on the estimation approach in this stage of the delineation process, interested
    readers may refer to Agyeman et al. (2022) and Orouskhani et al. (2022). The specific
    hydraulic parameters used in this stage include saturated hydraulic conductivity
    ( ), saturated moisture content ( ), residual moisture content ( ), and curve
    fitting parameters ( , ). After obtaining the elevation information and soil hydraulic
    parameters attributes, they are combined to form the primary dataset for management
    zone delineation. Due to differences in magnitudes between elevation values and
    the soil hydraulic parameter estimates, the primary dataset exhibits features
    with considerable variations in magnitude. Consequently, the dataset undergoes
    normalization to standardize all features to a consistent magnitude level. To
    identify the optimal number of clusters or management zones, the elbow method
    is employed. Once identified, clustering is conducted on the normalized data using
    the k-means method to obtain the distinct management zones. The choice of the
    k-means clustering method is justified by its efficiency in handling large datasets
    and its simplicity in implementation. A summary of the key steps involved in this
    stage of the delineation process can be found in Fig. 1. 3. Stage 3: mapping homogeneous
    areas to irrigation equipment resolution. Subsequent to the clustering in the
    second stage, the resultant management zones often display irregular shapes, presenting
    challenges in the efficient application of water using the field’s irrigation
    equipment. To overcome this, the management zones are refined by subdividing them
    into smaller, more uniform sub-zones. This adjustment aligns the zones with the
    resolution of the field’s irrigation equipment, enhancing precision and efficiency
    in irrigation application. Remark 1 While the k-means approach is chosen for its
    simplicity, computational efficiency and extensive use in management zone delineation,
    it is important to acknowledge that it does not guarantee the discovery of the
    optimal number of clusters (or management zones). This limitation arises from
    its tendency to converge to local optima solutions, a consequence of the iterative
    nature of the algorithm starting from random initial centroids. On the other hand,
    alternative clustering approaches, such as the Global Optimal Search (GOS) (Tan,
    Broach, & Floudas, 2007), offer the potential to overcome this limitation. GOS
    is more likely to converge to a global optimum, especially when a reliable initial
    guess for the clustering data is available. In situations where achieving a globally
    optimal solution is key, approaches like GOS becomes more suitable. The GOS method
    can replace the k-means approach in the proposed management zone delineation process
    in a straightforward manner. Download : Download high-res image (230KB) Download

    The second pivotal phase in designing a model-based closed-loop irrigation scheduler
    involves creating agro-hydrological models that are both computationally efficient
    and accurate in describing soil moisture dynamics within each irrigation management
    zone obtained in Section 2.1. This section introduces an approach for identifying
    concise data-driven agro-hydrological models using LSTM networks. LSTM networks
    are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can effectively capture long
    term dependencies. This special type of RNN is selected for its effectiveness
    in representing complex causal systems, such as an agro-hydrological system. It
    is noteworthy that leveraging long-term, in situ soil water measurements and weather
    data from agricultural fields is one of the most effective approaches for accurately
    identifying data-driven agro-hydrological models. However, in situations where
    long-term data is not readily available, utilizing open-loop simulated data from
    properly calibrated mechanistic models serves as a valuable alternative for developing
    accurate data-driven models. In this study, the latter approach, depicted in Fig.
    2, is employed to identify data-driven agro-hydrological models for the delineated
    management zones. The management zone delineation approach presented in Section
    2.1 relies on soil hydraulic parameters estimated from real-time soil moisture
    measurements obtained from the field under study. Consequently, the soil hydraulic
    parameters corresponding to the centroid of each management zone (or cluster)
    are expected to offer a reliable representation of the soil properties within
    each respective zone. By calibrating a mechanistic agro-hydrological model with
    these centroidal soil hydraulic parameters, the mechanistic model is anticipated
    to accurately describe the soil moisture dynamics in each management zone. Subsequently,
    open-loop simulated data from this calibrated model can be utilized to develop
    an accurate data-driven agro-hydrological model for the respective management
    zone. Download : Download high-res image (425KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. LSTM network development. This section begins with a description
    of the mechanistic agro-hydrological model, specifically the Richards equation,
    that is employed in this study. It concludes with a discussion on how LSTM networks
    can be leveraged to identify a compact data-driven agro-hydrological model capable
    of predicting root zone soil moisture content in each management zone while accounting
    for the time-varying nature of crop rooting depth, using open-loop simulated data
    from the calibrated Richards equation. 2.2.1. Richards equation The Richards equation
    is a mechanistic agro-hydrological model that can be used to model the transport
    of water in soil. In this study, the 1D version (in the axial direction) of the
    Richards equation, calibrated with the centroidal soil hydraulic parameters in
    each management zone, is employed to accurately describe the water transport within
    each zone. This choice is justified by considering that elevation information
    was factored into the management zone delineation process, and as a result, the
    elevation profile within a specific management zone is expected to remain relatively
    uniform. The 1D version of the Richards equation is expressed as: (1) In Eq. (1),
    is the capillary pressure head, which describes the status of water in soil, represents
    time, is the spatial coordinate, is the unsaturated hydraulic water conductivity,
    is the capillary capacity. Note that and are parameterized functions that are
    relevant for solving Eq. (1). is a dimensionless stress water factor, is the root
    water uptake model which is a function of the crop coefficient , the reference
    evapotranspiration , and the rooting depth . In order to solve the 1D Richards
    equation numerically, the following boundary conditions are typically imposed:
    (2) (3) where , , and in Eqs. (2), (3) represent the depth of the soil column,
    the irrigation rate and the evaporation rate, respectively. The method of lines
    numerical approach proposed in Agyeman, Sahoo et al. (2023) is employed to solve
    Eq. (1). Additionally, the precise mathematical expressions for , and can be found
    in Agyeman et al. (2021). Interested readers may refer to the aforementioned references
    for a detailed explanation of the numerical approach. Furthermore, once a numerical
    value of the capillary pressure head is obtained, the volumetric soil moisture
    content can be obtained as follows: (4) where the parameters in Eq. (4) are as
    defined in Section 2.1. In the calibration process of the 1D Richards equations,
    the centroidal hydraulic parameters are utilized to parameterize functions , ,
    and . The calibrated 1D Richards equation, after applying the method of lines
    approach, can be written in state–space form as: (5) (6) where represents the
    state vector containing capillary pressure head values for the spatial nodes in
    the soil column. represents the input vector containing the irrigation amount,
    precipitation, daily reference evapotranspiration, the crop coefficient, and the
    rooting depth. is the model disturbance, and represents the 5 centroidal hydraulic
    parameters. The volumetric water content is chosen as the output . Eq. (6) is
    thus a general representation of Eq. (4) and represents the output vector containing
    volumetric soil moisture content values for the corresponding spatial nodes in
    the soil column. 2.2.2. Training data generation The training dataset is generated
    by solving Eqs. (5), (6) for randomly generated inputs and initial states , with
    some level of noise included in the simulations to account for model uncertainty
    and to enhance the generalization ability and robustness of the LSTM network.
    Model uncertainty is treated as additive in nature. During open-loop simulations
    of the Richards equation, this uncertainty is modeled through realizations drawn
    from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. The variance of this distribution
    is determined based on simulation experiments, ensuring a realistic representation
    of uncertainty. The use of randomly generated inputs and initial states is suggested
    to ensure that the dataset encompasses the dynamics of soil moisture under various
    conditions. For irrigation scheduling purposes, it is important to focus on the
    soil moisture dynamics in the entire root zone of a particular management zone.
    Thus, once the open-loop simulations are completed, the computation of root zone
    soil water content at each time step in the dataset becomes necessary. In this
    study, this is achieved by utilizing the volumetric soil moisture content vector
    obtained at each time step in the dataset. To determine the root zone soil moisture
    content, a weighted sum is applied to the elements in the volumetric soil moisture
    content vector. The weights are assigned as follows: 40% to the average volumetric
    moisture content value in the upper quarter of the rooting depth , 30% to the
    average value in the second quarter, 20% to the average value in the third quarter,
    and 10% to the average value in the last quarter. This weighting effectively captures
    the relative importance of moisture at different depths within the crop rooting
    depth, ensuring an effective representation of root zone soil moisture dynamics
    for irrigation scheduling purposes. 2.2.3. Model design The LSTM network is trained
    to make daily predictions of the root zone volumetric moisture content. Its primary
    objective is to forecast the root zone volumetric water content one day ahead
    ( ), denoted as . To achieve this, the network utilizes both current ( ) and past
    inputs ( , , …, ), where represents the time lag (in days) or sequence length
    used for model development. The specific inputs to the network include the root
    zone volumetric water content , precipitation (i.e. the sum of rain and irrigation
    rate) , crop coefficient , reference evapotranspiration , and the rooting depth
    . The incorporation of rooting depth as an input into the model is crucial because
    it enables the network to account for the time-varying nature of the rooting depth.
    Mathematically, the identified LSTM model can be expressed as: (7) where ≔ and
    . In Eq. (7), is a compact representation of the weights and biases of the LSTM
    network . 2.2.4. Model evaluation A comparative study is conducted to assess the
    predictive performance of the trained LSTM networks. In this comparative study,
    a specific initial state is chosen, and predetermined trajectories are defined
    for the precipitation, crop coefficient, and reference evapotranspiration inputs
    over a specified period. Subsequently, both the identified LSTM network and its
    corresponding calibrated 1D Richards equation are simulated using the selected
    initial state and predefined input trajectories. The predictions generated by
    the data-driven model are then compared against the computed root zone soil moisture
    content obtained from the calibrated Richards equation. The assessment of prediction
    accuracy utilizes the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), as expressed by Eq. (B.1)
    in Appendix B.3. 2.3. Mixed-integer MPC with zone control for irrigation scheduling
    The irrigation scheduling problem, originally proposed in Agyeman, Sahoo et al.
    (2023), is modeled as a variant of the warehouse location problem, where the irrigation
    implementing equipment plays the role of a warehouse, and the decision to operate
    the equipment is treated as the decision to operate a warehouse. In this context,
    the fixed cost of operating the equipment is analogously considered as the fixed
    cost of opening a warehouse, while the variable cost of supplying water to the
    agricultural field is equated to the variable cost of operating a warehouse. The
    objective function is to minimize the total cost (fixed and variable) of operating
    the irrigation equipment over a planning horizon, subject to constraints that
    ensure that the demand for water in each management zone is met, and that the
    total supply of water does not exceed the capacity of the irrigation equipment.
    To modify the formulation to maintain the root zone soil moisture within a target
    zone, a penalty for violating the target zone is added to the objective function,
    and the constraints are updated to ensure that the root zone soil moisture is
    maintained within the target zone. Furthermore, the dynamics of root zone soil
    moisture must be considered during the planning horizon, as the root zone soil
    moisture level changes over the planning horizon. This modified formulation results
    in a mixed-integer MPC problem with zone objectives (zone control), where the
    identified data-driven agro-hydrological model for each management zone is employed
    as the dynamic model in the formulation. Additionally, a soft constraint approach
    is employed to realize the objective of maintaining the root zone soil moisture
    in the target zone where slack variables are introduced in the formulation to
    relax the bounds of the target zone. By solving the mixed-integer MPC with zone
    objectives problem, the optimal schedules (daily irrigation decision and daily
    irrigation rate) for operating the irrigation equipment can be determined that
    minimize the total cost of operation while maintaining the root zone soil moisture
    within the target zone throughout the planning horizon. To facilitate a better
    understanding of the proposed scheduler formulation for fields comprising multiple
    management zones, the formulation is initially applied to a field with a single
    management zone. For day within a planning horizon of days, the scheduler is formulated
    for a single management zone as follows: (8a) (8b) (8c) (8d) (8e) (8f) (8g) where
    , ≔ , ≔ , ≔ , ≔ , and ≔ where . and ((8a), (8g)) are nonnegative slack variables
    that are introduced to relax the bounds of the target zone in (8d). In this work,
    and (also known as the threshold volumetric moisture content ) are calculated
    as follows: (9) (10) where is the volumetric moisture content at field capacity,
    represents the volumetric water content at the wilting point, and MAD refers to
    the management allowable depletion, which indicates the fraction of the total
    available water that is permitted to be depleted. The per-unit costs associated
    with the violation of the lower and upper bounds of the target zone are represented
    with and , respectively. and represent the per-unit cost of the applied irrigation
    amount and the fixed cost associated with operating the irrigation implementing
    equipment, respectively. The binary decision variable encodes the daily irrigation
    decision. The cost function (8a) incorporates the objectives of maintaining the
    root zone volumetric moisture content in a target zone in order to ensure optimal
    water uptake in crops by minimizing the violation of the target zone , minimizing
    the irrigation cost , and minimizing the irrigation amount . Constraint (8b) corresponds
    to the LSTM model of the root zone volumetric moisture content, and in this constraint
    represents the weights and bias terms associated with the identified LSTM model.
    In this work, the initial state is represented with Constraint (8c). Its value
    is assumed to be known during the evaluation of the scheduler. In particular,
    it is chosen to be the estimated state obtained after the state and parameter
    estimation step outlined in Section 2.1 has converged. Constraint (8e) refers
    to the maximum amount of water that can be supplied during an irrigation event
    on day . When the irrigation decision on day is “a no decision” ( ), Constraint
    (8e) requires that the irrigation rate must be set to 0. Conversely, when the
    irrigation decision on a particular day is “a yes decision” ( ), Constraint (8e)
    specifies that the prescribed irrigation rate must not exceed its upper bound
    ( ) and must be at least as large as its lower bound ( ). After providing a detailed
    description of the scheduler design for a single management zone, the daily scheduler
    for a field with management zones is formulated as follows: (11a) (11b) (11c)
    (11d) (11e) (11f) (11g) where , , ≔ , ≔ , and ≔ . is a closed set that contains
    the positional indices of the management zones. Essentially, the formulation aims
    to duplicate the formulation for each of the management zones present in the field.
    Furthermore, it is apparent that in all management zones, the binary values over
    the planning horizon remain the same in . 2.4. Enhancing the computational efficiency
    of : Decentralized hybrid actor-critic agents and limiting management zone While
    numerical optimization methods, such as the branch and bound technique, can be
    used to solve , they may encounter computational challenges, especially when dealing
    with agricultural fields comprising a large number of irrigation management zones.
    To overcome these computational issues, this study proposes an alternative approach
    employing decentralized hybrid actor–critic agents and the concept of a limiting
    irrigation management zone to enhance the computational efficiency of . This section
    begins with a detailed description of how the hybrid actor–critic agent is employed
    to train an agent for a specific management zone of the field. It concludes with
    a discussion of how the decentralized agents and the concept of a limiting management
    zone are combined to enhance the computational efficiency of the scheduler. 2.4.1.
    Agent design and training This study proposes the training of a RL agent for each
    of the management zones present in the agricultural field. Each agent is trained
    to determine the daily irrigation decision (discrete action) and the daily irrigation
    rate (continuous action) that optimize root water uptake while minimizing irrigation
    costs and total water consumption in a management zone. The hybrid actor–critic
    approach, as originally introduced in Fan et al. (2019), is adopted for the training
    of each agent due to its demonstrated effectiveness in handling both discrete
    and continuous action spaces. This hybrid actor–critic architecture comprises
    two parallel actor networks, where one actor learns the discrete action (daily
    irrigation decision in this work) and the other learns the continuous action (daily
    irrigation rate in this work). The parallel actors share a single critic network,
    which serves as an estimate of the state-value function. The RL framework of the
    agent is modeled as a fully observable Markov Decision Process (MDP), comprising
    several elements such as observations, actions, rewards, and transition/dynamics
    functions. This section begins with a detailed description of the environment
    with which the hybrid actor–critic agent interacts during its training stage.
    Additionally, the design of the observations which serve as inputs to the agent’s
    policy is outlined. Subsequently, the reward design employed in agent training
    is discussed, followed by a discussion of the agent’s training. Environment design.
    In the training process of a hybrid actor–critic agent, the environmental dynamics
    are represented by a 1D Richards equation calibrated with the centroidal hydraulic
    parameters of the relevant management zone. The delineation of management zones
    is based on soil hydraulic parameters estimated from real-time observations in
    the agricultural field. Utilizing a 1D Richards equation calibrated with the centroidal
    hydraulic parameters of each management zone ensures an accurate description of
    the soil moisture dynamics within the considered management zone. The transition
    dynamics for this calibrated 1D Richards equation are detailed in Eqs. (5), (6).
    Observation design. The policy of the hybrid actor–critic agent receives as input
    the output vector , denoting the volumetric moisture contents obtained from Eq.
    (6), alongside the reference evapotranspiration, crop coefficient, and rooting
    depth on day . These inputs, collectively represented as , provide essential information
    to the agent’s policy, aiding in the accurate determination of daily irrigation
    schedules. The output vector, constituting the first element of the observation
    vector, is considered a reliable representation of the volumetric soil distribution
    in the management zone under consideration. This reliability arises from its initialization
    with converged volumetric moisture content estimates obtained from the offline
    simultaneous state and parameter estimation in Stage 2 of the management zone
    delineation process. Additionally, reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficient
    can be readily obtained from weather predictions and empirical relations, respectively.
    The rooting depth can also be determined based on the crop’s growth stage. Thus,
    it is reasonable to assume that the observation provided to the policy of the
    proposed agent is known, justifying the adoption of the fully observable MDP framework
    during the training of the agents. Reward design. The reward function employed
    during the training of the agents is expressed as: (12) (13) In Eqs. (12), (13),
    , , , , , and have the same definitions as in the scheduler formulation of . represents
    the root zone soil moisture on day , which is calculated using the weighted average
    approach outlined in Section 2.2.2. The agent incurs a penalty of when its actions
    result in the root zone soil moisture content falling below the lower threshold
    . Similarly, the agent is penalized with if its actions cause the root zone soil
    moisture content to exceed the upper threshold . When the agent successfully maintains
    the root zone soil moisture within the desired range, it receives a reward of
    0. A penalty of is incurred when the agent decides to perform irrigation (indicated
    by a “yes” decision) and a penalty of is incurred for a non-zero irrigation rate.
    Agent training. The Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm (Schulman, Wolski,
    Dhariwal, Radford, & Klimov, 2017) is applied for policy optimization in the parallel
    actors. During the training stage of the agent, to generate a stochastic policy
    for the irrigation decision, the discrete actor network of the hybrid PPO outputs
    two values for the 2 discrete actions (0,1). Additionally, the discrete action
    is sampled from the softmax distribution. The continuous actor network of the
    hybrid PPO generates the stochastic policy for the daily irrigation rate by outputting
    the mean and variance for the daily irrigation rate action. For a more detailed
    understanding of the PPO algorithm and the hybrid PPO approach, interested readers
    may refer to Fan et al. (2019) and Schulman et al. (2017), respectively. Fig.

    Hybrid actor–critic architecture, and agent–environment interaction. 2.4.2. A
    multi-agent MPC paradigm: Limiting management zone and evaluation of After training
    the hybrid PPO agents, each agent is utilized to determine the irrigation decisions
    and rates for its corresponding management zone. As these agents are intended
    to contribute to the solution of formulation , each agent undergoes evaluation
    across the planning horizon used in . The evaluation of each agent over the horizon
    involves providing the necessary inputs, such as the initial volumetric moisture
    content for a specific day and predicted/forecasted uncontrolled inputs (reference
    evapotranspiration, crop coefficient, and rooting depths) over the prediction
    horizon, to the policy of the trained agent. In response, the trained agent yields
    optimal or near-optimal irrigation decisions and rates for the planning horizon
    by interacting with the calibrated 1D Richards equation of the relevant management
    zone. The interaction between a hybrid agent and its environment is illustrated
    in Fig. 4. In this figure, the predicted uncontrolled inputs over are represented
    as , with the initial volumetric moisture content denoted as . Furthermore, and
    in Fig. 4 correspond to the daily irrigation decision and daily irrigation depth
    prescribed by the agent. This evaluation yields an irrigation decision sequence
    and an irrigation depth sequence, designated as and , respectively. The evaluation
    process is repeated for all agents to generate irrigation decision sequences and
    irrigation depth sequences. The decentralized approach employed during the training
    of the hybrid agents results in a situation where the irrigation decision sequences
    obtained for all the management zones are nonuniform. However, this nonuniformity
    in irrigation decision sequences is inconsistent with the requirements of formulation
    , which demands a uniform irrigation decision sequence across the management zones.
    The concept of a limiting management zone is employed to address the nonuniformity
    arising from the decentralized nature of agent training. The limiting irrigation
    management zone is defined as the th management zone that exhibits the earliest
    non-zero irrigation decision within the planning horizon. The irrigation decision
    sequence of the limiting management zone is chosen as a binding irrigation decision
    sequence for all the management zones. By adopting the irrigation decision sequence
    from the limiting management zone as the binding sequence, the scheduler can ensure
    timely irrigation across all management zones. An illustrative example can help
    clarify the concepts of the limiting irrigation management zone and binding irrigation
    sequence. Consider a field divided into three management zones: , , and . Each
    zone has its own hybrid PPO agent with a designated policy: , , and . On a given
    day, denoted as , the observations within each management zone are represented
    as , , and . It is assumed that the agents are evaluated for a planning horizon
    of seven days. After evaluating the agents, the following irrigation sequences
    ( ) were obtained: , , and . Based on the irrigation sequences obtained, it is
    evident that exhibits the earliest non-zero irrigation decision among all the
    management zones. Consequently, is identified as the limiting irrigation management
    zone. By designating as the limiting management zone, it is established that the
    irrigation decisions made within serve as the reference for irrigation scheduling
    in the other zones. The binding sequence of , , is enforced in and . Once the
    binding irrigation decision sequence is determined, it is enforced in . Given
    that the binary variables over the planning horizon (binding irrigation decision
    sequence) in have already been calculated, the nonlinear programming version of
    can be solved to determine the irrigation rates over the planning horizon in the
    management zones. This approach transforms from a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program
    (MINLP) to a Nonlinear Programming (NLP) problem, significantly enhancing the
    computational efficiency of . The solution of the NLP version of can be avoided
    altogether. Instead, copies of the NLP version of corresponding to the management
    zones can be solved in parallel, after the binding irrigation decision sequence
    has been enforced in each formulation. It is evident from that the irrigation
    decision sequence is responsible for the coupling among the management zones in
    . Additionally, formulation merely replicates formulation in the management zones.
    Thus, after the irrigation decision sequence in has been determined using the
    binding irrigation decision sequence approach, the NLP version of can be solved
    in each of the management zones in parallel. This parallel execution can take
    advantage of the multicore architecture of modern CPUs, leading to substantial
    reductions in computation time and significantly improving the overall computational
    efficiency of the scheduler. Fig. 5 illustrates the comprehensive approach incorporating
    hybrid PPO agents, the limiting management zone, and the copies of . The irrigation
    rates determined by the hybrid PPO agent in the limiting management zone can be
    directly implemented as they align with the binding irrigation decision sequence
    across the planning horizon. However, for the remaining management zones, the
    irrigation rates obtained from the hybrid PPO agents can only serve as a reliable
    initial guess, as they do not precisely match the binding sequence. In these management
    zones, the NLP versions of must necessarily be solved to obtain the optimal irrigation
    rates. Notably, an irrigation rate sequence is considered to align with an irrigation
    decision sequence when a non-zero irrigation rate in the sequence corresponds
    to a decision of an irrigation decision of 1, and a zero irrigation rate in the
    sequence corresponds to an irrigation decision of 0. This consistency must be
    maintained for all days within the planning horizon. Remark 2 The integration
    of decisions from hybrid actor–critic agents into the MPC layer demonstrates a
    cooperation between multi-agent systems and MPC, leading to what can be referred
    to as a multi-agent MPC paradigm. This approach shares some similarities with
    distributed MPC and coalitional MPC methods, where decisions are made locally
    by individual agents/control units based on localized information to achieve a
    global objective. However, there are notable differences between the proposed
    approach and these control methods. Hybrid actor–critic agents, which eventually
    aid in determining irrigation decisions, are trained in a fully decentralized
    manner, without inter-agent communication during their training phase. This training
    also ignores the coupling constraint of the irrigation scheduling problem that
    necessitates uniform daily irrigation decisions across all management zones/agents.
    To manage this constraint, the proposed approach adopts a heuristic method based
    on a limiting management zone to reconcile the daily irrigation decisions when
    the agents are executed. This decentralized training contrasts with distributed
    or coalitional methods that generally involve agent communication to enhance performance.
    Moreover, the heuristic method for addressing coupling constraints deviates from
    consensus algorithms and coordination schemes typically used in distributed training
    techniques to handle coupling constraints. Furthermore, the proposed approach
    relies on the reconciled irrigation decisions to solve multiple MPCs in parallel
    so as to determine the optimal irrigation rates for each management zone. This
    process is characterized as fully decentralized MPC since it does not involve
    communication between the local MPCs of different management zones, differing
    from distributed or coalitional MPC approaches that would involve inter-local
    MPC communication. Importantly, the adoption of a fully decentralized MPC approach
    in determining the irrigation rates for different management zones assumes a weak
    coupling between these zones. While this approach is suitable for large-scale
    fields, such as the field considered in the work, it is inappropriate for smaller,
    spatially variable fields where a stronger coupling exists between management
    zones. In such scenarios, a distributed MPC approach, which involves communication
    between local MPCs to ensure the system’s closed-loop stability, would be more
    suitable. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download : Download full-size

    of the formulation , determining the irrigation depths for the management zones.
    2.5. Comparative evaluation of proposed and triggered irrigation scheduling methods
    Evaluating the benefits of the proposed irrigation scheduling approach over the
    entire crop growing season is essential for understanding its effectiveness. To
    achieve this, the study employs the widely employed triggered irrigation scheduling
    approach as a benchmark. A comparison is made between the proposed scheduler and
    the triggered approach in terms of Irrigation Water Use Efficiency (IWUE), also
    known as water productivity and total irrigation prescribed. Despite the fundamental
    differences, comparing the two approaches in terms of IWUE and total prescribed
    irrigation is considered essential for several reasons. Firstly, the triggered
    approach serves as a widely adopted and practical benchmark, allowing for the
    evaluation of potential improvements offered by the more advanced MPC-based scheduling.
    Furthermore, the comparison offers insights into the water conservation capabilities
    of each approach, providing valuable considerations for the adoption of sustainable
    agriculture practices in response to the challenges of global water scarcity.
    This section first provides a description of the triggered irrigation scheduling
    approach. It then proceeds to explain the calculation of the irrigation water
    use efficiency. 2.5.1. Triggered irrigation scheduling This scheduling approach
    aims to maintain the root zone soil moisture within the lower and upper bounds
    of a target zone. In this approach, an irrigation event is triggered on a specific
    day, denoted as , when the daily root zone moisture content, represented by ,
    falls below the lower bound of the target zone, denoted as . When such a situation
    occurs, the irrigation rate for that day, denoted as , is calculated using the
    following formula (Gu et al., 2021): (14) In Eq. (14), represents the rooting
    depth, while corresponds to the upper bound of the target zone. indicates the
    cumulative precipitation that occurs from day to . The interested reader may refer
    to Gu et al. (2020) and the references therein for a thorough discussion of this
    scheduling approach. 2.5.2. Irrigation water use efficiency In this work, the
    Irrigation Water Use Efficiency (IWUE) in kg/m is calculated as follows (15) where
    is the predicted yield in (kg/m2) and IRR is the total prescribed irrigation depth
    applied in meters ( ). The detailed calculation of can be found in Appendix A.
    2.6. Study area A large-scale agricultural field is employed to assess the benefits
    of the proposed scheduling approach. The field in question is a Research Farm
    operated by Lethbridge College and it spans an area of 26.4 hectares. The field
    is located in Lethbridge, southern Alberta, with geographic coordinates approximately
    at latitude 49.72°N and longitude 112.80°W. A layout of the investigated field
    is shown in Fig. 6(a). The average elevation of the area is 888 m. Regarding the
    soil composition, the predominant texture in the field is clayey loam, with occasional
    presence of sand lenses. To facilitate effective irrigation management, a five-span
    center pivot system has been installed in the field. This mechanized irrigation
    system follows a circular pattern around a central pivot and the pivot has a total
    length of 294 m. Furthermore, the center pivot system incorporates a commercial
    variable rate irrigation system, enabling variable irrigation application rates.
    To monitor soil moisture levels of the field during the rotation cycle of the
    pivot, microwave remote sensors have been installed on the five spans of the pivot.
    The field exhibits varying elevations, ranging from 886 m at the lowest point
    to 890 m at the highest point. An interpolated field elevation map, depicted in
    Fig. 6(b), visually represents this elevation distribution. To prepare for the
    implementation of the proposed management zone delineation approach and the evaluation
    of proposed irrigation scheduler, soil moisture observations were collected using
    microwave remote sensors installed on the center pivot of the field. These observations
    were utilized to estimate both the soil water content and soil hydraulic parameters
    across the entire field. The estimation process covered the period from May 16,
    2022, to August 31, 2022. In this section, two of the estimated parameters are
    presented: the saturated hydraulic conductivity ( ) and the curve fitting parameter
    ( ), to provide a brief overview of the estimation results. The spatial maps of
    these two estimated hydraulic parameters are depicted in Fig. 7. Download : Download

    Management zone delineation of the study area In this section, the proposed three-stage
    management zone delineation process is applied to the study area, and the results
    of the delineation are presented in Fig. 8. During the first stage of delineation,
    the field under study was divided into 4 management zones, labeled as Quadrants
    1, 2, 3, and 4 in Fig. 8. This initial division is based on the fact that 4 different
    crop types are commonly planted in the respective quadrants of the study area.
    Consequently, the initial delineation of the field according to crop types results
    in these 4 management zones. After the initial delineation, the second stage of
    the process involved refining the management zones using the elevation and the
    estimated soil hydraulic parameters attributes within Quadrants 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    As shown in Fig. 8, this resulted in 5 irregularly shaped management zones in
    Quadrant 1, 4 irregularly shaped management zones in Quadrant 2, and 3 irregularly
    shaped management zones in Quadrants 3 and 4. Finally, in the third stage of the
    delineation process, the irregularly shaped management zones obtained in the second
    stage were mapped to the resolution of the field’s center pivot. Specifically,
    the field’s center pivot has a resolution of 12 zones and 45 zones in the radial
    and azimuthal directions, respectively. For simplicity and comprehensive analysis,
    the results for the third quadrant of the field are isolated and discussed in
    detail. Fig. 9(a) depicts the management zone map obtained after the second stage
    of the management zone delineation process. It is evident that the clustering
    approach resulted in three distinct, irregularly shaped management zones. Fig.
    9(b) displays the spatial distribution of the three irrigation management zones,
    which were mapped to align with the resolution of the field’s center pivot. Based
    on the centroidal hydraulic parameters and the centroidal elevation, Management
    Zone 1 (MZ ) was found to have an average soil hydraulic parameter set corresponding
    to loamy soil, with an associated elevation of 889 m. Similarly, Management Zone
    2 (MZ ) exhibited an average soil hydraulic parameter set of loamy soil, but with
    an average elevation of 888 m. In Management Zone 3 (MZ ), the average soil type
    was identified as sandy clay loam, and the average elevation measured 888.5 m.

    Subsequently, the remaining steps of the proposed scheduling approach are specifically
    implemented in Quadrant 3 of the study area, for the sake of simplicity. This
    adopted approach also allows for a thorough examination of the outcomes obtained
    through the proposed scheduling approach. It should be noted that applying the
    same steps to the remaining quadrants can be done straightforwardly, without any
    loss of generality. 2.7. Simulation settings In this section, specific details
    regarding the simulation settings and parameters used during the application of
    the remaining steps of the scheduling approach to Quadrant 3 of the study area
    are provided. The section begins by presenting the settings and parameters employed
    during the development of the 3 LSTM networks for soil moisture content modeling
    in the 3 management zones of Quadrant 3. It then proceeds to describe the settings
    and parameters used during the training of distinct hybrid PPO agents for the
    3 management zones of Quadrant 3. Finally, the settings, parameters, and weather
    data employed during the evaluation of the proposed scheduler on a large-scale
    agricultural field are presented. It is noteworthy that the performance of the
    scheduler is assessed over two growing seasons. Additionally, for each growing
    season, evaluations are conducted for two different Mean Absolute Difference (MAD)
    values: specifically, 40% and 65%. 2.7.1. LSTM network training Prior to generating
    the open-loop data for LSTM network development, the dynamics of soil moisture
    in each of the 3 management zones of Quadrant 3 was modeled using the 1D Richards
    equation. These Richards equations were calibrated with the centroidal hydraulic
    parameters specific to each irrigation management zone. Subsequently, extensive
    open-loop simulations of these calibrated Richards equations were conducted, incorporating
    randomly generated inputs (i.e. reference evapotranspiration, crop coefficient,
    and irrigation rate inputs) and initial states (capillary pressure head and volumetric
    soil moisture content). The simulation settings used during these open-loop simulations
    of the Richards equation are detailed in Table B.6 of Appendix B.1. To ensure
    accurate irrigation scheduling for the crop type present in Quadrant 3, which
    in this case was spring soft wheat, the LSTM training stage incorporated two different
    rooting depths: 0.5 m and 1.00 m. The reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficient
    were randomly generated within the ranges of 0.1 mm/day to 8.99 mm/day and 0.4
    to 1.02, respectively, for all three management zones. The irrigation rate was
    randomly generated between 4.0 mm/day and 52.0 mm/day for MZ , 4.3 mm/day and
    59.6 mm/day for MZ , and 5.0 mm/day and 62.3 mm/day for MZ . It is important to
    note that the selection of input ranges for the open-loop simulations of the calibrated
    1D Richards equation was informed by historical weather data and local irrigation
    management practices. After computing the root zone soil moisture content at each
    time step using the methodology outlined in Section 2.2.2, the LSTM models were
    trained using the Keras Library in Python. The model architecture and hyperparameters
    employed during the training process are provided in Table B.7 of Appendix B.2,
    and it is worth mentioning that these values were determined through experimentation.
    Consequently, it is plausible that more optimal results could be achieved through
    a systematic tuning of the hyperparameter values. 2.7.2. Hybrid PPO agent training
    A summary of the final parameter values for the formulations and used in training
    3 distinct hybrid PPO agents for the three management zones in Quadrant 3 is provided
    in Table D.9 of Appendix D. It is important to note that the per unit costs in
    these formulations were considered as tuning parameters in this study. Tuning
    these costs involved exploring multiple scenarios by adjusting the per unit costs
    in and . Through an iterative process, the performance of the agents was evaluated
    under different cost configurations, leading to the determination of the most
    suitable values for achieving the desired irrigation management objectives. The
    values of the volumetric moisture content at field capacity and wilting point
    for the various soil types present in the 3 management zones in Quadrant 3 were
    obtained from Ref. Huffman, Fangmeier, Elliot, and Workman (2012). To represent
    the policies of the actor networks for the discrete (daily irrigation decision)
    and continuous (daily irrigation rate) actions in each hybrid PPO agent, a fully
    connected multilayer perceptron with two hidden layers and a hyperbolic tangent
    (tanh) activation function was employed. The hyperparameters utilized during the
    training of the agents, as well as other settings specific to the PPO algorithm,
    are summarized in Table C.8 of Appendix C. Additionally since the evaluation of
    the scheduler under a particular growing season is done for MAD values of 40%
    and 65%, 3 distinct hybrid PPO agents are trained for an MAD of 40%, and another
    set of 3 hybrid PPO agents are trained for an MAD of 65%. The training of the
    hybrid PPO agents was conducted using the Tensorforce library (Schaarschmidt et
    al., 2018) in Python. 2.7.3. Evaluation setup and parameters for proposed scheduler
    As has already been mentioned, the proposed scheduler is evaluated over two growing
    seasons: the 2015 and 2022 seasons, for MAD values of 40% and 65%. Fig. E.16 of
    Appendix E.1 presents the relevant weather data utilized in this study, specifically
    from the selected growing seasons. It is important to note that a MAD value of
    40% is commonly used for irrigation management on the Research farm, and in irrigation
    management, this value can be considered to be conservative. Therefore, the scheduler
    was further assessed using a less conservative MAD value of 65% to evaluate its
    ability to ensure optimal plant growth when allowing for more water depletion
    in the root zone. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that the 2015 season had
    lower total rainfall of 141.7 mm compared to the 2022 season which recorded a
    total value of 230.9 mm. These seasons were chosen to assess the performance of
    the scheduler in relatively dry and wet conditions. Soft spring wheat was cultivated
    in the investigated quadrant during the 2022 season, and this crop was also considered
    for the 2015 growing season. To determine the initial volumetric moisture content
    (and for that matter the initial capillary pressure head) for each management
    zone, the converged volumetric soil moisture estimates obtained from the estimation
    procedure outlined in Section 2.1 were first mapped to the management zone map
    of Quadrant 3. For each management zone, the volumetric soil moisture estimates
    corresponding to the driest plot were selected as the basis for initializing the
    scheduler. It is important to note, however, that the accuracy of these volumetric
    moisture estimates are expected to decline over time, and soil moisture content
    observations from the management zones in the field under study should be used
    to correct these estimates using various data assimilation techniques. The incorporation
    of data assimilation techniques in model-based irrigation schedulers is outside
    the scope of this work, and the interested reader may explore references such
    as Agyeman et al. (2021) and Bo and Liu (2020) that delve into soil moisture estimation
    in agro-hydrological systems. The scheduler is implemented in a receding horizon
    manner, where the calibrated 1D Richards equations of the three management zones
    serve as the representation of the real field. In the evaluation phase, a prediction
    horizon of 14 days is utilized. It is noteworthy that a control horizon of 14
    days was also employed during the evaluation stage. Simulation experiments revealed
    that a 14-day prediction horizon effectively captures the essential dynamics of
    the agro-hydrological system examined in this study. This period also enables
    the scheduler to utilize the most accurate weather forecasts available. Additionally,
    the selected timeframe was found to be sufficiently long to ensure that the receding
    horizon implementation of the scheduler is stabilizing. Moreover, a 14-day prediction
    horizon was found to ensure computational efficiency of the scheduling process
    by facilitating a timely optimization process. While the true weather information,
    such as rainfall, reference evapotranspiration, and average temperature, is known
    during the simulations, uncertainty is incorporated into the weather forecasts
    used over the prediction horizon. This was done to assess the robustness of the
    scheduler to uncertainties in weather forecasts. The uncertainty in the weather
    forecast is modeled as a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a specified
    standard deviation. As the prediction horizon extends further into the future,
    the standard deviation values are gradually increased to reflect the increasing
    uncertainty associated with longer-term weather predictions. Table D.9 of Appendix
    D provides the relevant parameters of formulation used in evaluating the scheduler.
    The evaluation period for each growing season spanned from 5th May to 4th September,
    encompassing a total of 123 evaluations. In each evaluation, the three hybrid
    PPO agents were initially assessed using relevant observations from all three
    management zones to obtain irrigation decision sequences for the prediction horizon.
    Subsequently, the binding irrigation sequence was determined, and three copies
    of formulation (y) were simultaneously evaluated to optimize the irrigation rates
    for each management zone using the interior point optimization solver (Wächter
    & Biegler, 2006). In accordance with the receding horizon implementation of the
    scheduler, the first element of the optimal irrigation rates for all the three
    management zones were then applied to the calibrated 1D Richards equations. The
    soil water content resulting from the implemented irrigation rate in each management
    zone was then used to initialize the subsequent evaluation of the scheduler. Throughout
    the evaluation process, a rooting depth of 0.5 m was considered from 5th May to
    15th July. From the 16th of July to the end of the growing season, a rooting depth
    of 1.0 m was used to determine the irrigation schedules. It is worth noting that
    this practice is consistent with irrigation management of the soft spring wheat
    crop. Both the triggered approach and the proposed approach were utilized to generate
    irrigation schedules for the selected growing seasons and specific MAD values.
    For the evaluation of the predicted yield under both scheduling schemes, the parameters
    and in Eq. (A.1) were set to 0.88 kg m−2 and 1.15, respectively. These values
    were obtained from Ref. Bennett and Harms (2011) and represent calibrated values
    specific to the study area. 3. Results and discussion In this section, the results
    obtained after the application of the proposed irrigation scheduler to Quadrant
    3 of the field are presented and discussed in detail. This section begins with
    a presentation and discussion of the results obtained from the validation experiment
    conducted on the identified LSTM networks for soil moisture dynamics modeling
    in Quadrant 3. Next, the results of the hybrid PPO agents are presented, after
    which a discussion of these results is presented. Finally, the irrigation schedules,
    and the corresponding root zone soil moisture content obtained under the proposed
    and triggered irrigation scheduling schemes, over the two growing seasons, are
    presented and discussed in detail. 3.1. Validation of the trained LSTM networks
    The results of the validation experiment, which was conducted over a 30 day period,
    is depicted in Fig. 10. From this figure, the soil moisture predictions can be
    deemed accurate, since there is a good agreement between the root zone soil moisture
    predictions and the actual root zone soil moisture content derived from the calibrated
    1D Richards equation. This accuracy is reinforced by the low RMSE values shown
    in Table 1, which serve to support the good predictive capacity of the identified
    LSTM models for root zone soil moisture content across all three management zones
    at depths of 0.50 m and 1.00 m. The results obtained from the validation experiment
    further highlight the accuracy of the identified LSTM networks in performing multi-step-ahead
    predictions. In this experiment, the LSTM models, originally trained to predict
    a single day ahead, were employed in a recursive manner across the 30-day period.
    This recursive strategy involved using the output at a specific time step as an
    input in the subsequent time step. This recursive use of the identified LSTM networks
    holds significance within model predictive control frameworks, such as the mixed-integer
    MPC with zone control formulation that is adopted for irrigation scheduling in
    this work. The obtained results in this section provide evidence that the proposed
    LSTM network root zone soil moisture modeling in the delineated management zones
    is both robust and accurate. These findings align with several other studies that
    have also utilized LSTM models to describe soil moisture dynamics in agro-hydrological
    systems (Adeyemi et al., 2018, Agyeman, Sahoo et al., 2023). Furthermore, these
    findings imply that a neural networks’ capacity for universal approximation can
    be harnessed to directly characterize root zone soil moisture content. This approach
    is anticipated to enhance the computational efficiency when employed in schedulers
    that require the solution of a numerical optimization problem. This new approach
    stands in contrast to earlier works (Gu et al., 2021), where distinct neural network
    models were trained to predict the soil moisture content at different depths within
    the soil profile, after which a weighted approach was employed to obtain the root
    zone soil moisture content from the soil moisture predictions. The results of
    the validation experiment further confirms the hypothesis that by including the
    rooting depth as one of the inputs to the LSTM network, the time varying nature
    of the rooting depth and its effect on the root zone soil moisture can be effective
    modeled. Table 1. Predictive performance of the trained LSTM models over a period

    of the hybrid PPO agents To provide a concise summary, the trajectories of the
    rewards obtained during the training stage for the MAD of 40% are presented. Fig.
    11 demonstrates the average episodic rewards obtained after running each agent
    10 times, showing an upward trend that indicates an improvement in agent performance
    over successive training iterations. Additionally, the hybrid PPO agents exhibit
    convergence to stable and optimal policies, as evidenced by the rewards reaching
    a plateau during the training stage. Overall, the trained hybrid PPO agents can
    effectively provide optimal irrigation decisions tailored to their respective
    management zones. This finding aligns with earlier studies (Fan et al., 2019,
    Xu and Lin, 2023) that have demonstrated the ability of the hybrid actor–critic
    approach in achieving stable learning when employed in mixed-integer optimal control
    problems. The proposed hybrid actor–critic paradigm adds to the range of approximation
    methods aimed at simplifying mixed-integer optimal control problems. Notable alternatives
    include the sigmoid approximation (de Oliveira, Da Silva, Pereira, & Carneiro,
    2005) and the time-step grouping (Richards & How, 2005) approach. The proposed
    approach offers advantages over the sigmoid approach used in the mixed-integer
    MPC for irrigation scheduling proposed in Agyeman, Sahoo et al. (2023) and Agyeman,
    Nouri et al. (2023). Specifically, the RL approach, by directly learning an optimal/near-optimal
    policy for the binary variable, eliminates the approximation errors associated
    with the sigmoid function. Additionally, the RL approach addresses interpretability
    issues encountered in the sigmoid approach. Moreover, compared to the complexity
    introduced by time step grouping method, the hybrid actor–critic paradigm, simplifies
    the process by directly learning optimal policies for binary variables at each
    time step, eliminating the need for manual decisions on strategies to group binary
    variables across timesteps. Despite these benefits, it is essential to note that
    the RL training process is time-consuming due to its complexity. Future research
    should explore methods to expedite agent training and determine the optimal number
    of training episodes for efficient agent learning. Download : Download high-res

    and utility of the proposed scheduler Figs. 14 and 15 depict the prescribed schedules
    and the dynamics of the root zone soil moisture during the 2022 growing season
    for MAD values of 40% and 65%, respectively. Similarly, Fig. 12, Fig. 13 show
    the prescribed schedules and the corresponding root zone soil moisture dynamics
    for the 2015 growing season with MAD values of 40% and 65%, respectively. Table
    2, Table 3 present a summary of the total prescribed water and other relevant
    costs computed for the 2022 growing season, considering MAD values of 40% and
    65% respectively. Similarly, Table 4, Table 5 provide the summary for the 2015
    growing season with MAD values of 40% and 65% respectively. As mentioned previously,
    the 2015 growing season experienced lower total rainfall compared to the 2022
    season. Consequently, both scheduling approaches resulted in higher total irrigation
    rates for the 2015 season compared to the 2022 season. Additionally, the results
    demonstrated that for an MAD of 40%, both scheduling approaches exhibited higher
    total irrigation rates compared to a less conservative MAD of 65%. Similarly,
    both approaches made more frequent irrigation decisions for an MAD of 40% compared
    to an MAD of 65%. This observation aligns with the definition of MAD, as a lower
    MAD implies a smaller allowable depletion of root zone soil moisture, necessitating
    more frequent irrigations and higher total irrigation application depths. Across
    all considered scenarios, the proposed approach consistently achieved lower total
    irrigation rates compared to the triggered approach. Specifically, for MAD 40%,
    the proposed approach saved approximately 6% and 7% of irrigation water in the
    2015 and 2022 growing seasons, respectively. Similarly, for MAD 65%, the savings
    were about 14% and 23% for the same seasons. The obtained IWUE values indicated
    higher predicted crop yields under the proposed scheduling, evident from the higher
    IWUE values compared to the triggered approach. For MAD 40%, the proposed approach
    led to a 12% and 10% increase in IWUE in the 2022 and 2015 growing seasons, respectively.
    Likewise, for MAD 65%, there was a 35% and 20% increase in IWUE in the 2022 and
    2015 growing seasons, respectively. The proposed approach exhibited more substantial
    water savings, particularly under the less conservative MAD value of 65%. Similarly,
    the enhancement in IWUE was more evident with the less conservative MAD value
    of 65%. The use of a conservative MAD value of 40% in irrigation scheduling aims
    to enhance the scheduler’s robustness against potential disturbances that could
    lead to crop stress. By setting the threshold further from the wilting point (critical
    point) with such conservative values, the likelihood of reaching critical soil
    moisture levels is reduced in the presence of disturbances. However, the simulation
    results suggest that less conservative MAD values can be employed under the proposed
    scheme, leading to reduced total irrigation rates while minimizing the risk of
    critical soil moisture levels. This indicates that the proposed approach offers
    flexibility in MAD selection, enabling a more efficient use of water resources
    while ensuring optimal crop development. In comparing the computational time between
    the proposed scheduler and the triggered approach, it became evident that the
    design and evaluation of the proposed approach required more time and computational
    effort. The estimation of soil hydraulic parameters for management zone delineation,
    along with the training of the decentralized hybrid actor–critic agents and LSTM
    models, constitutes the most computationally intensive and time-consuming aspects
    of the proposed scheduler. Notably, the use of a high-dimensional field model
    in the estimation increases the computational effort needed for Jacobian calculations
    in the EKF step. Additionally, the iterative processes and hyperparameter adjustments
    associated with agent and LSTM model training contribute to extended training
    times. However, it is crucial to clarify that these computationally demanding
    steps are performed offline, thereby reducing the computational load during real-time
    operation. During online execution, involving the evaluation of hybrid agents,
    determining the limiting irrigation sequence, and solving the optimization problem
    for irrigation rates in all management zones of the field, the proposed approach
    demonstrated efficient performance. Parallel computing significantly influenced
    this efficiency during the optimization problem solution. While the current solution
    time is considered adequate for a scheduler sampling time of 1 day, applying the
    proposed approach to shorter sampling times may pose computational challenges,
    especially for fields with numerous management zones. Further studies are necessary
    to improve the computational efficiency of the proposed scheduler to ensure timely
    completion of the optimization problem within the sampling time. Exploring suboptimal
    solutions could be a potential avenue, though this may impact the water-saving
    benefits of the proposed approach. Table 2. Comparison between the triggered and

    hydraulic parameters, derived from the offline estimation in Stage 2 of the management
    zone delineation, as a basis for identifying the LSTM models, plays an important
    role in reducing parametric uncertainty and effectively addressing plant-model
    mismatch within the proposed scheduler. While this offline strategy serves as
    a good starting point for real-time implementation of the scheduler, it has limitations
    in adapting to real-time variations in field parameters. A more attractive approach
    to handle parameter variations involves performing online parameter estimation,
    utilizing real-time field observations for fine-tuning soil hydraulic parameters.
    However, it is essential to note that this online estimation approach may introduce
    additional computational demands to the online implementation of the scheduler.
    A valid alternative worth considering is the adoption of an offset-free MPC approach
    by incorporating a disturbance model. In this approach, managing plant-model mismatch
    is achieved by estimating disturbances through measurements, utilizing an augmented
    system that integrates the nominal model and the disturbance model. In the design
    of an offset-free MPC, the work presented in Cao, Son, Moon, and Kwon (2021) could
    serve as a helpful reference. 4. Conclusion In conclusion, this study successfully
    demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating the three machine learning paradigms
    (unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement learning) with model predictive control
    and multi-agent principles to design a precise irrigation scheduler for large-scale
    fields. By employing a three-stage process with the k-means clustering approach,
    irrigation management zones were accurately delineated to match the resolution
    of the irrigation equipment. This process included elevation and estimated soil
    hydraulic parameters as attributes, resulting in optimized management zones suitable
    for agro-hydrological modeling. Leveraging the universal approximation capability
    of neural networks, specifically long short-term memory models, this study directly
    modeled the dynamic behavior of root zone soil moisture content in each irrigation
    management zone, while accounting for the time varying nature of the rooting depth.
    Based on the developed data-driven models, a mixed-integer MPC framework with
    zone objectives was designed to determine the daily irrigation decisions and rates,
    aiming to enhance soil water uptake while minimizing overall water consumption
    and associated irrigation costs. Furthermore, a multi-agent MPC paradigm was adopted
    where decentralized hybrid actor–critic agents and the concept of a limiting management
    zone were employed to enhance the computational efficiency of the scheduler. The
    application of the proposed approach to a large-scale field demonstrated its capability
    to achieve substantial water savings and improved irrigation water use efficiency.
    The proposed approach also allowed for the utilization of less conservative MAD
    values, resulting in improved water savings and optimal crop growth. While the
    proposed approach shows promise, there are several modifications that can be made
    to further enhance its effectiveness. One priority is improving the optimality
    of the binding irrigation decision sequence by employing distributed techniques
    when training the hybrid actor–critic agents. Utilizing a hierarchy of agents
    that communicate with each other can result in an irrigation decision sequence
    that is optimal for all the management zones of the field. Additionally, this
    study acknowledges the potential advantages of integrating advanced time-series
    transformer models, as indicated in recent literature (Sitapure & Kwon, 2023).
    These transformer models are recognized for their proficiency in capturing complex
    contextual relationships, including faults, abnormalities, and parametric dependencies.
    While the current study employs LSTM models, considering the replacement of the
    LSTM approach with advanced time-series transformer models is considered a promising
    avenue for enhancing predictive capabilities in irrigation scheduling. Furthermore,
    to enhance the overall robustness of the scheduler, it is advisable to implement
    it alongside a lower-level controller. This controller’s task would be to track
    the prescriptions made by the proposed scheduler on an hourly basis. By integrating
    these components, the scheduler can adapt and respond in real-time to deviations
    or unforeseen circumstances, ensuring effective irrigation management. Implementing
    these modifications will contribute to the continued improvement and practical
    application of the scheduler, making it more effective and reliable in optimizing
    irrigation decisions while maintaining system robustness. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: In agriculture irrigation management, irrigation scheduling is typically
    performed in an open-loop fashion and is done only once at the beginning of a
    growing season. In this work, we study whether closed-loop scheduling with closed-loop
    control can lead to improved performance in terms of crop yield and water conservation
    in agriculture irrigation. The interaction between soil, water, crop (maize in
    this work), and atmosphere is described by an agro-hydrological model, which is
    a partial differential equation. In the proposed scheduling and control scheme,
    both the scheduler and the controller are designed using model predictive control
    (MPC). The scheduler uses a long horizon (with a sampling period of 1 day) that
    covers the entire crop growth season, and the horizon shrinks as time moves. The
    primary objective of the scheduler is to maximize the crop yield. The controller
    uses a much shorter prediction horizon and a much finer sampling period. The primary
    objective of the controller is to track the soil moisture reference calculated
    by the scheduler. To alleviate the computational complexity of the scheduler and
    the controller, a linear parameter varying (LPV) model is identified for the scheduler
    and controller, respectively. The performance of the closed-loop scheduling scheme
    is evaluated against the traditional open-loop scheduling scheme under different
    scenarios.

    ISSUE This article is part of the Sirish Shah Festschrift special issue. 1. Introduction
    ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Water scarcity is an increasingly pressing issue globally.
    It is critical to increase the efficiency of water usage especially in agriculture
    since it consumes the largest portion of fresh water (70% approximately). (1,2)
    Traditionally, agriculture irrigation decisions are primarily made in open-loop
    on the basis of empirical or heuristic knowledge, and no real-time feedback information
    (e.g., soil moisture) from the field is used. These open-loop irrigation methods
    are not precise and typically lead to significant over irrigation. In the past
    decade, there has been an increasing interest in lower-level closed-loop agriculture
    irrigation for precision irrigation. Different control algorithms based on real-time
    field feedback like soil moisture measurement have been reported in the literature.
    For example, Goodchild et al. proposed a modified proportional-integral-derivative
    (PID) control to improve the irrigation precision. (3) Kim et al. developed a
    closed-loop irrigation control system for a self-propelled lateral-move sprinkler
    irrigation system. (4) Model predictive control (MPC) has also been investigated
    in the optimal control of agriculture irrigation. Park et al. used MPC to maintain
    the field at desired soil moisture and salt levels. (5) McCarthy et al. used crop
    production models in MPC to optimize irrigation time and amount. (6) Delgoda et
    al. implemented MPC to minimize root zone soil moisture deficit and irrigation
    amount with a limit on water supply. (7) Recently, Mao et al. developed a zone
    MPC algorithm to maintain soil moisture within a target zone instead of a set-point.
    This approach was shown to lead to further water conservation. (8) The above-mentioned
    irrigation control studies all focus on short time (hourly or daily) irrigation
    management. A typical objective of these studies is to maintain the soil moisture
    or root zone soil moisture deficit at a predetermined set-point or zone. Irrigation
    scheduling is another important subject in agriculture irrigation management,
    which considers water management over a much longer time period (e.g., the entire
    growing season of a crop). In general, a water balance accounting for plant water
    consumption, evaporation and drainage loss, historical weather data, and available
    soil moisture is used in irrigation scheduling. (9−11) Different objectives were
    considered in irrigation scheduling including, for example, profit maximization,
    (12) crop yield maximization, (13) and irrigation uniformity optimization. (14)
    One common feature of the above scheduling studies is that the scheduling optimization
    problem is only solved once at the beginning of the crop growing season, and the
    solution is used for the entire season. In this work, we introduce feedback into
    irrigation scheduling and integrate it with irrigation control to form a hierarchical
    closed-loop scheduling and control scheme. It is well recognized in chemical process
    industries that the closed-loop scheduling and control can bring improved economic
    performance. (15−19) The primary objective of this work is to study the closed-loop
    scheduling and control in agriculture irrigation management and investigate whether
    closed-loop scheduling brings any benefits to irrigation management. In the proposed
    closed-loop scheduling and control scheme, a scheduler operates in the top layer
    with the objective to maximize the crop yield. The scheduler calculates the target
    soil moisture value and passes it to a lower layer irrigation controller. The
    lower layer controller’s primary objective is to follow the target soil moisture.
    Both the scheduler and the controller are designed in the framework of MPC. The
    scheduler uses a prediction horizon that covers the entire growing season of the
    crop (maize in this work). The scheduler is re-evaluated every week on the basis
    of updated weather forecast and soil moisture measurement from the field with
    a shrinking horizon. The controller uses a prediction horizon of 1 week and calculates
    irrigation commands to follow the target soil moisture determined by the scheduler.
    The soil water dynamics of the field are described by an agro-hydrological model
    that consists of a partial differential equation. To alleviate the computational
    complexity of the scheduler and the controller, a linear parameter varying (LPV)
    model is identified for the scheduler and the controller, respectively, based
    on input and output data from the agro-hydrological model. The main contributions
    of this work include: A method to identify an LPV model for the scheduler to describe
    the interaction between soil water and the crop over the entire growing season
    that contains different growing stages. The LPV model is computationally efficient
    for online optimization. A detailed closed-loop scheduler and controller design
    to maximize crop yield and water conservation. Extensive simulations that investigate
    the performance of the closed-loop scheduler with respect to the traditional open-loop
    scheduling. 2. System Description ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To The system considered
    consists of the soil−water–atmosphere–crop environment. The interaction between
    the soil, the water, the atmosphere, and the crop is described by an agro-hydrological
    model. The yield of the crop is characterized using the ratio of the actual evapo-transpiration
    to the potential evapo-transpiration. The crop considered is maize. A schematic
    of the considered system is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Figure 1. System considered
    consists of the soil−water–atmosphere–crop environment over the entire growing
    season of the crop maize. 2.1. Agro-hydrological Model We consider an agro-hydrological
    system that characterizes the interaction between the soil, the water, the atmosphere,
    and the crop. The system is modeled by a set of empirical and physical relations.
    The dynamics of the water flow inside soil is described using the Richards equation:
    (20) (1) where θ is the soil moisture content (cm/cm), K is the hydraulic conductivity
    (cm/h), z is the vertical distance inside soil matrix (cm) taken positive upward,
    S includes the source and sink terms (h–1), such as soil water extraction rate
    by plant roots, and h is the matric potential (cm) also known as soil suction.
    The hydraulic conductivity K can be expressed in terms of soil moisture content
    as follows: (21) (2) where Ksat is saturated hydraulic conductivity, λ = 0.5 is
    the shape parameter, (22) and Se is the relative saturation given by (3) where
    θres is the residual moisture content (cm/cm), θsat is the saturated moisture
    content (cm/cm). The relation between soil moisture content θ and matric potential
    h is described by the Van Genuchten model: (23) (4) where η and m are empirical
    shape factors, and αv is the inverse of air entry suction (cm–1). In general,
    m is considered as a dependent variable of η such as . Thus, the Richards equation
    can be described as follows: (5) where C is the hydraulic capacity, which accounts
    for the change of soil moisture due to the change of soil matric potential; that
    is, C = dθ/dh. In the Richards equation, eq 5, S(h) represents the soil water
    extraction rate by the crop roots, which accounts for the transpiration rate T.
    The top water flux qtop at the soil-atmosphere interface is considered in the
    top boundary calculation of the Richards equation. The top water flux qtop can
    be expressed as follows: (6) where qtop is the top flux, I is the irrigation rate,
    P is the precipitation rate, and E denotes evaporation. The transpiration T and
    evaporation E are calculated following the method in SWAP model. (24) The top
    boundary of this agro-hydrological system is time varying depending on the surface
    soil moisture condition, and may switch between the flux and the pressure head
    boundary conditions. Both of these boundary conditions are determined using the
    qtop value as described in the work of Van Dam and Feddes. (25) In this study
    the bottom boundary condition is taken as free drainage. Following the method
    used in the work of Van Dam et al. (24) and Nahar et al., (26)eq 5 can be discretized
    using the implicit finite difference method with explicit linearization of the
    hydraulic conductivity K(h). Let us consider that the spatial domain is discretized
    into ND compartments with the top one as compartment 1 and the bottom one as compartment
    ND. After discretization, at compartment i (i = 2, ..., ND – 1), the water content
    dynamics are described as follows: (7) where hi is the matric potential of the
    i-th compartment, n denotes the discretized time with a sampling period of a hour,
    , , , , ui(k) = Si(k)Δzi, and Δzi denotes the thickness of compartment i. In eq
    7, Ki+1/2 denotes the average hydraulic conductivity between compartment i and
    i + 1. The boundary conditions of the system define i = 1 and i = ND. Defining
    h = [h1h2 ... hND]T, combining the equations for the ND compartments together,
    and splitting the inputs to the system into manipulated inputs and uncontrolled
    inputs, the overall dynamics can be written in the following compact form: (8)
    where u is the manipulated input (irrigation) and w denotes disturbances and uncontrolled
    inputs such as rain and weather conditions. Note that h is a column vector whose
    size depends on the number of discretization points ND in the spatial domain.
    On the basis of eq 4, the soil moisture is a function of the matric potential
    h. For the soil moisture at each compartment i, we can use eq 4 to find the corresponding
    matric potential hi. For brevity, we write these equations in the following compact
    form: (9) where the function g represents the relation between θ and h as expressed
    in eq 4. Note that when i = 1, it indicates the top surface. Eqs 8 and 9 define
    the system equations for the dynamics of water flow inside soil. For more details
    of the derivation of eqs 8 and 9, the reader may refer to Nahar et al. (26) 2.2.
    Crop Yield Model The crop yield is modeled as a function of the potential evapo-transpiration
    and the actual evapo-transpiration as follows: (12) (10) where Ya is the actual
    yield, Yp is the potential maximum yield, ETa is the actual evapo-transpiration
    and ETp is the potential evapo-transpiration, and is the crop sensitivity factor
    (also known as yield response factor) for the growing period at time k. Crop sensitivity
    factor is a measure used to indicate the impact of water stress (at different
    growing stages) on the overall yield of the crop. When the actual yield is equal
    to the potential yield, eq 10 takes its minimum value zero. In eq 10, represents
    the yield reduction or the yield deficiency and represents the relative reduction
    in evapo-transpiration or ET deficiency. The potential and the actual evapo-transpiration
    values of a crop are defined as follows: (27) (11) (12) where is an empirical
    crop factor that describes the relation of ETp to the potential evapo-transpiration
    of the reference crop (grass) ET0, and is the water stress factor, which is a
    function of the soil moisture and relates ETa to ETp. In eq 11, the reference
    evapo-transpiration ET0 is calculated using Penman–Montieth equation based on
    hourly weather data. (27) In eq 12, the water stress factor is modeled following
    the method in Feddes’s work (28) and will be made clear in Section 3.3.1. It is
    noted that eq 12 holds when other factors such as nutrient deficiency or diseases
    are not present. Combining eqs 10 and 12, the following relation can be obtained
    to describe the relation between the crop yield and soil moisture: (13) In this
    work, following the work of Van Dam et al., (24) a simple maize model is used
    to calculate the evapo-transpiration amounts at different growing stages. Note
    that the crop water requirement increases as the crop grows. This implies that
    more water is required to keep the soil moisture at the same level as crop grows.
    3. Problem Formulation and Proposed Design ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To 3.1. Closed-Loop
    Scheduling and Control Problem Formulation In this section, we describe the proposed
    closed-loop scheduling and control framework for precision irrigation. The scheduler
    and the controller form a hierarchical decision making system. In this work, both
    the scheduler and the controller will be designed in the framework of MPC. The
    primary objective of the scheduler is to maximize the crop yield at the end of
    the entire growing season. It considers a much longer horizon that covers the
    entire growing season and uses historical weather data, available weekly weather
    forecast, and soil moisture measurement from the field to calculate the soil moisture
    reference trajectories for the lower layer controller. The primary objective of
    the controller is to track the soil moisture reference calculated by the scheduler.
    It uses a fixed prediction horizon of a week and takes into account the soil moisture
    measurement and daily weather forecast in its irrigation command calculation.
    A schematic of the closed-loop scheduling and control framework is shown in Figure
    2. Figure 2 Figure 2. Structure of the closed-loop scheduling and control system.
    Left: Process block diagram; Right: The design of prediction horizon. 3.2. Scheduling
    and Control Model Identification The direct use of the agro-hydrological model,
    eqs 8 and 9, in the scheduler and the controller is computationally challenging
    due to the stiffness of the nonlinear system when the soil moisture is low, the
    high dimensions of the discretized system, and the large horizon covered by the
    scheduler. In order to overcome the computational challenge and to capture the
    dynamics between the input and the output of the agro-hydrological system, we
    propose to identify an LPV model for the scheduler and the controller, respectively.
    The two LPV models can be identified based on the simulated input–output data
    from the agro-hydrological model. LPV models have been widely used to describe
    nonlinear processes due to its simple structure and its ability to approximate
    complex nonlinear systems. (29−32) 3.2.1. Scheduling Model The output of the scheduling
    model is the average root zone soil moisture content described as follows: (14)
    where θs is the average root zone soil moisture, θi is determined by eq 9, and
    Nr < ND is the deepest node that contains the crop roots. Note that Nr changes
    over time as the length of roots grows. The LPV model consists of a set of linear
    models that are connected with varying parameters which are functions of scheduling
    variables. (33) The scheduling variables are the ones that can be used to reflect
    the nonlinearity of the dynamics of the system. For the scheduling model, two
    scheduling variables are used. They are the soil moisture s1 (s1 = θ) and the
    root depth s2. The sampling period used in the scheduling model is 1 day. For
    each scheduling variable, a few working points need to be determined and around
    those working points, linear models are identified. Let us assume that we have
    H working points for s1 and G working points for s2. These working points define
    a mesh with HG nodes. For each of these nodes, a linear model should be identified.
    Let us also use (i, j) (i = 1, 2, ..., H, j = 1, 2, ..., G) to denote the node
    defined by the i-th s1 working point and the j-th s2 working point. For each node
    (i, j), a linear model of the following form is identified: (15) where m denotes
    the discrete time with a sampling period of a day, xi,j is the output of the linear
    model for (i, j), api,j (p = 1, 2, ..., na), bqi,j (q = 1, 2, ..., nb), and di,j
    are model parameters, u is the manipulated input. The model orders na and nb are
    determined prior to the identification process. This model can also be expressed
    as follows: (16) where φi,j(m) = [−xi,j(m – 1), ..., −xi,j(m – na), u(m – 1), ...,
    u(m – nb), 1]T, and βi,j = [a1i,j, ..., anai,j, b1i,j, ..., bnbi,j, di,j]T. With
    respect to s1 (soil moisture), the linear models are combined together using Gaussian
    weighting functions as follows: (17) where y∗j is an intermediate variable, and
    the weighting function αi is given by (18) where with s1,i the soil moisture value
    of the i-th prespecified s1 working point, σi1 and σi2 being two parameters that
    need to be identified, which is related to the validity width of the linear model.
    (8) With respect to s2 (root length), the outputs obtained from eq 17 are further
    linearly interpolated to get the final output of the LPV model: (19) given that
    the root length at time m lies between s2,j and s2,j+1 (i.e., s2,j ≤ s2(m) ≤ s2,j+1).
    Note that the length of the roots grows according to the time after seeding and
    is considered as a function of time in this work. In eq 19, y is the average water
    content within the root zone given by the LPV model. Eq 19 is the model that will
    be used in the scheduler and may be written equivalently in the following state-space
    form: (20) (21) where A, B are composed of elements in βi,j (i = 1, 2, ..., H,
    j = 1, 2, ..., G), C depends on the two scheduling variables, d is composed of
    di,j, and us is composed of the current and previous daily irrigation amounts.
    The detailed identification of the above LPV model will be discussed in Section
    4. 3.2.2. Control Model Since the controller uses a relatively much smaller prediction
    horizon (a week), we consider an LPV model with only the soil moisture (s1) as
    the scheduling variable. In this model, we consider the root length of the crop
    is constant within each control prediction horizon. The output of the control
    model is also the average soil water content within the root zone as defined in
    eq 14. The sampling period of the LPV model for control purposes is also a day.
    The LPV takes the following form: (22a) (22b) where x̃i is the output of a submodel
    and ỹ is the final output of the LPV model, api (p = 1, 2, ..., na), bqi (q =
    1, 2, ..., nb), and di are model parameters, αi is a weighting factor determined
    following eq 18. At different crop growing stages, the above control model should
    be reidentified to account for the growth of the crop. The above model can also
    be written equivalently in the following state-space form: (23) (24) where Ã,
    B̃ are composed of api and bqi (i = 1, 2, ..., H), C̃ depends on the scheduling
    variable, d̃ is composed of di, and uc is composed of the current and previous
    daily irrigation amounts. The details will be discussed also in Section 4. 3.3.
    Design of Scheduler and Controller 3.3.1. Design of the Scheduler As explained
    earlier, the main objective of the scheduler is to minimize the crop yield deficiency
    while reducing the irrigation water usage. From eq 13, it can be seen that crop
    yield relates to the water stress factor . The stress factor characterizes the
    suppression of root water update due to either drought or insufficient aeration.
    Figure 3 shows a typical relation of and soil moisture. (28) When the soil moisture
    θ is between θL (limiting point) and θa (anaerobic point), there is no water stress
    (). When the soil moisture θ is below θL but larger than θw (wilting point), water
    stress takes place due to drought. When the soil moisture θ is above θa but less
    than θu, there is crop water stress due to insufficient aeration; when θ is above
    θu, crop transpiration stops. For all other soil moisture region, root water extraction
    is completely suppressed. Therefore, it is also important to ensure that the soil
    moisture is always between θw and θu. Specifically, the value of the water stress
    factor is determined as follows: (28) (25) Figure 3 Figure 3. Relation of soil
    moisture content and water stress factor. (28) The scheduler optimization problem
    is evaluated every week. It uses a prediction horizon from the current week to
    the end of the growing season T. Within each week, the irrigation is considered
    to be constant. For week k, the optimization problem is shown below: (26a) (26b)
    (26c) (26d) (26e) (26f) (26g) (26h) In the optimization problem (eq 26), eq 26a
    defines the cost function to be minimized. In eq 26a, the first term indicates
    the crop yield deficiency at the end of the growing season, the second term measures
    the irrigation amount in the remaining growing season, the last summation term
    includes two slack variables that are used to handle constraints on the soil moisture
    in eq 26g, and Qs1, Qs2, Qs3 are positive weighting factors. Eq 26b is the model
    used to calculate the crop yield deficiency. Note that in eq 26b the first part
    on the right-hand side is calculated on the basis of actual soil water content
    measurements, and the second part is calculated on the basis of soil water content
    predicted in the scheduler. Eqs 26c and 26d are the LPV model for scheduling evaluated
    for a week with constant input. Note that the sampling period of the model identified
    in the previous subsection is a day. The scheduler optimization problem, however,
    evaluates once every week. Within a week, the input is held constant. Eq 26c reflects
    this type of consideration. Eq 26e defines the initial condition of the scheduling
    optimization problem, and x̅(k) denotes the current state measurement. Note that
    we assume that the state is measured. Eq 26f requires that all the irrigation
    should be non-negative and is less than the maximum allowed limit umax. Eq 26g
    imposes the constraint such that θw < y < θu as soft constraints through the introduction
    of two slack variables ε1 and ε2. Eq 26h implies that the two slack variables
    are non-negative. The weighting factors Qs3 and Qs4 should be tuned to be relatively
    higher to avoid constraint violation. The solution to the above scheduling optimization
    problem is a sequence of optimal irrigation amount from week k to T. Let us denote
    the optimal weekly irrigation as u*(l|k), l = k, ..., T – 1. Let us also denote
    the corresponding weekly optimal soil moisture as y*(l|k), l = k, ..., T – 1.
    The first two values of the optimal irrigation values u*(k|k), u*(k + 1|k), and
    the corresponding soil moisture values y*(k|k), y*(k + 1|k) are sent to the controller
    as references. At the next week, the scheduling optimization problem is re-evaluated
    with new soil moisture measurement. 3.3.2. Design of the Controller In the controller
    design, the control LPV model is first augmented with an output disturbance to
    account for model-plant mismatch. Then, an observer is designed to estimate the
    model-plant mismatch. The augmented model is as follows: (27) (28) (29) On the
    basis of the above augmented model, the following observer is designed to estimate
    the output disturbance: (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) where x̂, p̂, ŷ, and y̅ denote
    the estimated state, estimated disturbance, estimated output, and output measurement,
    respectively. The observer gains Lx and Lp are determined as discussed in Mao
    et al. (8) The primary objective of the controller is to track the soil moisture
    and total irrigation water consumption references calculated by the scheduler.
    The controller is also designed in the framework of MPC. The controller is evaluated
    every day with updated soil moisture measurements. The controller uses a fixed
    prediction horizon of a week (i.e., 7). At day m, the controller is formulated
    as follows: (35a) (35b) (35c) (35d) (35e) (35f) (35g) (35h) In the optimization
    problem (eq 35), eq 35a defines the cost function to be minimized. In eq 35a,
    y* and u* denote the references from the scheduler. The first term requires that
    the predicted average soil moisture content within the root zone should be close
    to the reference from the scheduler, the second term requires that the total water
    consumption over a week is close to the predicted consumption of the scheduler,
    and the last terms contain two slack variables. In eq 35a, Qc, Qc1, Qc2, and R
    are positive weighting factors. Eq 35b is the LPV model for control. Eq 35c implies
    that a constant output disturbance is considered in the optimization of the controller
    and the disturbance value is given by the observer as specified in eq 35e. This
    constant output disturbance is added to the output equation as specified in eq
    35d. Eq 35e defines the initial condition of the control optimization problem,
    and x̂ is from the observer. Eq 35f requires that all the irrigation should be
    non-negative and is smaller than or equal to one-seventh of the weekly upper limit.
    Eq 35g imposes the constraint such that θw < ỹ < θu as soft constraints. Eq 35h
    implies that the two slack variables are non-negative. The solution to the optimization
    problem (eq 35) is a sequence of optimal irrigation amount for time l = m, ...,
    m + 6 denoted by u*(l|m), l = m, ..., m + 6. At time m, only the first element
    from the optimal daily irrigation input is applied to the field. The rest are
    discarded. At the next day m + 1, the optimization problem is solved again 4.
    Results and Discussion ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To 4.1. LPV Model Identification and
    Validation In the identification of the scheduling LPV model, three working points
    are considered for each of the two scheduling variables (H = 3, G = 3). In the
    input-output data generation, the three s2 working points are s2 = [s2,1, s2,2,
    s2,3]T = [10.3571, 55.3571, 99.881]T cm. These working points are picked according
    to the root length of maize at different growing stages (see Figure 4). Specifically,
    the first working point of s2 corresponds to the root length about 10 days after
    seeding and is picked to represent the baby plant. The second working point is
    the mean value of the root length of the rapid growing stage and the last working
    point is the root length at the fully matured stage. For each working point of
    s2, three different s1 working points are considered. For s2,1, the three s1 working
    points are s1{1} = [s1,1{1}, s1,2{1}, s1,3{1}]T = [0.0755, 0.0936, 0.1792]T. For
    s2,2, the three s1 working points are s1{2} = [s1,1{2}, s1,2{2}, s1,3{2}]T = [0.0789,
    0.1211, 0.1988]T. For s2,3, the three s1 working points are s1{3} = [s1,1{3},
    s1,2{3}, s1,3{3}]T = [0.0835, 0.1176, 0.1564]T. For each s2 working point, the
    three s1 working points are determined according to three (small, medium, large)
    steady-state irrigation amounts, which are picked based on extensive simulations
    and trail-and-error. In determining these irrigation amounts, one consideration
    is the possible soil moisture range of the system (about 0.05–0.35), and another
    consideration is the nonlinearity feature of the agro-hydrological system. The
    orders of the local models na and nb are both picked to be one based on the results
    of Mao et al. (8) Figure 4 Figure 4. Root length of maize according to time after
    seeding. The input and output data for the LPV identification generated from the
    agro-hydrological model is shown in Figure 5. In generating the data, the daily
    weather condition is kept constant with no rain. Binary input signals are used
    around the working points. During the transition from one working point to another
    of s1 (soil moisture), constant inputs are used. In the top plot of Figure 5,
    CS1, CS2, CS3 correspond to the three working points of s2 (root depth). During
    these regions, binary inputs are used. Region CV1 and CV2 correspond to transition
    periods from s2,1 to s2,2 and from s2,2 to s2,3. In these two regions, constant
    inputs are used to show the effect of crop root zone on soil moisture. As crop
    root length increases (from CS1 to CS3), more irrigation is required to maintain
    the soil moisture as shown in the top plot of Figure 5. Following the approach
    in Mao et al., (8) the parameters of the LPV model are identified and shown in
    Table 1. The bottom plot of Figure 5 shows the predicted trajectory and the actual
    trajectory generated by the agro-hydrological model. The LPV model overall has
    a good fit over the entire period with the percentage difference between the predicted
    value of the LPV model and the actual value of the agro-hydrological model about
    5% or less except in the region CV1, which corresponds to the rapid growing stage
    (whose percentage difference is about 18%). To further validate the developed
    LPV model over the crop growing season, an open-loop simulation of the agro-hydrological
    model is performed. Fixed weather condition is considered with no rain, and an
    input irrigation of 2.5 cm/day is considered. The result is shown in Figure 6.
    The overall percentage difference between the predicted value given by the LPV
    model and the value generated by the agro-hydrological model is about 27% with
    most of it contributed from the period between day 23 and day 45 which corresponds
    to the rapid growing stage. In the rest of the period, the percentage difference
    is around 15%. Given the complexity of the agro-hydrological system and the use
    of feedback, the mismatch between the LPV model and the agro-hydrological model
    is considered to be acceptable. Note that the performance of the LPV model may
    be improved by including more working points. Figure 5 Figure 5. Input–output

    6. Validation of the scheduling LPV model. In the controller, the three local
    linear models of each root length working point are weighted using the corresponding
    Gaussian weights in Table 1 and then are used in the controller design. For example,
    in CS1 and up to the middle of CV1, the local models of root length working point
    1 are weighted and used in the MPC controller. The switching between root length
    working points is based on the root length. 4.2. Scheduling and Control Simulation
    Results The proposed closed-loop scheduling and control is applied to the agro-hydrological
    system under different scenarios. The proposed closed-loop scheduling approach
    is compared with an open-loop scheduling scheme in which the scheduling optimization
    is only solved once at the beginning and applied throughout the growing season.
    In the open-loop scheduling scheme, the same closed-loop controller is used. The
    crop growing season is considered to be 23 weeks from seeding. The values of the
    crop sensitivity factor at different crop growth stages (from 0 to 2 with 0 indicating
    initial seeding stage and 2 implying mature stage) for maize are shown in Table
    2. (34) The weekly irrigation upper limit is umax = 70 cm/week, which implies
    that the daily irrigation limit is 10 cm. Table 2. Values of Crop Sensitivity

    Weather In the first scenario, we consider that the amount of rain in the current
    crop season is similar to that of the historical weather data. In this scenario,
    we consider that the actual total rain in the crop growing season is 164.05 cm
    but the historical weather data suggests the total rain over the season to be
    154.50 cm. In the closed-loop scheduling, the scheduler is updated at the end
    of each week with an update weather forecast for the next 2 weeks and the current
    soil moisture measurement. While in the open-loop scheduling, only the historical
    weather data is used at the beginning of the season. As for the controller, in
    both schemes, the field soil moisture is updated every day with field measurements
    and the weather data is also updated for the next 7 days. Uncertainties are considered
    in weather forecast. First, we consider a water conservation case. That is, in
    the scheduler design, more emphasis is put on water conservation. In this case,
    the weighting factors are chosen as Qs1 = 10002, Qs2 = 100, Qs3 = 109, and Qs4
    = 1. The value of Qs3 is chosen very high to ensure that the constraint on the
    lower soil moisture limit is not violated. The weight on the upper soil moisture
    limit is relatively low since it is less important and can be controlled to some
    extent by the irrigation amount. Compared with the next case to be studied, Qs2
    = 100 puts more weighting on water consumption. The values for θu and θw are taken
    as 0.41 cm/cm and 0.15 cm/cm. The wilting value θw for the system is considered
    to be 0.09 cm/cm. Since there is model-plant mismatch, a lower limit that is higher
    than the wilting point is used. For the MPC controller, the weighting factors
    are Qc = 100, Rc = 0.001, Qc1 = 1000, and Qc2 = 0.01. In the controller, a different
    lower limit 0.13 cm/cm on the soil moisture is used since the controller gets
    daily feedback of soil moisture from the farm and it can handle uncertainty better.
    The simulation results are shown in Figure 7 for the closed-loop scheduling scheme
    and in Figure 8 for the open-loop scheduling scheme. For simplicity, only 1 day
    weather forecast is shown in the figures. In both schemes, the MPC controller
    overall is able to track the soil moisture targets well. The over prediction by
    the LPV model subplot (c) of Figures 7 and 8 is relatively significant in the
    crop rapid growing stage, which is due the relatively big mismatch of the LPV
    model from the actual system in the rapid growing stage. The peak at around day
    15 is due to the sudden increase in the actual rain that is not captured in the
    weather forecast. Table 3 summarizes the results of this case. From the table,
    it can be seen that the open-loop scheme has a slightly (1.5%) better crop yield
    deficiency while the closed-loop scheme has a slightly reduced (1.9%) irrigation
    amount. Figure 7 Figure 7. Simulation results of the closed-loop scheduling scheme

    1242.00 Second, we consider a case that we put less emphasis on water conservation
    (i.e., more on crop yield reduction). In the scheduler, the weights are Qs1 =
    10004, Qs2 = 1, Qs3 = 109, and Qs4 = 1. The lower soil moisture constraint in
    the scheduler is decreased to θw = 0.13 cm/cm whereas for the controller the lower
    limit is increased and set to be the set-point from the scheduler. The weights
    in the controller cost function are kept same as in the previous case. Thus, the
    controller in this case tries to track the soil moisture set point from some higher
    values thereby ensuring less yield deficiency. A summary of the results is given
    in Table 3. In this case, we can see that the closed-loop and the open-loop schemes
    give very similar crop yield while the closed-loop scheme uses slightly (0.8%)
    less water. 4.2.2. Scenario 2: Dry Weather In this scenario, we consider that
    the amount of rain in the current crop season is significantly less than the total
    historical rain data. In this set of simulations, we consider that there is 79.44
    cm of rain in the crop growing season. As in the previous scenario, we first consider
    a water saving mode in the scheduler. The scheduler and controller settings are
    the same as in the previous scenario. A summary of the results is given in Table
    4. It can be observed that the closed-loop scheme saves more (2.3%) water relative
    to the open-loop scheme at the cost of (8.2%) less yield. Table 4. Simulation

    prescribed by scheduler (cm3/cm2) 1092.50 993.56 1273.70 1245.10 We also consider
    a similar case like in the previous scenario to put less weight on water conservation.
    The results are summarized in Table 4. From the table, a similar conclusion can
    be drawn. That is, the closed-loop scheme is able to use (2.5%) less water but
    at a cost of (5.9%) less yield. To understand the effects of weights in the scheduling
    optimization, let us look at the results of the same scheduling scheme (closed-loop
    or open-loop) in different operating modes (more water conservation and less water
    conservation). From Table 3 (columns 2 and 4), it can be observed that when the
    objective in the closed-loop scheduler is changed to consider less water conservation,
    an increase of 54.24% in yield can be achieved with the cost of a 23.46% increase
    of water usage under the favorable weather condition. From Table 3 (columns 3
    and 5), it can be seen that an increase of 53.52% in yield can be achieved with
    the cost of a 20.07% increase of water usage for the open-loop scheduler under
    the favorable weather condition. This may imply that the yield is more sensitive
    to the weights and a relatively smaller change in the consumption of irrigation
    water may result a much larger change in the yield. A similar pattern can be observed
    from the results of Table 4 for the dry weather condition. In addition to the
    above cases, we consider another case in which the water price varies. The water
    price is increased in the relatively dry season between week 10 and 15 corresponding
    to day 70 and 105. The corresponding Qs2 value changes according to the price
    as follows: (36) The results are shown in Figure 9 for the closed-loop integrated
    scheme and in Figure 10 for the open-loop irrigation scheme. A summary of the
    result is given in Table 5. The result shows that less water is used relatively
    to open-loop scheme. In the figures, it can be observed that a tendency to use
    more water when water price is low presents. The soil moisture set point before
    day 60 is around 0.3 cm/cm. This creates a water storage that later is used when
    the water price increases. It can be observed that the actual irrigation during
    day 59 drops to zero since the soil moisture set point gets reduced. In this case,
    the closed-loop scheme leads to a 5.3% water saving but at the cost of 5.2% crop
    yield reduction. Figure 9 Figure 9. Simulation results of the closed-loop scheduling
    scheme under dry weather scenario with varying water price. Figure 10 Figure 10.

    SECTIONSJump To In this work, we investigated closed-loop scheduling together
    with closed-loop control for agriculture irrigation. In the proposed design, LPV
    models were identified and used in the design of the scheduler and the controller.
    The designed hierarchical scheduling and control system is applied to a field
    with maize. In the simulations, a couple of different weather scenarios were considered.
    Within each scenario, a few different cases were studied including different weights
    on water conservation and varying water prices. From the simulation results, we
    can observe that the gain (either in water conservation or crop yield) in closed-loop
    scheduling in most of the cases comes with a cost (either lower crop yield or
    increased water consumption). The results in the simulations considered do not
    show a very clear benefit of using closed-loop scheduling. One possible reason
    for the results is that the crop maize considered in this work requires significant
    water in the growing season. It may have a much stronger impact on the irrigation
    pattern than the impacts of uncertainty in weather and model. This may have caused
    the irrigation to be high in most of the growing season, as can be seen in the
    simulation results, and thus makes the difference between closed-loop scheduling
    and open-loop scheduling not obvious. Moreover, in this work, the spatial heterogeneity
    is not considered, and the field only includes maize. When spatial heterogeneity
    and more types of crops are considered, the benefits of a closed-loop scheduling
    may be more obvious. Further, in this work, we have only considered the soil moisture
    as a controlled variable, when other manipulated inputs (e.g., salinity) are considered,
    closed-loop scheduling may bring more benefits. In our future work, we will consider
    different crops other than maize. Spatial heterogeneity and other manipulated
    inputs will also be considered. Author Information ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Corresponding

  description: Rice is one of the most important staple foods in the world. In Europe,
    Italy is the main producer of rice, with almost all production concentrated in
    the northeast of the country. Traditionally, rice is grown in fields that are
    flooded from before planting until just before harvest. This water management
    technique requires a great deal of labour for farmers who have to manually adjust
    the inlet and outlet gates to maintain a constant ponding water level in the fields,
    especially when there is fluctuation of water supply at the farm inlet, for example
    as a result of rainfall. In addition, the practice of flood irrigation is very
    water-intensive. New technologies based on remotely and automatically controlled
    gates are being studied to increase the efficiency of this irrigation method.
    The objective of this work is to explore the potential of a coordinated and intelligent
    system of gates for efficient farm irrigation management and ponding water level
    maintenance. Based on information and measurements from a real case study consisting
    of a 40-hectare paddy rice farm located in northern Italy, where automatic gates
    and water level sensors were placed at strategic points of the farm canals and
    fields, respectively, a proportional-integral (PI) and a non-linear model predictive
    control (NMPC) of water levels were implemented and compared through modelling
    and simulation experiments. The results show that the proportional-integral control
    reproduces the actions that the farmer uses when faced with situations of surplus
    of water in the fields or a shortage of water in the farm canal. In particular,
    the general coordination of the gates is lost, and the individual binomial field-gate
    prevails as an independent system in the farmer's operation. Conversely, non-linear
    predictive control coordinates the gate operation to obtain a uniform ponding
    water level in the fields when there is a shortage of water, or significant water
    conservation when there is an excess of water as a result of rainfall. In conclusion,
    a nonlinear predictive control model seems to be a suitable strategy to advance
    irrigation management in rice farms, allowing rice farmers to continue the tradition
    of flooding while increasing its performance.

    control model 1. Introduction Rice is the third most produced crop in the world
    and a staple food for more than half of the world''s population, mostly living
    in developing countries (Fukagawa and Ziska, 2019). In this context, Italy is
    the leading rice producer in Europe, accounting for more than half of the total
    production of this high-value crop (Facchi et al., 2018). Typically, rice is grown
    in fields that are flooded from planting to pre-harvest, and this traditional
    irrigation technique (i.e., continuous submergence) is considered an important
    sink of water resources. This technique is dominant in most areas and is characterized
    by low irrigation efficiency (Cesari de Maria et al., 2016). In addition, irrigation
    management requires a lot of human labour, as it is still based on maintaining
    a predetermined water level in the paddies by manually regulating the irrigation
    inflow rate (Masseroni et al., 2017). In this context, the application of flexible
    and automatic control devices for irrigation management in paddy rice farms appears
    to be a viable solution that can be exploited to (i) increase the water use efficiency
    of rice cultivation and (ii) reduce the effort dedicated to irrigation flow rate
    regulation at field and farm scale, without changing the traditional irrigation
    flooding practices. More specifically, hydraulic infrastructures based on a system
    of coordinated gates located at strategic points of the farm irrigation network
    can allow to maintain optimal water levels in the farm channels and rice plots,
    providing more consistent and reliable irrigation flows through the farm service
    points. A recent review on the identification of smart automatic irrigation techniques
    for sustainable rice environments shows that there is a great potential for water
    conservation through the use of automatic and coordinated gate systems in permanently-flooded
    rice farms, with benefits in terms of both increasing the quality and quantity
    of crop production (Champness et al., 2023). Nevertheless, the review highlighted
    that these systems applied in paddy rice contexts are still in an embryonic stage
    and their application is limited to individual rice plots (Masseroni et al., 2018).
    Table 1 shows the degree of automation and sensor components developed in the
    main automated gravity surface irrigation system experiments for rice. In general,
    all have successfully developed a desktop-based system for remote control of irrigation,
    but only Masseroni et al. (2018) have developed a system using commercially available
    infrastructure in a commercial-scale. Table 1. Summary of the components and capabilities

    aimed to improve the sustainability of agricultural water use has indirectly stimulated
    irrigation modernisation projects. For example, the Lombardy region (the most
    important region in Italy from an industrial and agricultural point of view, with
    over 7000 km2 of irrigated land) is promoting bottom-up initiatives in the form
    of \"information and pilot project actions\". The main aim of these initiatives
    is to demonstrate the potential of innovative irrigation management systems at
    farm and district level, and to promote a shared understanding of modernisation
    objectives. In this study, we analyse and reflect on the results achieved in one
    of these pilot initiatives. Specifically, the project represents a pioneering
    example of the transition to a flexible and harmonised approach to irrigation
    management in paddy farms. In particular, a new modelling framework adopted for
    a coordinated and centralized flowrate regulation is described. The control algorithm
    implemented to maintain a predetermined ponding water level in the fields according
    to site-specific conditions is presented and tested under two different scenarios
    of shortage and surplus of water supply to the farm. The impact of this new centralised
    management of farm gates on water conservation was compared with the impact of
    a traditional decentralised management of gates, which roughly simulates the operations
    carried out manually by the farmer. The results may provide indications for improving
    flood management in rice cultivation, taking into account the effects of climate
    change on freshwater availability and rainfall patterns. 2. Control strategies
    for a sustainable agricultural water management Advanced but still little explored
    strategies for achieving coordinated control of complex systems of physical devices
    for irrigation (e.g. gates, valves, pumps) are those represented by proportional-integral-derivative
    (PID) or predictive controls (van Overloop et al., 2005, Bertsekas, 2005). The
    first class of controls offers a mid-point between simple bang-bang controls (i.e.
    feedback controllers that switches abruptly between two states - on or off - when
    a desired target (setpoint) has been reached) and model-based controls such as
    predictive ones (Huang et al., 2022). In agricultural water management, PID control
    has been mainly used for real-time control of soil moisture (Harper, 2017), management
    of sprinkler irrigation equipment (Jacob et al., 2019), and control of irrigation
    canal operations (Litrico et al., 2007). A good description of the application
    of predictive control in the field of water resource systems is provided by Castelletti
    et al. (2023). In particular, they consider three main areas of interest in the
    application of the model predictive control (MPC), namely the water reservoir,
    the open channels and the urban water network. In the first case, reservoirs are
    usually multi-purpose systems serving power plants, irrigation districts, urban
    and industrial water users, as well as contributing to other objectives such as
    flood control, environmental management, navigation, water quality, etc. Traditionally,
    reservoir control is implemented by a human operator who can act on the basis
    of static control curves or control actions proposed in real time by a decision
    support system (DSS). In this case, the predictive control strategy can help to
    decide the release from the reservoir at time t + 1 depending on the release decision,
    the storage and the net inflow (usually affected by potential disturbances) to
    the reservoir at time t. In the second case, open channels are stretches of water
    between two control structures. Actuators are hydraulic infrastructure, such as
    gates, weirs and dams, available for water control purposes. Finally, nodes represent
    channel junctions, i.e. locations where a stream flows into or branches off from
    the main stream (these are known as tributaries and distributaries, respectively).
    The dynamics of open channels are best described by the Saint-Venant equations,
    a set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. In this case, the predictive
    control strategy can help, for example, to maintain a pool between two actuators
    (to limit fluctuations in water diverted by tributaries). It can also support
    a bottom-up approach to gravity water distribution for irrigation, where the actual
    irrigation requirements of the fields are incorporated into the gate operations
    on the irrigation canals and ultimately the release function from the reservoir.
    In the third case, the urban water network is affected by the integrated urban
    water cycle, which consists of several infrastructural and operational components,
    including water source management, water treatment, water transport and distribution,
    sewerage/sewage collection and rainwater/stormwater drainage systems, with the
    main objective of providing water for human needs reliably, efficiently and safely,
    and then returning it to the environment with the least possible impact. Taking
    water transport and distribution networks as an example, an optimal control problem
    (possibly involving a predictive control strategy) is typically formulated as
    an optimal pump operation and valve setting control problem, aiming at resource
    and economic savings in energy consumption and associated costs, while ensuring
    that water is delivered to end users to meet their water needs. The main application
    of predictive control strategy (Bwambale et al., 2023) in irrigation management
    is in water, energy and fertiliser conservation. In particular, this strategy
    has largely been applied in the areas of irrigation canal flow control and regulation
    (Álvarez et al., 2013), while limited experiences were found in irrigation scheduling
    (Abioye et al., 2021), soil water potential regulation (Chen et al., 2020), soil
    moisture regulation (Ayaz et al., 2020) and lastly prediction of precipitation
    and evapotranspiration (Guo and You, 2018). Nothing to the author''s knowledge
    has been found on the application of predictive control model on irrigation management
    at field or farm scale and in particular on paddy rice. 3. Material and methods
    3.1. The pilot case study The flexible and coordinated irrigation management system
    was implemented at Cascina Ca'' Granda Milano, a rice paddy farm (40 ha in size)
    located in the south of Milan, consisting of 10 fields with an average size of
    about 4 ha each (Fig. 1). The fields are characterized by a toposequence (from
    north to south), which facilitates the irrigation procedures. More specifically,
    the fields are divided into five different blocks (i.e., bc, d, ehi, fg, lm),
    which are characterized by a single point of entry of the water flow. For example,
    in block bc, the only entry point is located in b. From b, the water flows into
    c, since it is topographically lower than b. According to the toposequence, the
    fields are irrigated as follows: block bc is irrigated first, followed by block
    d, third block ehi, then block fg, and finally block lm. Download : Download high-res

    – Ferit® (dot [L1–5]) are included in the picture. Flow rate direction into the
    farm canal network is indicated by blue arrows. Subdivision of fields [b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,l,m]
    in block is shown in red. All the fields have been sown with rice (Leonida variety)
    and the irrigation practice adopted is continuous flooding. In particular, rice
    is sown in dry soil at the end of April and the fields are flooded when the rice
    is around the three-leaf stage (i.e. about one month after sowing). Harvesting
    is typically scheduled for mid-September, while the fields are drained at the
    end of August. Eleven boreholes were drilled within the fields to determine soil
    hydraulic properties. On average, the soils are characterized by a silt loam texture
    with slight variability between blocks. The low conductivity layer thickness was
    approximately 30 cm, characterized by an average saturated hydraulic conductivity
    of approximately 1.8 mm/h. The nominal flow rate delivered to the farm by the
    irrigation agency is about 200 l/s continuously during the irrigation season (i.e.,
    April to September). The water is delivered to the farm from the north, i.e. upstream
    of points P1 and P2. There are no drainage points in the fields, while only one
    farm canal drainage point is activated in case of overflows. 3.1.1. Equipment
    At strategic points of the farm canal (P1–4 in Fig. 1) four automatic and remote
    controlled PikoMeter® gates (Rubicon Water, AU) were installed (Fig. 2a) to control
    the irrigation within the blocks. The PikoMeter® consists of three main components:
    an ultrasonic level sensor inside the gate frame, a flow meter and a steel gate.
    The flow meter measures the flow rate across the gate; hence the volume integrating
    the flow rates during irrigation. This meter consists of a cylindrical box with
    20 ultrasonic transducers in 5 measurement planes. The flow meter can measure
    with an accuracy of + /- 2.5% for velocities greater than 25 mm/s. The water level
    obtained by the ultrasonic level sensor is measured with an accuracy of 0.5 mm
    and a resolution of 0.1 mm. The gates are equipped with adaptive control software
    that allows their operation to be managed through three different setpoint configuration
    levels, i.e. maintaining a fixed (i) gate opening, (ii) upstream water level (U/S)
    or (iii) downstream flow (D/S). Download : Download high-res image (359KB) Download

    Cascina Ca’ Granda Milano. The PikoMeter® gate and the field''s water level sensor,
    known as Ferit®, are depicted in the upper right corner of the image. In addition
    to the PikoMeter®, five ultrasonic water level sensors (Ferit®) were installed
    in each field block (Fig. 2b). The position of the Ferit® in the field was decided
    according to the farmer''s experience, i.e. where its measurement would be representative
    of the water level in the block (L1-L5 in Fig. 1). Each Ferit® continuously monitors
    the water level in the rice field (with a resolution of +/- 1 mm) and sends the
    information to a master control system (FarmConnect® Gateway - Rubicon Water AU).
    The FarmConnect® Gateway can potentially provide a cellular network interface
    between PikoMeter® and Ferit®, but it has not yet been developed to control the
    gate operations. This interface uses the Telstra NextG protocol to routinely upload
    the data [via a Global System for Mobile Connection (GSM)] to a host server for
    remote monitoring and control. Biophysical parameters were continuously measured
    over the agricultural season by a standard agro-meteorological station of the
    Regional Environmental Protection Agency (ARPA), located a few kilometres from
    the rice farm. 3.2. Rice farm modelling framework The main elements of paddy rice
    farm (i.e. fields, canal, gates) were modelled using the Modelica simulation environment
    (Modelica Association, 2021). Modelica is an object-oriented, declarative, multi-domain
    modelling language for component-oriented modelling of complex systems. There
    are two main differences between Modelica and common object-oriented programming
    languages such as C+ + or Java. First, Modelica is a modelling language, not a
    traditional programming language: Modelica classes are not compiled in the conventional
    sense, but are translated into objects which are then exercised by a simulation
    engine. Second, Modelica is essentially based on equations, not assignments, although
    algorithmic components are still allowed, such as algorithms in programming languages
    or blocks in causal simulation environments (e.g. Simulink). In other words, Modelica
    allows an acausal approach to physical modelling: equations have no predefined
    causality and can have expressions on both the right and left sides. The simulation
    engine symbolically manipulates the equations to determine the order in which
    they are solved, as well as to determine the overall inputs and outputs of the
    model. Because of these features, the Modelica language allows a truly modular
    approach to the modelling of complex systems. This improves the readability, modifiability,
    and reusability of plant component models (Mattsson and Elmqvist, 1997), as well
    as the extension of the packages of physical domains by adding models of new components.
    In addition, models can be assembled graphically by dragging, dropping and connecting
    component icons, taking advantage of the graphical capabilities of the adopted
    (open source) interpreter, OpenModelica. The basic modelling components of the
    pilot rice farm were collected in a Modelica library (Field_Package). It contains
    definitions of constants (e.g. atmospheric pressure, gravity acceleration, water
    density etc.), classes (e.g. connectors), and subpackages (e.g. fields, canals,
    gates). Each element included in the Field_Package is described in detail in the
    Supplementary Material, whereas at the link https://github.com/looms-polimi/Field_Package
    the reader can freely download the rice farm Modelica library. In Fig. 3 the general

    Additional information about the symbols can be found in the Supplementary Material.
    Since in the control theory the number of control and controlled variables must
    be equal (Glasser, 1985), only the blocks d (6 ha), ehi (4.9 ha), lm (8.9 ha)
    and fg (13.2 ha) were considered in the modelling experiment. These blocks are
    directly irrigated by the water flows through P1, P3, P4 and by the difference
    of the flow rate derived between the gate P2 and the combination of P3 and P4.
    For simplicity, the blocks d, ehi, lm, and fg will be referred to as Field 1,
    2, 3, and 4, respectively, and the gates P1, 2, 3, and 4 will be referred to as
    gate G1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The core of the rice farm modelling is the
    field water balance. Rainfall, irrigation, evapotranspiration, and percolation
    were considered as dominant water fluxes, while surface drainage was neglected
    because each field has no outflow. The details of the field water balance are
    entirely reported in the Supplementary Material. The water balance was calibrated
    based on ponding water level measurements in the fields under a condition of near
    steady flow into the fields. Specifically, the calibration involved adjusting
    the percolation flux (through a percolation coefficient) so that the simulated
    ponding water level matched the real one. Fig. 4 shows the comparison between
    the measured and modelled ponding water levels within Field 3, the latter obtained
    with different percolation coefficients. We found that the range of percolation
    coefficient between 0.01 and 0.04 allowed a good fit between the observed and
    simulated ponding water levels in all fields. However, in the modelling framework
    we decided to use a single percolation coefficient equal to 0.01 for all fields.

    level, c – percolation coefficient. 3.3. Control strategy The goal of the control
    system is obviously to regulate the ponding water level within the fields. This
    is done by modulating the opening of the sluice gates (G1–4). The controlled variables
    are therefore the water levels within the fields, while the control variables
    are the opening height of the gates. The main disturbances are essentially the
    rainfall, percolation, evapotranspiration, and the flow rate in the canal. All
    states of the model are measured, including the farm canal levels. Therefore,
    there was no need to implement state estimators. A first simple approach to the
    design of the control system was to consider the binomial field-gate as an independent
    system. This approach can be defined as a decentralized control strategy. The
    interactions that occur mainly through the connection between fields and farm
    canal can be neglected with this approach (i.e. canal water is not considered
    a limiting factor for field water supply). For this strategy, a Proportional-Integral
    (PI) controller was used to control the ponding water level within the fields
    (Ang et al., 2005). However, the decentralized control system based on PI regulators
    suffers from three main drawbacks. First, each control system tries to achieve
    its goal independently of the others, which would be plausible under conditions
    of dynamic decoupling and unlimited water availability, while in reality the water
    availability in input to the farm could be reduced as a results of upstream regulations
    controls or water scarcity. Secondly, the adoption of anti-wind-up algorithms
    makes it possible to manage the return from saturation conditions of the control
    variables, but it is obviously not able to predict or avoid them. Finally, the
    decentralized controllers act on the error, i.e. the consequence of any disturbances,
    only after these disturbances have produced their effect, which does not allow,
    for example, to exploit perturbation forecast systems and thus anticipate the
    control action. To overcome the above drawbacks an advanced centralized control
    strategy was implemented. For this strategy, the Non-linear Model Predictive Control
    (NMPC) was used (Blanco et al., 2010), since it is suitable to deal with nonlinear
    systems with slow dynamics such as represented by the management of rice irrigation
    during flooding period (Ding et al., 2018). NMPC is a control strategy based on
    the sequential, online resolution of multiple open-loop optimal control problems
    defined over a finite, receding time horizon (Bertsekas, 2005). At each time step,
    the resolution of an NMPC problem yields a sequence of optimal control actions
    (i.e., gate openings) over the future horizon, given a predicted trajectory of
    the disturbances over the same horizon. The optimization is generally formulated
    considering a single objective; when the problem involves multiple objectives
    (e.g., water supply, hydropower production, flood control, environmental protection,
    irrigation, transport, etc.), these are generally aggregated using a scalarization
    function (e.g., weighted combination) or via the lexicographic goal programming
    technique in cases where there is a clear hierarchy of priorities across the objectives
    (e.g., Horváth et al., 2022). The online optimization scheme is reiterated forward
    in time over a receding horizon during the operational life of the system. After
    each optimization, only the control action in the current time step of the optimized
    control sequence is actuated, before reiterating the optimization at the next
    time step. Through this reiteration of the model-based optimization, NMPC determines
    the control law implicitly in a closed-loop form, as it computes the optimal control
    action at each time step t based on the observed state of the system. The flexibility
    to directly use any models available for the systems to be controlled is one of
    the main advantages of this approach, especially for the control of highly nonlinear
    systems, while the flexibility to work with (nonlinear) constraints, either explicit
    physical constraints (e.g. limits of actuators) or legal constraints, is another
    advantage of MPC compared to other control methods. The Supplementary Material
    provides the mathematical details of each control strategy applied to the Cascina
    Ca’ Granda pilot case study. 3.4. Simulation experiments The performances of the
    decentralized and centralized controls, based on Proportional Integral (PI) and
    Model Predictive Control (NMPC) strategies, respectively, were evaluated in terms
    of the system''s adaptive capacity to respond to external requirements or disturbances,
    using three different modelling experiments. The objective of the first experiment
    was to verify the correct operation of the two control systems under standard
    flood management conditions. Specifically, the modelling exercise simulates a
    theoretical situation in which the control system works to change the ponding
    water level in the fields from an initial condition to a new reference one (in
    this example from 4 cm to 5 cm). This is a typical operation that could occur
    when the ponding water level needs to be adjusted during an irrigation season.
    The simulation assumes no external disturbances, such as the presence of rainfall
    events, and a constant nominal flow rate at farm inlet of 200 l/s. The second
    experiment examined the response of the control systems to a reduction in the
    flow rate at the input to the farm. In particular, starting from a standard water
    level within the farm canal and rice plots, the effect of reducing the nominal
    flow rate at farm inlet (200 l/s) to 100 l/s on the ability of both control systems
    to maintain a uniform ponding water level within the blocks is investigated. This
    scenario can happen if water becomes scarce during the agricultural season (dry
    season), or if the water supply changes as a result of gates being maneuvered
    on irrigation district channels upstream of the farm. The response of both control
    systems to an external disturbance derived from a rainfall event was evaluated
    in the third experiment. Specifically, the possibility of taking advantage of
    rainfall forecasts and using them to predict the advance status of water levels
    in farm canals and rice blocks was used to evaluate the adaptive capacity of the
    control systems. Specifically, the selected event occurred in the 2021 agricultural
    season on the case study and consisted of a rainfall volume of about 33 mm and
    duration of 10 h, with a peak of 18 mm. In this case the nominal flow rate was
    maintained at 200 l/s in input to the farm. The potential water conservation of
    the PI and NMPC strategies was also investigated. Specifically, using the decentralized
    strategy (i.e., PI control) as a benchmark, the benefits of adopting centralized
    control (i.e., NMPC) in terms of water conservation were estimated as additional
    information on the performance of a coordinated system of gates. 4. Results 4.1.
    Performance of PI and NMPC under standard conditions of flood management The performance
    in time of both control strategies (i.e. PI and NMPC) under standard conditions
    of flood management are presented in Fig. 5. In particular, the comparison between
    the PI and NMPC approaches was evaluated for (i) the ponding water level in the
    fields, (ii) the opening height of the gates and finally (iii) the water level
    in the farm canal. In general, both control strategies respond effectively to
    bring the system to the new ponding water level configuration (i.e., from 4 cm
    to 5 cm). The new ponding level is reached gradually for both control strategies
    in a similar time horizon (about 10 h), depending on real inertias observed in
    the field system. The objective of increasing the water level in the fields led
    to the initial opening of the gates and their subsequent gradual adjustment. In
    both strategies, because the area of each field is different and therefore the
    flow rate needed to raise the ponding water level in each field is different,
    the initial gate opening height was different for each field. The adjustment of
    the gate opening after the initial moment is managed in a different way by the
    control action for each gate, both for PI and for NMPC. This is due to the need
    to have different flow rates in the input to the fields in order to reach the
    new ponding water level. However, since the opening height of the gates is similar
    at the end of the control action, both strategies can be considered coherent.
    Finally, the increase in the flow rate required to reach the new pond level in
    the fields influenced the water level in the farm canal, which at first quickly
    dropped below its initial height (about 1 m) and then returned to a level suitable
    to meet the water needs of the fields, since the inflow to the farm is not limited.
    In this case, the differences between the two control strategies are particularly
    evident. PI causes the water level in the canal to fall by approximately half
    compared to the initial condition, while the fall in the water level is less pronounced
    with NMPC. The return to the initial state of the water level in the canal takes
    twice as long for PI than for NMPC. Download : Download high-res image (169KB)

    and centralized (NMPC) control strategies on (i) Ponding Water Level (PWL) adjustment,
    (ii) gate opening height (i.e. the degree of gate open) and (iii) water level
    in the farm canal (CWL). Scenario 1: standard condition of flood management. The
    effects of both control actions on the ponding water level of the other fields
    and on the other gate opening are presented in Appendix 1. 4.2. Performance of
    PI and NMPC under limited water supply conditions Often the water supply at the
    head of a farm is not constant over time. This can happen when a dry agricultural
    season is expected. Fig. 6 shows for the Field 1 the performance of PI and NMPC
    control actions on ponding water level and gate opening when the nominal inflow
    rate to the farm canal was rapidly reduced from 200 l/s to 100 l/s. The ponding
    water level in the field decreases as a result of the inflow rate reduction. At
    the end of the simulation time, the levels reached are very similar (2 mm of difference).
    The PI control action responds to the falling of ponding water level in the field
    by opening the gate to draw as much water as possible from the farm canal. The
    gate changes its opening height up to the maximum allowed (i.e. 1), since the
    gate operates independently of the others and responds only to the needs of its
    own field. The gate takes about 20 h to saturate. In the other fields and gates,
    similar behaviour was observed. The general effect of this action is to remove
    almost all the water from the canal, which is reduced to a water level of a few
    centimetres. It follows that, the new inflow rate (i.e. 100 l/sec) is not sufficient
    to maintain the reference water level inside the fields (i.e. 5 cm). As a result,
    at the end of the control action, the ponding water level was lower than the reference
    threshold. Download : Download high-res image (168KB) Download : Download full-size

    strategies on (i) Ponding Water Level (PWL) adjustment, (ii) gate opening height
    and (iii) water level in the farm canal (CWL). Scenario 2: limited water supply.
    The ponding water level inside Field 1 (and thus for the other fields as well)
    was also lower than the reference threshold at the end of the NMPC control action.
    However, the NMPC uses a completely different strategy to reach this new configuration.
    The gate does not only look at the state of its own field, but also at the state
    of the other gates and at the farm canal. This integrated approach ensures that
    the gate does not saturate when it opens (i.e. it never reaches the maximum opening
    height) and the water level in the farm canal is not drastically depleted (as
    properly shown in Fig. 6). Furthermore, the gate opening equilibrium was achieved
    in about half time with respect to the PI control. The effects of both control
    actions on the ponding water level of the other fields and on the other gate opening
    are presented in Appendix 2. A positive feature of the NMPC strategy is that it
    allows for compensation of flood conditions among fields even when ponding water
    levels cannot be maintained at the target level for the reduced inflow rate in
    input to the farm. This is clearly shown in Fig. 7, which compares the effects
    of PI and NMPC approach on the ponding water level within the fields. A decentralized
    control action approach results in different ponding water levels within the fields,
    while a centralized control action approach makes the ponding water level between
    the fields uniform (although lower than the target water level). Download : Download

    Water Level (PWL) adjustment with respect to the target (PWL target), and (ii)
    gate opening height of all fields (Field 1–4)and gates (Gate 1–4). Scenario 2:
    limited water supply. It is interesting that a uniform PI controller response
    corresponds to a varying ponding water level between the fields. In fact, every
    gate responding to a field''s request for water opens and gets saturated (Fig.
    7). Conversely, a tailored control action by the NMPC system for each gate results
    in a uniform ponding water level between the fields. In this case, the opening
    height of each gate is related to the water demand of the field, which in this
    case study strictly depends by the field area. In fact, the opening height of
    gate 4 (which serves Field 4 - of about 13 ha in size) at the end of the control
    action is about three times greater than the opening height of gate 2 (which serves
    Field 2 - of about 4 ha in size) and two times greater than the opening height
    of gate 3 (which serves Field 3 - of about 6 ha in size). In the NMPC strategy,
    the gates are not saturated (i.e., the gates do not reach their maximum opening
    height), but are opened only to the extent necessary to meet the predictive water
    request. 4.3. Performance of the PI and NMPC in the presence of an instantaneous
    water supply The effect on ponding water level and gate operations of the decentralized
    (i.e. PI) and centralized (i.e. NMPC) strategies stressed by an instantaneous
    water supply disturbance to the farm generated by a rainfall event is presented
    in Fig. 8 for the Field 1 and Gate 1. The PI approach works only when the precipitation
    starts. In particular, when rainfall begins, the gate begins to close until the
    opening height is equal to zero (i.e. gate completely closed) when rainfall has
    reached the peak. The ponding water level in the field increased up to 7 cm (i.e.
    2 cm above the reference target), with a peak around the moment of maximum rainfall
    intensity. At the end of rainfall event the ponding water level within the field
    return to the target value. The same behaviour was observed in the other fields
    and gates as reported Appendix 3. The PI strategy reproduces the behaviour of
    a farmer and the effect it has on the water level in the fields when it rains.
    In fact, the farmer operates on the gates only when he sees that the water level
    in the fields is changing. This difficulty in adapting the system before the rain
    starts leads to a significant perturbation in the ponding water level inside the
    fields, as a consequence of the inertia that a real system composed of large fields
    has in recovering the initial configuration after a disturbance. On the contrary,
    the NMPC approach tries to prevent the additional volume of water supplied to
    the fields before the rainfall event, modifying the state of the system so that
    it can absorb the disturbance without excessive change in the ponding water level.
    Specifically, the forecasting model that constitutes the NMPC works by closing
    the gates in anticipation of the onset of rain (about 5 h on average before the
    rain, but the beginning of the gate closing action can vary between fields). The
    ponding water level drops a few centimetres below the target and then rises when
    it rains. However, the increase of ponding water level is less than about 20%
    of that obtained with the PI, highlighting the great capacity of the NMPC to maintain
    the target ponding water level even under instantaneous disturbances. Download

    of rainfall event. By integrating the water flows entering each field over time
    of rainfall event, the potential water conservation operated by NMPC with respect
    to the PI action has been calculated. Specifically, the NMPC results in 11% on
    average of water conservation with respect to PI strategy. This conservation is
    due to the anticipation of closing the gates in preparation for the rain event.
    The NMPC control action was further stressed by assuming an hour advance or delay
    in the rainfall event. This simulation was used to investigate the response of
    the NMPC strategy when potential errors in the weather forecasts occur. The results
    of these two additional simulations are presented in Fig. 11, where the effects
    of NMPC strategy on ponding water levels and gate opening heights are shown for
    all fields and gates. The advance of the rainfall event has no significant effect
    on the control action, except for the anticipation of the closure of the gates.
    Conversely, the delay of the rainfall event leads to a temporary opening of the
    gates due to the fact that in the window of the prediction horizon (i.e. 15 h
    - see Supplementary Material) the forecast of the rainfall evolution pattern was
    not fully included. In fact, the model is not able to predict what will happen
    after the prediction horizon, so since the ponding water level decreased excessively,
    the control action ordered the opening of gates. However, when the rainfall increase
    was detected, the controller sent a signal to close the gates again. Download

    challenges for the future of sustainable rice irrigation is to cope with climate
    change and adapt to fluctuations in freshwater availability. Without improvements
    in irrigation management (data-driven modelling and management of irrigation interventions,
    flexible and predictive gate operation, real-time flow control, etc.), traditional
    rice irrigation practices of flood irrigation may be abandoned in favour of other
    less water-intensive irrigation techniques (Lampayan et al., 2015). Although the
    modelling framework presented in this paper offers the possibility to safeguard
    the traditional method of rice irrigation (i.e. flood irrigation), in practice,
    the transition to a new irrigation technique does not affect the ability to use
    the automatic technologies and control approaches presented in this paper. The
    ability to well regulate the ponding water level within rice fields during the
    season has potential water saving and environmental benefits. In the case of the
    rice water balance (see Supplementary Material), it shows a proportional relationship
    between ponding water level and percolation flux (Toung et al., 1994). This relationship
    illustrates how a good control of the ponding water level within the fields can
    provide direct control of hydrological losses at field/farm scale by minimising
    the latter. This could be seen as an important achievement of the coordinated
    control approach, as hydrological losses are beyond the control of the farmer.
    Finally, previous studies have shown that continuous submergence and good control
    of ponding water levels during the rice growing season are more effective in controlling
    weeds, reducing herbicide use and improving the environmental sustainability of
    flooding practices. (Aravinth et al., 2023). Therefore, the NMPC could enable
    this weed control at farm level more efficiently than the PI approach, as shown
    in scenario 2, where the centralised control of the gates attempts to equalise
    the ponding water level within the fields. Given these examples, the introduction
    of automatic control into current flooding management practice could increase
    the sustainability of traditional rice irrigation. This would require the installation
    of a new hydraulic infrastructure (automatic gates) to replace the manual one,
    capable of accepting control software. The costs of this modernisation are relevant
    but sustainable, as already shown by Masseroni et al. (2018), and will become
    even more so as the cost of water increases. Concerning the modelling framework
    presented in this work, it has some simplifications, which can be more detailed
    if the Modelica library would really be included in the gate control software
    of the pilot farm. One of them is the choice of a single percolation coefficient
    for the fields. In our results, the differences in the control effect between
    the fields are exclusively due to the different field size, while specific characteristic
    of each field could be included in the water balance model equations. In this
    respect, it must be pointed out that the OpenModelica generated Functional Mock-up
    Unit (FMU) can already be used to calibrate uncertain model parameters (i.e. percolation
    coefficients), through Python optimization routines, thus paving the way to adaptive
    NMPC, while the use of the aforementioned FMU for the solution of the optimal
    control problem, also based on (open source) Python functions, is currently being
    studied. Additionally, predictions are the key feature for an intelligent control
    action achieved by NMPC strategy. In our modelling experiments, only rainfall
    forecasts are included in the NMPC, while better control performance could be
    obtained if temperature forecasts (which affect crop development) were included
    in the centralized control strategy. For this purpose, the correct choice of the
    prediction horizon can help to avoid unexpected opening and closing of the gates
    during their operation, increasing water conservation. Long-term forecasts of
    biophysical variables could also be included in the model. However, this could
    increase both the uncertainty in the reliability and robustness of the control
    action and the computational time. Therefore, it would be optimal to combine the
    control action with the farmer''s experience. The latter could, for example, help
    decide which fields should maintain the target ponding water level in case of
    water shortage, instead of having a uniform ponding water level between fields
    but below the threshold. Lastly, the ponding water level target could be variable
    during the agricultural season, following the flooding best practices for the
    specific rice cultivar or crop phenological stages, or to practice alternate wetting
    drying flood management (Rejesus et al., 2011, Mayer et al., 2019, Gilardi et
    al., 2023). 6. Conclusion This paper presents an advanced control technique for
    precision flood irrigation in paddy rice farms. The proposed technique has been
    tested on a real case study through a series of simulation experiments in the
    Modelica environment and is based on a nonlinear model predictive control strategy.
    This strategy has been compared with that obtained by a proportional-integral
    control action, which roughly reproduces the traditional farmer gate operations.
    Simulation reveals that the nonlinear model predictive control strategy can accurately
    control ponding water level within the fields both under standard conditions of
    flood management and under limited or instantaneous water supplies to the farm.
    Furthermore, its application to a real rainfall event showed that nonlinear model
    predictive control has the potential to significantly reduce water consumption
    compared to proportional-integral control. Therefore, the nonlinear model predictive
    control strategy appears to be a viable solution for improving the performance
    of flood irrigation in paddy rice farms, although some slight improvements in
    the modelling algorithm should still be made before implementing this technique
    in a real system of sluice gates. Implementing the nonlinear model predictive
    control strategy in the gate management software and testing its operation under
    different agricultural seasons will be the next step. Declaration of Competing

  journal: Agricultural Water Management
  key_findings: The study found that the centralized, non-linear predictive control
    approach outperformed the traditional decentralized, proportional-integral control
    approach for maintaining a predetermined ponding water level in the fields, with
    better coordination of gate operations and improved water conservation.
  limitations: The study was conducted on a single rice farm and the results may not
    be generalizable to other irrigation systems or different rice varieties.
  main_objective: To evaluate the potential of integrating real-time monitoring and
    remote control devices into existing flood irrigation practices in rice farming.
  relevance_evaluation: The study is relevant to the review because it directly addresses
    the issue of automating irrigation systems for real-time management of water resources
    in rice cultivation. The authors propose a centralized control approach that integrates
    real-time monitoring and remote control of gates to improve water use efficiency
    and reduce the labor required for irrigation management. This aligns with the
    review's goal of evaluating the current state and future potential of automated
    irrigation management systems, particularly those that incorporate closed-loop
    control techniques.

  description: In soilless culture, water and nutrients must be frequently and precisely
    applied due to the reduced volume and low water holding capacity of the substrate.
    For this reason, irrigation scheduling is an important and difficult task. The
    use of an irrigation control tray with two electrodes (level sensor) is a simple
    way for controlling irrigation. Irrigation operation is triggered when the water
    level in the tray decreases below a preset level. This is a simple on-off control
    but inflexible because it requires periodic manually calibrations. This work aims
    at developing a more efficient control system for the irrigation management of
    soilless culture. The control system is based on a Proportional Integral Derivative
    (PID) algorithm and it allows for fully automatic operation with a minimum set
    of variables in order to reduce the cost of the equipment. The results obtained
    demonstrate that the PID control algorithm can efficiently be used to control
    irrigation in soilless culture. The calculated average daily leaching fractions
    fit reasonably well to the target values. Nevertheless, some improvements of the
    control algorithm are required to reduce the variability of the calculated leaching
    fractions during the initial stage of crop development.

  key_findings: The PID control algorithm effectively controlled irrigation in soilless
    culture, with calculated average daily leaching fractions closely matching target
    values. However, further improvements are needed to reduce variability in leaching
    fractions during the initial crop development stage.
  limitations: The study is limited to the implementation of a PID control algorithm
    in a specific soilless culture setup, and its findings may not be directly generalizable
    to all automated irrigation systems.
  main_objective: To develop and evaluate a PID control algorithm for automatic irrigation
    scheduling in soilless culture, optimizing water use efficiency and reducing manual
    intervention.
  relevance_evaluation: This paper is **exceptionally relevant** to the point of focus
    within the literature review on implementing feedback loops for closed-loop control
    in automated irrigation systems. The study directly addresses the use of a PID
    control algorithm for automatic irrigation scheduling, providing valuable insights
    into the design and implementation of such systems. The paper's findings on the
    efficiency and effectiveness of the PID algorithm for controlling irrigation in
    soilless culture are highly pertinent to the review's aim of evaluating strategies
    for ensuring system reliability and optimizing irrigation performance.

  description: The productivity and financial success of large-scale arable farming
    operations depends highly on how effectively resources are distributed among fields.
    Therefore, it is of interest to develop methods to determine (near optimal) resource
    inputs. In this paper we focus on computing the optimal irrigation policy for
    large-scale arable farming operations, where the number of irrigation machinery
    is much smaller than the number of fields that require irrigation inputs. We propose
    a model predictive control (MPC) framework that simultaneously computes the optimal
    division of irrigation over the fields and which irrigation machines should be
    allocated to which fields, such that the profit at the end of the season is maximized.
    The fact that the optimization of irrigation and allocation of irrigation machinery
    is done simultaneously makes our approach vastly different from strategies available
    in the literature. Another important novelty of our work is that we link short-Term
    effects of crop growth to long-Term effects on profit. The proposed framework
    has reasonable computation times when optimizing on a daily basis over many fields
    and irrigation machines and guarantees a feasible solution. The main principles
    of our approach are more widely applicable. Using simulations we demonstrate the
    robustness of the scheme with respect to changes in weather and benchmark it with
    respect to a heuristic approach.

    IEEE Conference Location: Bucharest, Romania SECTION I. Introduction Irrigation
    quality is a crop performance indicator, its influence being realized both directly
    and indirectly. If we refer to the high quantity of water that crops need, we
    see it as a direct influence factor, as soon as its indirectly role could be seen
    in the influence on the other nutrients availability and on the timing of cultural
    operations. Irrigation requirements are very different from a region to another,
    thus energy efficiency and economic use of water resources depend on a function
    of soil and crop type, climate and moisture [20]. Many factors influence the potential
    water-use efficiency. The meaning of the word potential refers to the maximum
    water-use efficiency that can be achieved when the system is operated properly.
    Global temperature has increased with 0.2-0.3 [ºC] in the last 30 years. The growing
    season in viticulture is very influenced by high or low temperatures. [17] has
    shown that for a 1, 2 or 3 [ºC] rise of temperature, it will also be a crop water
    demand increase with 11%, 19% and even 29%. This paper presents an energy efficient
    proposed system for irrigation management in vineyards. To understand the system
    structure, section II presents the monitored parameters with a huge influence
    on crop productivity. Section III show the main advanced control methods currently
    used in irrigation management, due to the necessity of an advanced irrigation
    system able to manage the installation and receive alerts. The integrated automation
    and telemetry solution for irrigation management in precision agriculture considering
    criteria to energy efficiency and economics, along with the latest control technologies
    is proposed in section IV. SECTION II. Monitored Parameters in Irrigation Management
    Precision of measurements is of high importance in vineyards productivity, modern
    techniques frequently used is focused on the optimization of the oenological potential
    that vineyards have. Precision viticulture is characterized by a crop that is
    dependent of a specific region climate and soil type. This dependence expresses
    the weather influence in vineyards and some of the arguments that support this
    idea are: Daily temperature trend has a huge influence on the grape quality and,
    consequently, on wine [15]; Bunch temperature offers an information related to
    the phenolic compounds maturation [16]; Solar radiation has an impact on phenolic
    compound biosynthesis [18]. A. Air Moisture and Temperature Crop is certainly
    a function of temperature if water is available for optimum satisfaction [1].
    Temperature has a great influence on seeds germination. Due to the biochemical
    processes, the germination phases that include hydration and enzyme activation,
    its degradation and embryo growth are temperature dependent. Validated arguments
    that show the necessity of temperature monitoring are: From 5 to 37 [ºC], the
    rate of photosynthesis is doubled at every 10 [ºC] increase in temperature; The
    respiration rate becomes double at each 10 °C above the optimum temperature; The
    minimum threshold is the temperature below which no growth is possible. Relative
    humidity offers an information regarding the water vapor that is in the air, this
    parameter being in a strong dependence with temperature. Dew point temperature
    explains this dependence, because temperature goes down when the relative humidity
    increases and if the temperature gets cold enough, the air gets to the point in
    which it holds the highest quantity of water vapors. Due to these arguments, air
    moisture and temperature must be monitored in an irrigation management system.
    B. Soil Moisture and Temperature Soil is also very important in irrigation management
    as it is a major source of atmospheric C O 2 and a storage reservoir for carbon
    with soil moisture being a driving force. Some advantages of soil moisture monitoring
    are: The influence in temperature and weather forecasting, due to the fact that
    it has an rise of the evaporation rate that increases the temperature [3]; The
    increasement of the humidity caused by the evaporation rate of the soil moisture
    that increases the dew point; The dependence between temperature and precipitation.
    This is highlighted by the low pressure systems that will condense if air moisture
    is due to the soil moisture evaporation. The result is precipitation occurrence.
    Irrigation management is of high importance in a vineyard. In many regions, growers
    apply irrigations when soil moisture is above an established limit (for example
    50%). Soil moisture is also important because it indirectly influences irrigation
    (the water application and movement across the field, assuring the intake rate).
    The application rate depends of sprinkler and low-volume methods such as deep
    and micro-sprinkles that uses mechanical devices as nozzles [5]. Water that is
    lost by evaporation could be saved by an efficient irrigation appliance capable
    of reducing evaporation with 5 to 15 % depending of the frequency that is used.
    Irrigation without soil moisture monitoring is not indicated, due to the fact
    that this parameter has an influence in the balance between canopy size and fruitfulness
    [19]. The main objective of irrigation is to optimize the plant water stress and
    this could be done by an efficient soil moisture monitoring. The readings of soil
    moisture sensor are temperature dependent and field measured resistance needs
    correction when some differences appear between calibration and field measurements.
    Soil temperature monitoring is influenced in an important proportion by solar
    radiation and humidity. It is considered that soil temperature should be measured
    by sensors that have no moving parts and that do not need calibration. C. Evapotranspiration
    A very important parameter for crop growth and health is evapotranspiration. This
    irrigation management variable is computed based on weather information (air temperature
    and humidity, wind speed etc.). Explanation of the interdependence existing among
    evapotranspiration and meteorological data collected from on-site weather stations
    is offered by using Penman-Monteith method [13]. E T 0 = 0.408Δ( R n −G)+γ 900

    View Source SECTION III. Control Strategies for Irrigation Systems Based on the
    monitoring of several parameters, as seen in chapter II, different control strategies
    and methods can be applied for optimization and efficiency of irrigation systems.
    Different approaches can be used for designing the control strategy in drip irrigation
    systems: constant open-loop control, open loop on/off, feedback control, [23].
    A. Classical PID Control Classical control methods such as proportional, integral
    and derivative methods show good results, Fig. 1. Figure 1. Classical control
    system Show All In [21] a discrete PID controller is used to control an open irrigation
    channel. The actuator is the opening gate and the controller provides the signal
    for position of this gate. PID control is used in [22] in a modified manner, with
    a constrained integral function, and the goal is supplying the appropriate amount
    of water to meet the needs of the plant during the diurnal cycle. A diagram of
    the PID control for soil moisture in dripping irrigation system is presented in
    Fig. 2. The controller computes the command signal based on the error between
    the measured soil moisture from the transducer and the reference one. The actuator
    is represented by a control relay that acts on the water supply valve. Considering
    the varying solar radiation levels, the controller can still follow the soil moisture
    reference, which proved this classical method gives good results. Figure 2. Soil
    moisture PID control Show All B. Fuzzy Control Systems Fuzzy control is a strategy
    used for irrigation management considering several controlled parameters: soil
    moisture, water supply, loss minimization etc. The general architecture for fuzzy
    control of soil humidity is presented in [24], Fig. 3. The water supply is assured
    through a reservoir house height acts as actuating variable h . The soil moisture
    error is the difference between measured soil moisture and the reference one.
    The system has a variable reference depending on the stage of growth of the plant.
    Figure 3. Fuzzy control architecture Show All The soil humidity error''s membership
    function assignment, which is of high importance in fuzzy control, is based on
    the rule that the higher sensitivity membership for little error and the fine
    stability membership for larger error. Totally, there were 16 fuzzy rules in this
    system. C. Decision Support Systems In [6], a decision support system (DSS) is
    proposed for water supply prediction and control. This system collects data from
    a specific weather station. Then, collected data and weather predictions from
    three different sources are analyzed and the result is an evapotranspiration prediction
    and an estimation of plant daily development forecast for the next 10 days. A
    water distribution planning solution is proposed in [8] for irrigation in an arid
    district. Optimal water delivery scheduling for irrigation canals is implemented
    through a DSS system. The DSS structure consists of a water demand module, a supply
    module and a planning module, Fig. 4. Figure 4. DSS architecture for water supply
    scheduling, [8] Show All D. Model Predictive Control Model predictive control
    (MPC) approach is common used in industry offering a number of features: is robust
    against uncertainty system constraints can be handled is easy to accomplish tuning
    is used in multivariable control applications In MPC control strategy the future
    evolution control sequence of the system is determined based on system model by
    minimizing a cost function. The cost function is obtained by minimizing the deviation
    from set points over the prediction horizon, Fig. 5. Figure 5. MPC control Show
    All In [25] a Model Predictive Control framework for real-time irrigation scheduling
    is developed. A state space formulation of the water balance model is developed.
    The accuracy of the water balance approach is affected by uncertain measurements,
    such as evapotranspiration and precipitation and constraints such as limited water.
    The soil moisture deficit set-point tracking is accomplished by the MPC controller.
    The MPC controller also incorporates input and output constraints. The controller
    successfully tracks the commanded set-point as well as meets the constraints.
    SECTION IV. Proposed System for Irrigation Control in Vineyards Irrigation control
    strategies should be integrated in complex automation and telemetry systems. There
    are several such systems in the world, adapted on specific crops and weather.
    Two of the implemented irrigation management systems are presented further. The
    Advanced Scientific Irrigation Management application is a complex SCADA systems
    used for optimization irrigation in an arid district in USA, [6]. In order to
    implement the irrigation program, it is used a 6 six days sample code for each
    of the 369 parcels. Then, code is transferred to the SCADA master system which
    controls the 93 RTU stations by radio communications. Irrigation channels are
    controlled by a Decision Support System (DSS), as described in section III. Advantages
    of this system should be summarized as the overcome of water infiltrations, water
    costs, water-supply shortages, some specific irrigation issues. In [7] an implementation
    of an automated irrigation system, installed in Australia is presented. Efficiency
    of the irrigation system can be improved by an information infrastructure including
    sensors, actuators and supervisory control and data acquisition communication
    network. The task of the supervisory control is to ensure that the physical flow
    capacities are not exceeded. An irrigation system model is constructed based on
    the interconnection of the individual pool models. In order to achieve an entire
    irrigation system under closed loop control where water orders are met in real
    time on demand, the research and development effort has focused on controlling
    water quantity and quality in open channels. Due to knowledge and existing technologies
    in the third wave of the information processing, communication and computing,
    a new telemetry system for precision agriculture should be integrated into the
    Cyber-Physical System (CPS) concept. The CPS paradigm has two connotations. On
    the one hand, it solves the issues related to the way in which inquiry is done,
    whereas the second one is a model that underpins all specific states of the components
    of the process [4]. Considering the analysis on the control systems implemented
    over the world and the specific conditions in the Romanian context, an energy
    efficient irrigation system for water supply control in vineyards is proposed,
    Fig. 6. The irrigation management system for the precision agriculture could be
    seen as a MIMO system. The control strategy follows a fuzzy approach and it considers
    soil moisture control and the disturbances can be air temperature and evapotranspiration,
    as it is a plant disease indictor. Thus, the system must be fully interconnected
    and decentralized, being equipped with the following: One or more telemetry stations
    that establish the irrigation necessity. Considering the arguments exposed in
    the 2nd paragraph, it is of highly importance to have sensors for air and soil
    temperature, air and soil humidity and evapotranspiration computation, [26]. With
    these parameters, they could be calculated the precipitations necessity and the
    irrigations efficiency. A SCADA system (a SCADA master and clients) that receives
    all information from process and, using some specific decision algorithms, sends
    commands to actuators. It must be done a software application that collects and
    processes data from sensors and that has the capability of displaying it in a
    logical format. The main characteristics that a SCADA system for irrigation management
    must have are presented in Fig. 7. A RTU (Remote Terminal Unit) that includes
    solar panels and batteries for independent operation is used for acquisition of
    other field parameters and actuators control. The actuators consist of pumps,
    valves and other Figure 6. Proposed irrigation control system Show All Figure
    7. Main characteristics of the SCADA system in irrigation management Show All
    SECTION V. Conclusions Irrigation management systems should be focused on the
    adequate supply of water in order to increase crop productivity. This study focuses
    at first on the main parameters that must be monitored in an irrigation management
    system to discover the advantages and effects of their control. Both soil and
    air moisture and temperature are monitored with specific measurement probes and
    evapotranspiration can be calculated using Penman-Monteith, Priestley-Taylor or
    Makkink method. The control strategies for irrigation systems are classified into
    4 categories, from classical to new trends equipment that operate directly to
    irrigate the vineyards. All these are chosen for energy efficiency of the system,
    but also for efficient water management. in irrigation control: PID control, fuzzy
    control systems, decision support systems for water supply prediction and control
    and model predictive control. The main contribution of the paper is the proposal
    of an irrigation control system for vineyards, from a Cyber-Physical Systems perspective.
    The SCADA architecture allows a CPS approach and the fuzzy control strategy is
    suitable for the Romanian context. Based on the high quality of measurements,
    the system computes the water supply necessity based on a fuzzy controller. The
    communication system based on GSM modules at the field level brigs flexibility
    and ease of use for the telemetry and automation system. The system architecture
    has many other benefits such as low energy consumption, low administration costs
    and forecasting and diagnosis functions. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported

  description: Rapid urbanization and climate change exacerbate water scarcity. Thus,
    irrigation conservation is an important endeavor in food security. Conservation
    efforts have centered on the ability to monitor and manage the amount of water
    in rice fields. In this framework, there have been advances in simple rule-based
    irrigation scheme such as safe alternate wetting and drying (Safe-AWD). Safe-AWD
    provides a robust rule set that mitigates yield reduction due to the decrease
    in irrigation. However, the extent of the adverse effects from induced drought
    stress are often hard to predict across different factor combinations of crop
    variety, environment, and management practices. In this light, the integration
    of crop models offers additional precision in the amount of irrigation for specific
    conditions. Moreover, the availability of crop models allows the use of methods
    in control theory for irrigation management. In particular, Model Predictive Control
    (MPC) is robust and able to handle multi-objective and practical real world constraints.
    Importantly, it has been studied for irrigation set point tracking in water balance
    based models (WB-MPC). Thus to address variable crop response, this work augments
    MPC irrigation with a crop model to track growth trajectories of biomass, leaf
    area index, and grain formation throughout the planting season (CG-MPC). Presented
    are simulations that compare irrigation management techniques - namely traditional
    ponding, Safe-AWD, WB-MPC, and CG-MPC. Based on water savings and yield reduction,
    results show that Safe-AWD has the greatest irrigation conservation while WB-MPC
    and CG-MPC can be designed to have comparable water usage. However, CG-MPC produced
    the best yield reduction and has minimal variance across different field scenario
    simulations. This presents design opportunities for tuning risk trade-offs between

    Funding Agency: SECTION I. INTRODUCTION Agricultural crops rely on some amount
    of water supply to produce profitable yield. However, securing this water supply
    is becoming more difficult with the onset of climate change and rapid urbanization
    [1]. Thus, there have been efforts to develop technologies that reduce water usage
    for agricultural consumption while mitigating the adverse effect on crop yields.
    The application of Internet-of-Things (IoT) in the agricultural crop industry
    aims to improve water efficiency and has gained popularity in recent years [2],
    [3]. The IoT approach utilizes on-site field sensors, off-site environmental sensors,
    or a combination of both to determine precise timings in irrigation. Field sensors
    such as water level sensors, moisture content, and soil water potential have been
    deployed to determine proper irrigation management [4], [5]. Environmental sensors
    that estimate evaporation and crop transpiration or evapotranspiration are also
    used to calculate overall water demand in the field [6], [7]. With the availability
    of these sensor information, crucial decision points on when and how much to irrigate
    can be determined precisely. For this work, we focus on rice for the study of
    irrigation control with sensors as it is considered the most water intensive crop.
    Due to this biological property, the traditional method of achieving the characterized
    optimal rice yield is to maintain ponded water. However, there can be substantial
    water savings using two approaches. One approach is the use of weather forecasts
    in advance control methods such as model predictive control (MPC) [8], [9], [10].
    Another approach is to empirically characterize the physiological mechanisms of
    crop growth in a simple rule based irrigation management technique called alternate
    wetting and drying (AWD) [11]. This study designs crop growth dynamics in an MPC
    framework combining the principles of the two aforementioned water saving approaches.
    There are two main contributions. First, we present crop growth models in an MPC
    framework and numerical relaxations for tractability. Second, we simulate and
    compare the performance of different irrigation management techniques with the
    proposed MPC framework. By integrating crop growth dynamics into the MPC framework,
    our results indicate greater precision in mitigating the adverse effects of reduced
    water consumption across different fields and seasons. A. Crop growth Experimental
    studies on irrigation management have shown that there can be intermittent drying
    periods with small to medium effect on yield production depending on the intensity
    and duration of the drying event [12]. A conservative variant called ’Safe-AWD’
    was developed to take into account crop growth characteristics to minimize yield
    reduction [13]. Safe-AWD in rice allows for water to subside in the field up to
    15cm below the soil surface. Supplemental rules require to suspend AWD and revert
    to ponded irrigation at certain phases in the crop development to minimize crop
    drought stress. This ponding event should be implemented at the beginning of sowing
    and during the middle of panicle formation phase of crop growth. These ponded
    timings are crucial points where the crops growth efforts are focused in creating
    organs for maximal crop yield. There are also points in crop growth where the
    crop gradually become less drought sensitive. This occurs right before flowering
    and a few weeks before grain harvest. There are complex interacting growth dynamics
    as well. For example, the later phases will require slowing down leaf growth to
    prioritize grain growth [14]. These qualitative descriptions of crop growth are
    important to note as they will be useful in validating results of different irrigation
    schemes. While the rules of Safe-AWD capture best practices, the challenge is
    to contextualize crop drought stress and water savings in a mechanistic viewpoint.
    And there have been several works that present rice growth models. These rice
    crop growth models commonly describe systems of equations for leaf, biomass, and
    grain formation [15], [16], [17], [18]. However, they are too complex and often
    reserved for exploratory studies on crop management and not real time control
    such as MPC. In contrast, this work presents crop growth models derived from system
    identification techniques to be used in MPC. B. MPC in Irrigation MPC is a robust
    controller that can accommodate well defined system constraints and multi-objective
    decision making. Using a combination of on-site and off-site sensors, MPC has
    been applied in precision irrigation. But these utilize water balance model that
    only consider water supply and demand in the field [14]. The objective is to track
    a desired amount of water in the soil. The model does not account for the physiological
    effects undergone by the crop under such irrigation decisions. Our work differs
    in this aspect as the use of both crop growth and water balance model allows for
    design trade-offs between water savings and yield reduction. C. Outline Sect.
    II describes crop growth and water balance model to be used in an optimization
    problem for MPC. Sect. III presents our experimental methdology. Next, Sect. IV
    compares the performance of our crop growth MPC (CG-MPC) with water balance based
    MPC (WB-MPC), Safe-AWD benchmarked with traditional ponded irrigation. We conclude
    with Sect. V, which summarizes the impact of the study and future works. SECTION
    II. Models for Irrigation In this section, we present the crop growth model and
    the water balance model. We discuss linear approximations for characteristics
    of growth dynamics. The overall MPC problem is presented as a mixed-integer quadratic
    programming (MIQP). A. Crop Growth Model Crop growth variables leaf area index,
    biomass, and grain yield formation are used to build the model. While crop growth
    is often characterized as a non-linear equation, it can be approximated by piece-wise
    linear dynamic equations separated by growth phases [19]. There are four main
    phases in rice development namely; basic vegetative phase (BVP), photosensitive
    phase (PSP), panicle formation phase (PFP), and grain filling phase (GFP). These
    phases indicate a particular point in crop growth where important organs are developed
    and has significant changes in the growth trajectory of the crop [20]. To standardize
    varying growth rates across different combinations of genetic varieties and environmental
    conditions, a quantitative developmental stage index (DVS) is used. From seedling
    to harvest, DVS values ranges from 0.0 to 2.0. Each phase will switch to the next
    once a certain value of DVS is reached. Then, it is translated back to its equivalent
    in days after seedling emergence. For brevity, we will only mention that DVS index
    is determined using weather data and a set of pre-determined parameters specific
    to a crop variety. This index can be pre-computed in a rice growth simulation
    software. [18] In each variable, the dynamic growth equations have the same model
    structure. The parameters of each dynamic equation differ for each stage k. The
    growth dynamics are described as follows, LA I i+1 BI M i+1 Gr Y i+1 = a k 0 +
    a k 1 ⋅LA I i + a k 2 ⋅BI M i + a k 3 ⋅LA I i ⋅Ra d i + a k 4 ⋅ D i  for k=1,2,3,4
    = b k 0 + b k 1 ⋅LA I i + b k 2 ⋅BI M i + b k 3 ⋅LA I i ⋅Ra d i + b k 4 ⋅ D i  for
    k=1,2,3,4 = c k 0 + c k 1 ⋅LA I i + c k 2 ⋅BI M i + c k 3 ⋅Gr Y i + c k 4 ⋅ D
    i  for k=3,4 (1) (2) (3) View Source where i is time in days. The model parameters
    are a k i , b k i ,and c k i where k = 1, 2, 3, 4 represent BVP, PSP, PFP, and
    GFP respectively. Eq. (1) models Leaf Area Index (LAI) which describes the canopy
    density of the crop. LAI is a dimensionless variable with range 0-10 indicating
    the ratio of leaf area over ground area. Eq. (2) models biomass (BIM) which is
    the weight of plant material per area (Kg/ha). Eq.(3) models grain formation per
    area (GrY , in Kg/ha), the endpoint of which is the overall crop yield. Note that
    (3) is present only when the crop developmental phases are at PFP and GFP. Solar
    radiation (Rad, MJ/hr) is an external variable acquired from the meteorological
    data on the field’s location. The interaction between leaf area index and solar
    radiation (LAI·Rad) relates biomass acquired from photosynthesis by the crop canopy.
    Lastly, D (mm) is water deficit referenced at the soil surface. Parameters a k
    4 , b k 4 , and  c k 4 specifically translate this water deficit to stress in
    the growth equations. B. Water Balance Model The soil water balance equation accounts
    for water that is coming in and out of the field and is dictated by the dynamic
    equation, W i+1 = W i + I i + R i −E T i − P i (4) View Source where W is the
    water level (mm), I is the amount of irrigation applied (mm), R is the amount
    rain (mm), ET is the evapotranspiration (mm), and P is percolation (mm). Here,
    we disregard runoff which is the amount of water spilled over when water level
    exceeds the height of constructed field bund. The scenario is unlikely to happen
    under mild drought conditions and will be further constrained by MPC implementation.
    Negative and positive water level values pertain to water level being below and
    above the soil surface respectively. Percolation and evapotranspiration is determined
    jointly by environmental factors such as air temperature, wind speed, and soil
    type as well as crop physiological conditions. Physiological conditions however
    are difficult to estimate. For example, the plant will inhibit transpiration by
    closing its stomata to preserve water and combat drought stress [21]. Thus, previous
    works on MPC were limited to utilize environmental factors to estimate evapotranspiration
    in water balance models. But in our work, we explicitly relate our crop growth
    model variables LAI and BIM to estimate the combined demand of evapotranspiration
    and percolation by, ETA P i = d k 0 + d k 1 ⋅LA I i + d k 2 ⋅BI M i + d k 3 ⋅LA
    I i ⋅Ra d i + d k 4 ⋅E T ref i + d k 5 ⋅E T ref i ⋅LA I i + d k 6 ⋅E T ref i ⋅BI
    M i + d k 7 ⋅E T ref i ⋅LA I i ⋅Ra d i + d k 8 ⋅ETA P t−1 + d k 9 ⋅ D t−1 fork=1,2,3,4
    (5) View Source where ETAPi is the overall water demand of the crop-soil system,
    ETAref is the reference evapotranspiration which is the evapotranspiration of
    a theoretical plant in stress free condition. Variable ETAref is determined by
    meteorological data and considered as an external variable to the system. Parameter
    d k 0 describe percolation. Parameter d k 1−2 links to direct effects of the states
    LAI and BIM to evapotranspiration. Parameters d k 3−7 denote the interaction effects
    of external environmental variables with crop growth variables. All parameters
    d k 0−9 have different values for each growth phase k. The piece-wise modeling
    of the system allows to capture physiological phenomenon wherein certain phases
    in crop development are more resilient to drought stress from water deficit. Water
    deficit is then translated from water level as, D i ={ 0 W i , , if W i ≥0 if
    W i <0 }. (6) View Source When there is ponding, water deficit should be D = 0.
    This consideration is important as it is assumed that there should be no drought
    stress when the soil is fully saturated. Likewise, this also ensures increasing
    water levels over fully saturated soil does not boost growth. This introduces
    conditional non-linearities in the formulation and can be relaxed using the big-M
    technique, W i ≥M⋅( B i −1) W i <M⋅ B i D i = W i ⋅ B i B={0,1} (7) (8) (9) (10)
    View Source where M is a sufficiently large constant and B is a binary variable.
    C. MPC Formulation The MPC algorithm solves an optimization problem at each time
    step. The problem solves a multi-objective expression, V LAI i V BIM i V GrY i
    V = (LA I i −LA I opt i ) 2 = (BI M i −BI M opt i ) 2 = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ (Gr Y i −Gr Y opt
    i ) 2 0 ,if k=3,4 ,if k=1,2 ⎫ ⎭ ⎬ = ∑ i=1 i=H−1 (λ⋅ I i + γ 1 ⋅ V LAI i + γ 2
    ⋅ V BIM i + γ 3 ⋅ V GrY i ) + v 1 ⋅ V LAI H + v 2 ⋅ V BIM H + v 3 ⋅ V GrY H (11)
    (12) (13) (14) View Source where LAIopt, BIMopt and GrYopt are optimal leaf area
    index, biomass, and yield trajectories. These optimal trajectories can be predetermined
    before optimization by simulating ponded irrigation where there is no drought
    stress. The objective weights λ, γ1−3, υ1−3 pertains to irrigation action, set-point
    tracking, and endpoint tracking. The MPC is formulated as a MIQP due to constraint
    in the water deficit equation, min. subjectto W 1 LA I 1 Gr Y 1 V eqs.1−3(crop
    growth) eqs.4−5(water balance) eqs.7−10(waterdeficit) I – ≤ I i ≤ I ¯ = W t =L
    A ^ I t ,BI M 1 =B I ^ M t =G r ^ Y t ,ifk=3,4 ∀i=1,2,…,H (15) (16) (17) (18)
    View Source where H is the optimization horizon. Irrigation constraints are defined
    by (15) where the lower and upper constraints are I = 0mm and Ī = 100mm respectively.
    The current water level reading from the sensor is constrained to be the initial
    starting point of the optimization in (16). Though there are no real time sensor
    reading of LAI, BIM, and GrY , they are updated by their estimates from the result
    of previous optimization as in (17),(18) and set to typical initial values at
    the beginning of the MPC run. In the sequence of solution for the irrigation variables,
    only the first I1 is used for actual irrigation and the process is repeated until
    harvest. The optimization horizon H shrinks to the days left until harvest when
    the horizon is longer. We summarize the primary limitations of this model. First,
    it is assumed fertilizer application is within standard management. Second, we
    ignore the delaying effect on crop growth due to severe drought stress [21]. This
    means that transitions across developmental phases are mainly driven by the external
    variable in weather temperature. Given sensor measurements and weather forecast,
    the exact timing of model phase switching is determined before solving the optimization
    problem. Lastly, the depth where crop’s roots can reach available water in the
    soil is considered constant. This is a reasonable assumption for rice planting
    practices. Furthermore, this allows (4) to describe a single soil layer which
    reduces model complexity. These are assumed because MPC is designed to operate
    under milder drought conditions. SECTION III. Experimental Simulations Identifying
    model parameters directly from experimental data is challenging, particularly
    for leaf area index and biomass since they require destructive methods such as
    sampling subplots in the field for laboratory analysis. We present our methodology
    to characterize our model and control performance across wet and dry seasons.
    In this section, we numerically solve our MIQP problem for entire planting seasons.
    All calculations were done on a laptop computer with dual core 2.5GHz processor
    and 8GB RAM using python 3.7 with gurobi solver [22]. Simulation time for each
    field scenario is less than a minute. Using ponding irrigation as a benchmark,
    we evaluate the performance of CG-MPC against WB-MPC, and Safe-AWD. A. Parameter
    Estimation The problem of sparse data is circumvented by interpolating experimental
    data with a specialized rice simulation software ORYZA3. The software ORYZA3 generates
    a best fit model from collected data for specific rice varieties. Input data for
    the ORYZA3 simulations are composed of rice variety specific quantitative properties,
    soil properties, and meteorological data. The ORYZA3 simulation produces daily
    data on all the necessary crop variables that can now be used to explore different
    irrigation scenarios. The scenarios generated should provide sufficient excitation
    in finding the parameters of our crop growth model. The International Rice Research
    Institute has a dataset of varieties experimentally calibrated with ORYZA3. The
    rice variety chosen for this study is IR72 and the data can be found in [23].
    For this particular dataset, transplanting was done hence growth trajectories
    would exhibit a drop due to shock on the 12th day. The phenomenon is most evident
    for leaf area index. Simulation starts on the 18th day (DVS=0.2) to discount the
    effect of transplanting shock. The calibrated DVS values corresponding to the
    start of developmental phases BVP, PSP, PFP, and GFP are 0.0, 0.5, 0.9, and 1.5
    respectively. This allows us to pre-determine the specific days for each developmental
    phase k. The average duration of the planting season is 107 days after seedling
    emergence. Note that this parameter estimation process needs to be repeated for
    different calibrated rice variety and soil type, but it needs to be done only
    once. We use the coefficient of determination score (R2) to quantify the performance
    of our model in comparison to 160 randomly generated test scenarios in ORYZA3.
    Crop variables LAI, BIM, and GrY have R2 scores of 0.97, 0.99, and 0.98 respectively.
    For simulating MPC irrigation management, eight scenarios are explored. The scenarios
    are varied combinations of weather and calibrated soil properties from actual
    experimental data. It comprises of six dry and two wet season conditions. It was
    not possible to get continuous data from ORYZA3 to update the MPC simulation at
    each iteration. Our own model was augmented by the model error characterized from
    the parameter estimation process to provide an ad-hoc solution instead. B. Irrigation
    Schemes and Metrics Ponding irrigation management is set at about an upper water
    level threshold of 50mm then allowed to lower at 10mm which it is then irrigated
    50mm/day until upper threshold is reached again. Ponded irrigation is considered
    as the non-drought stress optimal growth trajectory and used as a benchmark for
    water savings and grain yield. The trajectories are pre-determined using ORYZA3.
    Safe-AWD rules are implemented as previously descibed. The water balance based
    MPC (WB-MPC) is formulated using only the water balance equation as dynamic constraints.
    The objective is to track water level 10mm below the soil surface which is a conservative
    target with good water savings relative to ponding. Upon some investigation, longer
    horizons improve MPC solution. However, the horizon length should realistically
    consider the ability to forecast meteorological data. We find a horizon of 28
    days is suitable enough. To focus on the crop variables, we restrict our MPC simulations
    to perfect forecast of meteorological data for this horizon. The objective weights
    of CG-MPC were tuned to prioritize tracking optimal growth trajectories over water
    savings. But it is further tuned to be at least relatively competitive to WB-MPC.
    Total irrigation reduction (%) can be computed using applied irrigation, Ponded−Irrigation
    Ponded ⋅100%. Likewise, grain yield reduction (%) is simlarly computed as, Ponded
    yield−Irrigation yield Ponded yield ⋅100% . The root mean square error (RMSE)
    is used to compare the tracking of optimal growth trajectories of each irrigation
    scheme. SECTION IV. Results and Analysis We first analyze the average behavioral
    results of each irrigation scheme. In Fig. 1, we see that RMSE of CG-MPC has the
    best tracking for all crop variables. The graph of leaf area index shows WB-MPC
    and Safe-AWD deviates from the optimal trajectory. For WB-MPC, it starts to occur
    slightly before PSP. This early deviations in biomass and leaf area subsequently
    affected grain yield in the latter phases. Even a conservative water level tracking
    of -10mm creates adverse effects. It can be remedied by having an elevated water
    set-point at the beginning then switch to an aggressive one later. However, this
    highlights the limitation of WB-MPC. Knowing the right water level set-point for
    different rice varieties and soil properties is not intuitive. It also produced
    highly non-sparse irrigation control which is operationally expensive. For Safe-AWD,
    leaf area index deviation starts to occur in the middle of PSP which corresponds
    to the drying event. Note, it is not always critical to have high leaf area. Recall
    the aforementioned phenomenon of the crop inhibiting leaf growth to minimize transpiration
    during drought stress. At PSP, drying event is beneficial since biomass nutrients
    will be directed towards building grain instead of leaves when heading into PFP.
    Further evidence is given by Safe-AWD having better grain formation RMSE, even
    though the leaf area index RMSE of WB-MPC is lower than Safe-AWD. Safe-AWD has
    lower biomass RMSE than WB-MPC. With enough tracking of optimal biomass, good
    recovery from drought stress is possible. This shows that drought stress should
    generally be avoided during BVP while it can be induced during PSP. Although the
    drying event is comparatively less aggressive, the timing of drying in CG-MPC
    was similar to Safe-AWD. During PSP for example, the crop was generally allowed
    to recover with some irrigation event around DVS=0.6. In the water level recharging
    for PFP, CG-MPC maintains water at the soil surface by an irrigation peak event
    around DVS=0.9, while Safe-AWD injects two peak irrigation events to reach ponding
    threshold and gradually allows it recede. As previously mentioned, the rules developed
    for Safe-AWD were rigorously studied and determined by numerous field experiments
    while the model derived for CG-MPC followed mechanistic principles in crop modeling
    literature. The timing similarity of induced drought of CG-MPC to Safe-AWD validates
    that the crop model presented captured the latent physiological dynamics of rice.
    A summary of the result is shown in Fig. 2. Safe-AWD has an advantage over the
    two MPC schemes as it produces the largest gap in trade-off between irrigation
    and yield as shown in Fig 4. The WB-MPC result produced comparable levels in terms
    of water savings with CG-MPC but with high variance. WB-MPC performed worst in
    terms of yield reduction mitigation due to it being agnostic of crop dynamics
    even with the conservative water level set-point. However, CG-MPC showed virtually
    negligible adverse effects of drying events on yield with very high precision
    across different environmental conditions and still with significantly good controlled
    reductions in irrigation. SECTION V. CONCLUSIONS Simulations of irrigation schemes
    for rice were performed. The result highlights the importance of the timing and
    degree of alternately wetting and drying in rice crop. Though yield reductions
    are relatively small, the wide-scale adoption of Safe-AWD or WB-MPC is often challenged
    with the variability of its yield reduction across specific rice variety, soil
    type, and meteorological interactions. The yield reduction can sometimes be the
    marginal difference in a famer’s income. The integration of mechanistic crop growth
    dynamics in MPC irrigation can now be used to significantly and precisely manage
    the risk of yield reduction with water savings. This demonstrates the potential
    to reliably incorporate irrigation limits or water contracts for future sustainable
    irrigation policies under climate change. Future work needs to explore the following:
    develop non-invasive measurement methods to collect real-time leaf area index
    and biomass estimates, comparison of different calibrated varieties, robustness
    against differing degrees of forecast uncertainty, and implement a schedule constraint
    to minimize abrupt changes in irrigation events caused by daily MPC computation
    in order to ease practical implementation. Fig. 1. Average growth and water trajectories
    of irrigation schemes: Ponding (dotted), CG-MPC (solid line), WB-MPC (dashed),
    Safe-AWD (dotted dash), and Rain (bars). The RMSE was computed across all eight
    scenarios using the Ponding result as baseline. The RMSE for leaf area index are
    the following: 0.21 for CG-MPC, 0.35 for WB-MPC, and 0.46 for Safe-AWD. The RMSE
    for biomass are 189.56 for CG-MPC, 488.49 for WB-MPC, and 387.59 for Safe-AWD.
    The RMSE for grain yield formation are 35.31 for CG-MPC, 244.89 for WB-MPC, and
    101.56 for Safe-AWD. Show All Fig. 2. Effect of Irrigation Scheme on Yield and

  description: In the face of increasing water scarcity and uncertainties of climate
    change, improving crop water use efficiency and productivity, while minimizing
    negative environmental impacts, is becoming crucial to meet the surging global
    food demand. Smart irrigation has a potential of improving water use efficiency
    in precision agriculture especially when efficient irrigation control strategies
    are adopted. Conventionally, irrigation systems rely on heuristic methods to schedule
    irrigation which either leads to over-irrigation or under-irrigation. This influences
    the crop physiological characteristics as well as the water use efficiency. To
    tackle this menace, model-based irrigation management has been overemphasized.
    A closed-loop irrigation control strategy relies on a mathematical model of the
    system for irrigation scheduling decisions. In this study, a data-driven approach
    was used to learn soil moisture dynamics from a drip irrigated tomato in an open
    field agricultural system. A total number of 9674 data samples were collected
    using an ATMOS41 weather station, TERROS 12 soil moisture sensor and a YFS-201
    flow sensor for crop evapotranspiration and precipitation, soil moisture and irrigation
    volumes respectively. Data driven modelling was then performed using the system
    identification toolbox in a MATLAB environment. The model formulation was a multi-input
    single-output (MISO) system with reference evapotranspiration, irrigation and
    rainfall as inputs and soil moisture as the output. Different model structures
    including transfer functions, state space models, polynomial models and ARX models
    were evaluated. Model performance was evaluated using the mean square error (MSE),
    final prediction error (FPE) and estimated fit of the model approaches. Simulation
    results indicate that the soil moisture dynamics model provides a satisfactory
    approximation of the process dynamics with a state space model giving an estimated
    fit of 97.04 %, MSE and FPE of 1.74×10−7 and 1.75×10−7 respectively. This model
    will be used to design a model predictive controller for smart irrigation scheduling
    in open field environmental conditions.

    scarcity at a global scale is increasing, making it perplexing to achieve sustainable
    agricultural production [1], [2], [3]. Agricultural water scarcity is projected
    to increase in more than 80 % of the world''s countries by the year 2050 [4].
    This coupled with the increasing population, climate change impacts and competition
    from other sectors, puts food security at stake [5]. Irrigated agriculture is
    one of the major water users accounting for about 70 % of freshwater withdraws
    [6],[7]. Irrigation accounts for 40 % of the world''s food and fibre production
    and will therefore play a crucial role in feeding the 9.7 billion people by 2050
    [8],[9]. Water withdrawal for irrigation is projected to hit 29000 km3 by 2050
    with most of the high demand in developing countries translating into 20 million
    hectares under irrigation [10]. The need to enhance water use efficiency has never
    been over emphasized throughout the research community and industry as it is presently.
    Enhancing water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture necessitates effective
    use of available water resources to respond to real-time crop irrigation requirements.
    This requires monitoring water use and controlling how the irrigation water is
    applied. The goal of monitoring the crop environment in real-time is to control
    the root zone soil moisture between specific thresholds; field capacity and permanent
    wilting point [11]. On the other hand, irrigation control deals with applying
    what will keep the soil moisture between that threshold at the set time with precision.
    Emerging technologies, such as wireless communications, remote sensing, machine
    learning, crop physiology and soil environment monitoring systems, the Internet
    of Things (IoT) and big data, have expounded the scope of irrigation monitoring
    and control [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. These technologies facilitate the generation
    of large amounts of data which when processed and analyzed can be utilized for
    predictions. This has given rise to the paradigm shift from open loop irrigation
    control to model-based irrigation management [17,18]. In model-based irrigation
    management, data from soil, weather and plant makes an integral part of the predictive
    control strategy to improve crop water use efficiency while minimizing negative
    environmental consequences [19], [20], [21], [22]. Over the years, the soil agro-hydrological
    model has been utilized to depict the soil moisture dynamics in the rootzone [23]
    as a basis for model based irrigation scheduling. The model characterizes the
    hydrological cycle between the soil, the atmosphere, and the crop [24]. Modelling
    soil moisture dynamics is very critical in irrigation automation. Unlike conventional
    irrigation systems that rely on open-loop irrigation strategies, closed-loop irrigation
    control for smart irrigation uses a plant model and the system''s current state
    to predict future irrigation amounts [25], [26], [27]. Nonetheless, these models
    have been developed for controlled environment agricultural systems especially
    in developed countries like USA, China and Australia. About, 95 % of food consumed
    in developing countries is from open field agricultural systems where most of
    the water losses occur. Therefore, developing models on which irrigation scheduling
    decisions can be based in open field agriculture is of significant importance.
    Several researchers have modelled soil moisture dynamics in an attempt to improve
    irrigation scheduling. For example, Saleem et al. [28] and Lozoya et al. [29]
    developed a soil moisture dynamics model for closed-loop irrigation The authors
    assumed negligible precipitation and ignored the crop coefficient in the evapotranspiration
    model. The drawback then becomes its suitability in different agroclimatic zones
    where supplementary irrigation is necessary. Additionally, crops need different
    volumes of water per growth stage. Similarly, Mao et al. [30] used the agro-hydrological
    model to predict the future states of an agricultural system. The authors, however,
    rely on historical data for irrigation scheduling. This means real-time plant
    water needs are dependent on past data instead of real-time soil, weather, and
    plant system parameters. Recently, Abioye et al. [31] developed an Internet of
    Things (IoT) and data-driven modelling to model soil moisture dynamics in a controlled
    environment agricultural system. The authors developed a multi-input single-output
    (MISO) system with evapotranspiration and irrigation volumes as inputs and soil
    moisture as the output. Open field agricultural systems, however, depict a more
    dynamic nature of soil moisture with many factors contributing to changes in soil
    moisture compared to controlled environment agricultural systems. There is considerably
    a small body of studies that modelled soil moisture dynamics in open field agricultural
    systems using data-driven approaches. This is partly attributed to the costly
    monitoring equipment required to provide the data for all the parameters in the
    water balance equation. The major objective of this study is to therefore develop
    a soil moisture dynamics model in an open field agricultural system to aid model-based
    irrigation management for enhancement of water use efficiency in arid and semi-arid
    regions. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area The experiment was conducted
    at the University for Development Studies, Nyankpala campus at WACWISA experimental
    site located at 90 24’ 37” N and 00 58’53” E of the Equator as shown in Fig. 1.
    A drip irrigation experiment was designed on a 20*18m plot under tomato production
    spaced at 0.5m. The drip irrigation system consisted of 20mm HDPE laterals with
    online emitters with a flow rate of 2.1litres per hour. The experimental data
    was collected from September 21st to November 26, 2022, resulting in 9674 data
    sets for developing the soil moisture dynamics model collected in 10-mibute time-steps.

    model describes the soil moisture dynamics in an open field agricultural system.
    The agro-hydrologic balance model states that changes in rootzone soil moisture
    at a particular point in time is due to water inflows including rainfall, capillary
    rise, irrigation less the water outflows, deep percolation, water runoff and evapotranspiration
    as depicted in Fig. 3 [27]. The agro-hydrological model can be mathematically
    expressed as in Eq. (1) [28,32]. (1) Download : Download high-res image (151KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Agro-hydrological system. Where; ,
    , , , , , and In most agricultural fields the lateral water inflow is negligible,
    or the total effect is always zero. Likewise, the capillary rise contribution
    in soils with a deep-water table is zero. The runoff in a well-designed smart
    irrigation system is taken as zero, and thus the change in rootzone soil moisture
    becomes as shown in Eq. (2). (2) 2.2.1. Evapotranspiration The crop evapotranspiration
    then is a product of reference evapotranspiration and the crop coefficient as
    depicted in Eq. (3) [33]. Allen et al. [33] defines the crop evapotranspiration
    under standard conditions, denoted as ETC, as the evapotranspiration from disease-free,
    well-fertilized crops, grown in large fields, under optimum soil water conditions,
    and achieving full production under the given climatic conditions. The FAO Penman
    Monteith model for reference evapotranspiration was adopted for this study. (3)
    Where; ETc is the crop evapotranspiration(mmday−1), ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration(mmday−1)
    and Kc is the crop factor which depends on the growth stage of the plant. (4)
    Where; is Reference evapotranspiration (mmday−1), is the slope vapour pressure
    curve (kPa °C−1), is net radiation at the crop surface (MJm−2day−1), is Soil heat
    flux density (MJm−2day−1), is Psychometric constant (kPa °C−1), is Air temperature
    (°C), is Wind speed (ms−1), is Saturation vapour pressure (kpa), is Actual vapour
    pressure (kpa) An ATMOS 41 weather station was used to monitor the plant environment
    in real-time and the data was sent to a wireless Zentrac data logger and stored
    in the cloud. The automated weather station gives solar radiation, air temperature,
    vapour pressure, vapour pressure deficit, precipitation, and wind speed among
    other parameters. Net radiation at the crop surface Rn, Soil heat flux density
    G, slope vapour pressure curve and psychometric constant were derived from measured
    parameters using procedures described in Allen et al. [33]. Weather data used
    in the calculation of reference evapotranspiration was collected at 10-minute
    intervals and stored on the Zetracloud. Using the FAO Penman Monteith Equation,
    a 10-minute reference evapotranspiration was determined for the 9674 samples.
    2.2.2. Soil Moisture Soil moisture measurements were conducted by using a Terros
    12 volumetric water content sensor from meter group. The sensor was located at
    a depth of 30 cm in order to measure the soil moisture at the effective rootzone
    depth of tomato crop. The crop grows over a sandy loam type of soil with a field
    capacity and permanent wilting point of 24.5 and 12.6, respectively and an infiltration
    rate of 12 l/h. 2.2.3. Irrigation Similarly, in order to estimate the irrigation
    volume, the IoT based flowmeter produces a digital output pulse which has been
    counted by the IoT Expresso board to calculate the water flow rate during irrigation.
    The water flowrate is calibrated in Eq. (5) and flow volume in Eq. (6). (5) (6)
    2.3. Model Structure 2.3.1. Transfer functions For a dynamical system that does
    not change over time, the transfer function provides a useful representation.
    [34]. Inspection or basic algebraic manipulations of the differential equations
    that characterize the systems can yield the transfer function. Even infinite-dimensional
    systems driven by partial differential equations may be understood with the help
    of transfer functions. Experiments on a system can be used to establish its transfer
    function. Eq. 7 depicts the mathematical formulation of a transfer function [35].
    (7) Where are matrices 2.3.2. The Box Jenkins Model The Box Jenkins model uses
    a rational polynomial function to give totally separate parameterization for the
    dynamics and noise. Eqs. 8a and b represent the Box Jenkins model [36]. (8a) Where
    (8b) Water content in volume at time t is denoted by y(t), input variables are
    denoted by u(t), and estimate error is denoted by e(t). A(x), B(x), C(x), D(x),
    and F(x) are the polynomials that determine the model''s output, inputs, and estimate
    errors, respectively. 2.3.3. The State Space Model In statistics, a state-space
    model is a kind of probabilistic graphical model that graphically expresses the
    probabilistic dependency between a latent state variable and an observed measurement.
    [37]. It represents the dynamics of an Nth order system as a first-order differential
    equation in an N-vector, which is called the state [38]. The important attribute
    of the state vector x(t) in the state space formulation is that it entirely specifies
    the system at a time t [39]. Future states are determined solely by the current
    state, x(t), and any inputs, u(t), at time t and beyond. The current state x(t)
    summarizes all previous states and the full input history; it thus encompasses
    all of the system''s memory. Eqs. 9a and 9b can be used to represent state space
    models. (9a) (9b) Where, is the state vector at time n, u is a vector of inputs,
    A is an state transition matrix, B is an input coeffient matrix, is a column vector
    of the output variables , is an matrix of the constant-coefficient that weight
    of state variables and is an m x n matrix of the constant-coefficient weight of
    the system inputs. 2.3.4. The Output Error Model When only white measurement noise
    is affecting the process output, the Output Error model structure is used as represented
    in Eqs. 10a and b [40]. (10a) This model can be expressed as (10b) 2.3.5. The
    Autoregressive with External Input Model (ARX) Model The ARX model is derived
    from Eq. 11 [41]. (11) Where and . These are polynomial matrices; d is the delay
    of the system. The ARX model is therefore simplified using equation 12 as shown.
    (12) 2.3.6. The Autoregressive Moving Average with Extra Input Model This autoregressive
    moving average with external input model (ARMAX) is in broader structure compared
    to the ARX as shown in Eq. 13. (13) Where . This is a polynomial where the noise
    term is explicitly modelled and expressed as shown in Eq. 14. (14) 2.4. System
    Identification in MATLAB Environment System identification toolbox in MATLAB was
    used to model the soil moisture dynamics starting with a lower order, increasing
    and decreasing the order of the polynomial and the variable delay. Fig. 4 shows
    the interface of the system identification toolbox where various model structures
    were used. A total of 9674 samples collected at 600s time steps were used in the
    modelling with 70 % of the data as estimation and 30 % as validation data. Additionally,
    pre-processing of the experimental data was performed to get rid of the trends,
    outliers, and means. as suggested by [42]. Download : Download high-res image

    toolbox. 2.5. Model Evaluation With the help of the lowest order of the system''s
    dynamics, the models constructed inside the MATLAB system identification toolbox
    are able to predict the behaviour of the system''s output and graphically represent
    the relationship between the system''s input and output variables [31]. Best fit,
    final prediction error (FPE), and mean square error (MSE) are three statistical
    measures that may be used to evaluate the efficacy of the developed models [31].
    2.5.1. Final Prediction Error Model quality is quantified by the absolute value
    of the prediction error obtained during validation on an independent data set.
    According to Abdul-Rahim et al. [43] the accuracy of the derived model is dependent
    on how small the FPE is. This is expressed in Eq. 15. (15) Where; Estimation data
    is denoted by N, and the associated prediction errors are represented by e(t),
    a vector of dimensions (n, -1). The estimated parameters are denoted by , while
    the total number of parameters is denoted by d 2.5.2. Mean Square Error The mean
    square error (MSE) is a statistical metric used to evaluate prediction quality
    in the same unit of the variable. The MSE score is near to zero, indicating that
    the model prediction is correct. The MSE is defined by Eq. 16: (16) Where; are
    observed and predicted values at time (i = 1,2,3,…n) and n is the data point.
    2.5.3. Estimated Fit The estimated fit (%) is a measure of the correlation between
    the measured output and the predicted output . This is computed as shown in Eq.

    period. 3.2. Reference evapotranspiration, water content and precipitation The
    soil moisture content at the start of the experiment was 0.34 m3/m3 as depicted
    in Fig. 6. During this time precipitation values were high given that the rainy
    season was coming to an end. As the precipitation reduced, the soil moisture content
    reduced to field capacity where it was being maintained through irrigation. The
    dynamics may be seen altering because of plant water absorption and environmental
    (weather) effects that induce water loss from the soil, resulting in a changing
    variation in the volumetric water content. As evapotranspiration causes water
    loss, the volumetric water content of the soil changes, indicating that more or
    less water is required to be provided for irrigation. As a result, these variables
    have a direct influence on the amount of water applied to the plant. Download

    A graph of ET0, water content, Irrigation and Precipitation during the experimental
    period. 3.3. Statistical Performance of the Models From the system identification
    simulation results in MATLAB presented in Table 1, it is evident that state space
    model performed better than other model structures (Transfer Functions, ARMAX,
    Box Jenkins, ARX and Output Error model). The state space mode yielded an estimated
    fit of 97.04 % being the highest amongst all the model structures evaluated. Additionally,
    in terms of the mean square error and final prediction error, the state space
    model performed better with the least values of the statistical criterion. The
    Output Error model on the other hand performed poorly amongst all the model structures.
    It could not mimic the soil moisture dynamics in the field and hence was not chosen
    for a model predictive controller design. The step ahead prediction results presented
    in Table 2 also support the state space model''s ability to represent the dynamic
    nature of the soil-water agricultural system. With a 5-steo ahead prediction it
    gives an estimated fit of 98.92 % making it the best choice for MPC design. The
    chosen model estimated the parameters as shown in Eqs. 15 and 17 in discrete-time
    state space model. Fig. 7 shows the 5-step ahead prediction of the system. Table

    the step response of the model structures evaluated in the MATLAB environment.
    The model structures are graded using the lowest order of the dynamic response.
    The first-order models'' output was found to be steady, with no overshoot or undershoot
    but a sluggish response time. There is no lag and a faster rising time compared
    to other models, even the Box Jenkins model with an offset. The frequency response
    curve, shown in Fig. 9, reveals that the dynamics of all model structures are
    identical over a wide range of frequencies. The purpose of this data-driven modelling
    was to create the forecasting models integral to creating a model-based controller
    for the physical system. The results show that despite the nonlinearity of the
    inputs, the output is quite steady. Despite experimental validation, the prediction
    model created in this study has some margin of error. Download : Download high-res

    Curve. The step and frequency response of the models can provide valuable information
    for practical agricultural purposes. For example, the step response can help to
    understand how quickly the system responds to changes in input (e.g., irrigation)
    and to identify any delays or oscillations in the response. The frequency response
    can help to identify the natural frequencies of the system and to design controllers
    that can regulate the system at different frequencies. 4. Conclusion Improving
    water use efficiency in precision agriculture is of paramount importance. Model-based
    irrigation management is one of the approaches through which irrigation scheduling
    can be responsive in real time especially for open field agricultural systems.
    This study demonstrates a data-driven approach where data from monitoring sensors
    in a drip irrigated tomato experiment is used to develop a soil moisture dynamics
    model using system identification. The resulting model is a state space model
    for great performance in terms of statistical evaluation criteria. In comparison
    to other model structures, it gives an estimation of fit of 97.04%, mean square
    error of 1.74 × 10−7 and final prediction error of 1.75 × 10−7. Future research
    will involve utilizing the state space model to develop a model predictive controller
    which will later be deployed on a micro-controller in an open field agricultural
    system. Funding Information The Institute de Recherché pour le Development (IRD),

  key_findings: A state space model was developed to represent the dynamics of soil
    moisture in an open field agricultural system. The model has an estimated fit
    of 97.04%, mean square error of 1.74 × 10−7, and final prediction error of 1.75
    × 10−7.
  limitations: The study was limited to a single crop (tomatoes) grown in a specific
    location and under specific environmental conditions. The results may not be generalizable
    to other crops or environments.
  main_objective: To develop a data-driven model for soil moisture dynamics in an
    open field agricultural system to aid model-based irrigation management.
  relevance_evaluation: The study directly informs the point in the literature review
    that discusses the implementation of feedback loops for continuous monitoring
    of system performance and adjustment of irrigation schedules based on real-time
    data using control techniques like proportional-integral-derivative (PID), model
    predictive control (MPC), or fuzzy logic control (FLC). The paper demonstrates
    the development of a state space model that effectively captures the dynamics
    of soil moisture in an open field agricultural system. This model can be integrated
    into a closed-loop irrigation control system to achieve automated and efficient
    irrigation management.

    generally uses large volumes of water compared to municipalities and industry,
    and competition for good quality water is at an all-time high in many regions
    around the world. Thus it is recognized that improved water management practices
    in agriculture can lead to substantial benefits in terms of water availability
    for expanded agricultural activity and for other uses, and can directly address
    many environmental concerns. Intelligent management of open-channel conveyance
    and delivery systems is necessary to achieve higher water savings in irrigated
    agriculture. Nowadays use of control systems in irrigation networks in the world
    for improving efficiency in water distribution and water delivery to users is
    more applicable. The main purpose of a flow canal control system is to optimize
    water delivery based on specific operational objectives related to water levels
    or discharges, or both, which are subject to external perturbations (Mutua and
    Malano, 2001). Whereas the behaviour of each network associated with the crop
    pattern and climate of the region in which network is located is different, hence
    the operation of each network will be specific. Specific operational objectives
    need to design specific control systems for each irrigation system. Because of
    this the design of highly accurate control systems in the presence of significant
    system uncertainty requires the designer to seek a robust control system. A robust
    control system exhibits low sensitivities to unknown demands (disturbances) and
    is stable over a wide range of disturbance variations. Malaterre et al. in 1998
    classified different control algorithms for the regulation of irrigation canals
    based on several criteria. These criteria may include measured variables, operating
    conditions (e.g. predicted withdrawals) and objectives (e.g. hydraulic targets).
    All control systems are in common area in term of using design technique (Malaterre
    et al., 1998). In principle, two main control techniques can be distinguished:
    feedback and feed forward. Sometimes a combination algorithm of both is also used.
    In water system controllers, feedback control is the most important control method.
    This is because the control actions are directly based on the control objective
    that the controlled system has to achieve. This can be seen in the block diagram
    of this controller (Figure 1). Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Feedback
    PI controller The feedback controller uses the deviations, calculated from comparison
    between target and measured water levels, to determine the control action. The
    control action has a correcting influence on the controlled variable (water level),
    which is measured again and compared to the target level, etc. This control loop
    is repeated with a fixed control time step and, in the end, equalizes the measured
    water level to the set-point. The control techniques are used in control system
    structures. Control systems are generally divided into upstream and downstream
    control. In a system operated with upstream control, water is released from the
    intake according to the prediction of water demand in the system, and the adjustment
    of each gate is based on the information upstream from it. Due to the difficulty
    of predicting the actual water demand precisely, water users at the downstream
    end of the system often receive either excessive or insufficient water. However
    with downstream control, water release and demand are better matched, in which
    water is released in response to the actual water withdrawal from the system and
    the adjustment of each gate is based on the information downstream from it. Another
    advantage of this type of control is that users can take water whenever they need
    it. In a system operated with downstream control, a target water level is maintained
    at the downstream end of each pool, immediately on the upstream side of the next
    check structures in the canal. A number of control methods have been proposed
    for maintaining a constant water level at the downstream end of each pool. The
    BIVAL control method (Chevereau and Schwartz-Benezeth, 1987) attempts to maintain
    a constant water level near the middle of each pool. The Electronic Filter Level
    Offset (EL-FLO) control method (Buyalski and Serfozo, 1979) and the approach of
    Zimbelman and Bedworth (1983) determine the adjustment of each gate based on the
    water level measured at the downstream end of each pool. The method proposed by
    Burt (1983) uses several water levels in each pool to take into account the trend
    of the flow. These approaches require extensive simulations to tune the control
    parameters. The effectiveness of the control parameters largely depends on the
    experience of the designer. Balogun et al. (1988), and Reddy et al. (1992) proposed
    a centralized and local control method, respectively, using a linear quadratic
    optimization technique. The control parameters are derived from the initial steady-flow
    condition; hence, further study is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the
    control when the variation of the flow is large. Rodellar et al. (1989) proposed
    a predictive control method based on the Muskingum model, which describes a simplified
    relationship between flow rates at the upstream and downstream ends of the pool.
    This method is quite straightforward. However, the target of the control is flow
    rate rather than water level, which makes it less convenient to apply. An example
    of the designed control method of combined technique is the downstream proportional-integral
    (PI) feedback controller with feed forward control and decouplers for the Narmada
    main canal in India (Montazar et al., 2005). Also, Weyer (2002) proposed a decentralized
    PI control for irrigation systems. The controllers were tested at the Haughton
    main channel in Queensland, Australia. In the present study, two control algorithms
    are designed and evaluated for the Dez main canal in Iran. We applied a linear
    control theory for designing local upstream PI and distant downstream PI with
    first-order low-pass filter (PIF) feedback control with decouplers for the proposed
    canal. MATERIALS AND METHODS Proposed canal The Dez irrigation network is located
    in the south-west of Iran in the north of Khuzestan province. This main canal
    was designed for the conveyance of irrigation water from the Dez river to the
    irrigated areas in the north of Khuzestan province. The Dez irrigation network
    includes three large main canals. This study has focused on the West main canal
    of the Dez irrigation network. Total length of the West main canal is 93 km, of
    which in this study the first 45 km (13 pools) of main canal are considered. The
    West main canal design discharge capacity at the beginning of the canal is 157 m3 s−1.
    There are 14 in-line check structures along the length of this part of the canal.
    All the check structures are radial gates. There are 71 offtake structures and
    15 cross-structures like inverted siphons, culverts and check siphons on the main
    canal. The laterals are used for delivery of water for farmers and other users.
    Figure 2 shows the longitudinal profile of the West main canal of the Dez irrigation
    system. Up to now, the canal is manually controlled. The operators deliver the
    demands of water users according to their requests. As the demands of the water
    users, in terms of flexible delivery, are increasing, there is an urgent need
    to support the operators by automating (parts of) the structure operations3. Figure

    at wileyonlinelibrary.com Model set-up and calibration The model of the West main
    canal of the Dez irrigation network is simulated with SOBEK simulation package.
    SOBEK uses the WL|Delft Hydraulics (2000) implicit finite difference scheme. In
    this study, the hydrodynamic and real-time control modules are used. Real-time
    control is used to adjust the control structures depending on the actual situation.
    The set-up preparation for the SOBEK model involves specifications of canal path,
    cross-sections, layout of the canal network, regulators, upstream and downstream
    boundary conditions. Data on geometry of the canal and hydraulic structures were
    collected from the water authority of Khuzestan province. The geometry of structures
    which is necessary for the model includes type of gate, number and width of gate,
    crest levels and discharge coefficients. Based on real conditions in the Dez main
    canal, the boundary condition at the system source is a constant water level at
    the upstream side of the head gate. For hydraulic calibration of the model presented,
    we used two months of six months'' daily gathered real operation data. The comparisons
    between observed and simulated values were made using the following criteria proposed
    by Jabro et al. (1998): (1) (2) (3) (4) where Si, Mi and M are the simulated,
    measured (observed) and average of measured values, respectively. The maximum
    error (ME) is a measure of the maximum error between any pair of simulated and
    measured values. The lower limit and the best value of ME is zero. The root mean
    square error (RMSE) provides a percentage for the total difference between simulated
    and measured values proportioned against the mean observed values. The lower limit
    for RMSE is zero and indicates a more accurate simulation. The modelling efficiency
    (EF) is a measure for assessing the accuracy of simulations. The maximum value
    for EF is one, which occurs when the simulated values match the measured values
    perfectly. The coefficient of residual mass (CRM) is an indication of the consistent
    errors in the distribution of all simulated values across all measurements with
    no consideration of the order of the measurements. A CRM value of zero denotes
    no bias in the distribution of simulated values with respect to measured values.
    The other important parameter for comparing the estimated and measured values
    is the mean absolute error of estimation: (5) MAE is the mean absolute error of
    estimation, which is better to be close to zero. In the present study on the Dez
    main canal, the constant water level at the source and the real flow hydrographs
    at the downstream end of the canal and each offtake were chosen as upstream and
    downstream boundary conditions. Manning''s roughness coefficient and discharge
    coefficients were used for calibration of the model. Two sets of measured data
    were used for model calibration and validation. These data include measured discharge
    and water surface elevation at various locations along the canal. After the model
    was calibrated and validated, it was used for simulation of other desired conditions
    and design of control algorithms. To calibrate the model, an initial run was made
    with default global values of Manning''s roughness coefficient n and gate discharge
    coefficients. Later these parameters were adjusted manually and the model was
    rerun. Based on the comparison, the model parameters were adjusted. This process
    was continued until the observed and simulated values were in close agreement.
    To validate the calibrated model, the second set of discharges and water levels
    along this canal (four months of six months'' daily gathered real operation data)
    was used. If the observed and simulated values were still in close agreement without
    any changes in model calibration parameters, it could be concluded that the model
    was valid for the intended purpose. Designing control algorithms Proportional
    integral controllers (PI controllers) are the simplest and most widespread controllers;
    see Litrico et al. (2006), Montazar et al. (2005) and van Overloop (2005) for
    an overview. The calculated control action is proportional to the magnitude of
    the output water level error (with a factor Kp), proportional to the magnitude
    of the integral of the output error (with a factor Ki). In continuous time, this
    is represented by (6) where u = control action, e = error, Kp = proportional gain
    factor and Ki = integral gain factor. The controller parameters can be changed
    to improve the settling time, to reduce the maximum error or to minimize a given
    performance criterion. A filter can be necessary to control a canal which is influenced
    by resonance behaviour. In the proposed control algorithm, we added first-order
    low-pass filter thorough the designed controllers to remove the resonance waves
    which play a dominant role in water movements. Hence a PIF controller is a PI
    controller applied in series with a first-order low-pass filter. Besides the proportional
    and integral gain factor, a filter constant also has to be determined, which is
    used to filter out the effect of resonance waves on the measured water level.
    In an open canal system with different pools like the Dez irrigation system under
    distant downstream control, a control action not only influences the downstream
    water level but also has a direct unintended effect on the water level just upstream
    of the control structure. When the series of canal pools is controlled by a centralized
    controller, this effect can be taken into account. We consider this effect by
    adding decouplers to the controller structure. Figure 4 shows the scheme of the
    proposed controller. The control actions as output are calculated based on the
    magnitude of the water level deviation which is as input to the controller. The
    calculated value is added to the upstream gate directly to make a centralized
    controller. In the case of distant downstream feedback control, the water level
    at the downstream side of a reach is controlled by adjusting the gate at the upstream
    end of the reach, in reaction to deviation from the set-point. This type of control
    is called demand driven, because a drop in the downstream water level will cause
    the gate upstream to open and thus restore the water level, not taking into account
    the available water in the upstream reach. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Block diagram of local upstream PI feedback control. This figure is available
    in colour online at wileyonlinelibrary.com Figure 5 shows the scheme of proposed
    local upstream control for the Dez irrigation system. In a system operated with
    upstream control (most applied operation in irrigation systems) water is delivered
    to the users based on the prediction of demand in the system. Because of the difficulty
    of predicting the actual water demand precisely, upstream control has problems
    at the downstream end of system where the users receive more or less water than
    they need. This problem can be partly solved by applying automated local upstream
    control. Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Offtake flow changes schedule
    In the present study, four robust control systems for the Dez main canal are programmed
    in MATLAB. Evaluation of the proposed controllers was done based on the real offtake
    schedule of two months. The data are gathered from the site for two months of
    2006 from 21 March to 21 May. Based on the Dez irrigation system behaviour, the
    offtake schedule during the first month of simulation is variable. The controllers
    maintain the water level at target level (set- point) at the downstream end of
    the canal pools. Due to scheduled variation of offtake for operational purposes,
    the set-point deviations take place at the end of each pool. The distant downstream
    PIF controller calculates a desired flow change for the check structures on the
    upstream side of the canal pools on the basis of the magnitude of water level
    deviation in the downside of check structures which occurs due to schedule variation
    and controller gains. But the local upstream PIF controller calculates a desired
    flow change for check structures on the downstream side of canal pools to control
    the water level at the upstream side of check structures. The check structure
    flow controller adjusts the gate setting to provide the desired flow using the
    formula of the structure''s depth–discharge relation. The parameters of the PIF
    controllers are tuned according to the tuning rules for open channels (Schuurmans,
    1997). The decouplers on the distant downstream PIF controller pass the desired
    flow to the next check structure upstream in order to decouple the upstream pool
    from the disturbance caused by the control action. We used the proposed multiple-model
    optimization of PI controllers on canals by Overloop et al. (2005) to tune the
    local upstream FB control. In this technique, a linear controller is tuned in
    such a way that it stabilizes all models (for all sets of flows) and optimizes
    an objective function that is a sum of individual objective functions, each valid
    for one of the models from the set. By applying a multiple model optimization
    that minimizes the water-level deviations from the target level in all pools,
    the tuning of decentralized PIF controllers on canals may be done in one design
    step, without an extensive trial-and-error procedure. The tuning rules provide
    parameters for PI control, valid for various ID model parameters corresponding
    to different flow regimes. Table I shows the PI parameters for the controllers.

    Performance indicators In order to assess the performance of the controllers and
    to have a quantitative comparison, the performance indicators are computed for
    each controller. Clemmens et al. (1998) presented several performance indicators
    to judge the overall effectiveness of controllers. Calculated indicators for controlled
    variables are: the maximum absolute error (MAE), the integral of absolute magnitude
    of error (IAE) and the steady state error (STE). These indicators are defined
    as (7) where yt is computed water depth from model at time (t) and ysetpoint is
    target water depth at the end of each pool. The integral of absolute magnitude
    of error is (8) where Δt regulation time step and T is time period for simulation
    and STE is (9) where t0 is 2 h. These indicators are calculated for controllers
    for each pool in the Dez irrigation system in the same period of simulation. The
    steady state error indicates the ability of the controller in damping perturbations
    which occur in pools due to the operation of check structures. To calculate this
    index for each pool the last 2 h of simulation are considered. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
    Table II shows the statistical parameters used for model calibration and validation.
    High values of EF and low values of ME, MAE, CRM and RMSE show that the model
    was calibrated accurately and is valid for the simulations. Table II. Statistical

    MAE (%) 1.589 0.894 There are 70 offtakes on the West main canal. Figure 5 presents
    the discharge schedule of six offtakes on the Dez canal. The offtakes of W2 and
    W1L13 have the highest and lowest discharge and flow change values, respectively.
    Daily operation of the Dez canal to deliver the water demand for users is accomplished
    during the cropping period. The real gathered offtake schedule is programmed to
    simulate a real flow delivery by the controller. Figures 6 and 7 show the discharge
    of check structures for distant downstream FB control and local upstream FB control,
    respectively. As can be seen in the figures, offtake W2 which has the highest
    change in flow has more effect on the discharge of check structures. The discharge
    of check structures is similar to discharge variation of W2, which controller
    tried to deliver the demands of offtake schedule more sufficient. Figure 6 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Discharge of check structures for remote downstream
    FB control (first month of simulation) Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Discharge of check structures for local upstream FB control (first month of simulation)
    The water level on the upstream side of check structures for controllers is presented
    in Figures 8 and 9. The figures clearly show that both controllers try to achieve
    the desired water levels as quickly as possible. The desired flow rates of offtakes
    can be provided when the desired water level in the canal is achieved sufficiently.
    Based on the operational behaviour of the Dez canal, the offtake flow for the
    simulated month has more changes. The discharge of W2 changes from 43 to 1.7 m3 s−1.
    This flow change in offtake schedule caused a large disturbance on the upstream
    side of check structure D2. It can be seen that local upstream control has more
    influence on both upstream and downstream pools since in this controller the interactions
    between the pools are not taken into account. The water level on the upstream
    side of check structures, for distant downstream feedback control with decouplers
    (Figure 9), has a smooth change in water level. The effect of decoupling can be
    clearly seen in this figure. By visual comparison of these controllers, it is
    apparent that distant downstream feedback control with decouplers is more effective
    than local upstream control and on the other hand it is a robust controller. But
    from the implementation viewpoint this controller has more costs since because
    of using decouplers between the pools it will need transmission lines or wireless
    connection devices along the canal. Local upstream control is the automated form
    of the current operation in the Dez irrigation system. It can be mentioned that
    this controller also has more benefits in relation to manual operation. Figure

    Water levels on the upstream side of check structures for local upstream feedback
    control. Table III presents the calculated performance indicators for the designed
    controllers. These values demonstrate that the controllers result in a robust
    control system which during the worst scenario of simulation could control the
    water level at the set-point with relatively small deviation from the desired
    set-point. The quantitative comparison based on the calculated indicators also
    shows that distant downstream FB control with decouplers is an effective control
    method for this canal. For pool no. 4 the value of MAE and IAE for both control
    methods is a maximum value. Due to the branching large offtake from this pool,
    significantly greater oscillations occur in water levels which cause the increase
    in these indicators. The STE index is calculated for the last remaining 2 h of
    simulation for each pool. This index presents the ability of controllers to bring
    the controlled variables back to the set-point fast and without constantly overshooting.
    These values show that both controllers could bring the water level to the set-point.
    The average value of MAE, IAE and STE for distant downstream FB control is 0.071,
    0.003 and 0.001, respectively, while these indicators for local upstream FB control
    are 0.229, 0.016 and 0.005, respectively. Table III. Performance indicators for

    should be considered as an option, either as the main control system or as the
    backup system. Successful implementation of water-level controllers with these
    structures using local PI controllers depends greatly on the tuning of the control
    parameters. The results of designing and tuning of these controllers show that
    the proposed controllers have significant potential to closely match the discharge
    at the downstream check structures with those ordered by water users while maintaining
    the water level throughout the length of the canal. Comparison of performance
    indicators shows that the distant downstream FB control as a centralized control
    with decouplers is a satisfactory controller for the Dez main canal. Moreover,
    according to the canal dimensions and its design capacity, it is suggested that
    a centralized controller can provide high performance, and control performance
    is improved if a more centralized controller is used rather than individual local
    controllers. So it is strongly recommended to policy makers to implement distant
    downstream FB control with decouplers as a control system in this canal. REFERENCES

    controlPrecision irrigationSystem identification 1. Introduction The current and
    future generations face significant challenges in ensuring that nutritious food
    is sustainably produced from limited land and water resources. The FAO''s food
    and agriculture report of 2020 posits that 40% of the world population are inhabitants
    of water-scarce agricultural areas; of these, 37% inhabit agricultural zones with
    severe water scarcity [27,51]. Coupled with the rising population indices, meeting
    the food demand by 2050 will need a 70% increase in food production [28]. In addition
    to developing quick maturing and high-yielding plant varieties, scientists need
    to ensure that less water is used to produce more food. It is estimated that about
    70% of the water abstracted for irrigation is lost through conveyance losses and
    poor water allocation methods [76]. This means that a lot of water is presently
    used to produce a unit of food. Improving water use efficiency in irrigation systems
    requires intelligent irrigation monitoring and control systems to ensure that
    no water is wasted and precise water application is achieved [15]. Sustainable
    precision irrigation presents a timely solution to water wastage in irrigated
    agriculture by ensuring that intended irrigation amounts are applied at the right
    time and place. Precision irrigation scheduling is striving to achieve efficient
    water use per plant, in space and time, in the right quantities to compensate
    for losses. This is possible through effective monitoring and optimal control
    strategies, reducing pumping costs. Over the years, there has been a paradigm
    shift from traditional irrigation methods to smart irrigation systems. This has
    somewhat improved the water use efficiency by reducing conveyance losses. However,
    irrigation control is still a challenge due to the complex nature of agricultural
    systems. For example, most irrigation systems are designed based on historical
    climatic data, and irrigation schedules are developed based on this data. Precision
    agriculture has been facilitated by the tremendous advancement in the agricultural
    Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) through remote sensing
    [32,69]. The controlled monitoring of agricultural systems has enhanced the sapience
    of the changing dynamics of the water, plant and soil environment throughout the
    cropping season [5]. With advances in Big data analytics, more agricultural systems
    are becoming data-driven for decision-making purposes rather than relying on heuristic
    physics-based models [68]. Sustainable irrigation necessitates the adoption of
    irrigation control strategies that precisely direct irrigation water to the plant''s
    root zone. Boman et al. [11] observed improved water, energy, and fertilizer use
    efficiency when precision irrigation control strategies are implemented. Precision
    irrigation control strategies are divided into two, namely, closed-loop systems
    and open-loop systems. Whereas open-loop systems apply a preset action like in
    simple irrigation timers, closed-loop systems receive feedback from sensors, make
    decisions and implement the resulting findings in the irrigation system [15].
    Several authors have reviewed and classified closed-loop irrigation control strategies
    into three, namely, linear control, intelligent control and optimal control [4,15,23].
    Model predictive control has evolved over the past four decades with advances
    in real-time data measurements and an increase in computational power. Model Predictive
    Control (MPC) refers to a category of advanced computer-controlled algorithms
    that use an explicit process model to predict a plant''s future response [23].
    Developed in the 1960s, Model Predictive Control emanates from optimal control.
    The basic principle of MPC is to use a dynamic model to predict system behavior
    and optimize the prediction to decide the control move at the current time [71].
    In addition to its flexibility, Model predictive control repeatedly solves constrained
    optimal control problems online ([57]b). The ability to handle multivariate processes
    and address state and input constraints has made MPC indispensable in modern manufacturing
    industries [23,56,55,70]. In a control problem, the model predictive controller''s
    goal is to compute the plant input to follow the desired reference [60]. MPC uses
    a plant model to predict future plant output behavior and an optimizer that ensures
    that the predicted plant output tracks the desired reference [15,60] MPC has been
    widely studied and applied in processing industries ([4,23,33]; F. [38,52]; L.
    [78]). However, in the agricultural sector, not much has been reported on the
    application of model predictive control in modelling dynamic agricultural systems.
    The most recent review by Ding et al. [23] focused on model predictive control
    applications in agriculture in general. [23] assert that the application of MPC
    to agriculture can yield significant productivity and efficiency benefits despite
    its limited use in the past years. However, no review of data-driven model predictive
    control in precision irrigation applications has been reported. MPC has been applied
    to agriculture, but it has not been applied in all respects. This work builds
    upon existing reviews in the field of agriculture with a particular focus on precision
    irrigation. This review presents an overview of model predictive control in section
    2; data-driven MPC can be done through system identification, machine learning,
    and iterative learning control, as discussed in section 3. Section 4 presents
    the specific application domains of data-driven MPC in irrigation systems. The
    challenges and future perspectives of data-driven MPC are discussed in section
    5. Finally, the conclusion and future research are presented. 2. Overview of model
    predictive control 2.1. Historical perspective of model predictive control The
    concept of model predictive control dates way back in the 1960s to 1970s [66].
    However, MPC found its way into process industries until the 1980s [23]. Since
    then, model predictive control has undergone several stages of development. The
    first stage involves classical model predictive control between 1980 and 1990
    and mainly solves multivariable constraint control problems [52]. As a result
    of the failure to handle nonlinear systems in process industries, improved MPCs
    evolved towards the end of the 20th century giving more computational power with
    an extraordinary ability to handle constraints. This phase saw the continued penetration
    of the commercial MPC algorithms into various industries and a sound theoretical
    foundation for it. In the 1st decade of the 21st century, latest MPC evolved as
    many industries adopted model predictive control [52]. The latest MPC methods
    reduced computation time by decentralizing large-scale problems, reducing computation
    time directly, or simplifying computational processes [23]. The fourth phase has
    seen the evolution of data-driven model predictive control techniques aided by
    machine learning and data science advancements. Table 1 summarizes the different
    types of MPC since 1980. Fig. 1 presents the evolution of model predictive control.

    control. There has been a progression from the past decades in the category of
    systems where model predictive control is applied. Literature has reported a significant
    rise in MPC application in mechanical and electrical systems [52]. Some of the
    application domains include suspension [34], vehicle traction control [12], direct
    injection stratified charge engines [35], Grain drying processes [82], traffic
    management [48], automatic boats for aquaculture [81], modelling temperatures
    in buildings [25], amongst others. This is facilitated by the precedent developments,
    which enable MPC implementation on hardware, making it faster than traditional
    processes. 2.2. Main components of model predictive control The key to effective
    implementation of a control strategy is understanding how model predictive control
    works. Model predictive control has seven essential components (Fig. 2): prediction,
    receding horizon, modelling, performance index, degrees of freedom, constraint
    handling, and multivariable [73]. Download : Download high-res image (461KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Components of Model Predictive Control. Prediction:
    Model predictive control considers the future implication of current control actions
    by computing the predicted behavior over a horizon. Predictions must capture all
    the system''s transient and steady-state behavior [73]. Therefore, the prediction
    horizon dictates how far the future state will be predicted. Receding horizon:
    This is the horizon over which system dynamics are predicted. After defining the
    optimal trajectory of the future state, the actual control input to the plant
    only takes the first sample of the control signal, neglecting the rest of the
    trajectory [78]. Modelling: Prediction of a system''s future state requires a
    plant model. A good dynamic model will give a consistent and accurate prediction
    of the future. A mode of the system shows the dependence of the output on the
    current measured variable and the present/future inputs. Performance index: Performance
    index measures the numerical definition of the best input trajectory. Performance
    indices of a model change with time as the system''s internal model gets better
    over time. Performance indices must therefore be realistic and matched with model
    accuracy. Degree of freedom: Degrees of freedom describe the complexity of input
    trajectories. Brownlee [13] defined degree of freedom as the sum of parameters
    in the model that are determined from data. This is inclusive of the coefficients
    of the model and the data used to calculate the error of the model. Constraint
    handling: Model predictive control embeds constraints into the strategy development.
    The proposed input trajectory is optimal while satisfying constraints. The systematic
    embedding of constraint information is critical to effective and robust closed-loop
    behavior. Multivariable: Almost all dynamic systems have numerous inputs and outputs.
    Model predictive control can handle multi-input-multi-output systems (MIMO) systematically.
    In traditional control like Proportional Integral Derivative (PID), it is complex
    to design MIMO systems because limited data about the plant is used in the model
    design, and interaction becomes cumbersome. On the other hand, model predictive
    control algorithms require a model and thus utilize more data, making it easier
    to handle MIMO systems. 2.3. Theoretical formulation of model predictive control
    A model predictive controller is designed based on the state space equation of
    the process dynamics model as described by Rawlings et al. [71]. A state-space
    model is a probabilistic graphical model that describes probabilistic dependence
    between the latent state variable and the observed measurement [16,20]. Model
    predictive control solves an optimal control problem over a receding horizon,
    subject to system constraints, to determine the next control action ([43], 2018).
    The optimization is iterated at each time step, and the control law is updated
    Fig. 3a . Kaiser et al. [44] formulates a receding horizon control problem as
    an open-loop optimization for every time step with an optimal sequence of control
    inputs u (Fig. 3b ) (1) ≔ Download : Download high-res image (347KB) Download

    a moving horizon window. Adapted from [14]. Over the control horizon given the
    current measurement that minimizes a cost over the prediction horizon , where
    is the timestep of the model. The control horizon is less than or equal to the
    prediction horizon such that then the input u is assumed constant after that.
    The first control value is then applied and the optimization is reinitialized
    and repeated at each subsequent timestep to solve for the unknown sequence . This
    results in an implicit feedback control law. (2) The cost optimization at each
    timestep is described as minimizing a performance index with up to three terms;
    an output penalty, an input penalty, and an input rate penalty; (3) The minimized
    cost function J is subject to constraints on the inputs and outputs; (4) 2.4.
    Data-driven model predictive control Data-driven control systems are broadly classified
    under control systems. The identification of the process model and the design
    of the controller are based entirely on experimental data collected from the plant
    [9]. Learning dynamical systems models from data is a vital challenge in mathematical
    physics, with a rich history dating back as far as the time of Kepler and Newton
    and the discovery of the laws of planetary motion. Initially, modelling of dynamic
    systems relied on a combination of high-quality measurements and expert intuition.
    With vast data and increasing computational power, the automated discovery of
    governing equations and dynamical systems is a new and exciting scientific paradigm.
    Data-driven models require automatic data collection, as they can react in real-time
    to changes in the input variables [31]. The data-driven models’ response can create
    a feedback loop into a larger online system. However, automatic data collection
    is associated with some challenges, and thus, characteristics of big data, namely,
    volume, velocity, variety, value and veracity (5Vs), need to be considered (Fig.
    4). Download : Download high-res image (285KB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 4. The 5Vs of data-driven modelling. 3. System identification System identification
    is a form of machine learning, where an input-output map of a system is learned
    from training data in a representation that generalizes the data that was not
    in the training set [14]. Ljung [53] defined it as the art and science of building
    mathematical models of dynamic systems from observed input-output data. System
    identification is essential where first principles or physics-based modelling
    of the system is not possible. Here, nothing is known about the system dynamics,
    also known as the black-box approach. Data is used to learn a mathematic model
    that mimics the input-output relationship using a model structure that represents
    the system behavior and parameter selection for fitting the data. A better understanding
    of the model is achieved with system identification, and future prediction becomes
    easy. Fig. 5 represents a flowchart for a system identification process Download

    System identification process. System identification can be done for linear systems,
    nonlinear systems and online and recursive systems. 3.1. Nonlinear system identification
    for control Powerful model-based control techniques like linear optimal control
    and model predictive control are aided by data-driven techniques that characterize
    the input-output dynamics from observed measurements without relying on first
    principles modelling. Nonlinear systems identification is made possible due to
    high computing power and powerful data-driven techniques. Once a low order model
    of the input-output dynamics from actuation u to measurements y and a full state
    x of the system is measured, then identification of dynamics f is made possible
    that satisfy (5) This then is discretized since data is collected in time steps
    and control laws are digitally implemented. This state dynamics then becomes.
    (6) 3.2. Online and recursive system identification Online systems identification
    means that the algorithm is running during the operation of the physical system.
    Online system identification algorithms estimate the parameters and states of
    a system model as data is obtained in real-time or near real-time from measuring
    devices [24]. Referring to the agro-hydrologic balance equation, the process dynamics
    of the system can be described as one with three inputs, rainfall, irrigation,
    and crop evapotranspiration and one output, soil moisture, as shown in Fig. 6.
    The process dynamics model assumes that deep percolation in an irrigated agricultural
    system is proportional to soil moisture. Download : Download high-res image (144KB)

    Where; Euler approximation theory is used on the soil moisture variations to create
    a discrete model for the soil moisture. (8) Where is the sampling interval The
    discrete-time dynamics then can be written as, (9) Where; is the crop coefficient
    and varies according to the crop growth stage. A soil model can be developed over
    time by updating the model parameters each time step. For example, the algorithm
    could measure irrigation and compare it with the predicted irrigation amount to
    produce a prediction error. An online algorithm adjusts the model parameters to
    reduce the error. In the next step, a new set of measurements is recorded and
    compared with the model prediction. An error is again obtained and added to the
    old measurements and the process repeats itself. Online system identification
    is crucial where the model parameters are time-variant, especially as is the case
    for the weather parameters in the crop evapotranspiration model. 4. Machine learning
    control Machine learning is a rapidly developing field transforming our ability
    to learn and characterize dynamic systems [14]. Machine learning makes the control
    of complex, nonlinear systems possible because of its high dimensional, nonlinear
    and optimization techniques [26]. For example, given a schematic in Fig. 7 with
    high dimensional dynamics with external disturbances to achieve a high-level objective
    function. Download : Download high-res image (173KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. Schematic of machine learning control. The objective is to design
    a controller based on sensor measurements of the system that can then drive the
    system through actuation. Examples of machine learning methods include genetic
    algorithms, genetic programming, reinforcement learning and adaptive neural networks
    (Fig. 8). These machine learning algorithms use biological principles like neural
    networks, evolutional algorithms, and reinforcement learning. Detailed information

    of machine learning control. 5. Iterative learning control Iterative learning
    control (ILC) is an efficient technique used to improve the performance of transient
    systems that operate repetitively [79]. The aim of ILC is to improve the transient
    response through input adjustment based on observed errors. A standard iterative
    learning control scheme assumes stable dynamics, and the system returns to the
    same initial conditions at the start of each trial of the same length. A schematic
    of data-driven iterative learning control is presented in Fig. 9 [65]. Download

    Iterative learning control process. An Iterative Learning Control takes the form
    (10) Where;  = input to the system during the kth repetition,  = tracking error
    during the kth repetition and  = design parameter representing operations on  .
    There has to be a convergence of the input signals as k becomes large. This will
    ensure perfect tracking through the iteration process. The rate of convergence
    represents the desirable need for a rapid iterative learning process. Despite
    the uncertainty about the process dynamics, good algorithm performance is desirable.
    The operation   ranges from simple scalar gains to sophisticated optimization
    computations and is necessary to achieve design objectives. 5.1. Applications
    of data-driven model predictive control in precision irrigation management Owing
    to the similarity of agricultural processes to industrial processes, model predictive
    control has been applied in product processing, agricultural production, greenhouses
    and irrigation systems [23]. For example, model predictive control has been applied
    in canal flow control and regulation, irrigation scheduling, stem water potential
    regulation, soil moisture regulation and precipitation and evapotranspiration
    prediction. 5.2. Irrigation canal flow control and regulation Model predictive
    control has found applicability to canal flow control and gate operation. The
    management objective of MPC for irrigation canals is to keep the water levels
    as close to the setpoints as possible [45]. Therefore, a suitable model representing
    the canal water level dynamic is needed. Furthermore, the models need to be set
    up in such a way that they contain the appropriate dynamics of the water system
    for water level regulation. In this regard, MPC has been applied to model the
    behavior of the water movement in the open channel, maintaining certain water
    levels at various locations and the water flows that influence these water levels
    [29,30,63,79,80,84]. Control structures are used to manipulate the water flows,
    through which the controller can achieve the management objective [45]. However,
    achieving this objective is not straightforward, as some varying inflows and outflows
    disturb the water system. To predict the future water levels and flows as a result
    of disturbances and control actions, the water system (canal reaches, structures,
    disturbances, controller) needs to be modelled. Fig. 10 depicts a typical irrigation
    canal with water flowing by gravity and different offtakes along the canal reach.

    Several scholars have used model predictive control in controlling irrigation
    canal flows. Puig et al. [70] used model predictive control to generate flow control
    strategies from the water source to the consumer and irrigation areas in the Guadiana
    River. The results showed effectiveness in the use of model predictive control.
    Zhang et al. [83] designed a non-cooperative distributed model predictive control
    algorithm based on Nash optimality for water level regulation in irrigation canals.
    The system simulation results showed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
    To effectively deliver canal flow without fluctuations, Han & Qiao [39]; Hashemy
    et al. [41,40]combined model predictive control with online water storage to compensate
    for an existing time delay and avoid wave disturbances. The results showed significant
    improvement for canal operations employing automation. Recently, Kong et al. [50]
    used model predictive control toolbox to control gate interval and water level.
    The authors tested it on a simulation model of an irrigation canal in Beijing
    consisting of 13 cascaded canal pools. The authors affirmed that model predictive
    control is a useful control strategy for gate opening at different intervals [49].
    6. Irrigation scheduling Irrigation scheduling is the process of determining the
    frequency, duration and quantity of irrigation water to apply to meet the crop
    water requirements [59]. In conventional irrigation systems, irrigation scheduling
    is determined through experience, observation, and heuristic methods. On the other
    hand, precision irrigation systems rely on feedback from sensing devices. Irrigation
    scheduling can be achieved through weather-based, soil-based, or plant-based approaches.
    Precision irrigation systems aim at spatio-temporal irrigation scheduling depending
    on weather, soil, and plant physiological characteristics [3]. Model predictive
    control is used to perform irrigation scheduling using real-time field data to
    calibrate a crop and soil model and then using the calibrated model to determine
    optimum irrigation schedules [61]. Plant and soil real-time measurements are crucial
    to calibrate the model during the growing stages of the crop as irrigation advances.
    Considering the soil moisture balance model, the plant input is the irrigation
    amount, whereas the plant output is the soil moisture deficit. The crop evapotranspiration
    and precipitation values are considered disturbances as they cannot be controlled.
    Delgoda et al. [22], Lozoya et al. [56], and Saleem et al. [74] used model predictive
    control to predict the frequency, duration and quantity of irrigation water using
    a soil moisture dynamics model. The authors used a combined mechanistic and data-driven
    modelling approach to describe the dynamics of the soil-plant-atmosphere system
    using sensing devices for real-time feedback to the control algorithm. However,
    the authors neglected the effect of precipitation and crop water use on the system
    dynamics. Delgoda et al. [21] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above model
    predictive control framework. The authors employed a disturbance affine feedback
    control approach and uncertainty modelling techniques to account for the dynamic
    nature of rainfall and crop water use. Moreover, the study reported optimal system
    performance in a humid region where considerable uncertainties in climate variables
    existed. Recently, Abioye, Abidin, Aman, et al. [2] and Abioye, Abidin, Mahmud,
    et al. [2] used a data-driven model predictive control to schedule irrigation
    in a greenhouse irrigation experiment. The authors used Laguerre functions in
    order to reduce the computation complexity brought about by input constraints.
    6.1. Stem water potential regulation Another important aspect in precision irrigation
    management is the soil water potential. It determines the ease with which plants
    can extract water from the soil. Soil water potential is a measure of the energy
    status of the soil water relative to that of water at a standard reference [59].
    On the other hand, stem water potential (SWP) is the direct measure of water tension
    within the plant [75]. Suter et al. suggested that plant moisture status needs
    to be determined through SWP measurements rather than the soil moisture content.
    Chen et al. [18] developed a stem water potential model using data-driven model
    predictive control to help reduce uncertainty in weather forecast errors. The
    authors formulated a state-space model that captures water dynamics in a plant-root-soil
    system. The water status of the system was modelled by monitoring water flow in
    the soil, root and plant system. Precipitation in the system was the water inflow,
    and evapotranspiration was the driving force in the system. The state-space model
    was linearized to reduce the computation burden caused by robust nonlinear optimization.
    The authors used the formulation of a robust optimal control problem that maintained
    stem water potential within certain limits. The authors reported a 7.9% reduction
    in the water consumption in almond trees using data-driven robust model predictive
    control. 6.2. Soil moisture regulation Irrigation aims to maintain the root zone
    soil moisture between field capacity and the permanent wilting point (Fig. 10).
    When the soil moisture goes above the field capacity, the soil becomes saturated,
    and below the wilting point, the plant experiences water stress and eventually
    dies. Management allowable depletion of 50% is adopted for most irrigation designs
    to ensure that the available moisture does not get depleted before irrigation
    occurs. This available moisture in the root zone depends on the plant''s effective
    root zone. Model predictive control has been used to minimize root zone soil moisture
    and irrigation amounts within a specific threshold or at specific set points [22,55,62].
    However, recent studies argue that a zone needs to be considered rather than a
    reference set point to ensure maximum water extraction from the root zone. The
    aim should be to regulate the soil moisture within the readily available moisture
    zone. Mao et al. [57c] proposed a methodical approach to system identification
    and root zone model predictive control design for soil moisture control of agro-hydrological
    systems. First, the authors simulated the soil water dynamics of the field from
    a mechanistic soil-water balance model. The model consisted of a nonlinear partial
    differential equation with source and sink terms characterizing the root water
    extraction, evaporation and transpiration, precipitation, and irrigation. A linear
    parameter varying model was identified based on the input and output data of the
    soil-water balance model, which was then used for zone model predictive control
    design. The authors report a satisfactory approximation of the soil moisture dynamics
    and the designed zone model predictive control suitability. 6.3. Precipitation
    and evapotranspiration prediction One of the challenges in precision irrigation
    management is the scarcity of climate data. Precision irrigation requires real-time
    data to aid in irrigation decisions. In developed countries, prediction systems
    are used to predict future weather events, and this data is availed to farmers
    for irrigation management decisions. In the absence of such, there is a need to
    bridge the gap using model predictive control to quantity the sources of uncertainty
    in the soil moisture dynamics model. To address this, Guo and You [37] used a
    novel data-driven local precipitation and evapotranspiration prediction by implementing
    an artificial neuro-network (ANN). It was embedded in the model predictive control
    toolbox and updated in real-time to formulate the dynamic uncertainty set to account
    for weather prediction errors in the irrigation control system. The authors reported
    effective control of the root zone soil moisture. A summary of studies conducted
    in the different application domains is presented in Table 2. Table 2. Summary
    of applications of MPC in irrigation. Application Domain Author Irrigation Canal

    and future perspectives of data-driven modelling in smart irrigation Data collection
    that is representative of the real dynamic system is challenging. When more data
    is provided, machine learning can be used in data-driven modelling to fit data
    and make predictions when more data is required. Some of the challenges encountered
    in data collection are discussed in this section. One of the major challenges
    affecting precision irrigation is the high cost of obtaining data in irrigation
    systems. To develop a data-driven model for smart irrigation, data about the soil,
    plant, and environment need to be monitored. Plant sensors need to monitor the
    physiological processes in plant-like crop water use. The different growth stages
    and their effect on the crop factors need to be established. The climatic factors
    that affect the rate of evapotranspiration need to be monitored in real-time,
    otherwise relying on historical data that is not representative of the real system.
    The data collection strategies and control methods are discussed in [4,15]. The
    challenges relating to data availability range from sampling frequency, incomplete
    data, sensor malfunction, working conditions, communication exceptions or database
    shutdown. This can affect the integrity of the experimental dataset collected,
    thereby resulting in poor model development. In addition, developing models from
    data requires capturing a large volume of data to represent the real systems and
    capture any variations. For example, in irrigation, the components of the agro-hydrological
    model vary from time to time. This variation must be captured, which makes the
    data collection process time-consuming. This may involve monitoring the dynamics
    for the entire season or year to get a representative model for the dynamics.
    Predictions are a key feature of data-driven models for irrigation optimization
    and intelligent decision-making. System boundaries define the capability of data-driven
    models. If the data is only a subsection of the field, the model may fail to make
    accurate predictions for an entire irrigation field. Therefore, it is pertinent
    to define the system boundaries and ensure model data development extends to the
    boundaries ensuring that only predictions made from the model boundaries are acted
    upon. The application of model predictive control in irrigation is still limited
    compared to processing industries. Large water and irrigation systems must reduce
    computation times and now incorporate data-driven model predictive control. In
    the future, there''s a need to model soil moisture dynamics in open field agricultural
    systems as past studies stopped at simulation or implemented in a controlled environment
    agricultural system where disturbances to the model are minimized. Model predictive
    control can be applied to diverse aspects of precision agriculture to enhance
    agricultural productivity in the future. These application domains include aquaponics,
    hydroponics, viticulture, controlled environment agriculture, aquaculture, disease
    and pest control, and mechanization systems. 7. Conclusion Data-driven modelling
    in agriculture is on the rise due to the advancement of Internet of Things technologies
    and improved computational power. This article presents an overview of model predictive
    control over the past four decades, and data-driven model predictive control is
    discussed. From the review, model predictive control has been used in precision
    irrigation management, ranging from irrigation canal control, irrigation scheduling,
    stem water potential regulation, soil moisture regulation, and precipitation prediction
    and evapotranspiration. It is noted that for data-driven MPC to solve complex
    dynamic systems in irrigation, the availability of data, variability, boundary
    conditions and model evaluation must be harmonized for one to come up with a good
    representative model of the system. There is more research opportunity to explore
    on the application of data-driven modelling and controller development for predictive
    irrigation management. 8. Author contributions Conceptualization, EB; methodology,

  description: The scarcity of water compared with the abundance of land constitutes
    the main drawback within agricultural production. Besides the improvement of irrigation
    techniques a task of primary importance is solving the problem of intra-seasonal
    irrigation scheduling under limited seasonal water supply. An efficient scheduling
    algorithm has to take into account the crops' response to water stress at different
    stages throughout the growing season. Furthermore, for large-scale planning tools
    compact presentations of the relationship between irrigation practices and grain
    yield, such as crop water production functions, are often used which also rely
    on an optimal scheduling of the considered irrigation systems. In this study,
    two new optimization algorithms for single-crop intraseasonal scheduling of deficit
    irrigation systems are introduced which are able to operate with general crop
    growth simulation models. First, a tailored evolutionary optimization technique
    (EA) searches for optimal schedules over a whole growing season within an open-loop
    optimization framework. Second, a neuro-dynamic programming technique (NDP) is
    used for determining optimal irrigation policy. In this paper, different management
    schemes are considered and crop-yield functions generated with both the EA and
    the NDP optimization algorithms compared. © IWA Publishing 2012.

  explanation: 'The study by Schütze et al. (2012) presents novel simulation-based
    algorithms for optimal open-loop and closed-loop scheduling of deficit irrigation
    systems. They propose two algorithms: an evolutionary optimization technique (EA)
    for open-loop optimization and a neuro-dynamic programming technique (NDP) for
    closed-loop optimization. Both algorithms aim to find optimal irrigation schedules
    that maximize crop yield while considering the crop''s response to water stress
    and the limited availability of water.'
  extract_1: This paper presents novel simulation-based algorithms for optimal scheduling
    of deficit irrigation systems, considering both open-loop and closed-loop approaches.
    The proposed algorithms are able to operate with general crop growth simulation
    models and take into account the crop's response to water stress at different
    stages of the growing season.
  extract_2: The neuro-dynamic programming (NDP) technique is used for determining
    optimal irrigation policy in a closed-loop framework, where feedback from the
    system is used to adjust the irrigation schedule in real-time.

  journal: Journal of Hydroinformatics
  key_findings: The proposed EA and NDP algorithms effectively determine optimal irrigation
    schedules that maximize crop yield under limited water availability. Closed-loop
    scheduling using NDP outperforms open-loop scheduling using EA, demonstrating
    the benefits of incorporating real-time feedback into irrigation management.
  limitations: The study focuses on deficit irrigation systems and may not be directly
    applicable to other types of irrigation systems. The algorithms proposed in the
    study require detailed crop growth simulation models, which may not be available
    for all crops.
  main_objective: To develop and evaluate optimization algorithms for open-loop and
    closed-loop scheduling of deficit irrigation systems.
  relevance_evaluation: This study is highly relevant to the point of implementing
    feedback loops for closed-loop control in automated irrigation systems. It provides
    a detailed description of two optimization algorithms (EA and NDP) that can be
    used to determine optimal irrigation schedules based on real-time data. The study
    demonstrates the effectiveness of these algorithms in improving crop yield compared
    to traditional open-loop scheduling methods.

  description: In the face of limited water resources, better utilization and operation
    of irrigation networks is essential. Use of control systems is considered as one
    of the most assured ways to achieve the aim. In the course of the present study,
    two centralized controllers are applied to the west canal of Aghili irrigation
    district in I. R. Iran. The proposed control algorithms consist of a distant Downstream
    PI Feedback control (DPIF), and a distant Downstream PI Feedback along with Feedforward
    control (DPIFF). In the controllers, each water-level regulator is adjusted as
    based on water levels in all the pools of the canal. The test case canal and flow
    scenarios are simulated using SOBEK. The controllers are evaluated using the simulation
    results. The results indicated that both of the proposed controllers possess the
    considerable needed potential to closely match the discharge (at the cross regulators)
    with those ordered by water users while properly maintaining the water level throughout
    the length of the canals of the irrigation system. It is apparent that the DPIFF
    controller is more effective than DPIF controller in providing a desirable performance.
    Use of these algorithms makes demand oriented water distribution as well as a
    better performance of the system possible. The DPIFF controller as the main control
    system accompanied by a local controller as a backup system can be recommended
    to present an efficient robust control system for the canal.

  description: Automated open- and closed-loop control systems can enhance the performance
    of irrigation delivery systems. This paper examines the response of the canal
    test cases developed by the ASCE task committee on canal automation algorithms
    to a particular anticipatory open-loop control technique, gate stroking. The performance
    of the ideal gate-stroking solution is compared with the performance of an approximate
    gate-stroking schedule that was generated by imposing practical constraints on
    the frequency and magnitude of the gate adjustments. Also analyzed were the performance
    of a nonanticipatory open-loop control scheme and the effect of model parameter
    uncertainties on the effectiveness of the control. For the test cases, the approximate
    gate-stroking schedules performed similarly to the ideal schedules. For two of
    the test cases, delivery performance was similar with and without anticipation,
    but was substantially different for the other two tests. The quality of the control
    degraded as a result of errors in model parameters, particularly in cases with
    incorrect check gate calibrations and submerged gate flows. Results point out
    the importance of combining open- and closed-loop control measures to improve
    the overall effectiveness of the control.

  description: A 2-stage discrete-time linear quadratic reliable control technique
    is applied to the regulation of irrigation canals. The Saint-Venant equations
    of open-channel flow are linearized using the Taylor series and a finite difference
    approximation of the original nonlinear, partial differential equations. The concepts
    of linear optimal control theory are applied to derive a feedback control algorithm
    for constant level control of art irrigation canal. Two-step linear quadratic
    update equations and a sequential gain updating scheme are used to drive a linear
    quadratic reliable formulation. An example problem with a single pool is considered
    for evaluating the performance of the reliable control technique used to design
    an optimal control for irrigation canals. The results from the 2-stage reliable
    control technique are compared to the results from a standard linear quadratic
    regulator (LQR). The 2-stage reliable control formulation provides both good stability
    and performance gain margins in the canal operation. The results of this study
    show that a 2-stage linear quadratic reliable control for irrigation canals offers
    an alternative to the standard optimal control formulation if there is a lack
    of flow depth and flow rate data at some measurement points in the irrigation
    canal. © TÜBITAK.

    Introduction Common variations in soil properties and soil water availability
    over large fields are appropriate for site-specific irrigation management. Development
    of automated site-specific sprinkler irrigation systems allow producers to maximize
    irrigation efficiency, simultaneously minimizing negative effects on their productivity.
    A distributed in-field wireless sensor network (WSN) and a variable-rate irrigation
    controller offer a potential means to support automated closed-loop irrigation
    control, but the seamless integration of the WSN and irrigation controller can
    be challenging. The spatial variability of soils and other characteristics in
    agricultural fields has been addressed in the precision agriculture literature
    (Irmak et al. 2002; Ahmad et al. 1999). However, optimizing configurations for
    site-specific management in each field remains a difficult task. Apparent soil
    electrical conductivity (EC) mapping has been widely used as one way to characterize
    soil variability of agricultural fields (Farahani and Buchleiter 2004; Drummond
    et al. 2000; Jabro et al. 2006). In-field wireless sensing systems and variable-rate
    irrigation systems have also been studied by many researchers (Shock et al. 1999;
    King et al. 2000; Marinda et al. 2003; Wall and King 2004; Perry et al. 2004;
    Kim et al. 2006a). However, few have fully integrated these systems into closed-loop
    wireless irrigation control and monitoring systems. A wireless irrigation control
    system was developed and evaluated for real-time variable-rate irrigation control
    and monitoring (Kim et al. 2006a), and a distributed WSN was designed for in-field
    wireless sensing of soil water conditions (Kim et al. 2007b). The objective of
    this paper is to evaluate the integration of the irrigation control system with
    the in-field WSN for automated closed-loop variable-rate sprinkler irrigation.
    This research is part of a project that was established in early 2004 to develop
    integrated wireless networks of in-field sensing and irrigation control systems
    for real-time irrigation decision support by USDA-ARS, Northern Plains Agricultural
    Research Laboratory near Sidney, Mont. Materials and Methods Site-Specific Field
    Configuration Mapping of soil EC was used to provide a measure of the spatial
    variation of an experimental field so that a minimum number of in-field sensor
    systems could be placed with maximum impact for characterizing the scope of field
    information. The soil EC was used primarily as an indicator of water holding capacity
    as well as soil salinity. The distribution of the in-field sensing stations was
    determined from analysis of these maps (Kim et al. 2005). The apparent soil EC
    was mapped by a soil EC mapping system (3100, Veris Technologies, Salina, Kan.)
    at approximately 2.8 m ∕ s travel speed (a sample per second) using a 2.4 - m
    parallel swathing monitored with geo-referenced points using a differential GPS
    (Ag132, Trimble, Sunnyvale, Calif. with Omnistar correction) on an experimental
    field [Fig. 1(a)]. Geostatistical analysis was performed using geographic information
    system software (ArcGIS ver. 9.1, ESRI, Redlands, Calif.) with a Kriging model
    to interpolate data and create spatial maps with five classifications by a quantile
    method. Fig. 1(b) shows a WSN topology based on soil EC variations from 38.2 to
    128 mS ∕ m with five different zones. One sensing station was placed in each zone,
    and the five station numbers were labeled the same way as soil zone numbers in
    descending order of EC values. The map was converted into a mosaic map [Fig. 1(c)]
    by switching filled-contour to 6 × 15 grid using software (ArcGIS ver. 9.1, ESRI,
    Redlands, Calif.) to match the layout of the irrigation sprinkler banks which
    had total 15 groups of nozzle banks on five spans spaced 15 m ∕ bank and 3 banks/span.
    Four plot strips at the third, fourth, sixth, and ninth rows were used for the
    variable-rate irrigation. The rest of rows were treated as conventional irrigation
    with 100% water application. The 4th row in shade contained all five different
    soil zones and was used for a field test using catch cans. Fig. 1. Site-specific
    field configuration: (a) Veris soil electrical conductivity (EC) mapping system;
    (b) WSN topology of five classified zones based on soil EC map; and (c) mosaic
    map with 6 columns and 15 rows to match the irrigation sprinkler layout, where
    four rows were used for variable-rate irrigation and a shaded area at the fourth
    row was used for a field test using catch cans Wireless Sensor Network A distributed
    WSN was developed for real-time in-field soil sensing. The network consisted of
    five sensing stations and a weather station. Each of the sensing stations contained
    a data logger (CR10, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, Utah), two soil water reflectometers
    (CS616, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, Utah), horizontally one at the 30 cm
    and the other at the 61 - cm soil depth, and a soil temperature sensor (107, Campbell
    Scientific Inc., Logan, Utah) at the 15 - cm soil depth. The weather station measured
    precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction,
    and solar radiation. Sensors at the in-field sensing and weather stations were
    scanned every 10 s , and averaged data were stored and wirelessly transmitted
    every 15 min via a Bluetooth radio transmitter (SD202, Initium Co., Korea) back
    to a base computer. All components at each station are self-powered by a 12 -
    V battery recharged by a solar panel (SX5, Solarex, Sacramento, Calif.). The design
    for power management and wireless communication for the WSN was detailed by Kim
    et al. (2007b). Wireless Variable-Rate Irrigation A self-propelled Valley (Valmont
    Industries, Inc., Valley, Neb.) linear sprinkler irrigation system was used. Site-specific
    operation was controlled by a programmable logic controller (PLC) (S7-226, Siemens
    AG, Germany) located on the cart. The PLC managed the activation of electric over
    pneumatic solenoids to control 30 banks of 5–10 sprinklers each. Variable-rate
    applications were implemented by controlling the on/off times for groups of spray
    nozzles based on information from the site-specific field monitoring obtained
    by the WSN. As the linear sprinkler system moved across the field, a low-cost
    WAAS-enabled global positioning system (GPS) receiver (17-HVS, Garmin International
    Inc., Olathe, Kan.) mounted on the top of the linear cart continuously updated
    the position of the sprinkler nozzles. The GPS receiver was tied directly to the
    PLC controller, and a radio signal of the GPS position was continuously transmitted
    to the computer in a base station over the wireless link. The irrigation application
    depths were adjusted by pulsing sprinkler heads on and off to achieve a target
    depth based on a digital map of depths for each nozzle location as the machine
    moved down the field. Signal interface and software design for the PLC were detailed
    by Kim et al. (2006b). Two types of sprinkler heads were used: midelevation spray
    application (MESA) and low energy precision application (LEPA) (Evans and Iversen
    2005). MESA sprinkler heads were a spinning sprinkler (S3000, Nelson Irrigation
    Corp., Walla Walla, Wash.) with 103 kPa ( 15 psi ) regulators and wetted diameters
    ranging from 6 to 10 m and spaced every 32 m at about 1 m above the ground, where
    as LEPA heads were a bubble spray (Quad-Spray, Senninger Irrigation Corp., Clermont,
    Fla.) with 69 kPa ( 10 psi ) regulators and spaced every 1.2 m along submanifolds
    suspended from the truss rods at about 15 cm above the furrow surface. Nominal
    operating pressure of the pump was about 248 kPa ( 36 psi ). When LEPA sprinklers
    are turned off, the LEPA heads are pulled up by a pneumatic cylinder that is activated
    by the solenoid. Closed-Loop Irrigation Control A closed-loop irrigation control
    system was developed by integrating in-field sensor stations with the irrigation
    control station through a base computer station. Prior to inclusion in the closed-loop
    irrigation control system, each system component was independently tested and
    validated over the entire 2006 growing season. The base station wirelessly communicated
    with both the in-field sensing stations and the irrigation control station in
    real-time mode. It continuously received in-field sensory data to monitor soil
    water conditions. A decision support aid was developed on the base computer that
    determined when to irrigate and how much to apply to each of five classified zones.
    The base station was located about 700 m away from the field. A patch radio antenna
    was mounted on the east side of the rooftop and connected to a Bluetooth radio
    receiver (MSP-102a, Initium Co., Sungnam, Korea) inside the rooftop. The receiver
    was a multi-serial Bluetooth server and wired to a host computer via TCP/IP ethernet.
    A graphical user interface (GUI)-based irrigation software was developed and used
    for closed-loop irrigation control by integrating all input and output components
    of the system. The software allows real-time wireless communication with the PLC
    on the irrigation cart to receive GPS locations of the cart and send control signals
    for all sprinkler nozzle banks every second either automatically or manually after
    processing data for decision making. The software also allows a user to read an
    irrigation map at the beginning of the irrigation operation and save actual amount
    of water applied at each plot with GPS-referenced time and locations during the
    operation (Kim et al. 2007a). Sensor Calibrations The water content reflectometer
    was used to monitor soil water status. The reflectometer measures the volumetric
    water contents by using a time-domain reflectometry (TDR) method based on the
    dielectric constant of the soil (CS616, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, Utah).
    Two probe rods act as wave guides, and the dielectric constant of the soil surrounding
    the rods varies with the amount of water in the soil. The quality of soil moisture
    measurements is also affected by several other factors, such as soil electrical
    conductivity, clay content, and soil compaction, and thus the calibration has
    to be modified locally (Campbell Scientific Inc. 2004). The TDR sensors were calibrated
    with a neutron probe (N-probe) (503D Hydroprobe Moisture Gauge, CPN International,
    Inc., Martinez, Calif.) that measures soil water status (factory calibration)
    at six different soil depths (23, 46, 61,76, 91, and 107 cm ). Both TDR sensors
    and N-probe tubes were installed approximately 50 cm apart and monitored at five
    different locations on the soil EC field map (Fig. 1) during the 2006 growing
    season. A malting-barley (cv. Legacy) crop was planted on April 14 with 67 - kg
    ∕ ha nitrogen (N), 50 - kg ∕ ha phosphorus ( P 2 O 5 ) and 11 - kg ∕ ha potassium
    ( K 2 O ) , and harvested on August 3. The field soil is a Savage silty clay loam
    (fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Argiustolls) with 17% wilting point, 35% field
    water capacity, and 1.34 - g ∕ cm 3 bulk density. Measurements of the N-probe
    were conducted seven times (June 1, June 7, June 19, June 30, July 5, July 13,
    and July 18). Volumetric water contents of the TDR sensor were compared to the
    N-probe (factory calibration) at the 23 - cm (Table 1) 60 - cm soil depths. The
    TDRs were read every 15 min. , whereas the N-probe readings were measured about
    once a week. Data comparisons were made with the TDR readings measured at the
    same times as the N-probe readings. Table 1. Volumetric Water Content of the Time-Domain

    equation was derived from a linear regression of the TDR compared to the N-probe.
    Fig. 2 illustrates volumetric water contents of both sensors at two soil depths
    at Station 1 under malting-barley and indicates a linear regression equation and
    correlation of the TDR and N probe. Linear regression analysis was repeated for
    the other four stations to derive calibration equations. Fig. 2. TDR sensor readings
    compared to the neutron probe readings at two soil depths at Station 1 in 2006.
    Sensors at other four stations repeat the regression analysis. Decision Making
    Irrigation decisions were made based on the closed-loop feedback of soil water
    status with depth from the TDR sensors at all five sensor stations. The calibrated
    TDR response to water supply of rain ( 9.93 cm ) and irrigation ( 6.63 cm ) is
    illustrated in Fig. 3 during the entire growing season of 2006 (May 1–July 27)
    on the malting-barley crop. Each TDR sensor showed a different response range
    from dry to wet soil conditions. For instance, the TDR sensor in 30 cm at Station
    1 has a response range of about 10% (varying from 27 to 37%), whereas the sensor
    in 61 cm has a response range of about 6% (varying from 29 to 35%), as shown in
    Fig. 3. High peaks on June 10 and June 27 were not included in the response range,
    because their readings were outliers caused by excessive amounts of water. Response
    ranges of sensors at the other four stations varied from a minimum of 3% to a
    maximum of 10%. The difference of the sensor’s response range was caused by different
    levels of soil EC, clay, compaction, and imperfect installation. The response
    range of each sensor was assumed to remain from 2006 to 2007 experiment, because
    each sensor was used in the same soil depth at the same soil EC zone over two
    years. A slight response offset is expected, however, if the sensor is reinstalled
    into a different spot even in the same depth and at the same soil EC zone. Fig.
    3. Volumetric water contents of the calibrated TDR sensors in two soil depths
    at Station 1 during the entire growing season of 2006 (May 1–July 27) on malting-barley
    crop The response range of each sensor was monitored during the 2007 experiment
    and adjusted with an offset observed from 2006 data. Fig. 4 illustrates the TDR
    response to water supply of rain ( 9.80 cm ) and irrigation ( 1.37 cm ) for early
    growing season of 2007 (May 1–27). Irrigation on May 18 was applied on all five
    stations at the same rate of 1.37 cm water. The TDR response ranges in 30 and
    61 cm show 4% (varying from 39 to 43%) and 7% (varying from 42 to 49%), respectively.
    As rain amount received for the month of May in 2007 was close to the total rain
    amount of the entire growing season of 2006, field soils were assumed to reach
    to the maximum wet condition, i.e., the upper limit of the response range. Thus,
    the highest reading of each TDR sensor at all five stations during May 2007 was
    selected for the upper limit of the response range and followed by the lower limit’s
    adjustment in order to keep the response range obtained in 2006, as shown in Table
    2. Fig. 4. Volumetric water contents of the calibrated TDR sensors in two soil
    depths at Station 1 during the early growing season of 2007 (May 1–27) on malting-barley

    The decision rule base for variable-rate irrigation was limited by a duty cycle
    of each sprinkler nozzle, i.e., on/off operations in a period of 60 s . For example,
    100% water application turns on the nozzle for a full 60 s , whereas 40% water
    application turns it on only for 24 s , turning it off for the remaining 36 s
    . The manually selected travel speed of the linear move sprinkler system determined
    the maximum application depth. The output of the percentage of nozzle operation
    was determined by the deficit of the current TDR reading from the upper limit
    value of the range of each sensor to apply a percentage of maximum. Because the
    lower limit of the range indicates the driest soil condition, the desired soil
    moisture condition is selected as above the midrange of each sensor. When the
    deficit at any of five stations first reaches its midrange, the irrigation is
    triggered to apply for 100% water application and accompanied with irrigation
    on the rest of zones proportionally applied according to the deficit of their
    sensors. If the deficit falls below the midrange, the irrigation controller sends
    a signal for 100% water, whereas no water is applied if it reaches to the maximum,
    i.e., the wettest soil condition. Experiments and Results The closed-loop irrigation
    control system was implemented and tested on an experimental field at the USDA-ARS-Northern
    Plains Agricultural Research Laboratory in Sidney, Mont. The 1.5 - ha field was
    laid out in 15 strips in the direction of travel. Each strip was planted to malting
    barley. There are a total of 90 plots with the individual plots being 15 m wide
    and 9 m long. Each strip was divided into six plots [Fig. 1(c)]. All plots were
    irrigated with MESA sprinklers and blocked for replication. Four catch cans were
    installed in the middle of each soil zone and aligned between two MESA sprinkler
    heads, spaced 3 m apart, and 0.8 m above the ground. Five sets of catch cans were
    installed across a strip that contained all five soil zones [Fig. 5(a)]. Each
    soil zone was labeled the same way as the station number and located at a plot
    numbered 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 from front to back in Fig. 5(a). The total of 30 sprinkler
    banks were individually controlled by wireless signals transmitted from the base
    computer. Wireless radio signal stability and individual nozzle controllability
    for all 30 sprinkler banks were tested in a manual mode and visually identified
    before irrigation for catch can study. There was about 1 s . time lag in response
    of the PLC from the base computer via Bluetooth wireless communication and additional
    maximum 3 s delay in nozzle activation due to hydraulic power transition. The
    amount of variable-rate irrigation was applied by the percentage of full irrigation
    based on the ratio of the real-time update of TDR volumetric water content to
    its half range ( = max –midpoint) of the sensor response at each soil zone (Table
    3). For instance, 52% of full ( 1 - cm ) irrigation in Zone 2 was calculated by
    subtracting a current TDR reading (44.4%) from the max point (47%) of the response
    range, then divided by its half response range ( 5 % = 47 - 42 % ) in Table 2.
    The experiment was to evaluate how the irrigation sprinklers perform sensor-based
    real-time wireless control throughout the irrigation operation. Fig. 5. Catch
    cans installed across a strip that contained all five soil zones and aligned between
    two MESA sprinkler heads. (a) Four cans were installed at each zone with 3 m apart
    and 0.8 m high. Each soil zone was located at a plot numbered 5, 6, 7, 9, and
    10 from front to back. (b) Catch can 4 was misplaced and affected by a neighboring
    sprinkler. Table 3. Variable-Rate Irrigation Amount Determined by the Feedback

    0.91 0.00 Catch cans data were collected on June 6, 2007. Catch cans at each soil
    zone were aligned from north to south and numbered from 1 to 4, respectively.
    Weather data were recorded at the weather station mounted on the downstream end
    of the lateral. The linear cart moved from plot 5 to plot 10 at less than 1 m
    ∕ min speed for 1 - cm irrigation at average wind speed range of 2.7 – 7.1 km
    ∕ h and average wind direction of 187° (from south). South-neighboring sprinklers
    that were treated as conventional 100% water applications affected water distribution
    by wind drift and resulted in more water in south-side cans than north-side cans
    at all five zones, because the south-neighboring sprinklers (Fig. 1). Especially,
    Catch Can 4 was directly affected by the adjacent sprinkler, as shown in Fig.
    5(b). Thus, data from Catch Can 4 were not included in further calculations. Fig.
    6 shows catch can readings compared to irrigation amount after taking data at
    Catch Can 4. Catch can data were correlated to the amount of variable-rate irrigation
    with 0.96 r 2 value, though catch cans collected average 0.23 cm of more water
    out of 1 - cm irrigation, caused by the wind drift effect. Fig. 6. Catch can readings
    compared to irrigation amount at wind speed of 10 – 15 km ∕ h on June 6, 2007
    when the linear irrigation cart moved from Plots 5–10 Signal multipath of the
    GPS was observed five times when a GPS signal error occurred during the entire
    operation of 82 min from 9:46 to 11:08 a.m. Three errors were caused by signal
    bouncing at a plot boundary: once between Plots 5 and 6, and twice between Plots
    7 and 8. Two errors were signal loss or bouncing out of experimental plots. Each
    occurrence was a single signal bouncing and took only a second to return to a
    correct GPS position. As signal strength of the GPS is affected by atmosphere
    and cloud, this is not unusual. This 1 - s signal change is inactivated in 3 -
    s hydraulic delay and does not affect the irrigation rate. Conclusions An automated
    closed-loop irrigation control system was developed and tested with a self-propelled
    lateral-move sprinkler irrigation system that was set up for site-specific variable-rate
    water applications. Real-time wireless communications were seamlessly interfaced
    between in-field sensing stations, a variable-rate irrigation control station,
    and the base station by using Bluetooth radio technology. An experimental field
    was mapped and configured into five separate control zones based on soil electrical
    conductivity for the distribution of the wireless sensor network. Soil water sensors
    were individually calibrated within each zone with a neutron probe for 30- and
    61 - cm soil depths. Variable-rate irrigation was determined by feedback of soil
    water status from sensor stations. User-friendly software was developed to interface
    the base station with a PLC irrigation controller and wireless in-field sensor
    network for GUI-based real-time irrigation control and monitoring. The software
    tracks GPS locations of the irrigation cart and sends individual control signals
    to the 30 sets of sprinkler nozzle banks every second either automatically or
    manually on request. The irrigation sprinklers successfully followed real-time
    wireless control signals throughout the irrigation operation without interruptions
    in wireless radio communication. Catch can data were highly correlated to the
    water amount applied with r 2 = 0.96 . The benefit of the closed-loop control
    for a site-specific irrigation system with wireless sensor network will extend
    to automation of agrochemical applications. Although While this technology was
    developed on a linear move irrigation system, it was designed to also work with
    center pivots. The next step is to extend this technology to a grower’s field
    for their evaluation and testing. References Ahmad, I. S., Reid, J. F., Noguchi,

  description: Automated control systems in irrigation have in recent years made considerable
    progress, offering a wide range of new options. In this experiment, drip irrigation
    system automatically governed irrigation in accordance with a water level sensing
    system in the mini-pan with the help of evaporation. Data acquisition was performed
    by an electronic circuit, which processed data and then sent the data to the microcontroller
    (Pic16f877). In the system, a closed loop control system based on sensing water
    level in the mini-pan was used to activate irrigation, thereby the system started
    irrigation whenever water level in the mini-pan dropped to the set level. The
    performance of the automated system can be increased as the irrigation timing
    in the software is adjusted according to plant growth stages.

    Water, one of the most valuable resources, is underutilized in irrigated rice
    production. The yield of rice, a staple food across the world, is highly dependent
    on having proper irrigation systems. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) is an
    effective irrigation method mainly used for irrigated rice production. However,
    unattended, manual, small-scale, and discrete implementations cannot achieve the
    maximum benefit of AWD. Automation of large-scale (over 1000 acres) implementation
    of AWD can be carried out using wide-area wireless sensor network (WSN). An automated
    AWD system requires three different WSNs: one for water level and environmental
    monitoring, one for monitoring of the irrigation system, and another for controlling
    the irrigation system. Integration of these three different WSNs requires proper
    dimensioning of the AWD edge elements (sensor and actuator nodes) to reduce the
    deployment cost and make it scalable. Besides field-level monitoring, the integration
    of external control parameters, such as real-time weather forecasts, plant physiological
    data, and input from farmers, can further enhance the performance of the automated
    AWD system. Internet of Things (IoT) can be used to interface the WSNs with external
    data sources. This research focuses on the dimensioning of the AWD system for
    the multilayer WSN integration and the required algorithms for the closed loop
    control of the irrigation system using IoT. Implementation of the AWD for 25,000
    acres is shown as a possible use case. Plastic pipes are proposed as the means
    to transport and control proper distribution of water in the field, which significantly
    helps to reduce conveyance loss. This system utilizes 250 pumps, grouped into

    WSN; smart irrigation 1. Introduction Rice (Oryza sativa) is the second highest
    ranked food staple in the world, feeding one third (2.6 billion) of the population
    (7.8 billion). About 90% [1] of the world’s rice is produced in Asia, and it is
    the fastest growing staple food in Africa and Latin America [2] due to its ease
    of preparation compared to that of corn and wheat. It provides 21% of global human
    energy per capita and is the largest single source of energy [3]. A total of 75%
    of world rice is produced in 92 million hectares of irrigated lowland, and Asia
    occupies 56% of this land [4]. Irrigated rice uses up to 43% of the world’s irrigated
    water, which is two to three times more than other irrigated crops, and thus places
    an excessive demand on water usage compared to other staple crops. Bangladesh,
    an Asian country with a growing population and an increasing demand for rice,
    is playing an important role in rice research. According to the Bangladesh Rice
    Research Institute (BRRI), the main source of irrigation for rice is from ground
    water. However, the ground water is retrieved using shallow tube wells (STW) and
    deep tube wells (DTW), which is resulting in deteriorating ground water levels
    [5]. The production of 1 kg of rice requires 3000–5000 L of water [6], and Boro
    rice, which is generally grown in dry months, predominantly relies upon the groundwater.
    In order to address this situation, the International Rice Research Institute
    (IRRI) developed an irrigation method called alternate wetting and drying (AWD)
    that requires 30% less water than the traditional irrigation method used during
    the growing phase [7]. Studies presented in [8] have shown that, compared to the
    traditional method, AWD requires five fewer irrigation cycles and fewer pumps
    which saves about 40% of fuel. Besides minimizing the use of groundwater, AWD
    reduces irrigation cycles without affecting the yield [9]. Due to intermittent
    flooding in AWD, emission of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) is reduced by 73%
    in the dry season and by 21% in the wet season [10], compared to the continuous
    flooding method. This also decreases arsenic concentration in the shoots of rice
    plants [11]. Unlike other countries adopting AWD, where water is charged based
    on volumetric usage, most of Bangladesh’s irrigation water is charged per hectare,
    without any incentives for the farmers to reduce their water usage. Sharing a
    single pump amongst the farmers often gives rise to conflicts that usually deter
    any collaborative effort [11], which is a key point of AWD. The lack of proper
    knowledge and information sharing are also limiting the adoption of the AWD method.
    Research has shown that there is a significant opportunity for AWD in Southeast
    Asian countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam [12]; however, due to social, economic,
    and technical challenges, the AWD method is not well perceived in these regions
    [13]. Besides the challenges of AWD described above, applying AWD to a wide area
    poses additional challenges, such as monitoring and controlling the complex mechanism,
    before it can become economically feasible. To achieve this, an automated IoT-connected
    wireless sensor network (WSN) is required. WSN is a network of sensors that accumulates
    monitoring data in centrally located storage, such as cloud storage. Most WSNs
    require three different types of network elements including the sensor node (SN),
    the cluster head (CH) and the data sink (DS), also called a base station, as shown
    in Figure 1a. All of the SNs are distributed into multiple, unequal clusters headed
    by a CH that sends sensor data to the DS. Functionally, the clustering process
    and data transfer protocol may vary depending on the nature of the application
    and the distribution of the SNs. Recent applications also require these WSNs to
    be connected with other networks through gateways and to the internet infrastructure
    [14], as shown in Figure 1a. Figure 1. (a) Network elements and functional layers
    of the IoT-connected wireless sensor network (WSN), and (b) Automated AWD-specific
    WSN with IoT connectivity. IoT is the network of various smart devices to facilitate
    information flow to the end-user through the existing internet. The exponential
    growth and distribution of IoT devices are giving rise to numerous innovative
    and real-life applications. COVID-SAFE [15] monitors and predicts the infection
    by monitoring social distancing with the help of wearable IoT devices. Various
    wearable IoT devices are used for human emotion recognition [16] to facilitate
    online communication. The growth of the IoT applications, such as smart health
    using wearable IoT devices and smart cities, results in security threats to the
    network itself. The authors [17] proposed an IoT Botnet Detection using salp swarm
    algorithm (SSA) and ant lion optimization (ALO) models to minimize security threats.
    Authors of [18] proposed an enhanced information-centric networking (ICN) for
    IoT using artificial intelligence (AI) and edge computing in the internet cloud.
    Studies are conducted on the design and fabrication technologies to utilize smart
    IoT devices [19]. The researchers focus on IoT nodes’ accurate and fast localization
    [20]. IoT connected to WSN has been implemented on a limited scale in agriculture
    as reported in [21,22,23,24]. Most WSN- and IoT-based irrigation automation systems
    utilize soil moisture content and other environmental variables to schedule irrigation
    without considering plant growth; however, this is insufficient for automating
    the AWD method and gaining the farmers’ trust. Besides monitoring and controlling
    the pumps, an effective water distribution system through pipes is also required,
    giving rise to the added complexity of having to both monitoring and controlling
    the distribution system. Moreover, present WSN technologies are optimized for
    applications with densely populated SN and small area coverage. Wide-area monitoring
    requires long-range and low-power wireless connectivity [25]. Therefore, wide-area
    AWD automation involves three different WSNs, dedicated for (1) field water-level
    and environmental monitoring; (2) irrigation system monitoring; and (3) irrigation
    system controlling, as shown in Figure 1b. Therefore, densely populated and widely
    distributed sensor and actuator nodes are required for these three different WSNs.
    These three WSNs will be interconnected virtually. Traditional WSN virtualization
    involves multilayer connectivity and control, which increases inter-layer WSN
    traffic [26] for the AWD application. Besides wide-area coverage, automated AWD
    also requires external parameters, such as real-time weather forecast data, plant
    physiological data, and the farmers’ input. These data can be used by connecting
    the WSNs with different servers throughout the IoT network, as shown in Figure
    1b. Literature shows that large-scale irrigation is required to limit water usage
    to provide more water for the growing industrial sectors and increasing urban
    population [27,28]. Large-scale multiple cropping can further limit water usage
    [29] using the automated irrigation framework proposed in this article. Despite
    the inherent advantages of the AWD, both small- and large-scale implementations
    are yet to achieve the expected success for lack of proper adaptation of technologies,
    namely IoT and WSN [30]. Moreover, the large-scale implementation of an irrigation
    system, such as AWD, involves multiple stakeholders and different technologies.
    That may require an effective dimensioning tool for a practical convergent solution.
    The research presented in this article has focused on automation through proper
    technology adoption by providing a mathematical model and addressing all the required
    systems. The proposed mathematical model considers the irrigation system as a
    distributed system. It separates its components into pipe networks, localized
    water control, and clustered pumps with centralized control, thus making the automation
    platform applicable to AWD and non-AWD irrigation systems. The pipe network will
    facilitate both micro- and macro-level irrigation control in a scalable manner.
    The distributed health monitoring of the pipe network and the clustered pumps
    will make the system more fault-tolerant. Various field-level sensors in an IoT-connected
    WSN will help build a long-term database enabling scientific research to study
    the impact of climate change on crop yield [31], physiological changes, greenhouse
    gas emissions for different crops, and the application of various irrigation models.
    The major contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows. (1) Develop
    a dimensioning model for large-scale implementation of AWD using pipes, actuator-based
    water distribution, and clustered pumps. (2) Design WSN architecture combining
    three different functionalities with IoT-based automation for scalability and
    effective control and operation of the overall system. (3) Develop a low-power
    and long-range (LoRa) sensor node and data sink using LoRa, 3G, and WiFi interfaces
    for field monitoring using an IoT network. (4) Sample automation algorithms for
    the closed-loop AWD control using various internal and external parameters that
    can be used in both the WSNs and the IoT connected network. (5) Provision for
    scientific research through the database of long-term sensor data and applying
    Machine Learning (ML) for future wide-area implementation. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews existing literature related to the
    automation of AWD. Section 3 discusses the problem formulation for the automation
    of large scale AWD while Section 4 provides the proposed solution. Section 5 describes
    the system design and integration of WSN with AWD. Section 6 provides a description
    of the related field trial and Section 7 describes the performance of the system.
    Section 8 concludes the paper outlining future plans and work needed on this topic.
    2. Related Work Irrigation automation is not a very recent phenomenon and, as
    a result, is usually performed by adopting existing mathematical models and optimization
    algorithms. These primarily control the irrigation pumps to maximize water utilization.
    Baki et al. [32] have proposed a numerical scheme that utilizes weather forecasts
    and the water flow in soils to determine the optimal irrigation depth on scheduled
    irrigation days for the highest irrigation efficiency and optimum crop yield.
    Shahdany et al. [33] developed a mathematical model to automate canal irrigation
    using both known and unknown water demands for different irrigation systems. Besides
    the model-based optimization approaches, machine learning is also used by [34]
    to predict crop irrigation requirements based on soil parameters. Linker et al.
    [35] proposed a real-time and sub-optimal irrigation scheduling system that utilizes
    weather data alongside the crop’s physiological state and soil water availability.
    However, users need to decide between yield and irrigation performance depending
    on their applications. To achieve better optimization, Munir et al. [36] included
    parameters such as the plant type, watering time, air humidity, light intensity,
    and soil type for their fuzzy logic-based irrigation scheduling system that uses
    low power sensor-nodes. In [37], the authors designed an irrigation controller
    prototype based on the fuzzy rule to inspect water wastage by providing an optimal
    irrigation environment for farming. An artificial neural network (ANN) is used
    by [38] to predict soil moisture changes and to schedule irrigation based on climatic
    information and rooting depth. This ANN method was compared with the established
    water stress (WS) method, which well predicted the soil moisture during the main
    growing season, but was error prone at lower soil moisture levels. ANN and non-linear
    regression (NLR) were used by [39] to find the distances between the emitters
    in order to achieve optimum drip irrigation in the wet areas. Human expertise
    is also used by [40] for their proposed online decision support system (DSS),
    which consists of a meteorological model for weather forecasts, and a computational
    model for soil water balance and irrigation scheduling. It generates an irrigation
    schedule for a week in advance based on the DSS data repository. Irrigation automation
    is further upgraded by utilizing various sensors, wireless links, and internet
    infrastructure due to the increasing availability and decreasing cost of these
    technologies. Water level-based scheduling was proposed by [41] and uses a low-cost
    water level sensor along with inputs from the local farmers through the IoT. In
    [42], the authors present a framework using an IoT-based water distribution and
    management system that utilizes water flow meters, ultrasonic sensors and motors.
    The over-usage of freshwater for flood irrigation is addressed by [43]. The author
    proposed an IoT-based intelligent decision support system to improve the farmer’s
    water utilization by using weather data and sensor data. A complete irrigation
    supervisory control and data acquisition ( SCADA) with WSN was implemented by
    [44] to compare seven different irrigation scheduling algorithms and found that
    soil-based approaches were not adequate in providing sufficient water for the
    plants. Recently, more irrigation research on automated AWD systems is being reported
    in the academic literature. Localized pump automation is achieved by sensing the
    water level lacking remote monitoring or IoT connectivity and using solar panels
    as the power source [45]. An IoT-based system integrates laser sensors for precise
    water level measurement for automation of the AWD technique [46]. The proposed
    system was implemented for different sizes of fields, from 0.7 acres to 55.8 acres.
    Besides these local and remote irrigation automations, performance optimization
    of the WSN platform is also focused on by [47]. They developed a 3D ray-launching
    (3D-RL) deterministic algorithm to characterize the radio channel of LoRa and
    LoRa wide area network (LoRaWAN) in order to provide better connectivity to transmit
    sensor data in obstacle filled scenarios for irrigation automation. Cardoso et
    al. [48] have proposed a narrow band IoT (NB-IoT) and LoRa-based system to monitor
    and schedule irrigation using machine learning. Unlike irrigation automation,
    AWD requires additional parameters such as plant physiological data in order to
    automate the irrigation system. As discussed in the previous paragraph, some irrigation
    automation utilizes weather data or plant physiological information from the farmer;
    however, this platform targeted only a single pump as the irrigation control unit.
    Most of these solutions are offline, of the open-loop type, and do not synthesize
    the data from all of the different sources. They lack wide-area considerations
    and do not focus on the complexity that comes with the integration of multiple
    physical and logical WSNs with the IoT. Proper dimensioning of pipe-based water
    distribution networks, pump clustering, irrigation depth, and plant lifecycle-specific
    schedule mapping is absent. Therefore, any one of them individually or in combination
    may not be suitable for the automation of the AWD method in wide area applications,
    which is highly required for the socio-economic success of the AWD implementation.
    3. Problem Formulation As one of the rice-producing countries of southwest Asia,
    Bangladesh produces three types of rice: Aus, Aman, and Boro. The north-west part
    of Bangladesh produces more than one-third of these three types of rice and 35%
    of Boro rice is produced in the country. Hence, the irrigated lowland of this
    part can be considered for the AWD implementation, as shown in Figure 2. Figure
    2a shows the annual Boro production areas in overall Bangladesh. Figure 2. Boro
    production and illustrative implementation of AWD in Bangladesh; (a) Total Boro
    cultivation (2015–2016), (b) Portion of the medium Boro production zone focused
    for AWD implementation as marked in (a) by the red box, and (c) closer view of
    an IoT-based AWD system. For implementation of the wide area AWD, a portion of
    the medium Boro production area that produces less than 16% Boro [49] and lacks
    adequate irrigation facilities, as marked by the yellow box in Figure 2b which
    was chosen as the test site. Figure 2c shows the land condition of this area.
    The AWD zone is 5 km by 20 km, covering more than 24 thousand acres of cultivable
    lands that suffers from lack of irrigation. The closest water source is a river
    which is at least 2 km away from the cultivable land. Therefore, traditional canal-based
    irrigation methods are inadequate as they can suffer from water seepage of about
    40% [50]. Furthermore, manual AWD is not able to provide efficient water level
    control over this large area of irrigated land. The proposed IoT-based automation
    system with pipe-based water transportation and distribution using the AWD system
    may reduce the seepage loss by up to 90% [51]. Local or centralized automation
    is not adequate in monitoring and controlling the large number of elements in
    the AWD system. Therefore, an intelligent layered IoT-based closed-loop automation
    system is required and is proposed for this project. 4. Proposed Solution The
    proposed automation of AWD is a closed-loop control system that uses an IoT based
    WSN, which is represented by a simplified block diagram as shown in Figure 3.
    This system has three different types of inputs, which are: (i) environmental
    inputs from the field and weather forecast server; (ii) irrigation inputs from
    a plant physiology database; and (iii) inputs from the users of the pumping network
    and water distribution system. Figure 3. Functional blocks of the IoT–WSN-based
    AWD automation control loop. The environmental parameters to be monitored are
    temperature, pressure, humidity, and the greenhouse gas methane ( 𝐶 𝐻 4 ) . Rice
    fields emit a considerable amount of methane, which can be reduced significantly
    by the intermittent flooding that occurs in the AWD method. The field temperature,
    pressure, and humidity data are required to calculate the evapotranspiration loss,
    seepage loss, and water level of the field, which are used to calculate the basic
    parameters used in the AWD method. Other environmental parameters, such as wind
    speed and daylight, can be collected from the weather forecast server through
    the IoT cloud. The wide area AWD requires an adequate number of pumping machines
    and a pipe-based water distribution system to meet the field irrigation requirement.
    To maintain uniform irrigation throughout the area, the water pressures of the
    pipes need to be monitored continuously. The actuators for the water outlets and
    pumps are controlled to maintain proper pressure and water flow during the wetting
    phase of the AWD method. Additionally, the pump power and mechanical parameters
    need to be monitored continually. The crop coefficient ( 𝐾 𝑐  ) determines the
    AWD stages and can be determined from plant physiological data stored in the database
    and from input entered by farmers. The external data obtained from sensors in
    the field, the weather forecast, the crop coefficient, and user input are combined
    and processed in the closed control loop by the cloud-based AWD server through
    the IoT network. The control logic generated by the cloud server is then sent
    to the actuators and pumps through the IoT network to control the irrigation processes.
    All of the sensor nodes (SN) and actuator nodes (AN) are grouped into clusters
    and connected with the base-station (BS) through the cluster head (CH) using a
    LoRa wireless interface. The BS connects the whole WSN to the IoT network through
    the general packet radio service (GPRS) or third generation (3G) cellular network
    as per availability and coverage. The BS also acts as the WSN to an IoT gateway
    that converts the SN/AN data packets to message query telemetry transport (MQTT)
    messages. 5. System Design and Integration The proposed AWD automation consists
    of two main parts: (a) design and dimensioning of the AWD system; and (b) design
    and integration of the WSN. The AWD method at its core is an irrigation schedule
    that depends on certain the water requirements which vary depending on soil condition
    and the growth stages of the crop. Automation of the AWD using the IoT and WSN
    requires the sensor and actuator networks to be designed together, integration
    of various service modules, and development of the software algorithm. These are
    described in the following sub-sections. 5.1. Irrigation Scheduling The water
    volume of the irrigated field changes due to evapotranspiration and percolation.
    Evapotranspiration is influenced by the crop’s growing stage, wind speed, solar
    radiation, temperature, humidity, and soil properties. The crop evapotranspiration
    (𝐸 𝑇 𝑐 ) [52] can be calculated as 𝐸 𝑇 𝑐 =𝐸 𝑇 0 × 𝐾 𝑐  (1) where ( 𝐾 𝑐 ) is the
    crop coefficient (potency of soil evaporation and crop transpiration), and (𝐸
    𝑇 0 ) is the reference evapotranspiration. Among the different methods, the Food
    and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) Penman–Monteith method [52] is considered
    to be the best estimation for 𝐸 𝑇 0 , and can be expressed as 𝐸 𝑇 0 = 0.408Δ (
    𝑅 𝑛 −𝐺)+γ 900 𝑇+273 𝑢 2 ( 𝑒 𝑠 − 𝑒 𝑎 ) Δ+γ(1+0.34 𝑢 2 )   (2) where, 𝑅 𝑛 = net
    radiation at the crop surface ( MJ m −2 d −1 ) , G = soil heat flux density (
    MJ m −2 d −1 ) , T = mean air temperature (°C), Δ = slope of saturation vapor
    curve (kPa°C−1), 𝑢 2 = wind speed ( ms −1 ), 𝑒 𝑠 = saturation vapor pressure (kPa),
    and 𝑒 𝑎 = actual vapor pressure (kPa). Water requirements for rice (WRR) in cm/day
    is given in Equation (3), which measures the receding water level. 𝑊𝑅 𝑅 𝑗 =(𝐸
    𝑇 𝑜 × 𝐾 𝑐 𝑗 )+𝑃𝐸𝑅𝐶 (3) where PERC is the percolation loss from water seeping into
    the ground through pores, and j is the growth-stage index (1 to 3). Figure 4 illustrates
    the irrigation scheduling for the AWD method. The irrigation frequency (lower
    row) changes along with the development stages of the crop. Three development
    stages (transplantation, flowering, and panicle initiation) along with a water
    level indicator (middle row) are shown to indicate where continuous standing water
    and irrigation scheduling is required. Figure 4. Irrigation scheduling in alternate
    wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation method. The different crop coefficients, including
    Kc of rice, for these three stages are shown in Figure 4 [53]. It is quite evident
    when AWD is initiated that, for approximately 5 to 8 days, depending on the soil
    type, no irrigation is required [54]. Continuous standing water is required at
    the beginning of all three stages which approximates to about 30 days in total;
    hence, utilization of the AWD method is suspended during these times. Therefore,
    depending on the stages and in accordance with the 𝑊𝑅 𝑅 𝑗 , irrigation scheduling
    is applied. Irrigation scheduling is divided into two sections. The first section
    is for continuous standing water and the second section is for AWD period. Continuous
    Standing Water: For the three development stages, if the standing water level
    recedes to 2 cm from 5 cm as given in Equation (4), then the irrigation schedule
    or cycle 𝐼 1𝑗 is applied using Equation (5). 𝐼 1𝑗 represents the number of times
    the pump is turned on and is used to maintain a continuous water level of 5 cm
    above the ground. In this equation, TPFj is the total number of days related to
    the transplantation, panicle initiation, and flowering stages. 𝑖𝑓 ∑ 𝑡=1 𝑇 𝑊𝑅 𝑅
    𝑗 (𝑡)=3 cm 𝑖𝑛 𝑇 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠, 𝑗∈{1,2,3}  (4) 𝐼 1𝑗 = 𝑇𝑃 𝐹 𝑗 𝑇 (5) Establishment of continuous
    standing water during these stages is necessary as rice is quite sensitive to
    fluctuation in water level. Alternate Wetting and Drying Method: For the AWD method,
    when the water level falls 5 cm from above the ground and reaches 15 cm below
    the surface as given in Equation (6), then irrigation 𝐼 2 , which is the number
    of times the pump is turned on, is implemented using Equation (7), where 𝑊 𝑗 is
    the total days for the AWD method, to bring the water level back to 5 cm above
    the surface. 𝑖𝑓 ∑ 𝑡=1 𝑇 1 𝑊𝑅 𝑅 𝑗 (𝑡)=5 cm 𝑖𝑛  𝑇 1  𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠  𝑎𝑏𝑜𝑣𝑒 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒  𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛

    (7) The AWD method is utilized in three different stages of the plant development
    period: (i) 15 days after transplantation; (ii) then seven days before panicle
    initiation; and (iii) finally seven days after flowering. 5.2. Dimensioning of
    the AWD System Proper dimensioning of the water distribution network’s pipes is
    required for the implementation of a large-scale AWD system. Multiple pumps are
    used in several clusters for a field of 25,000 acres to reflood the field in the
    shortest time possible. Multiple clustered-pumps facilitate the multiple inlet
    rice irrigation (MIRI) option available with AWD which allows the water to flow
    into the fields from several inlets, flooding the field in the shortest amount
    of time. The capacities of the pumps are chosen to meet the recommended minimum
    swift flooding rate of 0.00126 m3/s per acre (20 gallons per minute per acre),
    which varies depending on the type of soil [55]. Equation (8) shows the total
    number of pumps required ( 𝑛 ), when operating for 𝑡 hours with pumping capacity
    ( c ) in m3/s. The available pumping capacities include 0.02524, 0.05047, 0.06309,
    0.1009, and 0.1262 m3/s, and are achieved with 400, 800, 1000, 1600, and 2000
    GPM (gallons per minute) pumps that cover an acre of area (A) with q (150/m for
    one cm per hour water delivery) amount of water. 𝑛= 𝐴 𝑐×𝑞×𝑡       (8) Figure 5a
    shows the number of pumps required to irrigate 100 acre-inches. Using our proposed
    area of 25,000 acre-inches, it will require a total of 250 pumps with 2000 GPM
    capacities. Figure 5. (a) Number of pumps required when operating for duration
    of time (b) Average power consumption between different water lifting devices
    (c) Efficacy of the water lifting devices. Beside the volume of water to be delivered,
    the selection of water pump depends on lifting head, water pressure, and parameters
    of the water sources. Depending on the lifting head and the source of the water,
    there are three different types of pumps used for irrigation in South-East Asian
    countries including Bangladesh. For the surface water on bodies of water such
    as rivers and lakes, low-lift pumps are used where the lifting head is between
    1 to 5 m. A shallow tube well (STW) is used for more than 73% of ground water
    irrigation [56]. The rest is performed by pumps with higher lifting capacities
    called deep tube wells (DTWs). Irrespective of the type of pump used, pumps with
    higher efficiencies must be selected [57]. Pumps with 70% efficiency (as commonly
    used) are chosen for better selection among different lifting capacities. Average
    energy consumption (Ea) is calculated using Equation (9). 𝐸𝑎=ℎ𝑝·𝜂· 𝑡  (9) where
    hp is the horsepower of the pumps, η is the pump efficiency, and t is the operating
    time of the pumps. The efficacy of the system is measured using Equation (10).
    𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑐𝑦=𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 ( m 3 /s)/ 𝐸𝑎  (10) The average power consumption and efficacy
    of different water lifting devices are shown in Figure 5b,c. The efficacy curves
    in Figure 5c assume 600 GPM, 400 GPM, and 1110 GPM capacities for the low-lift
    pumps (LLP), STW, and DTW pumps. Figure 5b,c shows that LLPs have greater efficacy
    and low energy consumption compared to the other two types. This is mainly due
    to less heads [58] and thus makes the LLP type an economically feasible solution.
    Therefore, multiple low lift pumps are to be used for the wide-area AWD implementation
    as it would allow for proper utilization of the surface water and help lessen
    the exploitation of groundwater irrigation. The proper dimensions of pipes are
    of paramount importance in carrying surface water to the field; therefore, pipes
    are chosen to ensure minimum friction loss while maintaining the recommended water
    flow velocity [59]. The pipes are placed on a downward slope, as shown in Figure
    6a, to overcome the loss of pressure that occurs when travelling larger horizontal
    distances. Moreover, due to multiple inlets for irrigation, the pressure of water
    may fall from one inlet to the other; hence, when needed, the inlets closer to
    the source can be closed, to ensure sufficient water pressure at the opposite
    end of the field. Figure 6. (a) Downward slope water pipe (b) In-field Automated
    AWD setup. According to Equation (8), 250 units of 0.1262 m3/s (2000 GPM) capacity
    pumps need to be formed into clusters to ensure that the field is reflooded within
    16 to 17 h of operating time. The frictional head loss for a steady pipe’s flow
    is calculated using the Hazen–Williams equation [59], which is given by Equation
    (11). ℎ 100𝑓𝑡 =(0.2083× ( 100 𝑐 ) 1.852 × 𝑞 1.852 )/ 𝑑 ℎ 4.8655 (11) where ℎ 100𝑓𝑡
    = friction head loss, in feet, of water per 100 feet of pipe, c = Hazen–Williams
    roughness constant, q = volume flow (gal/min) and 𝑑 ℎ = inside diameter of the
    pipe (inches). Subsequently, the friction loss in psi [59] can be calculated using
    the following Equation (12). 𝑓 100𝑓𝑡 =(1/2.31)× ℎ 100𝑓𝑡 (12) where, 𝑓 100𝑓𝑡 =
    friction loss in psi per 100 feet of pipe. Equations (11) and (12) are required
    to determine the diameter of pipes needed for specific applications. The holes
    of the inlet would need to be 0.0635 m in diameter to obtain a flow of 0.004732
    m3/s (75 GPM) from every inlet in order to fill the field in the shortest possible
    time [55]. Table 1 shows the proposed AWD system with the number of monitoring
    and driver nodes needed to ensure that water gets dispersed evenly throughout
    the field. Figure 6b shows the AWD setup of the field, designed to ensure that
    all farmers receive a fair share of irrigation water, thus resulting in greater
    acceptance of the AWD. Table 1. Proposed AWD system setup. 5.3. WSN and IoT Integration
    IoT-based automation of the AWD system requires different WSNs for sensors and
    actuators. All of these networks work independently with the same base station.
    A WSN collects field parameters such as water level, gas emissions ( 𝐶 𝐻 4 ),
    temperature, pressure, and humidity. These data are then transmitted at 15 min
    intervals. The other WSN monitors the pipe and pump health parameters, such as
    pipe pressure, flow rate of water in pipes, and pump electric power. Based on
    these data, it generates alarms to shut down the pump in emergency situations.
    There is continuous monitoring at the SN which allows for immediate action when
    needed. The actuator network operates the actuators of the pipe to control the
    water flow through the pipe and is updated every 15 min. Comparing the low-power
    wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies, LoRa was chosen for the WSN in order to
    achieve the wide area coverage needed at the monitoring area for the AWD automation.
    Table 2 summarizes the LPWAN technology features [14] including range, data rate,
    and power requirements. It shows that LoRa is the best suited technology in terms
    of range with higher data rates when compared to Sigfox. Table 2. Basic features
    of wireless technologies. LoRa employs chirp spread spectrum (CSS) modulation
    for better noise immunity and sensitivity in order to achieve low-power and long-range
    wireless connectivity. The LoRa data rate ( 𝑅 𝑏 ) depends on the channel bandwidth
    (BW), coding rate (CR), and the CSS spreading factor (SF), and can be calculated
    using Equation (13). Data Rate=SF [ 4 4+CR ] [ 2 SF BW ]  (13) For the proposed
    automated-AWD system, the LoRa physical layer was chosen instead of LoRaWAN in
    order to customize the channel access interval and achieve better channel utilization
    by implementing a custom MAC (Medium Access Control) layer. Furthermore, WSN coverage
    can be improved by increasing the CSS spreading factor of LoRa, without increasing
    transmission power or changing any network elements [14]. Table 3 summarizes the
    LoRa configuration parameters used for the SN where the data rate Rb is calculated
    using Equation (13). Table 3. LoRa parameters. The multi-purpose sensor node (SN),
    shown in Figure 7a, is designed for all WSNs in order to keep the network homogeneous.
    It consists of a LoRa transceiver module (SX1278) unit, main processor (ATMega
    328), and network specific sensors and actuator drivers. Depending on the specific
    application, the sensor node can be used to either drive actuators or collect
    and monitor sensor data. Figure 7 shows the hardware blocks of the SN with the
    power unit and the base station. Figure 7. Hardware block diagram showing (a)
    Sensor node consisting of sensors, actuator drivers, and power unit; (b) base
    station (BS) with LoRa and cellular data connectivity. The base station (BS) consists
    of a Raspberry Pi-4 which acts as a host computer to control the WSN, data communication,
    and gateway functionalities. It has both LoRa and Wi-Fi/3G/LTE to maintain the
    connection with the WSNs and IoT cloud. Figure 7b shows the hardware block diagram
    of the BS. 5.4. Communication Protocol and Automation Algorithm Data transmission
    from the SN is controlled by the BS. The BS initiates data request messages to
    a specific SN using their unique ID and sends an acknowledgement after successful
    reception of the sensor data. For the actuator node (AN), the BS sends the actuator
    control messages to the AN, and updates the actuator nodes in the server database
    after receiving the data and from the AN. All of these communications between
    the WSN and the BS are performed using LoRa with messages transferred as LoRa
    packets. The BS processes the LoRa data packets and sends them to the IoT server
    as MQTT messages. The commands used to control the pumps and actuator, sent from
    the IoT server, also use MQTT. On the user side, a smartphone app and web interface
    are connected with the IoT server through a cloud-implemented MQTT-hypertext transfer
    protocol (HTTP) gateway. All of the data communication and AWD automation processes
    are performed by the SN, BS, and cloud IoT server. Figure 8a,b show the possible
    software algorithms designed for the SN and AN, respectively. At first, it configures
    and initializes the sensors, LoRa module, and driver unit. It then starts reading
    the field, pipe, and pump sensors to monitor their condition continuously. The
    AN takes all necessary actions according to certain pump operating conditions
    and control logic defined by the user during the initialization phase. All the
    internal control variables are updated according to external parameters at regular
    intervals in a closed loop at node A. These external parameters, such as user
    input, plant-specific data, and weather forecasts, are collected through the IoT
    server. Figure 8c shows the AWD automation control logic performed by the IoT
    server. The SN algorithm, shown in Figure 8a, was used for the field trial (described
    in Section 6). The algorithms, shown in Figure 8b,c, intended for wide-area AWD
    automation, were not used in the field trial. Initially, the irrigation phase
    (TPF or AWD) is ascertained, at which point all of the phase specific decisions
    are taken. For example, the surface water level (SWL) is monitored in terms of
    TPF, and, for the AWD, the below surface water level (BSWL) is checked to determine
    whether to toggle the actuator nodes on or off. Subsequently, after toggling the
    actuators and pumps, the SWL is measured for both the TPF and AWD, and then, if
    the SWL reaches 5 cm above the surface, the actuators and pumps are switched off.

    actuator node algorithm, and (c) Control logic algorithm for the AWD server intended
    for wide-area AWD automation. 6. Field Trial A field trial was performed in two
    phases: (i) WSN formation and data collection at UIU (United International University),
    Bangladesh; and (ii) remote data collection using the IoT network in an AWD plot
    at the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI). Figure 9a shows the location
    of the UIU campus fields and Figure 9b shows the BRRI’s research agricultural
    field on Google Maps. Figure 9. Field trial location: (a) On-campus trial at United
    International University. (b) Agricultural land trial at BRRI. Figure 10a shows
    the IoT-connected (wireless sensor and actuator network (WSAN) architecture which
    is comprised of two sensor networks (WSN1 and WSN2) and one wireless actuator
    network (WSN3), as described in Section 5.3. In phase one, four sensor nodes (SNs)
    were placed at each corner of a 500 m by 500 m field with the indoor base station
    (BS) located in a lab on the fifth floor of the campus building. The approximate
    distances between the SNs and the BS were 500 m to 750 m, as shown in Figure 10b.
    Figure 10. (a) IoT-connected WSAN architecture (b) On-campus trial setup with
    sensor devices connected to a base station IoT-connected WSAN architecture. Sensor
    data were collected on a round-robin basis to avoid the co-channel interference
    that occurs at high frequencies (30 s period), and to evaluate the data transfer
    performance of the WSN. The base station (BS) consisted of a Linux-based (Redhat
    7) Apache web server with Node.js, HTM, Python 3, and Maria Database. It also
    acted as a WSN-IoT gateway using the LoRa–WiFi interface. To collect real-life
    data and to evaluate the AWD algorithm’s performance, SNs were placed in the agricultural
    plots of BRRI in a Boro field. The field was divided into irrigation blocks of
    15 m by 15 m, and the SNs were placed 200 m apart from each other. The irrigation
    system was controlled using a central pump. Figure 11 shows the field setup. Figure
    11. Agricultural field level trial setup: (a) Top view of a sensor device in the
    field (b) The receiver base station setup. The BS located at BRRI acquired all
    the sensor data from the field and stored it in the IoT server in a lab at UIU
    through the 3G cellular network. To monitor and process the field data in real-time,
    a distributed application structure was designed, as shown in Figure 12c. Here,
    a smartphone app, web interface, and other automation applications were developed
    and primarily implemented within the central IoT server [60]. Figure 12a,b show
    the smartphone app and the web interface. Figure 12. (a) Mobile Application, (b)
    Web Application, and (c) client-server connectivity for user interface. The mobile
    and web applications were linked to a Node.js server. A mobile Android application
    was used to collect data, a server was used to store the data and generate notifications,
    and a web client was used as a dashboard to display all the AWD specific information.
    The mobile app and web dashboard used rESTful APIs, HTTP requests, and web sockets
    to interface with the server. Sensor data from the external sensor devices was
    recorded on the server, where it was reactively pushed to the mobile client and
    dashboard using web sockets. Web sockets were used to communicate between the
    server and the clients. Both the Android and web apps provided similar services,
    such as user registration, sensor data acquisition, warning generation based on
    sensor data, and data and AWD status reports on the dashboard. The end user, farmers,
    can reconfigure the AWD parameters, such as water level and pump operation time
    using either the smartphone app or web interface. 7. Performance Analysis In traditional
    irrigation systems, water distribution is performed using earthen canals [50]
    due to their low initial cost. However, these canals result in poor distribution
    efficiency, less area coverage, and, in the long run, results in high maintenance
    costs. The greatest concern in using earthen canals is the high water loss, which
    is expressed as water conveyance loss (S) [51] and can be calculated using Equation
    (14). 𝑆={( 𝑄 1 − 𝑄 2 )÷𝐿}×100 (14) where S = the rate of conveyance loss in the
    canal ( m 3  s −1 ) per 100 m distance, Q1 = rate of flow at the inlet ( m 3  s
    −1 ), Q2 = rate of flow at the outlet ( m 3  s −1 ), and L = distance between
    two points (m). The main factor causing this loss in the earthen canals is due
    to seepage loss. Studies have found that about 40% of the water is lost during
    the distribution time through the earthen canals [50]. The proposed automated
    AWD system using plastic pipes can overcome this conveyance loss, and help reduce
    the irrigation time, which in turn results in less energy (fuel or electricity)
    to operate the pumps. The conveyance loss rate for the proposed project derived
    from [51] is shown in Figure 13. It compares the conveyance loss between earthen
    canals and plastic piping when water is transported 5000 m from the water source
    to the field. Thus, the proposed design saves about 90.91% of water when transporting
    it from the source using plastic piping instead of earthen canals. Furthermore,
    studies conducted by [51] have found that the incorporation of the AWD method
    with plastic pipes has saved about 42% of water, and reduced energy consumption
    by 41.2% compared to the traditional method. Figure 13. Conveyance loss compensation
    between earthen canal and plastic pipe. Using Equations (5) and (7), the frequency
    of irrigations, 𝐼 1𝑗  and  𝐼 2𝑗 , can be used to determine the total energy consumption
    of the pumps. For instance, to reflood a 100-acre field with 3 cm of water while
    maintaining continuous water during TPFj, a single 2000-GPM capacity pump with
    70% efficiency and 12 hp, operating for 18 h, would be sufficient as seen in Figure
    5a. Then, using Equation (9), average power consumption of the pump is found to
    be 142.8 KWh. Similarly, the average energy consumption can be determined for
    the AWD method. Therefore, the total energy consumption for the whole season can
    be found by using Equation (15): 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 (𝐾𝑊ℎ)= 𝐼 1𝑗 ∗𝐸𝑎(𝑇𝑃 𝐹
    𝑗 )+  𝐼 2𝑗 ∗𝐸𝑎(𝐴𝑊𝐷) (15) where 𝐸𝑎(𝑇𝑃 𝐹 𝑗 ) represents the energy consumption during
    the TPF stages in order to supply 3 cm of water to the field, and 𝐸𝑎(𝐴𝑊𝐷) denotes
    the energy required to supply water when water reaches 15 cm below ground during
    the AWD method. It can be observed that, compared to the traditional method which
    utilizes continuous water, the proposed automated system is expected to require
    less energy. Figure 14 shows the dimensioning steps and mathematical calculations
    that are used for the proposed AWD system. Figure 14. Required dimensioning and
    calculation steps for an IoT-based AWD system. Table 4 compares the automated
    AWD method with manual AWD systems. Manual AWD studies focused on limited field
    sizes, soil types, and water sources. Sharing a limited number of water-lifting
    devices amongst numerous farmers tended to cause conflicts among them. Furthermore,
    the number of farmers it supported was generally quite limited. However, in the
    proposed IoT- and WSN-based automated AWD system, large-scale implementation is
    possible using a pipe and actuator-based water distribution system with cluster
    pump operation and monitoring. In this proposed system, 10 clusters, each containing
    25 pumps with capacities of 0.1262 m 3 /s (2000 GPM), can cover an area of 25,000
    acres. In this system, the pumps have 12 hp with an average pumping efficiency
    of 70%, which can support a large number of farmers while still allowing each
    farmer to obtain a fair share of water. Table 4. Comparison between manual AWD
    and automated AWD. In manual AWD, due to manual inspection of water levels throughout
    the irrigation season, pumps may operate for more hours than necessary, resulting
    in the wastage of valuable resources. However, in automated systems, pumps are
    switched off as soon as the water level reaches a certain threshold level, resulting
    in water and energy savings. The experiments presented in [46] showed that the
    automated AWD saved between 13–20% of water, with a 25% decrease in irrigation
    energy cost, and an increase in rice yields by 2–11% over manual AWD. The AWD
    automation scheme proposed in this paper is expected to reduce irrigation costs
    further since it uses plastic pipes to carry water. Moreover, integration of weather
    forecast data will operate the pumps effectively (e.g., keeping pumps off when
    the forecast predicts precipitation). Research in [45,46] presented automation
    of the AWD process by using sensors to precisely measure the water level precisely.
    These studies focused on small areas compared to that of the system described
    in this paper. For large-scale automation of AWD, multiple WSNs need to be designed
    and implemented. While automated AWD systems offer certain advantages over the
    manual AWD, as described in Table 4, the dimensioning of the wide-area automated
    AWD system may face challenges during implementation. The plant physiological
    database for developing countries such as Bangladesh is not regularly updated
    and is not easily accessible. In Bangladesh, where farmers are largely not exposed
    to technology, their knowledge and experiences about rice and irrigation are not
    readily available. Moreover, one of the research constraints is that the weather
    forecast information is not based on the specific local territory. Rather, it
    is based on the general meteorological information of the whole region. 8. Conclusions
    This paper has presented an approach to automating a wide-area AWD system covering
    a total irrigation area of 25,000 acres. Implementation of AWD in such a large
    irrigation area has not been reported in the existing literature. It is imperative
    that such a large system uses automation instead of the traditional manual operation
    and monitoring approach. The automation can be achieved by integrating three essential
    and intricate wireless sensor networks (WSN): a mechanical subsystem comprised
    of pumps, actuator networks, and a water distribution network, and an IoT system
    that runs the automation algorithm and issues control commands. The data from
    the WSN, along with other operating parameters, are processed at a central server
    that decides whether to activate the pumps and the actuator valves. The system
    is scalable and the algorithm can be adjusted for irrigation areas with different
    sizes within a practical limit. The required set of equations to support the design
    and operation of the overall system is provided in this paper. The hardware for
    the system is presented and described in order to facilitate the implementation
    of the automation system. The communication protocol and automation algorithm
    have also been presented in sufficient detail. A sample study on a small-scale
    field trial is presented as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the effectiveness
    of the proposed system. An analysis of the proposed system’s expected performance
    is discussed by comparing it with manual and automated AWD systems in the existing
    literature. The analysis highlights the large irrigation area and the complete
    automation aspect of the proposed system. Despite numerous advantages, such as
    reduced water consumption, and economic and environmental benefits, widespread
    adoption of AWD is yet to be materialized due to social, economic, and technical
    challenges. This paper demonstrates that, with the adoption of existing sensor
    networks and IoT-based technologies, wide area adoption [25] is feasible and economically
    viable. The proposed wide-area AWD system allows for continuous monitoring and
    real-time decision making along with a fair distribution of water amongst the
    farmers. The authors are optimistic that, with the adoption of the proposed system,
    wide area AWD will be implemented in rice-growing countries. These countries will
    then reap the full benefits of the technological advantages that AWD has to offer.
    For future expansion of the proposed system, long-term data can be collected and
    analyzed to improve the system further and to further control the greenhouse emissions
    more effectively. Since the proposed system enables the collection of data and
    creation of a large database, new models can be generated and advanced techniques,
    including machine learning and big data, can be applied for better performance.
    Furthermore, incorporating the farmer’s valuable input alongside previous data
    and algorithms will make it possible to accurately identify the different physiological
    stages of plants during the season, resulting in the improved development of plants
    and yields. Author Contributions Conceptualization, G.M.E.R. and R.M.; methodology,

    to precision agriculture irrigation systems have been essential to reduce water
    consumption while growing healthy crops. Specifically, implementing closed-loop
    control irrigation based on soil moisture measurements is an effective approach
    for obtaining water savings in this resource-intensive activity. To enhance this
    strategy, the work presented in this paper proposed a new set of water management

    feedback scheduling 1. Introduction According to the Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO) of the United Nations, it is estimated that around 70% of all water withdrawal
    worldwide is due to agricultural applications [1], contrasting the industrial
    sector at 20% with municipalities’ local infrastructure for services and domestic
    water use taking the remaining 10%. This seems a logical percentage distribution
    given that around 2000 to 3000 L of water are required to grow food per person
    daily [2]. Nonetheless, what is more concerning regarding this volume of water
    is that 93% never returns to its original source, signifying an apparent complete
    loss of the resource. Irrigation efficiency refers to the ratio of water the crop
    uses to the total amount of water extracted from the source [3]. Different factors
    affect irrigation efficiency, like water run-off, evaporation, and deep percolation.
    Water efficiency mostly depends on the hydraulic infrastructure and irrigation
    method, while surface irrigation has a water efficiency from 50% to 65%, sprinklers
    range from 60% to 85%, and drip irrigation from 80% to 90% [4]. Surface irrigation
    implies surface evaporation, which contributes to water loss. Sprinkler technology
    reduces water loss but, still, the applied water evaporates off the leaves of
    the crop canopy. In contrast, drip irrigation delivers water directly to the plant’s
    root zone, reducing losses due to run-off and evaporation [5]. In any case, water
    efficiency can be considerably improved when a sensor-based smart irrigation system
    is installed over the hydraulic infrastructure [6]. Notwithstanding, food production
    is stated to rise in the following ten years and for many decades to come. In
    [7], the author states that the demand for food and agricultural products is projected
    to further increase by up to 70% by 2050 in order to satisfy the requirements
    for an estimated 10 billion person population by then. That, in addition to the
    growing effect of climate change on water shortage worldwide, can have terrible
    consequences in the near future regarding resource allocation and availability
    for agricultural purposes. Vulnerable communities in arid regions would potentially
    suffer the consequences of water scarcity and global warming more [8]. Moreover,
    severe social conflicts have already occurred in rural communities due to the
    unfair assignation of water resources for agricultural activities [9]. Therefore,
    technology and data-driven solutions for water management are required to improve
    resource efficiency, reduce water waste, and contribute to sustainable agriculture
    practices [10]. The waste and overuse of water resources for crop irrigation is
    a relevant topic that has been addressed by precision agriculture from different
    perspectives [11]. In this sense, automatic irrigation systems aim to optimize
    water utilization while helping farmers to improve crop yields by providing the
    right amount of water, at the right time, in the right place in the field [12].
    To control the amount of water used during irrigation, typically these systems
    conduct measurements of soil moisture levels (volumetric water content), environmental
    parameters (solar radiation, wind speed, air temperature, air humidity), and crop
    conditions (canopy temperature, chlorophyll content, trunk diameter) [6]. Efficient
    water management is typically achieved by implementing closed-loop irrigation,
    where real-time soil moisture measurements gathered from large crop areas determine
    when to activate irrigation. Wireless sensor networks provide the communication
    infrastructure for the devices to transmit and receive data. A control device
    receives soil moisture data from sensors, executes a control algorithm, and activates
    or deactivates the irrigation valves to determine how much water to apply to the
    crops. In addition, the control unit may receive complementary information, such
    as environmental parameters and crop conditions, to improve algorithm accuracy
    using model-based estimations. The strategies to implement the algorithms are
    mostly based on classical and modern control theories like on-off control [13],
    PID (proportional-integral-derivative) control [14], and MPC (model predictive
    control) [15,16]; however, recently artificial intelligent approaches such as
    fuzzy logic [17,18,19], machine learning [20,21], and multi-agent systems [22,23]
    have gained the attention of the research community due to the initial promising
    results in the area of data-driven agriculture. However, most works on closed-loop
    irrigation consider one crop and a single irrigation area without water constraints.
    Therefore, they usually assume full water availability, which in practice is not
    always true, especially in arid regions where water management is a priority for
    sustainable and economically profitable crops. Real-time systems refer to computing
    devices that react within precise time constraints to events in the environment
    [24]. Around this concept, different algorithms have been developed mainly within
    the scope of operating systems theory, where multiple control tasks are simultaneously
    executed, sharing common resources [25]. In these systems, the allocation of resources
    is commonly formulated as a constrained optimization problem, where the aim is
    to maximize the benefits of control performance subject to efficient use of the
    available resources. Real-time computing for control systems has been deployed
    over various fields of industry and services like automotive systems, mobile robotics,
    smart grids, gas and water distribution, and food and petrochemical industries,
    among others [26]. The work presented in this paper integrated modeling and control
    theory with real-time computing to develop dynamic water allocation algorithms
    for precision agriculture, considering different irrigation areas with different
    characteristics, such as crop types, soil conditions, and water needs. Under this
    scenario, water availability is constrained and can only be supplied to one irrigation
    area at a time. Experimental data show that dynamic resource allocation in multiple
    irrigation areas avoids stressed crops and improves water utilization compared
    to the empirical approaches commonly used by farmers. 2. Materials and Methods
    2.1. Irrigation Dynamics An irrigation area can be modeled as a finite two-dimensional
    space where vegetation is to be raised, with water being the primary input resource
    for the system. Other relevant physical variables that can be considered in the
    analysis of the crop’s growth include, but are not limited to, soil physical characteristics
    (texture, structure, drainage), environmental parameters (temperature, air humidity,
    solar radiation, wind speed), and crop attributes (type of crop, development stage,
    plants health). A single variable that can show the irrigation’s overall performance
    concerning water usage is the soil moisture level 𝜃(𝑡) . As evidenced by its name,
    it measures the water in the soil. Soil moisture data are obtained by sensors
    that measure the volumetric water content 𝑉𝑊𝐶 , which is defined as the ratio
    of water volume 𝑉 𝑊 (𝑡) to the unit volume of soil 𝑉 𝑠 (𝑡) . Therefore, soil moisture
    can be defined as 𝜃(𝑡)= 𝑉 𝑤 (𝑡) 𝑉 𝑠 (𝑡) . (1) Even though irrigation dynamics
    present non-linear behavior, it is common to approximate the system as a linear
    model divided into three main operating zones according to normalized soil moisture
    levels [15]. As illustrated in Figure 1, these three areas are denoted as Figure
    1. Water content zones according to the soil moisture level, figure adapted from
    [27]. 1. Gravitational (water saturation zone); 2. Available (water available
    in the root crop zone); 3. Unavailable (hydric stress region). In the first workspace
    region, soil cannot retain water which is allowed to drain freely, provoking a
    significant amount of water waste. The second operating region consists of a state
    where the soil retains water and it is available for the crops. In the third area,
    there is not enough water available; at this point, visible damage can become
    apparent to the vegetation and, if not treated, can lead to crop loss. These three
    zones are exemplified in Figure 2, where it can be noticed that soil moisture
    dynamics are different for each region, and the two irrigation events rapidly
    raise the volumetric water content. Figure 2. Soil moisture dynamics for an irrigation
    system, figure adapted from [15]. Normalized soil moisture uses the maximum allowable
    depletion (MAD) as a reference level and is defined as 𝜃 𝑁 (𝑡)=𝜃(𝑡)−𝑀𝐴𝐷, (2) where
    MAD specifies the maximum soil water deficit that the crop may support without
    experiencing any water stress. Typically, the MAD level is located at 50% of the
    total available water capacity in the rooting zone [28]. Table 1 illustrates typical
    MAD values and maximum root zone depths for selected crops. As for the field capacity
    (FC), their volumetric water content percentage depends on the soil texture with
    values form 30% to 40% for silt loam, clay loam, and silty clay loam types of
    soil [27]. Table 1. Percentage values for maximum allowable depletion (MAD) and
    ranges of root depth for common crops. Data obtained from Allen et al. (1998)
    [29]. Closed loop irrigation aims to keep soil moisture above MAD and below FC
    level; this is an optimal spot for the stability of the crop’s growth since it
    avoids crop hydric stress and water waste. 2.2. Irrigation Model Based on the
    previous observations, a linearized model at the operating points is proposed;
    it is important to base the irrigation dynamics on experimentally-confirmed differential
    equations that allow for a proper realization of the input–output relationship
    for the system. A model solely based on irrigation as input is too ideal to execute
    according to the expected outcomes. Therefore, another humidity-related environmental
    factor must be added to the equation. This second time-dependent variable will
    be reference evapotranspiration 𝑒𝑡𝑜(𝑡) . It can be inferred as the amalgamation
    of the evaporation and transpiration processes that the vegetation may suffer
    and it can be obtained using weather variables (solar radiation, wind speed, air
    temperature, and relative air humidity) according to the FAO Penman-Monteith method
    [29]. Thus, it accounts for the vaporization of the moisture from the soil surface
    through heat transfer mechanisms such as convection and radiation from the immediate
    environment and it also takes into consideration the loss of water from the plant
    tissues through the stomata. The model can be enhanced by recognizing the variations
    of soil moisture with respect to time. This new variable, 𝜃 ˙ (𝑡) , should be
    equivalent to the difference of humidity inlets minus the outputs of liquid matter,
    according to the law of conservation of matter. Although a realistic model could
    employ dozens of variables, the simplest of them all are sufficient in many cases,
    including the scenario in which the climate is dry with minimum rainfall (which
    is the circumstance in which the 𝑒𝑡𝑜(𝑡) data were collected), a straightforward
    equation can take the following form via the work of [30]: 𝜃 ˙ (𝑡)= 𝑐 1 𝑖𝑟(𝑡)+
    𝑐 2 𝑟𝑓(𝑡)− 𝐾 𝑐 𝑒𝑡𝑜(𝑡)−𝑑𝑝(𝑡), (3) where 𝑖𝑟(𝑡) and 𝑟𝑓(𝑡) represent water inflow
    from irrigation and rainfall since, in arid regions, rainfall does not have a
    significative impact, then coefficient 𝑐 2 is zero, while 𝑐 1 represents the irrigation
    efficiency which depends on the hydraulic infrastructure with values that range
    from 0.3 to 0.9 and may vary considerably from one irrigation area to another.
    Crop coefficient 𝐾 𝑐 in conjunction with the 𝑒𝑡𝑜(𝑡) integrates the actual crop
    evapotranspiration, 𝐾 𝑐 depends on the crop type and crop growth stage, and the
    reference value of 1.0 corresponds to plain grass crop. Finally, 𝑑𝑝(𝑡) stands
    for the effects of deep percolation, which is the gradual descent of surface water
    to underground levels. It is important to remark that the effect of irrigation
    is not immediate and thus a time delay 𝜏 can be considered in the expression.
    This time delay depends on the depth location of the sensors but also soil compactness
    level. As for the deep percolation, as it can be inferred from the soil moisture
    levels in the ground, it can be defined as being proportional to 𝜃(𝑡) . Consequently,
    the soil water balance model can be re-written as 𝜃 ˙ (𝑡)= 𝑐 1 𝑖𝑟(𝑡−𝜏)− 𝐾 𝑐 𝑒𝑡𝑜(𝑡)−
    𝑐 3 𝜃(𝑡), (4) where 𝑐 3 denotes the proportionality of the soil moisture to the
    deep percolation effect. Now, (4) can be represented as a second-order state space
    model in the form of 𝑥 ˙ (𝑡)=𝑨𝑥(𝑡)+𝑩𝑢(𝑡), (5) where 𝐀,𝐁∈ ℝ 2×2 are the state and
    input matrices, which incorporate coefficients 𝑐 1 , 𝑐 3 , and 𝐾 𝑐 , and they
    can be experimentally obtained from measurements per crop area. The state vector
    𝑥(𝑡) and the input vector 𝑢(𝑡) are respectively defined as 𝑥(𝑡)=[ 𝜃(𝑡) 𝛿(𝑡) ]
    (6) and 𝑢(𝑡)=[ 𝑖𝑟(𝑡−𝜏) 𝑒𝑡𝑜(𝑡) ], (7) where 𝛿(𝑡)= 𝜃 ˙ (𝑡) and denotes the dynamic
    of the soil moisture variations. 2.3. Model Validation Over 45 days, data were
    collected from four different irrigation areas with different crop types, irrigation
    systems, and soil characteristics, as denoted in Table 2. Table 2. Irrigation
    areas characteristics used for data collection. As depicted in Figure 3, the irrigation
    areas were monitored with a solar cell-powered data acquisition system that sensed
    the crop soil moisture level every minute from three volumetric water content
    sensors (10HS Sensor from Meter Group), solar radiation (PYR Sensor from Meter
    Group), wind speed (Davis Cup from Meter Group), air temperature and relative
    humidity (VP-4 Sensor from Meter Group), and water consumption (Flow-Sync from
    Hunter Industries) through a wireless sensor network as described in [31]. Figure
    3. Evaluated irrigation areas. Coefficients values for matrices 𝐀 and 𝐁 from Equation
    (5) were experimentally obtained to model the soil moisture dynamics for each
    evaluated area properly. The estimation algorithm proposed by [15] was used to
    create a linear dynamic state space model for each operating zone (gravitational,
    available, and unavailable). Figure 4 shows the correlation between the estimated
    normalized soil moisture values calculated from the model 𝜃 ̂  𝑁 (𝑡) and the normalized
    measured soil moisture values obtained from the sensor readings 𝜃 𝑁 (𝑡) for a
    specific crop. Irrigation flow 𝑖𝑟(𝑡) is expressed in m 3 /mm and reference evapotranspiration
    𝑒𝑡𝑜(𝑡) in mm/day. Correlation results showed that the identified model adequately
    captured the irrigation dynamics for the crop. Figure 4. Validation results for
    the system identification. Once the proposed irrigation model was experimentally
    validated with four different crops, an optimization problem was formulated to
    evaluate the various water management strategies for a case where multiple irrigation
    areas share a water supply source. 2.4. Optimization Problem For real-time systems,
    control performance optimization and efficient use of the available resources
    are two key elements in the design of resource-constrained control applications
    [24]. This paper analyzed the scenario in which four irrigation areas with different
    crops compete for water supply. The proposed algorithms try to solve a water management
    optimization problem in order to minimize water consumption and crop hydric stress
    subject to the constraint of water availability, which can be defined as minimize
    𝐽= 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 ( 𝐽 𝑐 𝑖 + 𝐽 𝑠 𝑖 ) (8) subjectto ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑐 𝑖 ℎ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑈 𝑟𝑒𝑓 , (9) where
    n is the number of irrigation areas, J is the cost function which integrates water
    consumption 𝐽 𝑐 and crop hydric stress 𝐽 𝑠 for the i area. Also, 𝑐 𝑖 is the irrigation
    time required to move soil moisture from the low threshold to the high threshold
    for each specific area and ℎ 𝑖 is the task period which represents the deadline
    before soil moisture reached stress levels. Finally, 𝑈 𝑟𝑒𝑓 is the required water
    utilization level for the entire group of n irrigation areas. Cost functions for
    water consumption and hydric stress are respectively defined as 𝐽 𝑐 = 1 𝑡 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠
    ∑ 𝑘=1 𝑡 𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙 𝑖 𝑟 𝑘 (10) 𝐽 𝑠 = 100 𝑡 𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙 ∑ 𝑘=1 𝑡 𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙 𝑠 𝑘 , (11) where 𝑡 𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙
    is the total number of minutes for the 45 days evaluation period. 𝐽 𝑐 is the daily
    water consumption in m 3 /day, while 𝐽 𝑠 is the percentage of time that the crop
    suffers from hydric stress; hence, s corresponds to the total time the crop soil
    moisture level is under the maximum allowable depletion level, i.e., 𝜃 𝑁 <𝑀𝐴𝐷
    . Figure 5 shows the evaluated scenario, where a single water source supplies
    irrigation to only one area at a time by activating the electro-valves (actuators)
    while the sensors conduct periodic soil moisture and environmental measurements.
    The water management algorithm runs in the controller to schedule the irrigation
    events for the areas. Figure 5. Irrigation system for four areas. 2.5. Evaluated
    Algorithms A total of six algorithms were evaluated for a simulation time of 45
    days. The evaluation was conducted through a simulation implemented in the Python
    programming language. The first algorithm considers the ideal case where no water
    constraint is considered; each irrigation area receives water immediately when
    needed. Then, two heuristic irrigation algorithms based on time-partitioning schemes
    and three data-driven techniques based on real-time control were considered in
    the analysis. 1. Full-Satisfaction Irrigation (FSI): This ideal case was used
    as a reference, where no water constraint was applied. If the moisture level is
    found below some established level 𝑀𝐴𝐷 , it is time for irrigation. The input
    signal stops when the soil moisture reaches a certain ceiling 𝐹𝐶 . 𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 represents
    the flow in m 3 /min provided by the hydraulic system when the electro-valve is
    activated. Therefore, 𝑖𝑟(𝑡) has only two possible values: {0,𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒} . The control
    law can be summarized as an on–off hysteresis controller with full water availability:
    𝑖𝑟(𝑡)={ 𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒, 0, 𝜃 𝑁 (𝑡)<𝑀𝐴𝐷 𝜃 𝑁 (𝑡)>𝐹𝐶. (12) 2. Time Partitioning Irrigation
    (TPI): In this heuristic algorithm, a time slot is assigned to each area; during
    this time period, the area is irrigated until field capacity is reached. Let 𝑇
    𝑖 be the period of time placed in the i-th order where area i can be irrigated.
    The irrigation cycle is formed by 𝑇=( 𝑇 0 ,…, 𝑇 𝑖 ,…, 𝑇 𝑘 ) . Once 𝑇 𝑘 is over,
    the circle repeats itself. Irrigation on area i cannot occur if, at time 𝑡,𝑡∉
    𝑇 𝑖 . Therefore, 𝑖𝑟(𝑡)={ 𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒, 0, (𝑡∈ 𝑇 𝑖 )∧( 𝜃 𝑁 (𝑡)<𝑀𝐴𝐷) (𝑡∉ 𝑇 𝑖 )∨( 𝜃 𝑁
    (𝑡)>𝐹𝐶). (13) 3. Greedy Time Slotting (GTS): Like TPI, irrigation is divided into
    fixed time slots in a predetermined order. The main difference is that to recompense
    the expected stress during the periods of no irrigation, watering will be forced
    as long as 𝑡∈ 𝑇 𝑖 . Therefore, the proposed control law is 𝑖𝑟(𝑡)={ 𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒, 0,
    𝑡∈ 𝑇 𝑖 𝑡∉ 𝑇 𝑖 . (14) 4. Mutual Exclusion Resource Locking (MERL): In this data-driven
    algorithm analog to a first-come, first-serve scheme, the first land lot under
    the 𝑀𝐴𝐷 level will gain access to water for irrigation. While it is being watered,
    no other crop can be irrigated. It deals with the scenarios of access collision
    like in the dining philosophers’ problem proposed by [32]. Different processes
    (irrigation areas) may require access to a shared resource (water supply) in this
    strategy. Then, to control concurrency and avoid deadlock, a mechanism (algorithm)
    allows access only if the resource is available; if not, the process will wait
    a random period of time to check if the resource is now available. It is not a
    perfect solution but, given a good random seed, the probability that different
    processes keep colliding becomes null in practice. The proposed control law is
    defined as 𝑖𝑟(𝑡)={ 𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒, 0, ( 𝜃 𝑁 (𝑡)<𝑀𝐴𝐷)∧(𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟=𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒) ( 𝜃 𝑁 (𝑡)>𝐹𝐶)∨(𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟≠𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒).
    (15) 5. Earliest Estimated Deadline First (EEDF): Given that an available mathematical
    model is obtained through system identification techniques [33], an approximate
    behavior of the real plant can be estimated. To determine which irrigation area
    to give the most priority, one can compute which one has the sooner deadline and
    define a priority ranking among the competing areas. The deadline is calculated
    by estimating the time for the area to reach the 𝑀𝐴𝐷 threshold since, below this
    level, the crop will suffer from hydric stress. In this dynamic scheduling algorithm,
    the highest priority is assigned to the task with the earliest deadline to avoid
    water stress. Once the area has access to the water supply, no preemption is allowed
    until the irrigation area reaches the field capacity level. The proposed control
    law is defined as 𝑖𝑟(𝑡)={ 𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒, 0, (ℎ∈𝑚𝑖𝑛{ ℎ 𝑖 })∧(𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟=𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒) (ℎ∉𝑚𝑖𝑛{
    ℎ 𝑖 })∨(𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟≠𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒). (16) 6. Dynamic Feedback Priority (DFP): This resource-aware
    algorithm is based on the feedback scheduling concept, where the resource manager
    continuously monitors the soil moisture level for all the areas. Similarly to
    the EEDF strategy, the water resource is assigned to the irrigation area based
    on how close the moisture level is with respect to the 𝑀𝐴𝐷 threshold to avoid
    water stress. Here, the difference is that the resource manager may preemptively
    interrupt the current irrigation area anytime if it is determined that another
    area is in a more critical stage, i.e., closer to the water stress limit. Unlike
    the previous scheduling technique, where the priority will be calculated after
    finishing the irrigation, in this new dynamic feedback algorithm, the priority
    is continuously estimated for each sample period, 𝑖𝑟(𝑡)={ 𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒, 0, ℎ∈𝑚𝑖𝑛{
    ℎ 𝑖 } ℎ∉𝑚𝑖𝑛{ ℎ 𝑖 }. (17) 3. Results and Discussion The evaluation results in terms
    of water stress percentage 𝐽 𝑠 and water consumed daily 𝐽 𝑐 are displayed in Figure
    6, with a legend to signal the four individual areas and their performances. The
    left side belongs to an ideal case and the empirical methods, while the right
    side stands for the proposed data-driven techniques. Figure 6. Numerical results
    of the 45-day simulation period for each irrigation area following the scheduling
    policies and the constraints imposed into the system. (a) Water stress on each
    area for the ideal case and the heuristic algorithms. (b) Water stress on each
    area for the data-driven algorithms. (c) Irrigation water consumed daily in m
    3 by area for the ideal case and the heuristic algorithms. (d) Irrigation water
    consumed daily in m 3 by area for the data-driven algorithms. The ideal scenario
    of unlimited water is present in the FSI algorithm. Under there, every time the
    sensed moisture goes below the permitted threshold, irrigation is activated regardless
    of the state of the other lots. When it surpasses the upper threshold, irrigation
    stops. Therefore, as expected, the crops spend practically no time under stress
    even though it may consume a surplus of water. Otherwise, TPI irrigates only when
    necessary during the selected time slots permitted periodically. One can infer
    that, although it will save a good amount of resources, the plant will be placed
    under constant stress for most of the study horizon. If one agrees to irrigate
    heedless of the state variables during the allowed period, the expected result
    is a reduced level of water stress due to the incoming stagnant water to alleviate
    the climate in the subsequent periods at the expense of an augmented degree of
    resource usage. GTS is a technique commonly used by farmers to reduce crop water
    stress, since they use the soil to store water for the future; however, soil capacity
    to store water is very limited and this considerably increases the water waste.
    MERL enables the capacity to emulate the limitless resource case’s response while
    setting boundaries on how much water can be used in practice. Hence, the overall
    performance under this algorithm is similar to FSI. Earliest deadline scheduling
    functions similarly to the time-division multiplexed algorithms, with a considerable
    upgrade. EEDF, by always following the then-closest area to moisture fulfillment,
    ensures that the periods between irrigation will always be the shortest ones possible.
    However, three crops suffered from water stress under this algorithm and only
    one avoided the hydric stress; this can be explained by the no preemption mechanism
    imposed by the algorithm. Finally, the DFP algorithm obtained similar results
    to the MERL approach. This is because it is essentially a straight line along
    the lower threshold of the moisture level percentage. Nonetheless, it is excellent
    yet surprising news. The only mode in which one can achieve this kind of constant
    response is by periodically placing marginal magnitudes of the input at a fast
    and constant rate. This sort of reaction is the same as in drip irrigation, where
    the water is placed drop by drop into the root area. This method minimizes the
    erosion and evaporation of water commonly found in sprinkler irrigation while
    saving up to 60% of the water used and increasing crop yield by over 50% (see
    [34]). At first sight, the data-driven approaches seem to improve the extent of
    hydric stress in submerged areas. Also, they present a more organized and fair
    way to distribute the resources with the correct constraints in a real land lot.
    For a deeper evaluation, Table 3 presents the obtained cost function results as
    defined by Equations (10) and (11). Table 3. Cost function results of the evaluated
    algorithms. It can be observed that, even though the heuristic approaches tend
    to the highest and lowest values in both categories, the ability of the data-driven
    methods is more balanced and they produce an overall better performance. It is
    clear that, with the exception of EEDF, the plant suffers from much less hydric
    stress than with the heuristic methods. Additionally, at most, MERL and DFP allowed
    just under 5% water stress, while TPI and GTS put the crop under stress for more
    than 20% the duration of its intended growth. Additionally, water consumption
    stays below the ideal scenario of FSI, whose only true competitor is time partitioning
    schemes that increment the water stress exponentially, making them unsuitable
    for actual applications even if they are already used in practice by most farmers
    due to their experience and background. Of all the above, the best irrigation
    strategies that one can and should implement are the mutual exclusion resource
    locking (MERL) and the dynamic feedback priority (DFP), since they provided a
    balance of avoiding water stress while reducing water consumption in comparison
    with the heuristic TPI and GTS approaches. The first one shows how arbitrarily
    blocking the access of some agents to the main hydration supply can diminish the
    expenses and protect the vital resources in play while at the same time keeping
    the areas in good condition. The latter has more rewards that safeguard water
    utilization in this sector and consider the conservation of the immediate environment.
    The obtained results have demonstrated that data-driven water management strategies
    reduce irrigation water consumption while avoiding water stress on crops in conditions
    where multiple crop areas share a water supply. However, the drawbacks of implementing
    these automated solutions reside in the installation and maintenance cost, which
    most farmers are unwilling to accept if the return on investment is not clearly
    defined. To illustrate this, just the acquisition cost and the proper installation
    and maintenance of soil moisture sensors have a high level of complexity [31]:
    sensors require individual off-line calibration for the specific soil texture
    to reach a reliable accuracy, then installation must be carefully conducted to
    avoid soil air gaps to obtain representative readings; also, at least three sensors
    are required for an irrigation area and it is a good practice to unearth sensors
    each year for re-calibration. Since soil moisture sensor is, so far, the element
    on which closed-loop irrigation is based, lowering costs and efforts must be a
    priority to make sensor-based automated irrigation a feasible option for farmers.
    4. Conclusions A set of dynamic water allocation algorithms was proposed to optimize
    water consumption and avoid hydric stress for an agricultural irrigation system
    composed of multiple areas and a single water source. The dynamics of each area
    were modeled to represent different crops with different soil properties. The
    water management algorithms were integrated with closed-loop controllers based
    on soil moisture measurements for each irrigation area. Simulation results based
    on experimental data showed that the proposed strategies obtained a similar performance
    regarding water savings and avoiding water-stressed crops to when total water
    is available. They provided superior results compared with the heuristic strategies
    commonly used by farmers in practice. The proposed data-driven algorithms were
    formulated as a real-time computing optimization problem with resource constraints.
    The results encourage looking for other data-driven techniques to be applied in
    irrigation management. Water management for agricultural activities may have different
    perspectives: environmental, social, and economic, and the use of data-driven

  explanation: The study focuses on feedback control for basin irrigation systems,
    proposing a novel approach based on a combination of physical modeling and optimization.
    This approach aims to maintain a constant water depth during the irrigation process,
    ensuring uniform infiltration and minimizing water losses. The study demonstrates
    the effectiveness of this approach on a real-world experimental basin, achieving
    higher infiltration efficiency and crop yield than conventional irrigation methods.

  description: Feedback-controlled surge irrigation systems require operating criteria
    to maximize application efficiency. Two observable pieces of information that
    can be used for feedback control are water advance and runoff. Unfortunately,
    due to its spatially dispersed nature, water advance data can be difficult, expensive,
    and time consuming to collect. With good infiltration data, existing surge irrigation
    models can simulate surge flow for many conditions and be used to study the effect
    of varying management and field variables on surge irrigation performance. However,
    the models do not automatically generate optimal solutions for management. We
    developed the operating criteria and control logic for the management of a feedback-controlled
    surge irrigation system that uses a minimal amount of water advance data and runoff
    data as feedback information. The equations necessary for application of the operating
    criteria in a feedback-controlled surge irrigation system with laterally varying
    infiltration are presented.

    Automation Algorithms developed a series of test cases to evaluate the performance
    of canal control algorithms. In this paper, simulation tests were performed on
    ASCE test canal 1 using a remote downstream control configuration of MPC. The
    MPC algorithm effectively controls ASCE test canal 1, and its performance was

  key_findings: MPC effectively maintained the desired water levels in the irrigation
    canal, even in the presence of disturbances and constraints. MPC was fairly robust
    and did not require extensive tuning. The feedforward portion of MPC did not perform
    as well as other proposed feedforward routines.
  limitations: The study is limited to simulations on a single test canal and may
    not generalize to all irrigation systems. The study also does not address the
    scalability and reliability of MPC in large-scale deployments.
  main_objective: To evaluate the performance of model predictive control (MPC) in
    controlling the flow of water in an irrigation canal.
  relevance_evaluation: This paper is highly relevant to the outline point, as it
    specifically addresses the implementation of feedback loops using MPC for automated
    irrigation management. The study provides empirical evidence of the effectiveness
    of MPC in controlling water levels in an irrigation canal, which aligns with the
    intention of the literature review to evaluate the current state and future potential
    of automated irrigation systems.

  description: Automated control systems in irrigation have in recent years made considerable
    progress, offering a wide range of new options. In this experiment, a closed loop
    control system based on the relationship of electrical resistance and soil moisture
    was used to test the performence of the automated drip irrigation system for pepper
    (Capsicum annuum L.) growth. A main strategy for irrigation was determined before
    irrigation events and the pot (100kω) in the circuit was adjusted to the strategy
    determined before, thereafter a signal was produced by the electrodes embedded
    in the substrate whenever soil moisture reached to the threshold level. Therefore,
    the system took over irrigation events, started and stopped the irrigations throughout
    the entire growing season. The irrigation times and amounts of irrigation water
    applied by the system was not suitable for uniform crop production, because irrigation
    throuhout the whole growing season was commenced as almost 55% of the available
    soil moisture was depleted from field capacity (FC).

  explanation: Wu et al. (2022) proposed an intelligent irrigation system comprising
    wireless sensor networks, a solar power system, and a cloud platform to monitor
    soil moisture in real-time and automate irrigation schedules. Using a proportional-integral-derivative
    (PID) controller, the system adjusts the irrigation frequency and duration based
    on soil moisture readings. The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of their
    system in reducing water consumption by 26.4% while maintaining crop yield.

  description: Automated site-specific sprinkler irrigation system can save water
    and maximize productivity, but implementing automated irrigation is challenging
    in system integration and decision making. A controllable irrigation system was
    integrated into a closed-loop control with a distributed wireless in-field sensor
    network for automated variable-rate irrigation. An experimental field was configured
    into five soil zones based on soil electrical conductivity. Micrometeorological
    sensors were installed on each zone of the distributed wireless sensor network
    and remotely monitored by a base station for decision making. Soil water sensors
    were calibrated with a neutron probe and individually identified for their response
    ranges at each zone. Irrigation decisions were site-specifically made based on
    feedback of soil water conditions from distributed in-field sensor stations. Variable-rate
    water application was remotely controlled by the base station to actuate solenoids
    to regulate the amount of time an individual group of sprinkler nozzles was irrigating
    in a 60-sec time period. The performance of the system was evaluated with the
    measurement of water usage and soil water status throughout the growing season.

    the control of single, in-line canals, while canal operators typically have to
    control an entire network of canals. Because the branches in a network are hydraulically
    coupled with each other, control of a branching canal network based on separate
    controllers for each branch may not be the most effective control strategy. A
    methodology by which existing automatic control systems could be modified to control
    branching canal networks is provided in a companion paper. This paper presents
    results of hydraulic simulations of the new methodology to estimate the controllability
    of a large portion of the branching canal network operated by the Salt River Project
    (SRP). Two types of controllers were used for this study: (1) linear quadratic
    regulator (LQR) and (2) model predictive control (MPC). Both controllers used
    the same underlying process model [integrator-delay (ID) model], and both controllers
    were capable of feedback and feedforward control. Under feedback control alone,
    both controllers gave similar performance, but were unable to effectively control

    Slight differences were noted between the performance of the two feedforward controllers.
    Introduction In the companion paper (Wahlin and Clemmens 2006), a state-space
    methodology was presented by which two existing automatic control algorithms can
    be modified to control a branching canal network instead of a single, in-line
    canal. Two types of controllers were used for this study: (1) linear quadratic
    regulator (LQR) and (2) model predictive control (MPC). The integrator-delay (ID)
    model was used as the underlying process model for the controllers. The conversion
    from a single in-line canal to a branching network was accomplished by modifying
    the state transition relationships, as reflected in the state-transition matrix.
    The same state-transition relationships were used for both control methods. The
    rest of the controller design procedure, for either method, did not change from
    that for a single, in-line canal. The LQR methodology is fully described by Clemmens
    and Schuurmans (2004), who refer to this implementation as a fully centralized
    proportional-integral (PI) controller. The MPC methodology is described by Wahlin
    (2004). In the companion paper (Wahlin and Clemmens 2006), the approach for controlling
    branching canal networks was demonstrated with a simple example. In this paper,
    these two control methods were applied to a large portion of the canal system
    operated by the Salt River Project (SRP), including two branch points. Because
    of the long delay times in this large system, feedback alone was not sufficient
    for effective control. Thus feedforward routing of known demand changes was necessary
    for these two control methods to effectively control the overall branching canal
    network. Background The SRP is actually two organizations: (1) the Salt River
    Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District (SRPAIPD, or the District,
    for short), a political subdivision of the state of Arizona, and (2) the Salt
    River Valley Water Users’ Association (SRVWUA, or the Association, for short),
    a private corporation (SRP 2002). The District provides electricity to retail
    customers in the Phoenix area [approximately 7,500 km 2 (2,900 mi 2 )] and operates
    or participates in seven major power plants and numerous other generating stations
    (SRP 2002). The Association delivers nearly 1.2 billion m 3 (1 million acre-ft)
    of water to a service area of about 970 km 2 (240,000 acres) in central Arizona
    (SRP 2002). The water delivery area for the Association is approximately 16% agricultural
    and 84% urban (SRP 2002), and is rapidly urbanizing. The Association also maintains
    and operates an extensive water delivery system, which includes dams, reservoirs,
    diversion structures, wells, canals, and laterals. Dams and Diversion Structures
    In addition to the canal system, this study is only concerned with that portion
    of the Salt River that runs from the Stewart Mountain Dam to the Granite Reef
    Diversion Structure. Stewart Mountain Dam is the last of the major dams on the
    Salt River (SRP 2002). The dam was constructed between 1928 and 1930, and modified
    in 1992. Stewart Mountain Dam is 63 m (208 ft) high and forms Saguaro Lake, which
    has a capacity of about 86 million m 3 (70,000 acre-ft) (see Fig. 1). Fig. 1.
    SRP canal system (Salt River Project 2002, with permission) Granite Reef Diversion
    Structure was built to divert the water in the Salt River into the canal system
    of the Association. Granite Reef Diversion Structure is located about 4.8 km (3
    mi) downstream from the confluence of the Verde and Salt Rivers. It was constructed
    between 1906 and 1908. Granite Reef is a diversion structure only; it was not
    designed to store water. Granite Reef Diversion Structure is 8.8 m (29 ft) tall
    and consists of a 300-m-long (1,000 ft) ogee-shaped crest. Canal System Water
    is released from the Stewart Mountain Dam and flows through the Salt River to
    Granite Reef Diversion Structure. At this point, the water is diverted into the
    Association’s canal system, which consists of about 2,100 km (1,300 mi) of canals,
    laterals, and ditches (see Fig. 1). The main canals include the Arizona Canal,
    the Crosscut Canal, the Grand Canal, the South Canal, the Eastern Canal, the Consolidated
    Canal, the Tempe Canal, and the Western Canal. The Association maintains and operates
    the canal system. This paper deals only with the Arizona Canal, the Grand Canal,
    the Crosscut Canal, and the South Canal. Water behind the Granite Reef Diversion
    Structure is diverted into the Arizona Canal to distribute water on the north
    side of the Salt River. The Grand Canal is the oldest remaining canal on the north
    side of the Salt River, built between 1877 and 1878. In 1889, the Arizona Improvement
    Company created the Crosscut Canal and Power Company to construct a canal connecting
    the Arizona Canal with the Grand Canal. This canal unified the north side canal
    system. In 1912, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) built a new Crosscut Canal
    with a small hydroelectric power plant placed at the 35-m (116-ft) drop in the
    canal. For simplification, the Grand and Crosscut Canals are referred to as the
    Grand Canal in this paper. The South Canal was built by the USBR between 1906
    and 1908. Just like the Arizona Canal, the head works of the South Canal are located
    at the Granite Reef Diversion Structure. The purpose of the South Canal is to
    connect the Tempe and Consolidated Canals to the Granite Reef Diversion Structure.
    Problem Definition To demonstrate that the methodology developed for branching
    canal networks can effectively control the SRP canal system, a large portion of
    the SRP canal system was numerically modeled and the controllability was tested
    through hydraulic simulations using the procedures outlined in Wahlin and Clemmens
    (2006). The portion of the canal system that was modeled and automatically controlled
    includes the Arizona Canal, the Grand Canal (Grand and Crosscut), and the South
    Canal. In addition, the model and automatic control system extends up the Salt
    River to Stewart Mountain Dam. As with Wahlin and Clemmens (2006), all of the
    simulations were performed with the hydrodynamic model SOBEK (Delft Hydraulics
    2000). These numerical simulations are a good start for the Association to develop
    an automatic control system for its entire branching canal system. Actual System
    Salt River The Salt River runs for 22 km (13.7 mi) after Stewart Mountain Dam
    until it reaches the Granite Reef Diversion Structure (see Fig. 1). After the
    Granite Reef Diversion Structure, the Salt River becomes a dry riverbed that flows
    only during flood periods. The Salt River has variable cross-sectional areas and
    variable slopes throughout its length from Stewart Mountain to Granite Reef. Visser
    (1998) developed a reasonable approximation of the river so that it could be modeled
    in SOBEK and its response characteristics could be determined. Canal System Geometric
    Characteristics The geometric and hydrodynamic characteristics of the Association’s
    canal system are well defined. For each pool, SRP has very detailed HEC-RAS files
    (HEC 2002), which include roughness estimates, cross-sectional geometries, and
    bridge and culvert locations. The Arizona Canal consists of 15 pools. The first
    five pools of the Arizona Canal are referred to as the Upper Arizona Canal, while
    the remaining pools are referred to as the Lower Arizona Canal. The Grand Canal,
    which includes the Crosscut Canal, is composed of 15 pools, only 14 of which were
    included in this study. Finally, the South Canal, which is a small connector canal
    between Granite Reef Diversion Structure and the Tempe and Consolidated Canals,
    consists of only two pools. Check Structures At the end of each pool is a check
    structure. These check structures typically consist of a number of radial gates
    and overflow weirs. The Association does not use standard methods to calculate
    the flow through a radial gate. Instead, they use a special relationship that
    was developed by SRP personnel [see Clemmens et al. (1997) for more details].
    SRP gives each check structure an address to let operators know where the check
    structure is located. For example, the address for the check structure at the
    end of the second pool on the Arizona Canal is 1-01.9. The first number (1) means
    the pool is on the Arizona Canal. A Number 2 refers to the Grand Canal and a Number
    3 to the South Canal. The second number of the address (the one after the dash)
    is the relative location of the pool along the canal, but does not necessarily
    correspond to the distance along the canal. The last number indicates the closest
    lateral or turnout to the check structure. Thus the check structure for the second
    pool on the Arizona Canal is located near Lateral 1.9. Water Deliveries Water
    is delivered to customers primarily through gravity-based offtakes. There may
    be many different offtakes along the canal. Operators adjust the check gates to
    maintain a constant water level in the forebay. The gravity-based offtakes have
    a constant discharge if the water levels in the forebays are kept constant. Setpoints
    The Association has a setpoint for each pool, depending on the season. These setpoints,
    shown in Table 1, were determined after years of operating the canal; they were
    not determined by an optimization study. The setpoints used for this study roughly
    correspond to the setpoint used during the summer months, with some exceptions,
    explained later. Table 1. Setpoints for SRP Canal System Address Setpoint depth

    Canal; 2=Grand Canal; and 3=South Canal. Operational Objectives Brouwer (1997)
    identified three main objectives that the Association has with regard to its operation
    of the canal system. These objectives can be defined as follows: • To deliver
    water to the correct place at the right time and in the correct amount; • To have
    no operational spills; and • To maintain the water levels at their setpoints,
    with little fluctuation, so the offtake deliveries are more constant. Operational
    Procedures Canal operators at SRP use supervisory manual control to operate the
    canal system. A Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system is used
    to gather all the pertinent data (e.g., water levels, gate positions, etc.) and
    display them in the control room. The watermaster uses this information to maintain
    water levels in the pools within the “safe” zone (referred to as the green zone)
    while routing flow changes through the system. The green zone is water level deviations
    less than ± 0.076 m (0.25 ft). The red zone is represented by water level deviations
    of more than ± 0.122 m (0.4 ft), with the yellow zone in between. Most of the
    time, the watermaster wants to operate the canal in the green zone. However, there
    are situations when the watermaster will intentionally operate the canals in the
    yellow zone (e.g., to keep the water down for maintenance or construction purposes
    or to act as a temporary buffer). SRP delivers 10% more water to each customer
    in order to assure that the customers’ orders are met. Also, canal operators always
    have a little more water flowing from Granite Reef than needed. This extra water
    is called carriage water and it is used to compensate for any unexpected losses
    in the system. Zanjeros, the local term for canal operators, operate the laterals
    and the offtakes manually. They drive up and down the secondary and tertiary canals
    in the system and make the necessary changes at the offtakes to satisfy the customers’
    demands. Water schedulers collect the water order for the next day. All of these
    water orders are then given to the watermaster, who makes up the canal system’s
    water schedule for the next day. Water is then routed through the canal system
    remotely from the control room based on the water schedule. Hydrodynamic Model
    of the System To perform the desired simulations, a mathematical model of the
    Association’s canal system was built in the hydrodynamic model SOBEK. Salt River
    Visser (1998) developed a model of the Salt River, simplified to have a uniform
    trapezoidal shape with a bottom width, b , equal to 11.9 m (39 ft) and side slopes,
    z , equal to 15.3. Manning n -value was estimated to be 0.032 for the entire length
    of the Salt River between Stewart Mountain Dam and the Granite Reef Diversion
    Structure. Visser (1998) divided the Salt River into four different sections with
    bottom slopes and section lengths shown in Table 2. Table 2. Geometric Properties

    SRP has a detailed HEC-RAS model of each pool in their canal system. If all of
    the detail in the HEC-RAS models were used for all the pools in the Arizona, Grand,
    and South Canals, the resulting model of the system would be enormous, and it
    would not be feasible to make timely hydraulic computations on the system. Thus
    several simplifications were made while building SRP’s canal system in SOBEK.
    First, all of the extra structures (e.g., bridges, culverts, etc.) were removed.
    Second, the detailed geometric data in the HEC-RAS files were averaged over long
    distances. The longitudinal plot of each pool was examined and divided into sections
    based on where there was an obvious break in the grade of the pool. Typically,
    this resulted in three to five sections per pool. Then, for each of these sections,
    the HEC-RAS data were length-averaged over the section to define the average bottom
    width and side slopes. There was some concern as to whether or not the simplification
    of the cross sections would significantly impact the predicted water surface elevations.
    As shown in Fig. 2, simplifying Pool 2-04.2 did not have a significant impact
    on the water surface elevations. The water surface elevations were also not significantly
    affected for the rest of the pools under consideration. Once all the geometric
    data had been determined, they were entered into SOBEK to develop the hydrodynamic
    model. The model included the Salt River, the Arizona Canal, the Grand Canal,
    and the South Canal. Models of each individual pool were also developed because
    they were needed to determine the hydraulic properties of the pools for the ID
    model. Fig. 2. Profile plot of Pool 2-04.2 Check Structure Characteristics The
    check structures in SRP’s canal system are mostly radial gates. At this time,
    SOBEK does not have a function that allows the user to model radial gates. Even
    if it did, it would be doubtful that SOBEK would use SRP’s custom rating curves.
    For this study, this was not considered a significant problem. Both the LQR and
    MPC controllers are used in tandem with a flow controller, or slave controller.
    The flow controller’s function is to force the check gates to deliver the desired
    flow during the times between the feedback calculations, which removes the complex
    gate hydraulics from the system. Thus it does not matter if the check structures
    are modeled as radial gates, sluice gates, or overshot gates because the flow
    controller makes the necessary adjustments to assure that the flow requested by
    the feedback controller is passing through the check structure. To guarantee that
    the check structure is passing the correct flow, the flow controller inverts the
    gate equation to solve for the proper gate position. Prior studies have shown
    that the inability to accurately model check structure hydraulics has a minor
    effect on the performance of these automatic controllers (Clemmens et al. 1997;
    Clemmens and Wahlin 2004). All of the check structures were modeled as sluice
    gates in SOBEK. The width of a sluice gate in a pool was approximately equal to
    the total width of all the radial gates in that pool. SOBEK has four possible
    flow regimes for the sluice gate:(1) free orifice flow; (2) submerged orifice
    flow; (3) free weir flow; and (4) submerged weir flow. The typical flow condition
    that one thinks about for a sluice gate is what SOBEK defines as orifice flow.
    Weir flow, according to SOBEK, occurs when the water depth upstream from the gate
    is less than 1.5 times the gate opening. This is because for larger gate openings,
    the gate opening actually exceeds the depth of critical flow and the flow passes
    under the gate as weir flow, assuming no downstream backwater effects. The equations
    used in SOBEK for both free and submerged weir flow do not contain the gate opening.
    In SOBEK, changes in gate hydraulic regime occur more suddenly than in real life,
    causing numerical oscillations and potential instability. For this study, it was
    necessary to stay away from the weir flow condition because control was not possible
    under this flow condition (i.e., the flow controller cannot determine the correct
    gate position because it does not appear in the discharge equation) and to avoid
    unrealistic hydraulic behavior and potential instability that might occur as SOBEK
    switches from one gate equation to another. To avoid this problem, which occurred
    in some extreme situations, some of the gate widths were doubled. In one case
    (Pool 1-03.0), doubling the gate width was not sufficient and the setpoint also
    had to be raised. Changing the gate widths should have no effect on the performance
    of the automatic controllers, as discussed earlier. Offtakes There are multiple
    offtakes on each of the pools in the SRP canal system. To simplify the model,
    these multiple offtakes were consolidated into one offtake located just upstream
    from each check structure. The offtakes were modeled as sluice gates with a short
    canal section downstream. A drop in this canal section assured that the offtakes
    would operate under free flow. The offtake-gate openings were set so the correct
    amount of water would flow through the offtake if the water levels were at their
    setpoints. These offtake gate openings were calculated in MATLAB (MathWorks 2000)
    based on SOBEK’s gate equations and then supplied to SOBEK for the simulations.
    It was recognized that these offtake relationships were a simplification of the
    real system. However, this simplification should have little impact on a controller’s
    ability to maintain water levels at their setpoints. Boundary Conditions Various
    boundary conditions need to be defined in the SOBEK model of the SRP canal system.
    Boundary conditions must be set at the upstream and downstream ends of the canal
    system. The available boundary conditions in SOBEK are either water surface elevations
    or flow rates. Downstream control was implemented on the SRP canal system which
    means the releases at Stewart Mountain Dam are in the control loop. Thus the water
    level in Saguaro Lake, immediately upstream from Stewart Mountain Dam, was used
    as the upstream boundary condition. The lake’s water surface elevation was set
    at a fixed value for these simulations. The other boundary conditions that must
    be determined are at the downstream end of the canals (Arizona, Grand, and South)
    and in the short canal reach downstream from each offtake gate. At each structure
    that represented a downstream boundary, a sharp 1-m (3-ft) drop was created downstream
    from the structure. The water depths in the sunken sections were fixed at 0.5
    m (1.6 ft). This procedure supplied SOBEK with the necessary boundary conditions
    while still allowing the water level and flow rates to fluctuate. Control System
    The control system includes the Salt River, the Arizona Canal, the Grand Canal,
    and the South Canal. Remote downstream feedback control logic was used to automatically
    control the water levels in the various pools of the system. The exception was
    for Pool 2-04.6. This is the location of the Crosscut power generating station.
    For this pool, a local upstream controller was placed on the check structure and
    the pool was removed from the control loop. Under this scenario, the water level
    errors at the downstream end of Pool 2-06.3 generated control actions for the
    check structure in Pool 2-04.2, not Pool 2-04.6. Also, Pool 2-23.9 at the downstream
    end of the Grand Canal was not included because there was no HEC-RAS model of
    this pool. Thus the control system consists of 31 pools under downstream control
    and one pool under local upstream control. Two different downstream feedback controllers
    were used: (1) the fully centralized PI controller developed with LQR techniques
    and (2) MPC. Summary of Tests Performed Clemmens et al. (1997) used a series of
    tests defined by SRP watermasters to evaluate automation of the Upper Arizona
    Canal. Wahlin (2002) adapted these tests for most of SRP’s branching canal network.
    For this paper, Test 4 from Wahlin (2002) was examined in detail. The conditions
    for this test were a relatively high initial flow rate and flow rate changes occurring
    simultaneously on the Arizona, Grand, and South Canals. Table 3 presents a summary
    of this test. SOBEK unsteady-flow simulations were used to evaluate both the LQR
    and MPC feedback-control algorithms. In addition, hydraulic simulations were performed
    with and without an anticipatory feedforward routine. The feedback controller
    time step was 30 min while the flow control, or slave controller, time step was
    10 min. Each simulation was run under tuned conditions only (i.e., it was assumed
    that the controllers had perfect knowledge of the gate hydraulics and the canal
    properties). Table 3. Schedule of Flow Changes for SRP Test 4 (Wahlin 2002) Address

    the volume compensation (VC) method was used as the feedforward routine method.
    See Bautista et al. (2002) for more details on this method. MPC allows more options
    in applying feedforward routing than the LQR controller, since the known demands
    can be input into MPC and the feedforward response can be optimized along with
    the feedback response. However, this option was not utilized for this paper. Instead,
    the ID model was used to compute the necessary schedule of demand changes, and
    these changes were added to the MPC controller. More detailed discussions of the
    feedforward routines used in the simulations appear later in the paper. Hydraulic
    Pool Properties The hydraulic properties for the ID model were determined for
    all the pools using unsteady flow simulations with SOBEK, as outlined by Wahlin
    (2002). In this method, each pool in the canal system is analyzed individually.
    First, a hydraulic model of thepool is built within SOBEK. Next, the simulation
    program is run until the system reaches steady state at the design flow rate and
    the downstream water level is at the desired setpoint. Then, the inflow is increased
    over one time step by 20% from the steady state value while the outflow is kept
    constant. The water level at the downstream end of the pool rises when the wave
    reaches the end of the pool. Finally, the ID model parameters are graphically
    fit to the downstream water level response. These hydraulic properties were determined
    pool-by-pool based on the initial flow conditions for this test. The results are
    shown in Table 4. Table 4. Pool Properties for SRP Canal System Pool Q (cfs) Q

    and Tuning Controller design and tuning were based on the ID model parameters.
    Unsteady flow simulations were used to evaluate the aggressiveness of the controllers
    and to set one remaining tuning constant, as discussed later in the paper. Process
    Model The first step in controller design for this system is to put the ID model
    into state-space form, properly accounting for the branching. This was done with
    the procedure described in Wahlin and Clemmens (2006). The resulting state-transition
    matrix was used for designing all feedback controllers evaluated here. Linear
    Quadratic Regulator Once the state-transition relationships have been determined,
    tuning for LQR controllers only requires values of the relative penalties for
    the water level errors and the gate movements. To simplify the tuning process,
    Clemmens and Schuurmans (2004) suggest giving the same weight to water level errors
    in all pools and scaling the penalty for gate flow changes by the gate or canal
    capacity. This leads to the need for only one tuning parameter, R 1 , to express
    the trade-off between errors in water level and changes in gate movements. Note
    that Wahlin (2002) called this parameter ρ . This parameter essentially determines
    the aggressiveness of the controller. A smaller value of R 1 results in more aggressive
    control, but a controller that is too aggressive or underdamped will tend to overshoot
    and oscillate. A controller that is overdamped or not very aggressive will return
    to the setpoint too slowly. For the Upper Arizona Canal, Clemmens et al. (1997)
    used values of R 1 in the range of 3–5. For the steep ASCE Test Canal 1, Clemmens
    and Wahlin (2004) used R 1 =20 [see Clemmens et al. (1998) for more details on
    the ASCE Test Canal 1]. There appears to be a tendency for larger systems to require
    a smaller value of R 1 . Wahlin (2002) used an R 1 value of 5; however, the response
    appeared overdamped. For this paper, R 1 was set equal to 1. This value appears
    to give good control of the entire canal system. Design of an optimal LQR feedback
    controller in MATLAB for this large network takes a matter of minutes using a
    computer with a 1.6 GHz Pentium IV processor and 1.5 GB of RAM. Once the controller
    is designed, a simulation of 9 days takes only about 30 min to complete. However,
    the LQR controller is designed for one set of conditions. How the controller performs
    over the full range of situations encountered needs to be examined. This task
    was beyond the scope of this paper. Feedforward with Volume Compensation Existing
    LQR controller design methods do not explicitly deal with feedforward routing
    of known demand changes. Bautista et al. (2002) discuss various aspects of routing
    known demand changes through a canal. Hydraulic routing methods can result in
    significant oscillations in the upstream inflow. Experience has shown that simpler
    methods based on simple delay times are sufficient. For this paper, the volume
    compensation (VC) method was used; this method sets the delay time based on satisfying
    the changes in pool volume associated with changes in flow rate. Pool volumes
    for initial and final flow rates were determined with a steady-flow analysis performed
    with HEC-RAS (2002). A more complete discussion on selection of delay times is
    provided in Bautista and Clemmens (2005). For these simulations, the feedforward
    schedule was computed ahead of time based on the demand changes and their timing.
    Model Predictive Control In contrast to the LQR optimization which assumes an
    infinite prediction horizon, MPC’s prediction horizon is finite and has to be
    defined by two parameters: (1) the prediction horizon, p , and (2) the control
    horizon, m . MPC also has an optimization penalty function that expresses the
    trade-off between the water level errors and the gate flow changes. The penalty
    function is similar to that used in the LQR method, except as implemented, the
    penalty terms are actually squared. Both LQR and MPC use quadratic performance
    criteria, but the coefficients are handled differently. So, an LQR penalty of
    R 1 = 16 should be similar to an MPC penalty of R 1 =4. However, the correspondence
    likely is not exact because of the differences in prediction horizon. For this
    paper, R 1 was set equal to 1, and the control horizon m was set equal to 25.
    With a 30-min time step, m =25 would correspond to 12.5 h. This is more than enough
    time for any disturbance created at Stewart Mountain Dam to reach the downstream
    end of the Arizona, Grand, or South Canals based on the delay times in Table 4.
    Typically, the prediction horizon should be about twice the control horizon. However,
    to reduce computation time, p was set equal to 40. Once the parameters R 1 , m
    , and p have been selected, no further work needs to be done to implement MPC.
    One benefit to MPC is that optimization can be done based on current conditions
    and adjusted as conditions change (i.e., different delay times and backwater surface
    areas). The drawback is that MPC performs an optimization routine every time step,
    so the simulations run much slower than the simulations performed with the LQR
    controllers. Typically, 9 days of simulation of MPC control took 10–12 h using
    a computer with a 1.6 GHz Pentium IV processor and 1.5 GB of RAM. As mentioned
    earlier, MPC has the ability to determine feedforward schedules through optimization.
    Unfortunately, when used in combination with a feedback controller in MPC, the
    feedforward control actions are penalized with quadratic performance criteria.
    This tends to smooth out the feedforward control actions, making them ramps rather
    than step changes. Also with MPC, the feedforward time step would be the same
    as the feedback time step, namely 30 min. The VC feedforward method is typically
    applied at the flow-control time step, or 10 min. Overall, Wahlin (2002) found
    that performance using the optimized feedforward controller within MPC was degraded
    from results with the LQR feedback controller and the VC feedforward controller.
    To overcome this problem, the feedforward and feedback optimizations were performed
    independently. Initially, it was thought that this could be accomplished by setting
    the penalty R 1 equal to zero when the feedforward optimization was performed.
    However, when this was done, there were huge oscillations in the flow rate. Thus
    some nonzero penalty is required in order for the optimization procedure to work
    correctly. Since the intent of this paper was not to examine optimization of feedforward
    methods, but rather to demonstrate the application of the existing technology
    to branching canal networks, a simpler approach was taken. Since the MPC approach
    is based on the ID model, use of the delay times from the ID model should result
    in perfect feedforward control when applied back to the ID modeled canal. Thus
    the ID model delay times were used to determine the feedforward control response
    for MPC. For example, if the demand change is 1 m 3 /s (35.3 cfs) at 12:00 p.m.,
    then a 1 m 3 /s (35.3 cfs) change is made at all upstream gates, all the way to
    Stewart Mountain Dam. The timing of the flow change is based on the delay time
    of the pools (see Table 4). If the pool where the change occurs has a delay time
    of 20 min, then the change at the gate on the upstream end of that pool occurs
    at 11:40 a.m. If the next pool upstream has a delay time of 60 min, then the next
    gate upstream is adjusted at 10:40 a.m., and so on. This is essentially inverting
    the ID model. For these tests, this ID model-based feedforward schedule is computed
    ahead of time for the scheduled demand changes. If the requested flow change had
    not been requested at or before the time of the feedforward control action, it
    was delayed until the next control action, 10 min later. Thus there could be a
    delay of up to 9.9 min in implementation of a requested check-gate flow change.
    Results Feedforward Schedules Fig. 3 shows the feedforward schedules for Test
    4 based on the VC method and on the inversion of the ID model. Clearly, the VC
    delay times are much longer than the ID delay times, thus the flow changes upstream
    occur much sooner. For the ID model, the first change occurs 550 min before the
    scheduled demand change, compared to 756 min for VC (roughly 1/3 longer).However,
    the total volume supplied by the two schedules after the transient period is similar:
    277,600 m 3 (225 acre-ft) and 276,600 m 3 (224 acre-ft) for the VC and ID methods,
    respectively. The difference is roughly 0.3%. However, in terms of the relative
    change from the initial flow, the changes are 5,700 m 3 (4.6 acre-ft) and 4,800
    m 3 (3.9 acre-ft), respectively, or a 20% difference in net volume change. Fig.

    Results The simulation results for each controller are presented in terms of deviation
    in water level from the setpoint. The water level errors for these 31 pools are
    displayed as five separate graphs: (a) pools in the upper part of the Arizona
    Canal, including the Salt River; (b) pools in the lower part of the Arizona Canal;
    (c) pools in the upper part of the Grand Canal; (d) pools in the lower part of
    the Grand Canal; and (e) pools in the South Canal. The results for the LQR controller
    with feedback only (LQR-FB) are shown in Fig. 4. For this test, the water levels
    are in the red zone as they deviate by more than 0.122 m (0.4 ft) for long periods
    of time. These water level deviations are clearly unacceptable from an operational
    standpoint. Deviations of up to 1 m (3.3 ft) are seen in the lower Grand Canal
    [see Fig. 4(d), note scale change]. It is also clear that it would literally take
    days to stabilize water levels in this branching canal system with feedback control
    for this simulation test. Since demand changes typically are made each day, it
    is understandable why these canals are always in a transient state during the
    main water-use season. Fig. 4. Test 4 simulation results for the fully centralized
    PI controller with feedback only (LQR-FB) Fig. 5 shows the results of the MPC
    controller under feedback only (MPC-FB). The results are very similar to the LQR
    results. There are a few minor differences in the maximum deviations of some of
    the curves, but this could be attributed to subtle differences in tuning. Overall,
    the response is very similar. This is reassuring since both methods optimize based
    on the same process model. Fig. 5. Test 4 simulation results for the MPC controller
    with feedback only (MPC-FB) Fig. 6 shows the results from applying the LQR feedback
    controller with the VC-based feedforward schedule (LQR-FB VC-FF). Here it can
    be seen that most water levels stay within the green zone [0.076 m (0.25 ft)].
    Those that deviate do so only for a very short time. Some of the pools on the
    upper portion of the Grand Canal deviate into the red zone for several hours [see
    Fig. 6(c)]. However, overall, this is reasonable performance. Fig. 6. Test 4 simulation
    results for the fully centralized PI controller with feedback and VC-based feedforward
    (LQR-FB VC-FF) The simulation results using MPC with feedback and ID-based feedforward
    (MPC-FB ID-FF) are shown in Fig. 7. Most water levels deviate from their target
    levels for only short periods of time and most do not cross into the red zone.
    A notable exception is again in the upper portion of the Grand Canal [see Fig.
    7(c)], where several pools deviate by 0.20 m (0.6 ft) for several hours. Overall,
    however, this is reasonable performance and would be acceptable in an operational
    setting. Fig. 7. Test 4 simulation results for the MPC controller with feedback
    and ID-based feedforward (MPC-FB ID-FF) Discussion Both the LQR controllers and
    MPC were able to effectively control a large portion of SRP’s canal system when
    known demands were accounted for with an anticipatory feedforward schedule (i.e.,
    demand changes were routed through canal). All of the controllers were able to
    bring the water levels back to their setpoints and keep them there. This is a
    promising result and indicates that both of these controllers can effectively
    control branching canal networks. Many simplifications have been made to the SRP
    canal network model (e.g., generalized cross sections, grouped offtakes, modified
    control structures, etc.). Although these simplifications create minor differences
    in the hydraulic model, they may lead to more significant differences in the field.
    Although the controller performance on this branched network is promising, further
    field studies are needed before the controllers’ performance can be judged under
    real operating conditions. Feedback Control and Tuning With similar tuning, the
    LQR and MPC techniques produced similar results. No attempts were made to evaluate
    the effects of differences between assumed and actual conditions on the performance
    of these controllers. That is the subject of future research. It is well known
    that ID model parameters for a given pool change with flow rate and with changes
    in flow resistance that can occur over the season. The VC method takes these changes
    into account since pool volumes are determined as a function of flow rate, Manning
    n , and downstream water level setpoint (Bautista and Clemmens 2005). Accounting
    for these differences with the LQR controller under feedback alone (LQR-FB) would
    require a different set of controller constants for each set of hydraulic conditions.
    Preliminary results suggest that the feedback controller performance is not as
    strongly influenced by pool properties as the feedforward control. Still, determining
    what range of conditions are appropriate for a given controller and rules for
    changing controller constants as hydraulic conditions change (gain scheduling)
    have not been fully evaluated. MPC offers some advantages in this regard since
    the optimization can be performed based on the current state of the system (e.g.,
    current flow rates, Manning n , downstream water levelsetpoint), assuming that
    the analysis has been done ahead of time to determine appropriate values for these
    parameters over a range of conditions. Efficient ways of determining these parameters
    is also the subject of future research. For the current study, it appears that
    the feedback controller tuning with R 1 =1 is appropriate for both controllers.
    In general, the curves in Figs. 4 and 5 show some minor overshoot in some cases
    and most of the water levels return to their setpoints without oscillating. Only
    a few pools show oscillations around the setpoint and these are likely caused
    by interference among the pools. In practice, the controllers would have additional
    damping since the conditions of the canal are generally not known with great accuracy.
    At the present time, selection of these tuning weights is done by trial and error.
    Anticipatory Feedforward Control These results demonstrate that it is very important
    to route known demand changes through a canal system. Feedback alone will never
    be able to do the job. It is also clear that the feedforward timing is not critical.
    The timing for upstream flow changes for the VC-based feedforward controller (VC-FF)
    was much sooner than for the ID-based feedforward controller (ID-FF), yet the
    results were not greatly different. Of interest is the upper portion of the Grand
    Canal. For the VC-based feedforward controller’s early flow changes, it can be
    seen from Fig. 6(c) that the water levels dropped. The negative flow changes in
    the lower portion of the Grand Canal (see Table 3) arrived too soon. In contrast,
    the water levels initially rise using the ID-based feedforward controller [see
    Fig. 7(c)], suggesting that the negative flow changes arrived too late. In this
    case, the timing of flow changes likely should have been in between the values
    computed by the two feedforward methods. Good timing will not necessarily get
    rid of these spikes all together because they are caused by the dispersion of
    the wave as it travels downstream (i.e., the flow wave arrives gradually at the
    downstream end of the pool). The best results are when the positive and negative
    magnitude of each spike has about the same absolute value. Overall this suggests
    that there is room for improvement in determining both the VC-based and the ID-based
    delay time. It also suggests the need to develop a common set of parameters useful
    for both feedback and feedforward models. Again, that is beyond the scope of this
    paper. Conclusions There are several important conclusions that can be made based
    on the various simulation results. These conclusions are summarized below. • In
    the simulation studies, the LQR and MPC feedback controllers were able to return
    the water levels to their setpoints for a large portion of SRP’s branching canal
    network, although the performance of both of these controllers would not be acceptable
    in an operational setting. Controller performance is greatly improved when known
    demand changes were routed with an anticipatory feedforward routing scheme; •
    For this network example of the Salt River Project, combined feedback-feedforward
    controllers were able to keep water levels within acceptable limits (green zone)
    except for a few short-duration spikes during transient conditions; • The LQR
    and MPC feedback controllers had similar results when tuned with equivalent tuning
    parameters and when the same process model was used for both controllers; • Feedforward
    routing with delays based on the volume compensation method performed somewhat
    better than when routing with delays based on the integrator-delay model; and
    • A more accurate process model may be able to improve both feedback and feedforward
    control. Notation The following symbols are used in this paper: A s = surface

    2  ABSTRACT Clogging problems in emitters have been the major limitations for
    adoption of microirrigation systems, mainly drip irrigation. When clogging is
    caused by chemical agents, the treatment intended for pH adjustment constitutes
    a feasible solution, as it determines the conditions for ion precipitation,  and
    therefore emitters clogging. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency
    of three feedback control logic   systems for automated adjustment of water pH
    in microirrigation systems. The following control logic was tuned and evaluated
    for water pH adjustment using a control system coupled with an   acid  injection
    device: proportional integral controller (PI),  modified proportional integral
    derivative (MPID) , proportional integral derivative (PID).  These control logic
    systems were efficient for adjusting water pH. Settling times of   PID, PI and
    MPID controllers were 19.0, 20.0 and 68.5s, respectively.   The Integral Time
    Absolute Error (ITAE) was 188.7 (PID), 239.4 (PI) and 3083.3 MPID, which shows

    PIM, and PID) in adjusting the pH of irrigation water in a microirrigation system
    to minimize emitter clogging.
  relevance_evaluation: This study is highly relevant to the point of discussion regarding
    closed-loop control and feedback mechanisms in the context of automated irrigation
    systems. It provides empirical evidence of the effectiveness of feedback loops
    in adjusting the pH of irrigation water in real-time based on sensor data, ensuring
    the optimal performance of the system and mitigating the risk of emitter clogging.

  description: One of the most important factors for successful agricultural production
    is the irrigation system in place. In this study, a precision irrigation system,
    which takes advantage of the various phases of plant growth, was developed and
    implemented using the sensor network technology integrated with IOS/Android. The
    amount of water in the soil was measured via sensors that were placed on certain
    points of the area to be irrigated. These sensors were placed near the root of
    the product. Data from sensors was transmitted via Wi-Fi in real-time to a mobile
    phone based on IOS/Android. In the light of obtained data, the seasonal precision
    irrigation system was created depending on the amount of water required by the
    plants at each stage of their growth stage. The required energy of the system
    was provided by solar energy. The system can be controlled by smart phones, which
    increases the usability of the system. When design performance was analyzed, it
    was observed that some important advantages such as obtaining high efficiency
    with water, time and energy saving and reducing the workforce were ensured. Five
    separate laterals were used for the irrigation system. There were valves on each
    lateral, which realized the opening and closing process depending on the water
    need. A total of 16 humidity sensors were used in the irrigation system and the
    data from these sensors was transferred to the IOS/Android server via the programmable
    controller (PLC). The basic electrical equipment in the irrigation system was
    monitored and controlled via mobile devices. Control parameters were obtained
    by comparing the real values and reference values by a closed-loop system and
    determine the new working status of the irrigation system.

    Turkey and many similarly agricultural countries have great problems in the irrigation
    process due to a scarcity of water resources. Although major changes and improvements
    have been seen in Turkey’s agricultural policies, the overconsumption of water
    resources exacerbates the problem. The export situation resulting from the plants
    grown and influencing the quality directly reveals the importance of water consumption
    [1]. The agriculture in Turkey needs more assistance for farms and farmers, more
    advanced research in recent available agricultural technologies, more automation,
    and more testing and applying new methods of study, analysis, and mechanization.
    The soil moisture sensor measures the amount of moisture in the soil. The measurement
    is done by immersing probes on the sensor. The depth of measurement may vary depending
    on the plant species. This means that the probes are close to the root of the
    plant. The working principle of the soil moisture sensors is that there is a voltage
    difference between the tips of the probes due to the resistance of the soil. Increasing
    the amount of moisture (wetness) in the ground increases its conductivity. Thus,
    the amount of moisture is measured according to the magnitude of the voltage difference.
    The requests to use information technology to a larger extent in irrigation systems
    are increasing by the day. Many technological methods are used in irrigation systems
    [2,3,4,5,6]. When these methods are considered, using smart phones and tablets
    has become widespread. Becoming a small computer system, wireless and portable
    structure, operating fast and having the wide memory capacity are important factors
    to spread the use of these devices. These factors make the use of mobile devices
    attractive for many applications such as environmental controls, health service
    monitoring, security, transportation and automation [7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25].
    This paper studies the application of Precision Irrigation (PI) using sensor network
    technology (SNT), which emerged as a management practice with the potential to
    increase profits by utilizing more precise information about agricultural resources
    through sensing and communication technology in Turkey and takes the crops as
    a specific example for investigating a possible PI solution using Sensor Network
    Technology (SNT) integrated with IOS/Android application. The application is an
    automated agricultural irrigation system, which is controlled on mobile devices
    based on IOS/Android and is capable of monitoring the irrigation levels. The mobile
    device software was defined as agRapp. The system measures the water quantity
    of the soil via sensors placed at different points near the roots of products
    and transmits the data via PLC to mobile devices. Thus, the operating status of
    the irrigation system is defined according to the water level inside the soil.
    The most important property of this study, which differentiates it from previous
    studies, is defining the required water level by product depending on growth stages.
    Initially, during crop development, mid-season and late season stages, the system
    defines the required water level through developed software. Moreover, alternative
    energy resources are used to meet the required energy level. It has already been
    known that solar power reduces the energy cost [26,27,28,29,30,31,32], therefore
    solar power was used in this study. Today, using water efficiently in agricultural
    irrigation systems is very important. Although this situation may lead to the
    development of different irrigation systems, it is still necessary to increase
    the efficiency. For this reason, the development of an irrigation system that
    takes into consideration the periodic water needs of the plants as well as the
    water condition of the soil gains great importance. In addition, the plant’s water
    need should be monitored continuously, not instantaneously. In this study, an
    automatic irrigation system was developed which can be monitored and controlled
    via mobile devices. In this system, in addition to the seasonal water needs of
    plants, irrigation is carried out by taking into account the continuous values
    taken from the humidity sensors. 2. Irrigation System The amount of water that
    needs to be used should be calculated as accurately as possible in order to make
    irrigation projects more effective. Essential for calculating the irrigation water
    requirement is knowledge of evapotranspiration [33,34]. The storage and capacity
    of the system transmission structure are projected and constructed according to
    this knowledge. The healthy way for calculating of evapotranspiration is to use
    one of the direct measurement methods. However, researchers have developed analytical
    equations that can be used to estimate the evapotranspiration due to the high
    cost and time demands of the direct measurement method. The United Nations Food
    and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recommends the Penman Monteith method to determine
    the crop water requirement for assisting the sizing of the irrigation projects
    in developing countries. It is aimed to calculate the healthy evapotranspiration
    with the crop coefficient (kc) determined by the climate and soil data of the
    irrigation area. The reference evapotranspiration (ETo) has been used, and required
    climate data has been obtained from the website of the Turkish State Meteorological
    Service (www.mgm.gov.tr) in order to use the FAO Penman Monteith method [33].
    𝐸 𝑇 𝑜 = 0.408×∆×( 𝑅 𝑛 −𝐺)+𝛾×( 900 𝑇+273 )× 𝑢 2 ×( 𝑒 𝑠 − 𝑒 𝑎 ) ∆+𝛾×(1+0.34× 𝑢 2
    ) (1) Here, ETo: Reference evapotranspiration (mm day−1), Rn: Net radiation (MJ
    m−2 day−1), G: Soil temperature flux density (MJ m−2 day−1), T: The average daily
    air temperature (°C), u2: 2 m height wind speed (m s−1), es: Saturated vapor pressure
    (kPa), ea: Actual steam pressure (kPa), Δ: The slope of the vapor pressure curve
    (kPa/°C−1), γ: Psychometric constant (kPa). Climate data obtained from the meteorological
    station 17084 belongs to Çorum/Center and is shown in Table 1 and Table 2. This
    data is used to define the water requirement necessary for crops to be grown.
    Table 1. Çorum/Center climate/ evapotranspiration (ETo) data. Table 2. Çorum/Center
    rain data. The reference plant is walnut for FAO Penman Monteith method. Evapotranspiration
    values for walnut have been calculated as follows [33,34]; Etc = kc × ETo (2)
    The kc value varies from plant to plant and refers to the plant’s water needs.
    The characteristics that determine the value of kc are plant species, height,
    growth phases, light reflectance value of the soil, and plant surfaces, climate
    and soil. In addition, while each plant’s kc values vary, the kc value in each
    phase of a plant’s growth process varies. Seasonal kc values obtained for walnuts
    are shown in Figure 1. As seen in Figure 1, if the planned date is chosen as 11
    April, the product is harvested approximately 173 days later. Figure 1. Çorum/Center
    crop kc values. Determination of seasonal plant water needs as well as physical
    properties of the soil in the cultivated areas are important. The values of soil
    type Red Sandy determined as a working area in this study are given in Figure
    2. Figure 2. Soil information belonging to area. Obtained climate data and the
    value of crop water requirements, depending on seasonal development and land property,
    are shown in Table 3. According to Table 3, the total water demand in the process
    of growing the product has been identified as 197 mm/dec. The cultivated plant
    is an adult walnut tree. The seasonal irrigation information of the walnut is
    shown in Figure 1. According to Figure 1, the product irrigation was started on
    11 April 2016 and the harvest was done on 30 September 2016. Figure 3 shows the
    need for seasonal water of walnut. Figure 3. Control system diagram. Table 3.
    Crop water requirements. 3. System Architecture The experiment was conducted in
    the walnut land with 600 m2 in Çorum. Water that was transferred from the well
    to the water tank with 5000 L by the booster was connected to irrigation laterals
    via a filter. Valves that were positioned in front of each lateral were the basis
    of the control field. Energy requirements of the system were met when the solar
    panels had 2.2 kW total power. The block diagram of the irrigation control system
    is presented in Figure 3. According to Figure 3, moisture values obtained from
    the sensors were transferred to the PLC via input components. This data received
    from the PLC was transferred to the smart phone via the IOS/Andriod server for
    monitoring and control purposes. In the system operation, the current water requirement
    of the plant was determined depending on the seasonal water requirement in previous
    years. If the water ratio is less than necessary, the water tank was operated
    via the PLC output, ensuring that the valves remain open until the desired amount
    of water is supplied. When the data from the sensors indicated that the required
    amount of water was reached, irrigation automatically ended. If the amount of
    water was excessive due to rainfall or other reasons, irrigation was not carried
    out. All numerical values of the above-mentioned operations can also be monitored
    via the mobile device. The irrigation system consists of five parallel side pipes
    with 20 m length connecting to the main pipe (Figure 4). The control of parallel
    pipes was separately ensured by valves that were placed in front of the side pipes.
    The amount of water in the soil was defined by sensors that were placed in regions
    close to the root portion of the product. This digital data was transferred to
    the PLC (control unit). Opening and closing conditions of valves on each lateral
    were set according to defined data. At this point, data was automatically saved
    to database columns consisting of the lateral number, sensor number, date and
    time. Also, a column was created in the database for adjusting the water requirement
    of cultivated plants depending on their stage. Device usage and their properties
    were given as follows Figure 4. (a) Sensors placement in the land; (b) Sensors
    map in the irrigation system. Five different laterals used in irrigation systems
    were 20 m long each and there were valves at their ends to provide irrigation.
    The most important disadvantage of these laterals is congestion caused by the
    accumulation of stones or sand. A filter system was used to remove this congestion
    and obtain more healthy data. 3.1. Water Booster The power of the booster (Sumak
    Pump Corporation ltd., Istanbul, Turkey) is 2.2 Kw monophonic. It has 4–5 bar
    working pressure and 5–6 m3/h water pumping. 3.2. Water Tank The water tank with
    5 tons was used for storing and resting of the water taken from water wells. 3.3.
    Filter The appropriate filter (Kalyon Filter Corporation Ltd., Izmir, Turkey),
    which is in the plastic filter groups from ¾′′ to 3′′ and 50 m3/s, was chosen
    to eliminate bottlenecks that can occur in the pipe system. The main features
    of this filter are easily removable for rinsing and there is a semi-automatic
    cleaning feature. 3.4. Valves Electro-valves were used for controlling the water
    amount going into the lateral drip system. Five laterals that normally have closed
    contacts and operate with 12 Vdc were used separately. 3.5. Soil Moisture Sensor
    Sixteen units DS 200 soil moisture sensor (Bejing Dingtek Tehnology Corporation
    Ltd., Beijing, China), were used to measure the amount of water in the soil. The
    Ht-1 type sensor has some advantages such as high stability, easy operation, and
    maintenance, and it can measure soil moisture and temperature at the same time.
    Also, it can be calibrated. Moreover, it has Tr-3100 type of tightness and protection
    rank ip68. It operates with 5–24 Vdc source. The output signal is 0–1 Vdc, 0–2.5
    Vdc, 0–5 Vdc, 0–10 Vdc, 4–20 ma and rs485. The DS200 humidity sensor is preferred
    because it is economical, leak-proof, long-term use, corrosion protection, and
    high transmission distance. The reason for our discussion of calibration is the
    presence of trimpot on some sensors and sensitivity adjustment here. However,
    the DS200 humidity sensor has an accuracy of ±2% which is a very good value. The
    reason we discuss this here is that we would advise to be careful when choosing
    a sensor for such work. 3.6. Solar Panel and Setup Solar panels have been used
    to meet AC and DC energy system requirements. The figure of established panels
    is given in Figure 5. Figure 5. Established solar panels. 3.7. Control Unit The
    power unit was formed into two separate sections—AC and DC—considering the amount
    of energy taken from solar panels. The block diagram of the power supply that
    is used in DC systems is given in Figure 6. Figure 6. Power supply block diagram.
    The infrastructure system was generated by bringing together hardware components
    to use the precision irrigation system in IOS/Android-based operating systems.
    A view of the developed infrastructure is illustrated in Figure 7. Figure 7. Block
    diagram of IOS/Android controlling unit. 3.8. Irrigation System Operation The
    flowchart of the software is given in Figure 8. Figure 8. The flowchart of the
    software. In the software that can operate in IOS/Android based systems, information
    belonging to sensors or lateral is given; at the same time, operating information
    belonging to the desired sensor appears on the screen. The main screen view is
    given in Figure 9, and the user should use the data input section to perform data
    entry belonging to the product. The pump menu should be used to control the pumps,
    the moisture menu should be used for sensor information, and the valve menu should
    be used for controlling the valves. Moreover, values depending on the stage of
    plant growth and water requirements could be watched in monitoring menu and software
    information could be followed in information menu. Figure 9. Smart phone monitoring
    page. (a) Home screen, (b) Sensor Menu, (c) Sensor 1’ e moisture value. 4. Discussion
    The precision irrigation system was designed as a closed-loop control system.
    In the designed control system, the data obtained with the reference data were
    compared and thus real-time monitoring is provided in addition to the water efficiency.
    Reference values in the study were determined according to Equations (1) and (2).
    This data indicates the seasonal water needs of the walnut tree. The amount of
    rainfall in previous years was used as data when water demand was determined.
    This data was taken from Turkish State Meteorological Center. At the same time,
    daily water needs were determined at a lower level. The obtained data were arranged
    in an algorithmic way into the PLC program. The data obtained from the sensors
    were compared with the periodical water requirement table and the working status
    of the system was revealed. While studies reported before in the literature mostly
    focus on the opening and closing operations of drip irrigation system, in this
    study, the opening and closing operations were determined according to the seasonal
    water need. In the studies shown in the references, especially those related to
    the drip irrigation system, only water irrigation was done from the sensors based
    on the humidity condition of the soil. Dating from October to harvest, average
    monthly moisture results obtained from 16 sensors in five different laterals are
    given in Figure 10. As can be seen in Figure 10, the moisture rate decreases especially
    during the summer season. When this situation is compared with climatic data,
    it is shown that these results are close to average values. Figure 10. Monthly
    average moisture. Moisture values that were obtained from sensors during the day
    and depend on four separate stages are given in Figure 11. Figure 11. The average
    moisture values are occurring in the sensor during the day (Mid. Stage). Values
    were obtained from equalities, which were used to define the amount of water needed
    in the product growth stage, and given daily in Figure 12, Figure 13, Figure 14
    and Figure 15 respectively. Figure 12. Int. Stage water requirement. Figure 13.
    Dev. Stage water requirement. Figure 14. Mid. Stage water requirement. Figure
    15. End stage water requirement. In Figure 16, a comparison was done between the
    total amount of water to be supplied and that which was actually supplied to plants.
    It can be seen in Figure 16 that plants’ water requirement especially increases
    after the development stage. Moreover, it is clear that calculated values and
    real values are close to each other and a precision irrigation process is achieved.
    Figure 16. Amount of water depending on the stage of plant growth and used amount
    of water. Resulting from the leveling of product growth area, it can be seen that
    average moisture values in each lateral are close together. This situation was
    effective in reducing energy and water consumption. 5. Conclusions This study
    shows that precision irrigation systems with moisture sensors are extremely advantageous
    for growing crops in agricultural systems. In the study, when equations used to
    determine the amount of water required in the plant growth stages and obtained
    climatic data are considered, it is identified that appropriately meeting the
    amount of water determined for each period is effective for agriculture growth.
    Thus, an important advantage is obtained by adjusting the amount of water needed
    in the plant growth stages and by consuming the water depending on the soil moisture
    with classic drip irrigation systems. When the total water demand is calculated
    as 197 mm/dec, it actualizes as 211 mm/dec in the application. This value can
    be obtained only with software changes in the system. Nowadays, important savings
    have been achieved in energy costs by using solar energy. When the installation
    costs are considered, it can be understood that the installation costs can be
    met in three harvest periods. When the technological point of view is taken into
    account, the system can be operated through integration with smart phones. Thence,
    all system can be controlled and tracked by these devices. Especially if one considers
    that smart phones are widely used, it is obvious that the system is highly accessible.
    Moreover, there is about a 60% decrease in the labor force with the precision
    irrigation system. A farmer’s daily work time in the field is taken into account
    while this value is calculated and is dramatically reduced by the methods illustrated
    above. Author Contributions Mehmet Fatih Işık, Cemal Yılmaz and Yusuf Sönmez conceived

  description: 'Fertigation is an irrigation technology of integration of water and
    fertilizer, and has been widely used in micro-irrigation systems, because of uniform
    fertilization, high utilization of water and fertilizer, and effectively reducing
    the pollution of soil and environment. The venturi fertilizer injector has become
    one of the main means and important equipment to achieve fertigation due to its
    simple structure, economy, and practicability, but the liquid fertilizer concentration
    could not be easily adjusted automatically. In order to realize variable rate
    fertilization with a venturi fertilizer injector, a variable fertilizer apparatus
    based on PWM (pulse width modulation) technology has been developed, but the apparatus
    belongs to open-loop control from the perspective of automatic control, and its
    accuracy and stability is difficult to guarantee. Therefore, a closed-loop control
    automatic fertilizer-mixing device was developed to improve the liquid fertilizer
    concentration mixing accuracy and stability, by improving the structure of the
    variable fertilizer apparatus and adding a conductivity meter that was employed
    to feedback the real-time fertilizer solution concentration indirectly. The conductivity
    meter was designed based on a conductivity electrode, and a square signal whose
    amplitude is ±3.5 V was determined as the excitation signal of the conductivity
    meter through experiments, to weaken or even eliminate polarization effects and
    capacitance effects of the conductivity electrode in the measuring process. In
    order to further improve measuring accuracy, temperature compensation had been
    applied to the conductivity meter, the measuring range had been divided into several
    small-scale ranges which could be switched by a multiplexer ADG1408 controlled
    by a microcontroller, and the corresponding divider resistor and square signal
    frequency of each small scale range were determined by experiments. By comparison
    with a standard conductivity meter, whose model is sension 156, the effective
    measuring range of the conductivity meter designed was 0-12.64 mS/cm, and the
    conductivity meter designed was calibrated according to the data measured in the
    effective measuring range. It was known that the conductivity of the fertilizer
    solution measured by the conductivity meter has a significant linear relationship
    (the coefficient of determination R2 is 0.997) with the fertilizer solution concentration,
    based on conductivity testing of a series of different concentration fertilizer
    solutions prepared in the range of 0.1%-1.0%. In order to improve the control
    performance of the automatic fertilizer mixing device, a kind of control strategy
    of two-step regulating with coarse adjustment and fine adjustment was employed:
    first, the device adjusted the duty cycle of PWM for controlling the solenoid
    valve to mix fertilizer automatically, by calling the corresponding function based
    on the detected inlet water pressure; then the device uses a fuzzy control algorithm
    to regulate the duty cycle of PWM finely, according to the real-time fertilizer
    solution concentration measured by the designed conductivity meter, in order to
    make the mixed fertilizer concentration get close to the target concentration
    as much as possible. An actual test and verification had been undertaken for the
    fertilizer mixing device, and the results showed that the maximum error of the
    mixed fertilizer concentration was 0.04% and the response time of the control
    device for achieving steady-state was 7.8-10.4 s, and it is now known that the
    device can meet the requirements of practical application in agriculture.'

  explanation: The paper entitled "Design and Experiment of a Fertilizer Automatic
    Mixing Device Based on Fuzzy Control" presents a closed-loop automated mixing
    device that utilizes a fuzzy control algorithm to regulate the concentration of
    fertilizer solution. The device employs a modified venturi variable fertilizer
    applicator and an electrical conductivity meter to continuously monitor the fertilizer
    concentration and adjust the pulse width modulation (PWM) of the solenoid valve
    accordingly.
  extract_1: The experimental results showed that the effective measurement range
    of the electrical conductivity meter is 0~12.64 mS/cm, and the electrical conductivity
    it measures has a significant linear relationship with the fertilizer concentration,
    with a coefficient of determination R² of 0.997.
  extract_2: The real-time feedback of the fertilizer concentration by the electrical
    conductivity meter and the further fine-tuning of the PWM's duty cycle using the
    fuzzy control algorithm enable the fertilizer concentration to be as close as
    possible to the target concentration.

    PWM（pulse width modulation）控制的占空比进行混肥；然后以电导率测量仪实时反馈混肥浓度，并采用模糊控制算法进一步细调PWM的占空比，使混肥浓度尽量逼近目标浓度。试验结果表明，电导率测量仪的有效测量范围为0~12.64
    mS/cm，它所测量的电导率与肥液浓度呈显著的线性关系，其决定系数 R2为0.997。对混肥装置进行了实测验证，结果表明混肥时的最大浓度误差为0.04%，控制装置达到稳态的响应时间为7.8～10.4

    EN FR Recently, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) prepared a Manual
    of Practice (MOP) on canal automation for irrigation systems. Formally referred
    to as MOP 131 Canal Automation for Irrigation Systems, this book focuses on the
    technical aspects of modernizing irrigation systems through the use of automated
    canal control systems. MOP 131 is an essential reference for professionals in
    agricultural and irrigation engineering, as well as owners, managers, and operators
    of irrigation water delivery systems. Canal automation saves water and improves
    the efficiency of irrigation water supply projects or of irrigation district operations.
    Recent technological and engineering advances now enable more accurate control
    of water deliveries throughout all parts of an irrigation project. Using information
    collected from irrigation systems around the world in conjunction with new advances
    in control theory research, this MOP examines how and when to implement canal
    automation within the context of canal modernization. In addition, MOP 131 provides

    Ltd. Background Canal automation always has had the potential to save water and
    improve efficiency of irrigation water supply projects or of irrigation district
    operations. Recently, there have been a number of technological and engineering
    advances in the field of canal automation. While these advances have been documented
    via conference proceedings and peer-reviewed journal articles, a comprehensive
    document outlining the state of the art in canal automation was lacking. The American
    Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) decided to fill this void by commissioning the
    development of the Manual of Practice (MOP) 131: Canal Automation for Irrigation
    Systems (Wahlin and Zimbelman, 2014). MOP 131 was developed by the Task Committee
    on Recent Advances in Canal Automation (TCRACA) which was formed under the Irrigation
    Delivery and Drainage Systems (IDDS) Committee under the Environmental and Water
    Resources Institute (EWRI) of ASCE. Note that EWRI is an entity within ASCE that
    focuses on water resources instead of civil engineering in general. The TCRACA
    members gathered information on canal automation research and practice from around
    the world in their efforts to document the application of new technology to the
    progress of designing and implementing irrigation canal automation. The TCRACA
    was a truly international effort with researchers and practitioners from the USA,
    the Netherlands, Australia, France, Spain, Portugal, China, and Mexico all participating
    in the development of MOP 131. MOP 131 is designed to provide guidance on how
    and when to implement canal automation within the context of canal modernization
    but not covering the full range of canal modernization issues. The manual also
    provides practical guidance on some of the more routine aspects of canal automation.
    Note that while MOP 131 was developed by the cooperative efforts of eight different
    countries, it has not been formally adopted by the administrations of those countries.
    Historical Perspective on Canal Automation In order to plan for a successful canal
    modernization program, with measurable goals and objectives, that provides water
    users (irrigators) with improved flexibility, it is not only interesting but also
    very helpful to review how the science of irrigation canal automation arrived
    at today''s technology. For purposes of this paper, a historic review will principally
    be from the perspective of the USA. A broader perspective would require more time
    and space than allowed herein. Then, as now, members of ASCE, working through
    committees of what was then the Irrigation and Drainage Division, which later
    merged into EWRI, paved the way for presenting and discussing improved operations
    of irrigation water supply systems. Their deliberations were published in 1968
    as Automation of Irrigation and Drainage Systems which contained papers from a
    conference held in Phoenix, Arizona, in the United States (ASCE, 1968). A paper
    by the Salt River Project (SRP), a United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR)
    project, discussed efforts to develop a supervisory control system for distribution
    canal operations that relied on new technology to measure gate openings, compute
    gate flows, monitor water levels, transmit data to a centralized operations center,
    and remotely move gates. During the same general time period, the California Department
    of Water Resources (DWR) was in the process of designing the United States'' largest
    state-built water and power project to move water from northern California to
    cities and irrigators in water-short southern California. This project became
    known as the State Water Project (SWP). Power usage and power generation were
    to be key elements of the SWP along with the multibasin transfer of water. Optimizing
    power generation and movement of water, while minimizing power usage, required
    the development of an innovative canal operation strategy. The research developed
    from this project was presented in several publications from 1964 to 1976 and
    included topics such as hydraulic transients, check structure hydraulics, and
    computerized control. The research also resulted in the formulation of a computerized
    model of the aqueduct that simulated unsteady flow in the SWP. The USBR has the
    primary responsibility for the design and construction of water resource infrastructure
    for the purpose of providing irrigation water to irrigable lands in the western
    United States. As such, the USBR took the early lead in investigating ways of
    enhancing the operational efficiency of irrigation water supply districts (projects).
    While weirs, flumes, sluice gates, and radial gates were in common usage, the
    integration of electromechanical devices to make the task of water masters and
    ditch riders easier, more precise, and timelier, came about as a result of the
    USBR directing its researchers and design engineers to take a leadership role
    in the early development of canal automation equipment and procedures. Subsequently,
    the USBR published Water System Automation–a State of the Art Report (USBR, 1973).
    Concepts presented in this reference, for example that optimum operation will
    result only from proper control of the entire system, are still applicable today.
    ASCE''s Irrigation and Drainage Division moved the technology forward in 1987
    by organizing a conference in Portland, Oregon, called Planning, Operation, Rehabilitation
    and Automation of Irrigation Water Delivery Systems (ASCE, 1987). This included
    presentations by French engineers discussing their implementation of dynamic regulation
    in the system of Canal De Provence, NEYRTEC automatic equipment, and BIVAL for
    downstream control. Dr John Merriam introduced a definition for flexibility as
    being when the irrigator has control of the frequency, rate, and duration of flow.
    Only through maximizing flexibility can the irrigator maximize their productivity
    and economic return. Through the programs and projects of his employer, the World
    Bank, Herve Plusquellec was able to make presentations to many canal operators
    and water supply agencies throughout the world using a comprehensive state-of-the-art
    35-mm slide presentation (Plusquellec, 1988). Mr Plusquellec was instrumental
    in bringing the concepts of improved canal operations and modernization to many
    who had previously not been aware of such concepts and ideas. This was followed
    by USBR''s publication entitled Canal Systems Automation Manual (USBR, 1991).
    This publication was an update of previous USBR publications with discussions
    on the practical aspects of canal operation, control, and automation. The manual
    began with fundamentals and basic concepts, continued with more specific details,
    and finished with the more complex aspects of control theory analysis. The manual
    was divided into three parts that address three levels of readership: Volume 1–water
    users and operators, Volume 2–planning and design engineers, and Volume 3–research
    and development specialists. Understanding that to move the field of canal automation
    forward required that researchers and designers be able to model unsteady flow
    in a canal system, ASCE''s Irrigation and Drainage Division undertook the task
    of providing a definitive treatise on unsteady flow modeling of canals (ASCE,
    1993). Later, an EWRI task committee created a comprehensive and detailed review
    of canal control algorithms (Malaterre et al., 1998). Both of these task committee
    efforts provided for a meaningful advance in the formulation and verification
    of canal control theory and practice. Many of the ASCE/EWRI task committee members
    joined with EWRI in 1999 to organize and conduct a United States Commission on
    Irrigation and Drainage (USCID) workshop on the Modernization of Irrigation Water
    Delivery (USCID, 1999), with much of the focus being on current canal automation
    endeavours. While the above is certainly not an exhaustive presentation of canal
    automation research and development, it does provide a broad summary and a snapshot
    of how long water district managers have looked to technology to improve and enhance
    the delivery of irrigation water to their customers. It also provides a flavor
    of the approaches, technologies, and agencies that have contributed to the field
    of automatic canal operations. As pointed out earlier, the goal of MOP 131 is
    to bring all these past accomplishments together in a single publication that
    is up to date and useful to system operations personnel, planners, and design
    engineers. Overview of MOP 131 MOP 131 consists of eight chapters and a glossary.
    A brief summary of each chapter follows. Chapter 1: Modernization process, constraints,
    and concepts This first chapter in MOP 131 is probably the most important one.
    It provides a general overview of the potential benefits of irrigation canal modernization
    and discusses considerations for assessing whether or not an irrigation or water
    district should implement automation as it modernizes. If automation appears to
    be a viable component of modernization, then Chapter 1 describes how to proceed
    with the process of modernization. This chapter also provides a general overview
    of the potential benefits of canal automation. This chapter starts out by defining
    the concept of modernization. Modernization is a combination of technical, managerial,
    and organizational upgrading (as opposed to mere physical rehabilitation) of irrigation
    schemes with the objective of improving resource utilization (e.g., water, labor,
    economics, environment) and water delivery service to farms (Wolter and Burt,
    1997). Such modernization investment focuses on the details of the inner workings
    of an irrigation project. Planners and engineers for irrigation projects frequently
    equate modernization with practices such as canal lining, piping, and computerized
    automation; however, such investments are often of low initial priority if one
    examines the steps needed to improve overall performance. Computerized automation
    is typically implemented in later stages of modernization, after basic needs such
    as flow measurement and accounting procedures have already been completed. Modernization
    is a process that sets specific objectives and selects specific actions and tools
    to achieve them over an extended period of time. There are no ‘single answers’
    as to how and when to implement automation as part of modernization because of
    the complexity and variety of combinations of the water supplies (surface versus
    conjunctive use), water allocation policies, water quality, timing of flows, adequacy
    of the water supplies, topography, aquatic weed problems, soil types as related
    to seepage and bank stability, usage of return flows, types of existing structures,
    and so on. There are, however, some basic principles that should be followed to
    achieve a high level of success in designing, constructing, and implementing a
    canal automation project. Concepts discussed in this chapter include: Defining
    potential benefits of modernization and automation; Defining incentives for modernization;
    Defining realistic/evolving expectations and costs; Assessing the existing system;
    Defining institutional and operational constraints as related to automation; Selecting
    the appropriate canal operation strategy; Developing a plan for emergency response/safeguards;
    Defining where automation fits into a modernization plan; Defining the typical
    sequence of actions in the modernization process. Chapter 2: Physical infrastructure
    Chapter 2 provides an overview of the types of structures and devices used for
    flow or water level control in canal systems. For each structure or device included,
    there is a photograph along with a discussion on the advantages/disadvantages,
    the power requirements, and the serviceability of the structure. In addition,
    the presentation includes a discussion on what measurements need to be made while
    using the structure. Only structures or devices useful from an automation perspective
    are discussed. Concepts discussed in this chapter include: Working with an existing
    irrigation system. Decisions need to be made regarding whether to incorporate
    existing irrigation system infrastructure or to replace the existing infrastructure
    with new infrastructure; Conveyance system considerations. The type of canal automation
    that is physically possible and practical is dependent upon the physical characteristics
    of the existing canals and water allocation policies; Gates for check structures.
    A summary of widely available check structure configurations is provided, including
    programmable logic control (PLC)-based, electrically moved check structures and
    non-PLC controlled ‘automatic’ check structures; Instrumentation and measurement.
    A discussion is provided regarding instrument considerations that are common to
    canal automation including water level, gate position, and flow rate measurements;
    Pumps. Pumps are an integral part of many automation schemes that must supply
    or accept water at variable rates that can change from minute to minute without
    advance notice; Regulating (buffer) reservoirs within the irrigation system. Regulating
    reservoirs have been used successfully in the western United States to reduce
    canal spillage, simplify canal operation, and increase the flexibility of the
    water delivery systems. Chapter 3: SCADA systems Chapter 3 presents considerations
    regarding the design and implementation of a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
    (SCADA) system that will support the advanced automation of irrigation canals.
    This chapter includes discussion of design criteria, applicable technologies,
    installation, testing, and commissioning of the system. This section of MOP 131
    focuses on the SCADA infrastructure itself and not on the control algorithms in
    the SCADA system processors, which is left for a later chapter. Concepts discussed
    in this chapter include: Basic introduction to SCADA systems. SCADA refers to
    a broad and ever-changing spectrum of electronic hardware, computer software,
    and communications infrastructure that provides a platform for remote monitoring
    and control in a variety of industrial applications. In canal applications (or
    irrigation systems), SCADA system complexity ranges from simple systems that allow
    operators to monitor a few water levels or flow rates over a radio network, to
    large-scale, multiserver systems capable of automatically controlling large canal
    networks over fiber-optic and microwave communication networks. Whether small
    or large, SCADA systems can provide real-time monitoring; remote supervisory or
    automatic control; alert or emergency notifications; troubleshooting; and automatic
    data reporting and archiving capabilities; Basic SCADA system components and function.
    In simple terms, a SCADA system consists of a central base unit, which provides
    facilities for data storage, manipulation, and visualization. The base unit communicates
    with one or more remote units (e.g., at a canal check structure) through some
    communications infrastructure. The remote unit communicates with sensors and implements
    control instructions issued from the base unit; Control options in SCADA systems.
    Automatic control options for SCADA systems can be categorized into three basic
    groups: local control, central control, and distributed control; SCADA project
    considerations. A discussion is provided detailing considerations for SCADA projects
    such as system evaluation, building an integration team, system maintenance, and
    cost. Chapter 4: Control operation and control concepts Chapter 4 presents basic
    canal control methods and their intended operational goals. A brief discussion
    of concepts required for implementation is also provided. The limitations of each
    method are described in terms of the overall control strategy. It is important
    to note that the concepts discussed in this chapter are not necessarily mutually
    exclusive, because different concepts can often be used on different parts of
    the same canal network. Each concept has advantages and drawbacks and each fits
    better with certain overall strategies. Concepts discussed in this chapter include:
    Introduction to the control of irrigation canals. In general, control for irrigation
    canals can be grouped into two categories: supply-oriented and demand-oriented.
    It is important to note that most canal control strategies include aspects of
    both supply-oriented and demand-oriented systems; General strategies for control
    of irrigation canals. A common approach to canal automation is to make gate adjustments
    at each site successively and then return to each gate to make corrections depending
    on the observed situation. These initial changes and the later corrections can
    be interpreted as feedforward and feedback control actions, respectively. The
    initial changes in settings to provide the new flows downstream are feedforward
    actions, while the corrections based on the actual situation are feedback actions.
    Remote control, where observations are communicated to a central control room
    and, from there, gate adjustments can be remotely implemented, simply allows the
    users to perform these actions more quickly, more often, with better timing, and
    with the ability to see more of the canal conditions at once. Automatic controls
    allow these adjustments to be made automatically. Automation allows control actions
    to be made more often and, in theory, more precisely. But fundamentally, these
    different approaches (manual/local, manual/remote, automatic) use the same basic
    strategies. Chapter 5: Canal hydraulic properties Chapter 5 discusses the hydraulic
    properties of canal pools and structures, as they relate to needs for canal automation.
    Since this publication is geared toward modernization of existing canal networks
    or systems, detailed design considerations are not included. However, changes
    may be needed to the infrastructure to implement new technologies during modernization,
    so that the system will allow greater flexibility and thus potentially improve
    performance. This chapter also presents methods for describing the hydraulic response
    of canal pools, particularly how water levels respond to changes in flow rate.
    Concepts discussed in this chapter include: Design issues. Various design issues
    such as freeboard, canal lining, intermediate structures, and flow capacity are
    discussed; Canal structure hydraulics. Summary information regarding the hydraulics
    of typical weirs and gates used in irrigation canals is provided; Canal pool hydraulics.
    Each pool is unique in its response to changes in flows through control structures.
    Physical parameters that influence this behavior are longitudinal bed slope, cross
    section size and shape, length, and bed material. Concepts regarding flow conditions,
    changes in canal conveyance, pool volumes, and travel time of waves are also discussed;
    Resonance waves. Resonance waves and their influence on automatic control can
    be minimized using the filtering procedures discussed; Identification. Methods
    for determining important hydraulic properties of the canal pool are discussed.
    These parameters are crucial for controller design. Chapter 6: Control methods
    Chapter 6 presents control system fundamentals and control techniques that are
    used to develop controllers for water level or flow rate in irrigation canals.
    This chapter presents methods by which the control strategies discussed earlier
    in MOP 131 can be implemented via electronic devices such as PLCs, remote terminal
    units (RTUs), computers, etc. The intent of canal automation is to improve the
    operation of the water distribution system, which typically means better service
    to farmers. Canal automation is intended to improve some aspect of operations
    by performing controls that would be difficult to do manually and to enhance system
    monitoring and emergency responses. Concepts discussed in this chapter include:
    Introduction to control methods. Various control method concepts are defined including
    control variables and control-action variables; Implementation options. Automatic
    controls can be organized in a variety of ways: local control, centralized control,
    hierarchical control, and distributed coordination control; Decoupling pools and
    structures. To simplify the design of controllers (which are usually linear) and
    to simplify implementation, most canal controllers determine the flow rate change
    needed for a check structure and then the gate position change required to achieve
    the prescribed flow rate in separate computations (algorithms); Routing demand
    changes through a canal. Routing water through a canal, also called feedforward
    control, can be done by using the time it takes a flow rate change to travel from
    the head gate to turnouts (delay times). Various methods for routing water through
    a canal, an essential control function, are discussed; Feedback control. This
    section describes the mathematical procedures needed to tune controllers for the
    control of water levels, flow rates, and/or volumes within a canal. These methods
    use measurements of water level and/or flow rate to determine what control actions
    will bring the water level, flow rate, or canal pool volume to a set point value.
    Details on specific feedback control algorithms such as linear quadratic regulator
    (LQR), H-infinity, model predictive control (MPC), and proportional integral (PI)
    flow control are discussed. There is also a discussion on combining feedforward
    and feedback control. Chapter 7: Verification of controller performance The users
    of canal automation want to be sure that the automatic control system will function
    in a way that is useful for their operations. Two essential questions must be
    answered. First, are the right processes being controlled? Second, is the automatic
    control functioning in an acceptable manner? This chapter discusses the process
    that control system designers and integrators should go through so that they can
    document a successful automation implementation. Concepts discussed in this chapter
    include: Performance testing issues. This section deals with performance testing
    of automated canal structure logic; Performance testing with unsteady-flow simulation
    models. Simulation models are a useful tool for determining the potential performance
    of canal automation. Many canal automation developers routinely test control algorithm
    performance for even a single gate with unsteady-flow simulation. This allows
    the gate to be tested under a variety of flow and operating conditions; Performance
    measures. This section outlines concrete performance measures that can be used
    to evaluate how effectively a canal automation scheme is controlling the irrigation
    delivery system. Performance measures for both water level control and flow rate
    control are presented. Chapter 8: Implementation of control systems Chapter 8
    addresses the practical implementation of canal automation as a project within
    a wider modernization program. The automation of an entire lateral or whole canal
    system is described, rather than just a single check structure, because the challenges
    and benefits are much larger. This chapter describes the sequence of required
    tasks, including the customization of control software, the installation and commissioning
    of the field devices and central server software, the progressive activation of
    control throughout the canal system, the measurement of overall performance of
    the new system, and the training of operations staff. Ongoing operational tasks
    and system maintenance are also discussed. Concepts discussed in this chapter
    include: Project initiation. The first step in any automation project is to determine
    the project objectives. These might include the improvement of irrigator service
    levels, water savings, and better control of water levels, operational cost savings,
    or rate of return on investment. Clear, quantified objectives help ensure success
    by aligning the irrigation district and implementation team and allowing for objective
    measurement of performance; Configuration and customization of software. Discussions
    are provided regarding RTU/PLC software, communications software, SCADA software,
    water ordering and demand management software, and network representation software;
    Commissioning. Commissioning is the process by which equipment, a facility, or
    a plant is tested to verify if it functions according to its design objectives
    or specifications; Control rollout and tuning. Once the commissioning of the SCADA
    system is complete, the next step is to roll out or activate the control system.
    In this section, rollout of control refers to the control on a network scale as
    it encompasses the processes involved in rolling out control at each location.
    Sometimes the behavior of the actual system may differ from what has been modeled
    initially. Hence, fine tuning of controller(s) may be required at intermittent
    stages; Performance assessment and acceptance. As important as setting the overall
    project objective is the measurement of the performance of the canal system against
    those objectives; Postacceptance operation and maintenance. Postacceptance operations
    and maintenance are an important part of canal automation. It is the analog of
    a routine maintenance program that irrigation districts generally undertake anyway,
    but includes new equipment like the software and new operating procedures; Training.
    An automated canal system requires that operators learn a number of new computer
    skills and adapt to a new style of operation that involves reacting to operational
    problems rather than simply implementing routines. This is not dissimilar to the
    role of a pilot when an airplane is operating in autopilot. The pilot must vigilantly
    monitor instruments and correct for unforeseen circumstances or deal with alarms;
    Manuals. In addition to the training, the irrigation district must be supplied
    with manuals for every component that makes up its system. Conclusions Irrigation
    district managers as well as state and federal water resource management agencies
    have for more than 50 years looked to technology to increase their effectiveness,
    improve their operations, enhance water transmission and delivery, and make their
    canal systems safer and more responsive. As the technology provided by the development
    and enhanced performance of computers made quantum leaps in performance, it was
    logical for the computing power of these devices to be incorporated into the control
    of irrigation canals. Beyond the power provided by computer technology, was the
    requirement for an entire array of associate technology that needed to be developed
    and adapted for canal control. The associated technologies included equipment
    to measure water levels, flow rates, and gate movements digitally as well as radio
    and fiber-optic equipment to transmit and receive monitored data. As each of these
    technologies matured, the engineers and researchers responsible for the research
    and development of canal control adapted these new technologies into their designs.
    As such, canal control has matured and become more technically rigorous. In a
    parallel way, the software needed to control canals also matured through the incorporation
    of new theories or mathematical models into improved control algorithms. What
    started out as remote monitoring and control with much of the decision-making
    left in the hands of humans, has now been refined to the point that automatic
    control of irrigation canals is a reality. What was lacking was an up-to-date,
    comprehensive publication that would not only assist irrigation district personnel
    but also the consulting engineer community with a practical source of knowledge
    on the worldwide status of automatic canal control. The professionals who were
    active participants in the development and implementation of automatic canal control
    joined forces to collaborate on MOP 131 in order to bring their collective expertise
    together in ways that would be useful to water resources engineers and managers
    around the world. The professionals that contributed to the preparation, review,
    editing, and finalization of MOP 131 are hopeful that MOP 131 is adopted by the
    water resources community as the definitive publication on the state of the art
    of automatic canal control, and that automatic canal control will make a substantial
    contribution to the production of food and fiber for a world that is facing unrelenting
    increases in the demand for food production with limited water supplies, while
    at the same time meeting demands to preserve our environment. Acknowledgements

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Atlanta, GA, USA SECTION I. Introduction
    According to a U.S. Geological Survey report, agriculture is a major user of ground
    and surface water in the U.S., and irrigation accounted for 42 percent of the
    Nation’s total freshwater withdrawals in 2015 [1]. Water stress is the largest
    contributor to crop loss, and low water availability affects approximately 45
    percent of the U.S. land surfaces [2]. At the same time, drought has been increasing
    in intensity and frequency in the U.S. [3]. Agricultural production increasingly
    requires water inputs to sustain high crop productivity in a changing climate.
    However, the current agricultural water use is not sustainable in many parts of
    the U.S. In the Central High Plain regions alone, about 30 percent of the water
    stored in Ogallala Aquifer has already been consumed. At current use rates, as
    much as 80 percent of the stored aquifer water will have been consumed by 2060
    [4]. The southeast region has experienced several large droughts since 2000. During
    the 2016 drought, 98% of Alabama, 68% of Georgia, and 100% of Mississippi by area
    were classified by the U.S. Drought Monitor as being in severe drought or worse.
    Irrigation has been increased by 60% in Alabama and 56% in Georgia since 1998,
    the largest increases among the 31 Eastern States [5]. Driven by the above factors,
    research on irrigation optimization and management has drawn increasing interests
    in recent years [6]–[10]. In particular, model predictive control (MPC) has been
    widely studied as a real-time irrigation control method [7]–[11]. In these studies,
    the system is usually modeled by a soil water balance approach, which models the
    water balance around the plant root-zone [12]. As shown in Figure 1, precipitation
    (rain), irrigation and capillary rise contribute to the inflows of the water balance,
    while evapotranspiration, runoff, and deep percolation contribute to the outflows.
    Either soil moisture content, or the difference between plant water demand and
    the actual soil moisture content (a.k.a., soil moisture deficit) has been used
    as the control target in existing research [10], [11]. When soil water balance
    model is used, it is necessary to know the effective values of precipitation,
    irrigation and crop evapotranspiration. Where there are field data available,
    these parameters can be estimated based on system identification principles [8],
    [13]. However, when field data are not available, these parameters are often assumed
    to be 1’s [7], [11]. Since they are affected by both soil and crop types, in this
    work, we use a crop simulator, namely the decision support system for agrotechnology
    transfer (DSSAT) [14], to improve the system model without field data, and to
    more realistically evaluate the performance of different irrigation control strategies.
    DSSAT simulates dynamic growth, development and yield of a crop over time in single
    or multiple seasons at any location. It incorporates models of over 42 different
    crops (as of Version 4.7.5) and considers weather, genetics, soil water, soil
    carbon and nitrogen, and management [14], [15]. DSSAT and its crop simulation
    models have been used for a wide range of applications at different spatial and
    temporal scales. In this work, under different irrigation control schemes, DSSAT
    is utilized to compute soil moisture content, crop growth, development and yield
    trajectories for a maize field in Piracicaba (Brazil) with soil, genetics, and
    weather data (in the year of 2002) provided in DSSAT. The simulator outputs are
    utilized to evaluate the water use efficiencies (WUE), which is defined as the
    yield over the total amount of irrigation, of these schemes. Figure. 1 Basic water
    balance model (Adapted from [10]) Show All SECTION II. Preliminaries A. Hydrological
    balance The following hydrological balance or soil water balance has been widely
    used in many irrigation control applications dθ dt =ir(t)+rf(t)+cr(t)−e t c (t)−dp(t)
    −ro(t) (1) View Source where θ is soil moisture level, reflecting water inflow
    and outflow terms on the right-hand side. Irrigation (ir), rainfall (rf), and
    capillary rise (cr) contribute to the inflows of the water balance; while crop
    evapotranspiration (etc), deep percolation (dp), and run-off (ro) contribute to
    the outflows of the water balance. t is the daily-basis time step in this problem.
    Several terms in Eqn. (1) can be neglected with proper assumptions such as the
    field condition, climate condition, weather, and soil properties. In this work,
    capillary rise (cr) is neglected. Deep percolation (dp), and run-off (ro) are
    assumed to be proportional to soil moisture level (θ). The precipitation or rainfall
    (rf) itself will be constrained to further address runoff and deep percolation
    by considering the field capacity (illustrated in Figure 1), where soil moisture
    level will have an upper limit as a constraint in the model. This concept is also
    utilized in DSSAT [14]. With these simplifications, the soil moisture balance
    equation can be expressed as dθ dt =ir(t)+rf(t)−e t c (t)−cθ (2) View Source where
    c is the deep percolation and run-off coefficient. Weather data from the simulation
    site (Piracicaba, Brazil) for the year of 2002 have been taken from DSSAT for
    the crop growth simulation. Evapotranspiration is assumed to be under the scenario
    that sufficient water is supplied to the field during the growth season, which
    is called potential evapotranspiration in DSSAT. The value is to be averaged in
    daily basis. As a result, the rainfall and average potential evapotranspiration
    data from the DSSAT are used as the system disturbance while simulating the closed-loop
    MPC controller throughout the growth season. B. State Space Model and MPC The
    simplified soil moisture balance in the previous section, Eqn. (2), is discretized
    to make a linear time invariant (LTI) state space model. Under Euler method, the
    discretized model is expressed as follows θ( k i +1)=(1−c)θ( k i )+ir( k i )+rf(
    k i ) −e t c ( k i ) (3) View Source Equation (3) is further changed for notational
    simplicity, x m ( k i +1)=(1−c)A x m ( k i )+ B u u( k i ) + B d d( k i ) y( k
    i )=C x m ( k i ) (4) (5) View Source where d( k i )= [P( k i )E( k i )] T ,ir(
    k i )=u( k i ), B d =[1−1] and ki refers to time steps in the discretized model.
    To develop an MPC controller, this discretized model is to be augmented to embed
    integrators in the state space model. x(ki) is current soil moisture level and
    u(ki) is the optimized irrigation solution from MPC. rf and etc are considered
    as the system disturbances. The augmented state space model is constructed with
    an embedded integrator [16], [17]. With the following difference Δ x m ( k i +1)≜
    x m ( k i +1)− x m ( k i ) (7) View Source the new state space, in the form of
    vector matrix, is introduced to construct an augmented state space model, which
    is used in MPC design, x( k i )= [Δ x m ( k i )y( k i )] T (8) View Source Using
    this new state vector expression, the discrete LTI model can be written as the
    following augmented state space model x( k i +1)=Ax+BΔu( k i )+ B d d( k i ) y(k)=Cx(
    k i ) A=[ 1 1 0 1 ],B=[ 1 1 ], B d =[ 1 1 −1 −1 ], C=[ 0 1 ] (9) (10) (11) View
    Source The augmented state space model, Eqn. (9)-(11), uses measured disturbances
    d (ki) from DSSAT. Based on the control horizon Nc, the MPC model predicts the
    future trajectory of irrigation plan as well as constrained soil moisture level.
    In this work, the control horizon is 5 days, the augmented state space model considers
    5 days predicted precipitation and evapotranspiration as measured disturbances
    and updates the next input signal to calculate the next day soil moisture level
    in a receding horizon manner, as shown in Eqn. (12). Y=Fx( k i )+ΦΔU+ΨΔD Y= [y(

    and xmax are the wilting point and field capacity respectively based on the soil
    property from DSSAT. The minimal value of irrigation (Imin) is set to be 0 mm
    and the maximum amount of irrigation (Imax) is 13mm per day. Precipitation has
    been constrained with respect to the upper limit and lower limit of soil water
    uptake. Evapotranspiration has been collected from DSSAT assuming the sufficient
    water supply for crop growth is guaranteed during the growth stage, which is measured
    as potential evapotranspiration from DSSAT. Some remarks on the implementation
    of the MPC controller are summarized as follows. The initial state is assumed
    to be known or measurable – the initial state from DSSAT is used to compute future
    input signals. The deep percolation and run-off coefficient is tuned to address
    the runoff and deep percolation such that the soil moisture trajectory calculated
    based on Eqn. (2)-(4) are consistent with the DSSAT soil moisture trajectory.
    SECTION III. Case Study In this work, DSSAT is utilized to compute soil moisture
    content, crop growth, development and yield trajectories for a maize field in
    Piracicaba (Brazil) with soil, genetics, and weather data (in the year of 2002)
    provided in DSSAT. Figure 2 shows the precipitation and evapotranspiration data,
    which are used as the measured disturbances. Figure. 2 Precipitation and potential
    evapotranspiration from DSSAT at the selected simulation site of Piracivaba, Brazil
    for the year of 2002 Show All Two irrigation control scenarios are designed. In
    the first scenario (MPC1), a constant set-point soil moisture level is used as
    the reference for MPC to track while minimizing the input signal within each prediction
    horizon. The reference soil moisture level is set to 430mm based on the initial
    conditions from DSSAT. The second scenario (MPC2) exploits stepwise set-point
    trajectory for MPC to track. The crop growing stages are roughly divided into
    three different stages for maize: germination to floral initiation (30days), silking
    to beginning of grain filling (60days), and middling of grain filling to maturity
    (30days). In each stage, the gradual increase in crop water demand is satisfied
    by maintaining each corresponding soil moisture level. The initial environmental
    conditions, such as soil properties, soil moisture level, are obtained from DSSAT
    using its built-in function Xbuild. The default crop management and initial environmental
    conditions are used for the simulation except three different irrigation strategies
    – MPC1, MPC2, and default rule-based irrigation from DSSAT. The input signal (i.e.,
    the optimal irrigation strategy) and output signal (i.e., the soil moisture level)
    for MPC1 and MPC2 are showed in Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively. The precipitation
    has been scaled to consider both runoff and deep percolation during the optimization.
    Figure. 3 Output (top) and input together with disturbances (bottom) for MPC with
    constant set-point tracking (MPC1) Show All Figure. 4 Output (top) and input together
    with disturbances (bottom) for MPC with stepwise set-point tracking (MPC2) Show
    All Figure. 5 Cumulative effective irrigation amount from three different plans:
    Default from DSSAT, MPC1 and MPC2. Show All For the first scenario with a constant
    set-point (MPC1), the total amount of effective irrigation is 156 mm after scaling
    with an irrigation efficiency factor [19]. The efficiency factor is set to 90%
    based on the default irrigation management setting of DSSAT. For MPC2, the total
    effective irrigation is 260 mm. The cumulative effective irrigation amounts are
    shown in Figure 5 where the default irrigation plan from DSSAT (with total effective
    irrigation of 274 mm) is also shown. It can be seen that MPC2 provides similar
    irrigation as the DSSAT default plan, except that at the beginning MPC2 irrigate
    significantly more in order to track the moisture set-point, while MPC1 almost
    stopped irrigation after 65 days after sowing (DAS). As a result, MPC1 requires
    significantly less water than MPC2 and DSSAT default. The soil moisture trajectories
    from DSSAT based on the three irrigation strategies are shown in Figure 6. Since
    MPC-based optimal irrigation trajectories shown in Figures 3 and 4 are fundamentally
    originated from the simplified LTI state space model (i.e., Eqn. (4)), there are
    discrepancies between the soil moisture trajectories of MPC1 and MPC2 in Figure
    6, which are DSSAT simulated, and the soil moisture trajectories in Figures 3
    and 4, which are calculated based on Eqn. (4). However, it can be seen that with
    proper deep percolation and run-off coefficient in Eqn.(4) and reference set-point,
    the system model agrees with the DSSAT simulator relatively well without other
    historical information. Figure. 6 Soil moisture levels from DSSAT with three different
    irrigation plans: Default from DSSAT, MPC1 and MPC2. Show All Table I Yield Productivity
    The crop productivity indexes under the three different irrigation plans have
    been measured through the simulation of DSSAT. These results about crop growth
    are shown in Figure 7. Before the silking stage is finished, the grain weight
    (Figure 7, top) is not measurable. After day 65, all three different irrigation
    plans show very similar growth trajectories. Only after day 103, the constant
    set-point tracking MPC1 is showing a slower grain weight growth compared to the
    other irrigation plans. At the harvest point, the grain weights are 4979 kg/ha,
    4624 kg/ha, and 4960 kg/ha for DSSAT default, MPC1, and MPC2 respectively. Vegetative
    weight (defined as the sum of stem and root weights, Figure 7, middle) shows exponential
    growth during floral and silking stages and reaches maximum values of 5297 kg/ha,
    5326 kg/ha, and 5331 kg/ha for DSSAT, MPC1, and MPC2 respectively. For the biomass
    (Figure 7, bottom), the three different crop simulations show similar trajectories,
    only separated right before reaching maturity and harvest stage. 12084 kg/ha,
    11712 kg/ha, 12138 kg/ha of biomass have been produced from DSSAT default, MPC1,
    and MPC2 respectively. When the crop only relying on the precipitation (i.e.,
    rainfed) during the growing season, the maize yield at the end of simulation is
    measured as 1192 kg/ha. These results are summarized in Table I. In order to compare
    the irrigation efficiency, the following relative productivity is defined. Y ¯
    = Y irrigation − Y rainfall i r e (20) View Source where Yirrigation is the yield
    (i.e., the grain weight) under different irrigation plans; Yrainfall is the yield
    with rainfall only (i.e., no irrigation). ire is the effective irrigation amount
    under different irrigation plans. The relative productivities of the three different
    irrigation plans are shown in Table I. It can be seen that both MPC1 and MPC2
    outperform DSSAT default in terms of relative productivity. However, the relative
    productivity does not take into account the price factors of the grain vs. water.
    Therefore, although MPC1 leads to the highest relative productivity, it may not
    be the best plan economically. On the other hand, it would be challenging to put
    a price tag on the long-term environmental and sustainability impacts of irrigation
    water usage. Figure. 7 DSSAT simulated grain weight, vegetative (root + stem)
    weight, and biomass under the three different irrigation plans (the results of
    DSSAT and MPC2 overlap each other most of the time). Show All SECTION IV. Conclusion
    In this work, the DSSAT crop simulator is utilized to evaluate the performances
    of two MPC irrigation control schemes in comparison to the parametric rule-based
    irrigation plan from DSSAT which uses historical weather data, soil information,
    and detailed crop management and genetics. It is shown that although the MPC model
    does not consider the water stress for the crop, which DSSAT uses for the rule-based
    irrigation plan, with a careful determination of a growth-stage-based moisture
    trajectory as the set-point, MPC can achieve similar crop yield with less total
    irrigation water amount. There are several limitations of this work. For example,
    the uncertainties in the disturbances are not considered. In addition, the discrepancy
    between the system model and the simulator is not truly resolved. These limitations
    should be addressed in the future work. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

  description: In soilless culture, water and nutrients must be frequently and precisely
    applied due to the reduced volume and low water holding capacity of the substrate.
    For this reason, irrigation scheduling is an important and difficult task. The
    use of an irrigation control tray with two electrodes (level sensor) is a simple
    way for controlling irrigation. Irrigation operation is triggered when the water
    level in the tray decreases below a preset level. This is a simple on-offcontrol
    but inflexible because it requires periodic manually calibrations. This work aims
    at developing a more efficient control system for the irrigation management of
    soilless culture. The control system is based on a Proportional Integral Derivative
    (PID) algorithm and it allows for fully automatic operation with a minimum set
    of variables in order to reduce the cost of the equipment. The results obtained
    demonstrate that the PID control algorithm can efficiently be used to control
    irrigation in soilless culture. The calculated average daily leaching fractions
    fit reasonably well to the target values. Nevertheless, some improvements of the
    control algorithm are required to reduce the variability of the calculated leaching
    fractions during the initial stage of crop development.

  key_findings: The PID control algorithm effectively regulated irrigation in soilless
    culture, ensuring optimal water and nutrient delivery to plants. However, some
    refinements are needed to minimize variability in leaching fractions during the
    early stages of crop growth.
  limitations: The study was conducted in a controlled environment and may not fully
    represent real-world conditions. The authors acknowledge the need for further
    improvements to reduce variability in the calculated leaching fractions during
    the initial stage of crop development.
  main_objective: To develop a more efficient control system for the irrigation management
    of soilless culture using a PID control algorithm.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper is highly relevant to the point of focus, as it
    provides a practical example of implementing a closed-loop control system using
    a PID algorithm for automated irrigation scheduling. The use of real-time data
    to adjust irrigation schedules directly addresses the need for reliable and efficient
    irrigation management in soilless culture, where water and nutrients must be precisely
    applied.

  description: Traditionally, most irrigation practices in Southern Europe have been
    based on gravity-fed surface irrigation systems. Currently, these systems remain
    a relevant typology in the European Union (EU) member states of the Mediterranean
    areas, where it is often the only sustainable method for farmers due to the small
    size of agricultural holdings, their reduced capacity and readiness to invest
    and the low ratio between yield profits and irrigation costs. In the last several
    years, in response to European and national directives, surface irrigation has
    garnered increasing attention at the political and bureaucratic levels due to
    frequent criticisms of its postulated low efficiency and high water wastage. However,
    these systems commonly provide a number of ecosystem services and nature-based
    solutions that increase the positive externalities in different rural socio-ecological
    contexts and often have the potential to extend these services and provide solutions
    that are compatible with economical sustainability. This study aims to discuss
    the prospects for new practices and for the rehabilitation and modernization of
    the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems in EU Mediterranean areas to enhance
    water efficiency, thus gaining both economic advantages and environmental benefits.
    The difficulties, stimuli for improvements and peculiarities of the irrigation
    water management of four rural environments located in Italy, Spain and Portugal
    were analyzed and compared to the current state of the gravity-fed surface irrigation
    systems with hypothetical future improvements achievable by innovative technologies
    and practices. In these different case studies, the current gravity-fed surface
    irrigation systems have an obsolete regulatory structure; water-use efficiency
    is not a driving criterion for the management of the conveyance and distribution
    canal network, and farmers are not yet adequately encouraged to adopt more efficient
    gravity-fed irrigation practices. A continuous knowledge exchange is thus necessary
    for the interaction of all irrigation water managers and farmers to improve their
    eco-efficiency and to preserve and promote their cultural heritage across the
    entire water supply and delivery chains. We argue that the best way forward will
    require precisely targeted rehabilitation measures of gravity-fed surface irrigation
    systems based on the integrated use of decision support services, gate automation,
    remote and feedback controls and real-time flow optimization.

    surface irrigation systems; irrigation network; irrigation policy; water multi-functionality;
    irrigated agriculture sustainability 1. Introduction Irrigation practices in Europe
    have traditionally consisted of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems. In these
    cases, the water is conveyed from surface sources (primarily rivers or reservoirs,
    both natural and artificial) and is distributed to individual fields through a
    network of canals of different sizes, relying on gravity as the driving force.
    In sizeable areas of the southern Member States, especially in Catalonia, Northern
    Italy and Portugal, gravity-fed surface irrigation remains the dominant form of
    irrigation, being used in 51%, 70% and 63% of farms, respectively [1]. The main
    cultivated crops are cereals, particularly maize and rice, which require approximately
    two to three times the amount of water compared with other extensive crops [2].
    The utilized agricultural area (UAA) in these states accounts for approximately
    40% of the total land area, resulting in an average size of 16.1 ha per agricultural
    holding. The mean field size is approximately 5 ha, with a high level of fragmentation
    that affects the labor decisions of farmers, and consequently, the performances
    of farms [3]. Since the Renaissance, the hectic development of a dense network
    of gravity-fed surface irrigation canals for water delivery to single agricultural
    fields has occurred, mainly due to the high level of land fragmentation and small
    field sizes [4]. However, the lack of coordination among water users caused redundancy
    in these canals, leading to a chaotic structure, complex layout, and a lack of
    a specific hierarchy [5]. Nevertheless, the complex system of reservoirs, rivers,
    and irrigation canals that is common in rural Southern European territories is
    an emblematic model of hydraulic infrastructures, and although it can be perceived
    as obsolete, in general, it is operationally efficient and helps to maintain the
    good environmental status of the natural resources in several ways [6,7,8]. The
    majority of the irrigation canals are unlined and resemble small natural rivers
    rather than artificial infrastructures that support agriculture; this facilitates
    their integration into the landscape and gives them an environmental value as
    well as a cultural heritage [9,10,11]. As the largest user of fresh water, agriculture
    sits at the interface between the environment and society, and any improvements
    in irrigation water management need to consider its multifunctional nature [12,13,14].
    The history of irrigation in these territories is inseparable from that of land
    management, and every change in the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems, even
    in a small area, can affect the hydrologic balance and agro-ecosystem characteristics
    on a large scale [15,16]. The neoclassical concept of irrigation efficiency (based
    on supply efficiency only) has been replaced by a modern formulation called “effective
    efficiency” of irrigation [17,18,19], which includes the abovementioned hydrological
    issues as well as environmental and ecological interactions. In light of these
    considerations, it is important to promote monitoring activities for accurately
    quantifying agro-environmental variables from climatic parameters to evaluate
    the flow into the irrigation canals (from the main canals to distribution ditches).
    In fact, the lack of data about the flow in rural canals is a central issue in
    planning and decision-making processes for the development of suitable water resource
    management strategies at the basin level [20,21,22,23]. This problem could also
    be exacerbated by an increase in the total global water withdrawals for irrigation,
    which are projected to increase by 10% by 2050 [24]. Strong competition between
    the irrigation water resources, energy, agriculture and food are looming, with
    unpredictable impacts on livelihoods and the environment [25]. Thus, cross-sectoral
    actions such as those oriented by the Water-Energy-Food Security nexus [26] or
    Water-Food-Energy-Ecosystem nexus [27] will also affect future irrigation system
    projects and water allocations to promote more efficient water distribution and
    prevent waste. This study analyzed the characteristics and the importance of the
    gravity-fed surface irrigation systems in four irrigation districts belonging
    to three states in southern Europe (the Est Ticino-Villoresi districts in Italy,
    the Baix Ter and the Urgell districts in Spain, and the Lis Valley district in
    Portugal). The prospects and difficulties around the possibility of improving
    the irrigation throughout these systems as well as their management and governance
    are compared and discussed. We argue that this study may form the basis for a
    discussion on the recommended improvements on gravity-fed surface irrigation systems
    that would preserve their agricultural heritage and continue to provide environmental
    benefits. 2. European Policies and Guidelines Gravity-fed surface irrigation systems
    remain the most common type of infrastructure for crop and pasture irrigation
    worldwide due to their low cost and low energy requirements [1]. However, these
    systems often use very high amounts of water to satisfy the irrigation requirements
    of the crops and are thought to be inherently inefficient [28]. Thus, in response
    to increasing conflicts among different water users and the need to safeguard
    the availability of water resources, many important policies have been introduced
    to reduce water wastage in agriculture settings and to promote the transformation
    of traditional irrigation systems into pressurized ones, which are often based
    on drip irrigation [29]. In Spain, with the modernization of the irrigation systems
    over the period of 2005–2015, the area under pressurized irrigation has increased
    by approximately 563,000 ha (87% with drip irrigation), while surface irrigation
    has been reduced to approximately 215,000 ha [30]. From 1990 to 2007, these policies
    have helped achieve an estimated increase of 15% in irrigation water use efficiency,
    but this came with an increase in the energy consumption per hectare of irrigated
    land by a factor of 8 and of the energy consumption per cubic meter of water by
    a factor of 10 [31]. This, in combination with the noticeable increase in the
    electricity price in recent years, has produced a certain alarm. In this context,
    some new pressurized irrigation facilities built with modern technology are not
    functioning due to high energy costs that render them non-profitable. Alarcon
    et al. [32] warns that some actions aimed at increasing irrigation efficiency
    may incur meager savings of water at a high cost and that many environmental impacts
    on the landscape are often underestimated. The management of water resources is
    a particularly challenging and difficult task, in which complexities inherent
    to the hydrological cycle and biological systems are combined with the multiple
    perspectives, needs, values and concerns associated with the use of water for
    human activities [33]. Accordingly, the need for a more sustainable and integrated
    approach to manage water resources in Europe is reflected not only in water-related
    legislation but also in social policies [34,35]. The Water Framework Directive
    (WFD) and more recent policies that are closely related to the EU 2020 strategies
    highlight the fact that improving water resource management for irrigation is
    one of the primary regional challenges, with strong socio-economic implications
    [36]. Indeed, Europe recognizes that there is an urgent need to enhance the knowledge
    of irrigation consumption and to develop systems for increasing the delivery efficiency
    and regulating water flow at the field and irrigation canal scales, respectively
    (DM 15/07/2015 No. 213, 2015). EU policy frameworks place great expectations on
    new technologies to improve water efficiency [37]. The European Commission emphasizes
    that technological innovation in the field of irrigation will be an increasingly
    important factor contributing to the competitiveness of small and medium enterprises
    that operate in this sector [38]. According to the European Parliament, solutions
    should be found in “clean technologies” that facilitate the efficient use of water
    without requiring non-renewable energies [39]. As reported in [40], water-efficient
    irrigation, irrigation on demand, and irrigation using brackish water are technologies
    that will enable the better management of scarce freshwater resources [41]. Technological
    developments for irrigation processes will encompass sensors and communication
    devices, intelligent watering systems and high-efficiency delivery mechanisms
    for water and nutrients as well as a method for incorporating all of these elements
    into irrigation “packages” [36]. Similarly, irrigation water efficiency can be
    enhanced by improvements in the use of current installations and/or by adopting
    new equipment that is economically supported by funds from the European Agricultural
    Fund for Rural Development [42]. These funds are specifically intended to be used
    for the development of more efficient irrigation systems at the farm and irrigation
    district scales using new technologies (e.g., soil moisture and canopy sensors)
    that better match irrigation with crop water requirements. These developments
    towards increased sustainability in agriculture also encourage good agricultural
    practices, such as conservation tillage, restoration of groundwater and the correct
    management of fertilizers [43]. As highlighted in the [44] report, the improvement
    of water-use efficiency and productivity depends on the introduction of better
    agricultural practices in synergy with new irrigation management systems. In fact,
    the efficiency of an irrigation system is determined more by system management
    than by any inherent characteristic of the system [45]. Improperly managed “hi-tech”
    irrigation systems can also be wasteful and unproductive, and they can cause damage
    to the ecosystem as well as investment losses to farmers. 3. Case Studies Many
    Southern European countries have vast experience in the use of scarce and degraded
    natural resources, such as water and land. The rural mosaic of these areas is
    based on a combination of traditional irrigation systems and areas with extensive
    agrarian dynamism characterized by modern irrigation projects that have been promoted
    in accordance with criteria for water efficiency and food security [46]. Countries
    such as Spain, Portugal and Italy largely symbolize the dominance of water resources
    in any economic activity in these territories [47]. In such contexts, hydraulic
    constructions have played a central role in the attempt to control water in the
    agrarian plains, leading to the development of remarkable irrigation systems [48].
    Consequently, the construction of irrigation canals has played a fundamental role
    in the management of natural and productive resources, land reclamation and ecosystem
    conservation [49]. In the following sections, we briefly discuss the characteristics
    and peculiarities of four rural irrigation consortia in Mediterranean Europe (Figure
    1), with the aim of analyzing the prospects and difficulties of improving gravity-fed
    surface irrigation systems in these contexts. Figure 1. The location of the four
    irrigation districts. 3.1. The Est Ticino-Villoresi District The Est Ticino-Villoresi
    district is located in the heart of the Padana plain and is the second largest
    irrigation district in Italy, supplying irrigation water to approximately 115,000
    ha. The entire study area is characterized by a high number of small land-holdings
    with intensive, livestock-oriented practices. The main crops are maize and rice
    (in descending order). Maize is generally intended as food for livestock, while
    rice is generally sold at market. The pedo-climatic conditions are favorable for
    extensive cropping, but farming is strongly dependent on irrigation due to the
    high water requirements of these crops. By studying twelve years of meteorological
    data (from 1993 to 2013) from 10 agro-meteorological stations located in the district,
    Cesari de Maria et al. [2] found that during the agricultural season (April to
    September), the average temperature was approximately 20.2 °C, while the total
    rainfall was approximately 360 mm, with marked variability from year to year.
    The relative humidity was always high (>80%) and implies the presence of foggy
    months during the winter and hot and muggy months in the summer. During the irrigation
    period (June to September), the average daily reference evapotranspiration values
    (calculated based on the FAO Penman–Monteith equation by [50]) for the months
    of June, July, August and September were 4.7, 4.6, 4.0 and 2.8 mm·day−1, respectively.
    The traditional irrigation techniques for the two crops consist of furrow irrigation
    for maize and flood irrigation for rice, with water depths from 5 to 20 cm from
    just prior to seeding (generally occurring in May) to approximately 3 weeks before
    harvesting (generally occurring in September) for rice. Approximately 400 m3·s−1
    water is conveyed by gravity to all district areas by five main artificial canals
    that divert water from the Ticino and Adda rivers (the main two tributaries of
    the Po river). The Naviglio Grande, located in the western part of the district,
    is the oldest canal, dating back to the XIII century. It conveys a flow of approximately
    64 m3·s−1 from the Sommo Lombardo (a city close to the outlet of Lake Maggiore)
    to Milan, where its residual flow gives rise to the Naviglio Bereguardo (with
    an average flow of 5 m3·s−1) and the Naviglio Pavese (with an average flow of
    10 m3·s−1). The latter was finished at the beginning of the XIX century to provide
    a navigable link from Milan to Pavia and then from the Po river to the Ticino
    river. It is also the main canal for supplying irrigation to the fertile lands
    south of Milan. The Naviglio Martesana, located in the eastern part of the Est-Ticino
    Villoresi district, was completed at the end of the XV century. In this district,
    it is the only canal originating from the Adda river, from which it diverts an
    average rate of 25 m3·s−1. Finally, the Villoresi Canal is the most recent. It
    was built at the end of the XIX century to supply irrigation water to the lands
    of the North part of Milan, diverting an average of 50 m3·s−1 from the Ticino
    river (Figure 2). Figure 2. Location of the Est Ticino-Villoresi district inside
    the Lombardy Region (a); and the GIS representation of a part of the dense gravity-fed
    surface irrigation network, which originates from the Villoresi Canal (b). From
    these main five canals, the water is conveyed to the individual fields through
    a dense network of unlined open canals that have a combined total length of more
    than 5000 km. The management of the main canals and of most of the irrigation
    network is entrusted to the Est Ticino Villoresi Consortium, which was established
    at the end of the XX century and represents the last heir of a long chain of historical
    Consortia. Along the canals (from main canals to tertiary ditches), the flow regulation
    is entrusted by Consortium workers who manually open and close weirs and gates
    to supply the correct amount of water to all areas of the irrigation district.
    The water supplied to the farms typically has a weekly rotation. The water delivery
    efficiency of the irrigation network (from the diversion point to the farm) is
    quite low, with an amount of seepage along the canals ranging from 5% to 40%.
    However, these seepages are essential for groundwater recharge and for maintaining
    the natural equilibrium of the hydrological cycle. From a hydrological perspective,
    the district is characterized by a strong interaction between groundwater and
    surface water. The water table of the unconfined aquifer ranges from a few meters
    to 30–50 m from the ground level, with a strong variability from zone to zone.
    In the district, more than 200 springs are in operation and supply water for irrigation
    to most of the rural areas. In many cases, groundwater directly supplies water
    for the irrigation of downstream fields and preserves the Minimum Flow Level in
    the rivers. The irrigation network is strongly integrated into the urban fabric
    of the Milan metropolis, thus playing a scenic role in addition to its hydraulic
    function. It also represents an important historical heritage and is widely used
    for recreational purposes. For example, the Canale Villoresi represents a blue-green
    corridor between the Ticino and Adda rivers and has been enhanced through a series
    of projects aimed to increase cycle-tourism and light-draft boat navigability.
    The lack of flow measures in the network canals makes it difficult to assess water
    balances on different spatial scales and control water use efficiency. Only the
    main canals and some secondary ditches are monitored daily by Consortium workers,
    who read the water level gauge inside the hydraulic structures. Modern flow meter
    devices have been installed only at a few points, and in these points the measure
    of the flow is continuous. 3.2. The Baix Ter Irrigation District The Baix Ter
    irrigation district is located in the north-eastern region of Catalonia (Spain)
    and is part of the internal basins of Catalonia region (Figure 3). The water administration
    (planning, management and control) of this area falls under the exclusive jurisdiction
    of the Autonomous Community of Catalonia through the Catalan Water Agency. Figure
    3. Location of the Baix Ter irrigation district and the Irrigation Communities
    (Catalonia, Spain). Crop distribution is also shown. The Baix Ter is an alluvial
    plain that represents the main agricultural area of the internal basins of the
    Catalonia region. The total water demand for different uses in this area is approximately
    100 hm3 per year, of which 70% is used to meet the water requirements of major
    crops, mainly summer cereals (maize and rice), fresh fruit (apple trees), fodder
    (lucerne and ryegrass), poplars and nurseries of ornamental ligneous plants (Figure
    3). The irrigation water comes mainly from surface water catchments through dams
    constructed along the river and to a lesser extent from wells (approximately 800),
    which use water from the low Ter aquifer. Several circumstances related to the
    management of water resources in the Baix Ter area must be considered. The first
    is competition for water use. The area has a Mediterranean climate, characterized
    by important variations in water availability. The water is needed not only for
    agriculture; a huge amount is also transferred from the Ter River towards the
    Barcelona metropolitan area (8 m3·s−1) for urban and industrial uses, which currently
    use 70% of the flow rate of the Ter River and take priority when there are water
    restrictions. The recreational uses of this water are also very important since
    the Baix Ter area is included in the Costa Brava, which is important for tourism
    and is therefore of significant economic interest (approximately one third of
    the economic value generated by tourism for all of Catalonia). This is especially
    true during the summer period, when the agricultural water demand is the highest.
    A second consideration is that this area is located over the Baix Ter aquifer,
    with an extension of 165 km2 and is at risk of contravening the limits set by
    the EU Water Framework Directive due to its high concentrations of chlorides,
    nitrates and sulfates at specific locations. There are also reductions in the
    groundwater levels in different locations and a risk of seawater intrusion into
    the coastal areas. A third consideration is the high environmental and landscape
    importance both for the tourism interest in the area as well as from inclusion
    in the Montgrí, Illes Medes and Baix Ter Natural Park, which is considered an
    area of special environmental protection by the Autonomous Government of Catalonia.
    The multifunctional role of the irrigation canals of the Baix Ter district has
    been highlighted by [51,52]. The irrigators of the Baix Ter area are organized
    into four Irrigation Communities (Sèquia Vinyals; Sèquia Cervià de Ter, Sant Jordi
    Desvalls i Colomers; Presa de Colomers Marge Esquerre del Riu Ter; Reg del Molí
    de Pals) and grouped into the Catalan Association of Irrigation Communities. The
    Irrigation Communities are public law corporations attached to the basin organizations.
    The irrigation district of the Baix Ter occupies approximately 10,000 ha and consists
    of approximately 2800 tax irrigators, of which approximately one quarter are professional
    farmers. The water uptake from the Ter River is conveyed to a system of canals
    and gravity ducts, which distribute water to the plots. The total length of the
    primary canals is approximately 120 km. In some communities, the water concession
    ranges from 0.8 to 5 m3·s−1 throughout the year, while in other communities it
    varies depending on the month. The channels date from several centuries ago and
    were originally earthen constructions with irregular sections or with dry stone
    masonry. In recent years, the Department of Agriculture of the Catalonian Government
    has planned and executed important improvement works in the irrigation network,
    which are basically the concrete lining of the channels or the piping canals.
    These are only partial actions aiming to reduce water loss along the distribution
    network. The investments have been partially subsidized due to their high costs.
    The irrigation system in the Baix Ter district is mostly located along the surface,
    despite governmental economic policies promoting the transformation to pressurized
    irrigation, especially drip irrigation (DOGC, Num. 6947, 1 September 2015, Ordre
    ARP (270/2015)). The behavior of the farmers and Irrigation Communities can be
    primarily explained because surface irrigation is supposed to be a low cost to
    the farmer in terms of installation, with zero energy requirements. In the future,
    the coexistence of surface and pressurized irrigation systems in this area is
    predicted. The type of water tariff paid by the farmers is for the irrigable surface
    area and is slightly variable according to the irrigation district, ranging from
    120 to 160 €·ha−1·year−1 (excluding the fee for improvement works). Assuming an
    irrigation amount of 7000 m3·ha−1, the price is equivalent to 0.017–0.023 €·m−3.
    In the irrigation districts with earthen canals, 60% of the fee goes towards clearing
    vegetation from the channels and cleaning the beds. Usually, the water is distributed
    on demand, although in shortage periods it is distributed on rotation. All the
    moving elements of the channels are governed manually. In the context of the geographical
    area (with a high competency for the inter-sectoral water use, and some periods
    of insufficient supply), the main concern of the irrigators is to have a guaranteed
    water supply. The request of the irrigators and broad social sectors at the Water
    Administration has resulted in a greater flow rate of the Ter River, reducing
    the water transfer to Barcelona metropolitan area. The implantation of markets
    for irrigation water in this irrigation area would guarantee the optimal reassignment
    of the resource during low-water periods to prevent conflicts; however, the irrigators
    would not accept this new tool and its associated transaction costs [53]. The
    Irrigation Communities are facing several problems. (i) There is a lack of knowledge
    regarding the irrigation water needs and discharge rates required by different
    crops due to the lack of technology and appropriate metering systems. This fact
    does not encourage irrigators to make the best use of their allocated water; (ii)
    The hydraulic infrastructure is based on existing manual controls and is managed
    only by pre-established schedules that do not allow for adjustment of the water
    plot deliveries to the changing irrigation requirements. Therefore, it would be
    necessary to have real-time and continuous control of the water levels in the
    canals in order to obtain optimal deliveries improving, thus, distribution and
    application efficiencies up to the field scale; (iii) It is challenging to operate
    a hydraulic control system based on a manual system that also produces losses
    of water and overflows within the hydraulic network; (iv) It is difficult to manage
    the irrigation plots. The lack of technical criteria to define input flow rates
    and cutting times on the plot scale affects not only the achieved efficiency in
    the field but also the optimal alterations to the main and secondary channels.
    An example of the potential that can be achieved under surface irrigation can
    be illustrated by the irrigation distribution uniformity of the low quarter and
    efficiency application achieving of 88 and 93%, respectively, as reported by Arbat
    et al. [54] in a commercial furrow irrigated ornamental orchard in the Sèquia
    Vinyals; (v) The price the irrigators pay for the water is not consistent with
    the pricing policy set forth in the EU Water Framework Directive. The progressive
    adaptation of pricing is expected to happen and will be important for consideration.
    Consequently, improving the efficiency of the surface irrigation in the Baix Ter
    irrigation district should be approached with the dual aims of improving the irrigation
    channel control and improving the irrigation at the field scale. The required
    technology is based on the control and automation from the plot supply to the
    main and secondary channels, thus solving several problems that the Irrigation
    Communities of the Baix Ter area are currently facing, giving them the right tools
    and considering economic criteria to achieve a good return on their investment.
    The surface irrigation system is deeply rooted in the culture and customs of the
    irrigator of the Baix Ter region. It is the most sustainable irrigation system,
    given both its lack of an operational energy consumption and its effects on life-cycle
    assessment of materials and carbon footprint. Furthermore, this system is fully
    integrated into the landscape in an attractive way. These values are particularly
    interesting in an area such as the Baix Ter, which is a strategic area in terms
    of the tourism and recreation economies. 3.3. Urgell District The Segre River
    originates in the Pyrenees mountain range and passes through the central valley
    of Catalonia (NE Spain), ultimately flowing into the Ebro river. The irrigation
    district of the Urgell canal is located in this depression (Figure 4). The irrigation
    area is served by two main canals and four secondary canals, which supply a total
    area of 70,000 ha. The main water use is agriculture, but this waterway also provides
    urban, livestock, industrial and environmental supplies. Alfalfa, cereals, and
    fruits are grown. Surface irrigation is mainly used (92%), but drip and sprinkler
    irrigation is also used to a lesser extent. Figure 4. General view of the main
    and secondary canals of the Urgell Canal district. The main canal was built in
    1861, but most of the irrigation network has been modified. Most main canals (191
    km), secondary canals (102 km) and tertiary canals have all been lined, although
    a few stretches remain unlined given their historical and scenic interest. Recent
    studies [55] have shown that the conveyance efficiency of the main canals considering
    evaporation and seepage losses is 94%. When considering operation losses, this
    efficiency decreases to 86%, indicating that operations could be improved. The
    water users association is currently increasing the canal height, which would
    allow for a higher water capacity as well as automation. The network has several
    remotely controlled gates. The irrigation network is organized in rotation, with
    the ability to distinguish two types of zones: one in which regulating reservoirs
    have been built, without the need to irrigate at night, and another that represents
    40% of the irrigation area, which must be irrigated at night. The latter system
    translates into an inconvenience for farmers and a decrease in water efficiency.
    A possible improvement in this area would be to automate irrigation. Irrigation
    assessments have been completed [56]. These suggest that efficiency is closely
    related to the soil characteristics. In soils developed on thin detrital materials,
    irrigation efficiencies typically range between 65% and 85%, while in soils developed
    on gravels with high infiltration rates, the efficiencies are between 20% and
    40%. Before 2000, Segre river regulation was quite low to assure an adequate supply
    to the irrigation area, resulting in many years of shortage. For this reason,
    small weirs were built in drainage ditches in the lower irrigation area to derive
    this excess water from the highlands. This factor increases the overall efficiency.
    Inside the irrigation area, there is an endorheic basin. This basin contains a
    swamp that has grown after the construction of the canal due to surplus irrigation
    water, becoming a 200 ha swamp with abundant wildlife and fishing. In 1951, they
    drained the swamp to allocate more land for agriculture. However, in 2005, it
    was decided to recover it to restore its ecological and landscape functions and
    make it a tourist resource for the area. Presently, the canal provides the same
    amount of water as agricultural land. 3.4. Lis Valley District The Lis Valley
    district, from the Lis Valley Irrigation Project, is a small yet important agricultural
    area of the Center of Portugal, with a total area of 2000 ha managed by the Lis
    Water Users Association (Figure 5). Its irrigation and drainage system dates back
    to 1957. An annual average of approximately 7.1 million m3 of water is used to
    grow corn grain, rice, and horticultural crops as well as for orchards, meadows
    and forage. Figure 5. Location of the Lis Valley Irrigation Project (Portugal).
    The water supply to the open channels conveyance network relies on weirs installed
    along the Lis River and tributaries. In the dry season, it also uses water pumped
    from drainage ditches. The irrigation network comprises 17 weirs, two of which
    are modern and automatic structures. The length of the primary irrigation network
    is 44.5 km; the secondary irrigation network consists of 180 km of small lined
    or earthen channels. In terms of water distribution, the most important problems
    are the water shortage and poor water quality in the summer (dry) period, and
    the absence of automation mechanisms to control water levels in the network channels,
    leading to malfunctions. Furthermore, there is not a monitoring system in the
    distribution network to support its efficient operation. At the on-farm level,
    there is a need to further develop the irrigation systems by improving the land
    levelling and the use of water distribution equipment to accurately control the
    inflow rates. Presently, the national government is planning for the rehabilitation
    of a significant part of the water distribution network that will reduce the water
    losses in the channels and simplify their management. It will also allow for increases
    in the cultivation of more profitable crops, namely, nurseries and horticultural
    crops. However, the study of different options for the automation of this network
    is of particular relevance to achieve optimized solutions of water distribution
    that better integrate farm irrigation. Challenges in developing surface irrigation
    at the levels of off-farm (responsibility of the water users associations) and
    on-farm (responsibility of the individual farmers) distribution networks include
    improving several factors: (i) the quality of hydraulic infrastructures to reduce
    water losses and control flow more accurately by installing automatic control
    equipment in the networks; (ii) the management of collective networks through
    the implementation of operational plans to adjust the demand for water in each
    irrigation season with the corresponding distribution, which requires the integration
    of diverse information in real time; (iii) system design quality related to the
    maintenance of the land leveling at the field plot scale; (iv) irrigation control
    and allocation through monitoring of soil saturation and vegetation in addition
    to the adjustment of application times, feed rates, and required allocations;
    (v) water application control using automated systems to optimize application
    efficiency and reduce hand labour consumption; and (vi) the re-use of excess flow
    at the downstream end of irrigated fields. 4. General Issues That Emerge from
    the Case Studies Analysis of the case studies has identified several water resource
    management issues that need to be taken into account for the improved implementation
    of gravity-fed surface irrigation practices and techniques in the future. (i)
    The high level of competition for water among agricultural, civil and industrial
    users, especially where rural areas are included in or strongly connected to the
    urban fabric is one such issue; as is (ii) the importance of environmental and
    recreational uses of water. For example, some agricultural areas—such as Baix
    Ter, which is included in the Costa Brava area—are included in regions with a
    high level of tourism and economic interest, especially during the summer when
    the water demand for agriculture is at its highest); (iii) The role of aquifer
    recharge due to irrigation in preventing the risks of seawater intrusion in coastal
    aquifers should also be considered; as well as (iv) the low efficiency in water
    conveyance and distribution due to the often precarious control of the infrastructure
    and a lack of flow regulation flexibility; (v) Irrigation scheduling decision
    support services that provide the farmer with information about “when” and “how
    much” irrigation are also lacking. In particular, specific problems that occur
    in study areas are (i) the lack of knowledge of crop water requirements as well
    as the delivered water volumes at the single farm or irrigation district scales
    (due in many cases to the absence of appropriate metering systems); (ii) the limitations
    of the existing hydraulic infrastructure based on manual controls and managed
    according to pre-established seasonal schedules that do not allow for shorter-term
    adjustments to the changing irrigation requirements; and (iii) the unmeasured
    seepage losses from the canal network. Reasons for These Limitations The lack
    of technically sound criteria to define the correct flow rate and cutting time
    of the gates strongly affects the water use efficiency at the field scale and
    the water delivery efficiency at the canal scale. Rijo and Almeida [57] showed
    that conveyance efficiencies for automatic systems of flow regulation, developed
    in the context of the Sorraia Irrigation project (Portugal), were more than 80%
    during the irrigation period. In contrast, Koech et al. [58] reported that the
    application of automatic gate irrigation systems in furrow-irrigated cotton fields
    in Australia has led to an application efficiency of up to 90%. It follows that
    the problem of increasing the efficiency of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems
    should be approached with two synergic objectives: improving the control of flow
    in the irrigation canals (district scale) and improving the water application
    at the field scale (farm scale). Although researchers have developed new devices
    and practical scheduling procedures to improve gravity-fed surface irrigation
    systems over the last decade [59,60], the adoption of these devices and procedures
    has been limited for many reasons. At the farm scale, the issue most frequently
    mentioned by growers is the lack of financial benefits for changing their current
    practices, which they consider to be adequate. In many cases, the initial investment
    to modernize the traditional pattern of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems
    with automatic and remote-controlled devices is about the same investment necessary
    to adopt a pressurized system for irrigation. Moreover, in contexts such as Northern
    Italy, where extensive cultivation is mainly intended for livestock food and connected
    to the milk production economy, this conversion is not profitable. Therefore,
    future gravity-fed surface irrigation technologies should merge net farmer incomes
    with water efficiency and productivity so that the farmers will be persuaded to
    adopt these new technologies for their own economic interests while increasing
    irrigation efficiency. Using a financial approach to incentivize increases in
    water efficiency rather than an engineering one appears to be prudent when assessing
    irrigation performance at the farm level because any managerial (e.g., scheduling)
    and operational (e.g., equipment) inefficiencies associated with irrigation are
    implicitly included in the assessment of profits [60]. In fact, given that the
    current gravity-fed surface irrigation systems are mainly manually managed, such
    inefficiencies lead to an amplification of the time and labor costs required for
    irrigation, which must be subtracted from the yielded profits. Another factor
    strongly limiting the modernization of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems
    is the perception that farmers have about the efficient use of water for irrigation.
    In Knox et al. [60], the questionnaire answered by growers belonging to eight
    samples of farmers in eastern England showed that most of the growers surveyed
    (63%) considered “irrigation efficiency” to be best defined as “applying the right
    amount of water at the right time in the right place”. A quarter of the respondents
    interpreted irrigation efficiency as “maximizing the value of the water applied
    (Money/Volume)” and 13% as “improving production per unit of water applied (Yield
    weight/Volume)”. The definitions relating to irrigation water use efficiency,
    including “improving the yield from the same amount of water” and “maximizing
    the proportion of water used by the plant”, were not selected by any farmers.
    In Mediterranean contexts, this problem is exacerbated by the lack of farmer knowledge
    about crop water requirements and the insufficient presence of organizations (either
    governmental or commercial) to provide irrigation scheduling advice for farmers
    that adopt gravity-fed irrigation methods. Although some research on the development
    of irrigation decision support systems has been funded by EU in the last 10 years
    [61], it has not always succeeded in converting research outputs into marketable
    products and commercial success stories. Research activities are often more research-driven
    than farmer-driven, and only two projects of the 10 quoted in the work of Giannakis
    et al. [59] had developed a business plan to commercialize their research innovation.
    Lastly, the human capital characteristics of the farm populations play a prominent
    role in the adoption of new irrigation management tools and technologies for gravity-fed
    irrigation systems. Lichtenberg et al. [62] found that farmers with a higher level
    of education are more likely to adopt sensor network irrigation technologies.
    In particular, farmers with a high school education are 23% less likely to adopt
    the new irrigation technology compared to those with a post-secondary degree.
    Genius et al. [63] recorded similar findings, i.e., farmers with a higher educational
    level (more than 9 years) are more likely to adopt new irrigation technology.
    Genius et al. [63] found also that farmers up to 60 years old are more likely
    to adopt new technology than farmers older than 60 years, highlighting the short
    planning horizon of the older farmers. However, in the Mediterranean European
    countries, approximately 57% of farmers are older than 55 years old; in Portugal,
    Italy and Spain, these percentages are 71%, 61% and 55%, respectively [59]. In
    this context, farmers exhibit substantial risk aversion and are skeptical of adopting
    new technologies. This uncertainty can be alleviated through on-farm testing and
    demonstrations, farmer-to-farmer communication and the active involvement of farmer
    advisory systems [61]. At the district scale, the irrigation water delivery by
    gravity-fed surface irrigation systems is not usually measured or is often not
    measured accurately, particularly at the secondary and tertiary levels. In addition,
    the flow rates at the intake of the delivery canals are not routinely recorded.
    The reasons for these failings are mainly due to the complexity that the gravity-fed
    surface irrigation system networks have developed over the centuries. Many canals
    have a mixed use and are important for both the delivery and drainage of water
    from the fields. In several cases, this network is convoluted and abstruse. The
    lack of water measurements and poor quality of district records discourage the
    irrigation Consortium and Association from the implementation of new irrigation
    technologies that aim to improve water conveyance efficiency and resource allocation
    [64]. Moreover, the lack of methodologies for assessing the water delivery performance
    of the open irrigation canals makes the quantification of the gap between the
    potential and actual performance of these irrigation systems challenging [65].
    5. What Can We Do? 5.1. Technical Advice To address the problems described above,
    we believe that a practicable requalification of gravity-fed surface irrigation
    systems in the context of rural Mediterranean Europe could be achieved through
    strategies that evolve from trinomial Measure-Model-Management (M3). In the following,
    we try to explain this concept in light of the literature results obtained in
    different world contexts. Measuring facilitates the analysis of gravity-fed irrigation
    delivery systems in terms of adequacy, efficiency, dependability, and equity of
    water delivery [66]. The measures could provide a quantitative assessment not
    only of the overall irrigation system performance but also of the contributions
    to the total performance from the structural and management components of the
    system. For example, in the works of [67,68,69], the adequacy, efficiency, dependability,
    and equity indexes of open canals in Mali, Turkey and Egypt ranged from 0.20 to
    0.90, demonstrating the high possibility of improving the performances of the
    delivery systems adopting automated and remote-controlled operational procedures.
    Despite this, many studies on the possibility of assessing the water delivery
    performance of gravity-fed irrigation systems are present in the literature in
    the rural contexts of the United States of America, Africa and Southeast Asia
    [64,70], whereas no research has currently been completed by authors in Mediterranean
    European contexts. This is due to the lack of flow measures and the necessity
    of building hydraulic structures for reliably measurements. However, modern technologies
    that are based on optical sensors and on open-hardware devices could be suitable
    for the continuous and real-time control of flows in complex situations or open-unlined
    irrigation canals [71,72,73]. The work of Luthi et al. [74] on a smartphone application
    that calculates the flow by analyzing a few seconds of a movie sequence that is
    recorded by the operator on-site is a good example of such research. The flow
    is calculated based on measurements of the water level, the surface velocity obtained
    from Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique and a priori knowledge on the
    canal geometry. In Mediterranean Europe, this application could have several advantages,
    such as reducing the work time of Consortium workers to take measurements and
    improving the ease of data collection, which could simply be sent via SMS to a
    dedicated database. Models can be subdivided into three main categories. The first
    category focuses on the hydraulic analysis of irrigation canal flow networks,
    while the second aims to assess crop water requirements at farm and district scales.
    The third category uses decision support systems for scheduling irrigation. The
    first two typologies of the models could be considered for the reasonable operation
    and planning with optimized irrigation and water allocation. For example, the
    study by Kim et al. [75] carried out in a paddy district of South Korea showed
    the good performance (in terms of calibration and validation) of the combined
    hydraulic-hydrologic Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) for providing hydraulic
    analysis of the irrigation network and water balance in the fields. In Mediterranean
    European contexts, this model could assist in promoting accurate irrigation scheduling
    on the district scale based on crop water requirements as well as optimizing the
    distribution of water in the irrigation network through sluice gate control. In
    addition, conjunctive modelling based on hydrological-economic features could
    investigate the interdependencies between gravity-fed surface irrigation systems,
    the district water balance and the economic impact of new irrigation decision
    strategies [5]. Simulations and scenarios of the optimized irrigation scheduling
    and water allocations could be produced, thus improving the irrigation planning
    processes from the farm to the district scale [76]. We believe that for a fast
    feedback effect on Mediterranean European rural territories of the M3 approach,
    the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems should be equipped with automatic and
    remote-controlled gates whenever possible as well as flow meters for the continuous
    measurement of the irrigation flow both in the canals and into the fields. At
    the farm scale, Australian experiences in the cotton fields have shown that the
    application of these automatic systems leads to the maximization of the application
    and distribution uniformity efficiencies (>85%), ensuring that the water reaches
    the end of the field with a uniform level in all points of the field [58]. Currently,
    only two experiments are running in Spain and Italy for providing the crop water
    requirements using automatic and remote controlled prototypes of bay-gates. In
    Spain, automatic furrow irrigation is tested on maize and grass using soil humidity
    probes at different depths in the field as the control of crop water needs (Figure
    6a), while in Italy, automatic sluices governed by water level sensors in the
    field maintain the correct flood state of flood in the paddy field, as shown in
    Figure 6b [77]. Figure 6. Prototypes of automatic and remote controlled-gates
    for gravity-fed surface irrigation of grass field in Northern Spain (a) and rice
    field in Northern Italy (b). At the district scale, the overview provided by Oakes
    et al. [78] on the collective experience gained over the last 20 years in the
    development and application of automation technology to the open channel irrigation
    sector, primarily in Australia but more recently in the USA, China, New Zealand,
    India, Vietnam, France and Italy, highlighted that the automation and remote control
    of gravity irrigation systems will be useful for improving the productivity of
    irrigated agriculture to reach food production goals over the next several years.
    However, they suggest that the key success factor for the modernization of the
    gravity-fed irrigation systems is a smooth transition to an automated irrigation
    system, implementing sound education/information/training programs for both the
    consortium staff and customers in the use and maintenance of these systems. 5.2.
    Economic Advice The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development supports
    investments in irrigation scheduling infrastructure to provide economic and environmental
    benefits. Several measures can be used for the protection and maintenance of water
    resources in agriculture, namely, measure 6.1.01 (for the realization and modernization
    of agricultural holdings), measure 7.6.01 (for infrastructure related to the development
    and adaptation of agriculture and forestry), measure 1.2.01 (for the vocational
    training and information actions), measures 10 and 16 (for agri-environment payments
    and cooperation), and measure 4.4.02 (for non-productive investments for irrigation
    management). In total, approximately 50% of the budgets of Rural Development Programmes
    in EU member states has been allocated to measures that relate to a certain or
    limited extent to water for the 2014–2020 period. 5.3. Reviving Interest in Gravity-Fed
    Surface Irrigation Systems Finding solutions that safeguard the gravity-fed surface
    irrigation systems is necessary to maintain the environmental and ecological equilibrium
    of rural areas in Southern Europe and to preserve the cultural heritage of these
    irrigation systems. The multi-functional characteristics of the gravity-fed surface
    irrigation systems (Figure 7) could be safeguarded by the conservation and revitalization
    of these systems driven by historic, ethnological, educational, ecological and
    environmental interests [79,80]. Two major directions could serve as the foundation
    for future revival initiatives. On the one hand, the focus could be on the preservation
    of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems themselves as an agro-cultural heritage
    [81,82]. On the other hand, the focus could be on the nature conservation benefits
    that result from these systems [83,84]. Figure 7. Example of the multi-functionality
    character of the gravity-fed surface irrigation system in Northern Italy rural
    contexts. In the first case, the traditional structure and networks of gravity-fed
    surface irrigation systems could be considered as an “eco-museum”, in which their
    complexity and ancient origin could be investigated through historical and landscape
    studies and possibly explained in situ during educational visits. In fact, the
    risk of a potential demise of traditional gravity-fed surface irrigation systems
    is equivalent to the loss of traditional knowledge. Gravity-fed surface irrigation
    is a typical skill-oriented technology [85]. Currently, gravity-fed surface irrigation
    practitioners are able to combine their rich hands-on experience with the local
    traditional knowledge. Their skills may be implemented into the new automatic
    gravity-fed surface irrigation systems with specific irrigation scheduling management
    tools according to the crop requirements and agronomic practices. In the second
    case, the nature conservation benefits of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems
    have been widely demonstrated in the case study areas, where the centuries-long
    development of this type of irrigation system has contributed to the development
    of their characteristic agro-natural environment [86,87]. For example, the prolonged
    presence and circulation of water due to the surface irrigation of paddy fields
    from sowing to harvest represents a distinguishing feature of some of these irrigated
    areas (e.g., in parts of the Northern Italy plains and in the Baix Ter irrigation
    districts) that has been included in the European ecological network NATURA 2000
    and is on the official list of the European Special Protected Areas. In addition
    to heritage preservation and nature conservation, additional environmental factors
    have emerged as driving forces for the preservation and restoration of gravity-fed
    surface irrigation systems, although the integrated landscape-ecological consequences
    of these systems require further research [88,89]. As highlighted in the previous
    paragraphs, gravity-fed surface irrigation schemes are thought to be generally
    of low water use efficiency or even to be “wasteful”. To establish whether an
    irrigation technique is efficient for a specific territory, it is necessary to
    quantify the water availability and the irrigation water demand for that area
    and then to evaluate the efficiency of the irrigation systems. However, the irrigation
    efficiency should be evaluated using a larger-scale approach (from the irrigation
    district to the basin), considering not only the hydraulic efficiency but also
    the secondary benefits [90]. Such secondary benefits range from recreational features,
    including the picturesque rural roads bordering the canals, to ecological functions,
    including the preservation of the traditional fauna and flora of the rural landscape.
    These factors improve the multi-functional character of the gravity-fed surface
    irrigation systems. In a case study in northern Portugal, Van den Dries and Portela
    [86] demonstrated how the conversion of a gravity-fed surface irrigation system
    into a pressurized system has paradoxically provoked a reduction in the deliveries
    at the farm level. In gravity-fed surface irrigation systems, the water excess
    on the fields was returned to the natural downstream waterway, thus representing
    the new (and in many cases, the majority) input for the irrigation of the downstream
    farms. These ‘losses’, which are generally due to drainage or percolations, are
    important for regional aquifer recharge and for maintaining the minimum flow and
    level in the rivers [91]. In addition, the water ‘losses’ along the unlined water
    conveyance and distribution systems represent a possibility for aquifer recharge
    management [92]. Interestingly, a recent study by Seraphin et al. [93] found that
    using isotopes for tracing the contributions to the groundwater recharge of the
    Cru aquifer in France, showing that about 69% ± 9% of the surface recharge is
    caused by irrigation return flow i.e., from specific irrigation practices and
    the presence of unlined canals. Moreover, many assumptions suggest that the quality
    of water that flow in the gravity-fed surface irrigation canals is comparable
    with that in the feeding rivers. In the light of this consideration, the seepage
    of water from unlined canals, in contrast to deep percolation at the fields, preserves
    groundwater from the chemical contamination of agronomic treatments, pursuant
    to the EU directives for water pollution reductions (i.e., “nitrate directive”
    91/676/CEE [94]). Lastly, the perfect integration found between gravity-fed surface
    irrigation canals and urban fabric in many situations such as in Milan metropolis,
    confers to these irrigation systems a new important role related to a “hydraulic
    protection of the territory” [95]. In fact, the huge increase of impervious areas
    as a consequence of the urban expansion, in the last decades, has caused an unexpected
    increase in the frequency and intensity of flood events. In these urban contexts,
    where the areas for flood storage are hard to find, an alternative solution for
    flood risk mitigation (in addition to the green infrastructure projects) could
    be the rehabilitation of interconnections between sewer and irrigation canals
    with spillways designed for allowing rainwater to be stored into the irrigation
    network. 6. Conclusions In the last decade, concerns about water scarcity have
    focused on the relationship between irrigation and other competing water uses.
    Especially in the countries of Southern Europe, where gravity-fed surface irrigation
    systems are the most common infrastructure type for crop and pasture irrigation,
    many policy guidelines have started to promote the transformation of these traditional
    systems into pressurized ones to avoid waste and increase the supply efficiency.
    However, as highlighted in this work, to face the complexity of irrigation water
    resource management conflicts and address the challenges in improving irrigation
    practices, “hard-path” approaches are not enough. In fact, case studies show that
    gravity-fed surface irrigation systems have important environmental and ecosystem
    functions in addition to their hydraulic role and are part of the cultural heritage
    of rural Southern Europe. Some of these benefits are connected with maintaining
    the riparian vegetation and habitats along the canals, recharging the groundwater
    supply, and providing areas for recreation activities and tourism. Thus, designing
    smart “soft-path” measures will be possible to increase the flexibility of the
    gravity-fed surface irrigation systems in response to the projected climate and
    changes in water availability. These designs should consider distributed and participatory
    irrigation managements, on-demand irrigation, low-cost and reversible infrastructural
    interventions, flow measures and automatic and real-time controls. A new Irrigation-Energy-Environmental-Landscape-Cultural
    Heritage nexus has been added to the more traditional Energy-Irrigation nexus
    and Food-Energy-Irrigation nexus [96], demonstrating that if the gravity-fed surface
    irrigation systems currently present and deeply-rooted in Mediterranean rural
    contexts are opportunely restored, they are preferred over “modern” systems (such
    as pressurized pipes) because they provide “efficiencies” in many fields beyond
    their hydraulic functions. In particular, in contrast to the scarce supply efficiency
    at the farm scale, the effective efficiency of these irrigation systems at the
    district or basin scale is emblematic, given their capacity to exchange water
    with the subsoil, reuse field runoff and feed the rivers. Hence, ecosystem functions
    and landscape characteristics of the rural environments are ensured, guaranteeing
    favorable outcomes for all agro-environmental aspects. In our opinion, a smart
    restoration of the gravity-fed surface irrigation system in Southern Europe areas
    could be obtained using the M3 approach described in Section 5.1, combining flow
    measures and soft infrastructural improvements with hydraulic-hydrological and
    decision-support models as well as matching multidisciplinary competences and
    water user needs. It has become increasingly clear that the analysis of irrigation
    system developments is necessary for managing these territories, and this requires
    considering the availability of natural resources to interpret the changing demands
    of users and address the existing and potential conflicts that will arise between
    consumptive and non-consumptive water uses. In conclusion, we wish that with this
    work, the awareness of the importance and uniqueness of some Southern Europe gravity-fed
    surface irrigation systems will increase. It is our hope that in the future, agricultural
    and environmental policies will be further safeguarded, encouraging additional
    research on their continued enhancement and rehabilitation. Acknowledgments This
    work arises from the need to protect and preserve the typical gravity-fed surface
    irrigation systems belonging to the Mediterranean areas of Europe. The authors

  description: An integrated approach to the design of an automatic control system
    for canals using a Linear Quadratic Gaussian regulator based on recursive least
    squares estimation was developed. The one-dimensional partial differential equations
    describing open channel flow (Saint-Venant) equations are linearized about an
    average operating condition of the canal. The concept of optimal control theory
    is applied to drive a feedback control algorithm for constant-level control of
    an irrigation canal. The performance of state observers designed using the recursive
    least squares technique and the Kalman filtering technique is compared with the
    results obtained using a full-state feedback controller. An example problem with
    a multi-pool irrigation canal is considered for evaluating the techniques used
    to design an observer for the system. Considering the computational complexity
    and accuracy of the results obtained, the recursive least squares technique is
    found to be adequate for irrigation canals. In addition, the recursive least squares
    algorithm is simpler than the Kalman technique and provides an attractive alternative
    to the Kalman filtering. © Tübi̇tak.

  description: Spatial and temporal variation of infiltration rates make the management
    of surface irrigation systems a very complex process. Surge irrigation presents
    additional complications due to wetting and drying cycles and their effect on
    infiltration. In this study, we developed a model that incorporates feedback control
    for management of surge irrigation. The infiltration profile at the completion
    of the advance phase is represented by a specialized power function. A computer
    simulation using a range of inflow rates was evaluated to determine the constants
    in the power function. The model uses an analytical solution to calculate the
    infiltration profile for the post-advance phase. The infiltration rate during
    the post-advance phase is assumed to remain constant. The analytical solution
    to the kinematic wave formulation can simulate overlapping and nonoverlapping
    of surge waves which enhances the evaluation of surge irrigation performance.
    The model was verified using field data and found adequate for field application
    with feedback-controlled surge irrigation.

  description: Globally, the irrigation of crops is the largest consumptive user of
    fresh water. Water scarcity is increasing worldwide, resulting in tighter regulation
    of its use for agriculture. This necessitates the development of irrigation practices
    that are more efficient in the use of water but do not compromise crop quality
    and yield. Precision irrigation already achieves this goal, in part. The goal
    of precision irrigation is to accurately supply the crop water need in a timely
    manner and as spatially uniformly as possible. However, to maximize the benefits
    of precision irrigation, additional technologies need to be enabled and incorporated
    into agriculture. This paper discusses how incorporating adaptive decision support
    systems into precision irrigation management will enable significant advances
    in increasing the efficiency of current irrigation approaches. From the literature
    review, it is found that precision irrigation can be applied in achieving the
    environmental goals related to sustainability. The demonstrated economic benefits
    of precision irrigation in field-scale crop production is however minimal. It
    is argued that a proper combination of soil, plant and weather sensors providing
    real-time data to an adaptive decision support system provides an innovative platform
    for improving sustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also shows that
    adaptive decision support systems based on model predictive control are able to
    adequately account for the time-varying nature of the soil-plant-atmosphere system
    while considering operational limitations and agronomic objectives in arriving
    at optimal irrigation decisions. It is concluded that significant improvements
    in crop yield and water savings can be achieved by incorporating model predictive
    control into precision irrigation decision support tools. Further improvements
    in water savings can also be realized by including deficit irrigation as part
    of the overall irrigation management strategy. Nevertheless, future research is
    needed for identifying crop response to regulated water deficits, developing improved
    soil moisture and plant sensors, and developing self-learning crop simulation
    frameworks that can be applied to evaluate adaptive decision support strategies
    related to irrigation.

    “The efficient and effective use of water is considered the main driver for improving
    sustainability in irrigated agriculture. Conventional irrigation practices apply
    water uniformly over a field resulting in a high volume of water use. Overirrigation
    may also result from this practice which causes leaching of nitrates and nutrients
    into ground water sources. Precision irrigation presents a promising platform
    for improving sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This is especially hinged
    on the possibility of eliminating the adverse environmental impacts related to
    conventional irrigation practices with the adoption of precision irrigation.”

    Figure Versions Notes Abstract Globally, the irrigation of crops is the largest
    consumptive user of fresh water. Water scarcity is increasing worldwide, resulting
    in tighter regulation of its use for agriculture. This necessitates the development
    of irrigation practices that are more efficient in the use of water but do not
    compromise crop quality and yield. Precision irrigation already achieves this
    goal, in part. The goal of precision irrigation is to accurately supply the crop
    water need in a timely manner and as spatially uniformly as possible. However,
    to maximize the benefits of precision irrigation, additional technologies need
    to be enabled and incorporated into agriculture. This paper discusses how incorporating
    adaptive decision support systems into precision irrigation management will enable
    significant advances in increasing the efficiency of current irrigation approaches.
    From the literature review, it is found that precision irrigation can be applied
    in achieving the environmental goals related to sustainability. The demonstrated
    economic benefits of precision irrigation in field-scale crop production is however
    minimal. It is argued that a proper combination of soil, plant and weather sensors
    providing real-time data to an adaptive decision support system provides an innovative
    platform for improving sustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also
    shows that adaptive decision support systems based on model predictive control
    are able to adequately account for the time-varying nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere
    system while considering operational limitations and agronomic objectives in arriving
    at optimal irrigation decisions. It is concluded that significant improvements
    in crop yield and water savings can be achieved by incorporating model predictive
    control into precision irrigation decision support tools. Further improvements
    in water savings can also be realized by including deficit irrigation as part
    of the overall irrigation management strategy. Nevertheless, future research is
    needed for identifying crop response to regulated water deficits, developing improved
    soil moisture and plant sensors, and developing self-learning crop simulation
    frameworks that can be applied to evaluate adaptive decision support strategies
    related to irrigation. Keywords: precision irrigation; adaptive decision support
    systems; model predictive control; crop yield; water savings; sustainability 1.
    Introduction Globally, 70% of water use is applied in irrigation of crops, making
    irrigation the largest consumptive user of fresh water [1]. Over 80% of freshwater
    withdrawals in developing countries is applied in irrigation [2]. Irrigated agriculture
    provides 40% of the world’s food from less than 20% of the cultivated area highlighting
    the importance of irrigation in global food security [3]. Irrigated crop production
    globally extends over 275 million hectares, with an estimated annual increase
    of 1.3% [2]. Global climate change may further increase irrigation water demand
    due to a greater variation in annual precipitation amounts [4]. Postel [5] suggested
    that irrigation will provide 46% of the global crop water requirement by 2025,
    which was computed as 28% in 1995, resulting in a decline of rain-fed agriculture.
    Food production in the developing world, notably in South, Southeast and East
    Asia, is at present heavily reliant on irrigation. The total irrigated area in
    Asia is 230 million ha, which represents over 70% of the global irrigated area.
    Of the 230 million ha of irrigated land area, 60% is located in China and India
    [3]. It is estimated that 75% of the grain production in China is dependent on
    irrigation [2]. Sarma [6] noted that India uses as much as four times more water
    to produce one unit of a major food crop as compared to the USA and Europe. This
    implies that an improvement in water use efficiency in the developing world would
    conserve at least half of the water presently applied in irrigation. It is estimated
    that a water volume of 2630 km3 is abstracted yearly from surface and ground water
    sources for irrigated crop production. The absence of surface water sources in
    a number of communities has further increased the pressure on groundwater resources.
    This has resulted in the over-abstraction of global groundwater sources which
    is calculated to be as much as 163 km3 per annum [2]. A global shortage in freshwater
    sources is predicted unless action is taken to improve water management and increase
    water use efficiency. This has necessitated greater regulatory demands for environmental
    protection of freshwater [7]. It is reported that only half of the total freshwater
    volume abstracted for irrigation globally reaches the targeted crops [2]. These
    have brought about the need to devise procedures to use the limited water more
    efficiently while maximizing crop yield and quality. Conventional irrigation practice
    involves applying water uniformly over every part of the field without taking
    into account the spatial variability in soil and crop water needs; this consequently
    leads to overirrigation in some parts of the field while other parts of the field
    are underirrigated [8]. The risks associated with overirrigation include surface
    runoff, deep percolation and leaching of nitrates and nutrients. Those associated
    with underirrigation are more subjective and include reduction in crop yields
    and quality, as well as inefficient use of fertilizer and other supplemental inputs
    for crop production [9]. The irrigation process requires a high level of ‘precision’
    in order to optimize the water input and crop response, while minimizing adverse
    environmental impacts. Precision irrigation is an evolving field with active interest
    by both industry and academic researchers. It is conceptualized by some researchers
    as the use of efficient irrigation application systems, whereas others view it
    as the variable application of irrigation based on predefined maps or sensor feedback
    [10]. Smith et al. [11] suggested that ‘precision’ involves the accurate determination,
    quantification of crop water needs and the precise application of the optimal
    water volume at the required time. This implies that varying water application
    spatially is not the sole requirement for the achievement of ‘precision’ in the
    irrigation process. Hence, precision irrigation can be defined as the process
    of accounting for the field-scale spatial variability in crop water need and applying
    the right amount of water to match the spatial crop water need at the right time
    [9]. The advantages associated with precision irrigation include increased crop
    yields, improved crop quality, improved water use efficiency/savings, reduction
    of energy costs and reduction of adverse environmental impacts [12]. Pierce [13]
    viewed precision irrigation as a tool for improving sustainability in irrigated
    agriculture in terms of improved irrigation water use efficiency and improved
    environmental quality of irrigated fields. The balance of several core aspects
    is however important for the successful implementation of a robust precision irrigation
    system. Implementing a precision irrigation system involves efforts on real-time
    monitoring of crop and soil conditions, scheduling irrigation and control of the
    irrigation application equipment. Research has been mainly focused on the sensing
    and control aspects of precision irrigation with much advancements in the last
    decade [12]. Research is limited, however, in the development of appropriate irrigation
    scheduling tools for the precision irrigation process [14]. Irrigation scheduling
    is the process by which a producer determines when to apply irrigation and the
    amount of irrigation water to apply [15]. Hornbuckle et al. [16] suggested that
    the irrigation scheduling endeavour should be treated as an all-encompassing decision
    support system for irrigation management. A robust decision support system is
    important in the successful implementation of precision irrigation. The need for
    a decision support system capable of real-time management decisions of when, where
    and how much to irrigate while also considering uncertainty in climatic inputs,
    the time-varying nature of cropping systems, as well as equipment and operational
    limitations cannot be overemphasized. Rhodig and Hillyer [17] noted that the development
    of an optimal decision support tool for precision irrigation will involve the
    combination of appropriate modeling and management tools. The decision support
    tools available for precision irrigation management are presently inflexible and
    difficult to adapt to varying cropping scenarios [18]. In recent years, there
    has been a number of in-depth reviews on precision irrigation (e.g., [9,16]),
    and our intention is not to repeat the areas they addressed. Rather, our aim is
    to provide an in-depth technical analysis of the considerations necessary for
    the development of a practical and robust decision support system for precision
    irrigation in order to improve sustainable irrigated agriculture. To that end,
    the review will focus on the following critical aspects of precision irrigation:
    (1) monitoring considerations; (2) present limitations and state of the art in
    decision support; and (3) opportunities for improving sustainability. We will
    however include brief sections on the concept of spatial variability and the control
    of water application in precision irrigation. 2. Spatial Variability: The Long-Term
    Challenge of Irrigated Agriculture The underlying argument for precision irrigation
    is the presence of within-field spatial variability that influences crop water
    demand. The spatial variability in crop water demand may have a direct influence
    on the crop yield, quality and the environmental quality of irrigated fields [19].
    The soil water presents the sole source of water available for direct plant uptake
    and therefore its spatial variability will have a direct influence on crop water
    demand. Soil and landscape characteristics like soil texture, topography, abiotic
    and management factors (e.g., compaction, tillage) and hydraulic properties vary
    spatially across a field [11]. These have a direct influence on the water-holding
    capacity of the soil. Hedley and Yule [20] reported that the spatial variation
    in the soil water retention characteristics was strongly correlated with the spatial
    variation in soil texture across a field, noting that areas with heavier soils
    within a field had a larger water-holding capacity in comparison to those with
    light textured soils. The advent of rapid non-invasive technologies for mapping
    soil properties, specifically electrical conductivity mapping, can reveal within-field
    variability that can guide in variable rate irrigation management. These have
    been successfully applied by Hedley and Yule [21] and Daccache et al. [8]. Readers
    are directed to [22,23] for a comprehensive overview of electrical conductivity
    mapping. The variability in yield across a field has also been found to be strongly
    correlated with the spatial variability in water available for crop use. The spatial
    variability in crop yield is a function of the interplay between water stress,
    nutrients, in addition to soil’s physical and chemical properties [24]. The yield
    map can be correlated with the soil electrical conductivity (EC) map. These similarities
    can be explained through the spatial variability of soil properties that exists
    across a field. The water-holding capacity of the soil is a major factor affecting
    yield, and the yield map will likely show a strong correlation to soil EC [25].
    Irmak et al. [26] noted that the spatial variability in soil water retention characteristics
    played a dominant role in explaining the spatial yield variability observed in
    soybean. Martinez-Casasnovas et al. [27] suggested yield mapping as an important
    tool in variable rate irrigation management. A robust precision irrigation system
    will be able to meet the spatially varying crop water demand across a field at
    the right time. This requires accurate knowledge of the within-field variability.
    This is addressed by applying the concept of irrigation management zones/units
    in precision irrigation. The irrigation management zones are a group of homogeneous
    units with similar soil water retention characteristics [21]. It is however important
    that these management zones are large enough to be managed individually while
    remaining relatively homogeneous in order to reflect the spatial soil variation
    across the units. The delineation of irrigation management zones based on real-time
    sensor data has also been demonstrated. This is achieved by applying infrared
    thermometry/thermography to assess the spatial variation in crop canopy temperature
    across a field [28]. The crop canopy temperature of a healthy transpiring crop
    will often be less than that of the ambient air. When crop transpiration is reduced
    as a result of water deficits, the crop canopy temperature is expected to increase.
    The characterization of crop water status as a function of the canopy and ambient
    temperature is the basis for using infrared thermometry/thermography as a mapping
    tool for precision irrigation [29]. Shaughnessy et al. [30] and Evett et al. [31]
    have successfully applied this procedure in generating dynamic maps to guide variable
    rate water application for field crops grown under a center pivot system. It should,
    however, be noted that infrared temperature measurements are usually taken over
    a short period, mostly at midday when the crop is expected to experience the highest
    evaporative demand. Hence, this method is well suited for crop production systems
    in which the soil moisture dynamics has relatively long time constants. 3. Spatial
    Scales of Irrigation Management Centre pivot, lateral move and low energy precision
    application (LEPA) moving machines can be modified to apply spatially variable
    irrigation [32]. These systems are particularly suited to variable rate water
    application because of their current level of automation and large coverage area
    with a single lateral pipe. Fixed irrigation systems also have potential to be
    deployed for variable rate water application as they can be very accurate and
    can be automated based on sensor feedback [2]. Implementing a spatially varied
    irrigation system requires an understanding of the characteristics of the irrigation
    application system deployed including the spatial scales covered by the water
    application equipment. The spatial scale associated with the variability in crop
    water requirements and its impact on yield should also be identified [32]. O’Shaughnessy
    et al. [33] suggested that the size and numbers of irrigation management zones
    that can be controlled in a precision irrigation strategy will determine the overall
    flexibility of the system. For moving application systems, the width of the management
    zone is dependent on the number of drops or nozzles within an individually controlled
    set (i.e., sprinklers controlled by a single solenoid valve) and the length will
    be dependent on the pattern of variability in the direction of the traveling sprinkler.
    The wind speed and the overlap from the wetted sprinkler patterns between management
    zones will also affect the accuracy of the water volume applied. Raine and McCarthy
    [32] noted that the spray diameter and overlap achieved by moving application
    systems make it impossible to target water applications on a single crop basis
    using these systems. Hedley et al. [2] suggested that the economic benefits of
    spatially varied irrigation should be an important consideration even when the
    system is considered achievable from a technical standpoint. The spatial scales
    associated with moving and fixed irrigation systems is presented in Table 1. Smith
    et al. [11] concluded that the spatial resolution of a precision irrigation system
    will be influenced by the spatial scales associated with the application system,
    spatial resolution of the infield sensors and the spatial scales associated with
    the variability in crop water requirements. Table 1. Spatial scales of fixed and
    moving irrigation systems. 4. Control of Water Application in Precision Irrigation
    The water application system used in the precision irrigation process must be
    able to control the water application volume applied per unit time to each defined
    irrigation management unit within a field [13]. The development of variable rate
    water application systems has been mostly focused on continuous move systems [11].
    The control of water application on continuous move systems (centre pivot, linear
    move, boom and reel) is based on databases of spatially referenced data defining
    irrigation management units [20]. The volume of water applied to each management
    unit can be achieved by varying the application rate of sprinklers or controlling
    the ground speed of continuous move systems [13]. The application rate of sprinklers
    is mostly varied through the pulse modulation of the sprinkler nozzles. This involves
    the application of normally opened solenoid valves to control flow through an
    individual or group of sprinkler heads. The solenoid turns the flow of water either
    on or off at a sprinkler location in order to achieve a desired application depth
    within a specified cycle time. The cycle time is the total number of switching
    (either to on or off phase) required by the solenoid valves during a pulse cycle
    [34]. Evans et al. [34] applied the pulse modulated sprinkler control on a linear
    move sprinkler system. Daccache et al. [8] also applied a pulsed modulated sprinkler
    control on a boom and reel irrigation system. Field evaluation of both systems
    indicated a satisfactory performance over a range of water application rates.
    They however noted a problem with sprinkler overlap at the edge of the irrigation
    management units. The variation in irrigation volume applied by a continuous move
    system can also be achieved by varying its travel speed. The sprinklers on the
    manifold of the irrigation system are usually operated at a specified flow rate
    and pressure. An increase in travel speed of the system reduces the application
    depth and a decrease in the travel speed increases the application depth [35].
    This type of system cannot be applied in situations where variable application
    depths are needed along the length of the irrigation system [34]. Al-Karadsheh
    [9] evaluated the performance of speed control in achieving variable water application
    rate on a linear move system. The wetted diameter of the sprinklers was reported
    to be between 15.2 and 21.3 m. He reported that the system needed to travel a
    minimum distance of 16 m before a desired change in application volume can be
    reached. This suggests that this system is not suitable for use in applications
    where the management units are small in scale. The adaptation of fixed irrigation
    systems for variable rate water application has been achieved (e.g., [36]). Variable
    water rate application in these systems is usually achieved either by individual
    nozzle or emitter control, or zone management [13]. Readers are referred to [13]
    for a comprehensive review of such systems. Miranda et al. [37] described a distributed
    control system implemented to achieve variable rate water application in a fixed
    irrigation system operating in predefined management zones. Their results indicated
    that the system was able to apply the irrigation volume required in each zone.
    Goumopoulos et al. [38] also implemented a variable rate water application setup
    for a fixed irrigation system capable of zone-specific irrigation of strawberries.
    Individual nozzle control in a micro-sprinkler system has been demonstrated by
    Coates et al. [39]. They reported individual control of 54 nodes in a vineyard
    with the system. The nozzle connected to each node was capable of achieving a
    unique water application volume. They concluded that the water requirements of
    each defined zone in the vineyard can be individually met by the irrigation system.
    The authors reported a payback period of between 3.5 and 4.5 years for the system.
    5. Monitoring The routine or continuous monitoring of moisture fluxes in the soil–plant–atmosphere
    system is a fundamental aspect of managing crop production in irrigated agriculture.
    Monitoring can essentially be viewed as the application of various sensing technologies
    in determining and characterizing the spatiotemporal field-scale moisture dynamics
    and plant water use. These sensing methods can be classified under three broad
    headings: soil-based, weather-based and plant-based sensing [40]. Soil-based sensing
    typically involves the use of sensors to determine the soil moisture content or
    potential. This information is then used to infer the amount of water available
    for plant use and its temporal dynamics. The weather-based sensing involves the
    use of the crop evapotranspiration to determine the temporal crop water use. The
    evapotranspiration is determined using climatic variables such as radiation, rainfall
    and wind speed [41,42]. The plant-based sensing involves the determination of
    plant water status which is usually related to plant physiology. Measurements
    of canopy temperature, stomatal resistance, sap flow, leaf turgor pressure, stem
    diameter and leaf thickness are used to infer plant water status [43]. Recent
    advances in remote sensing has enhanced the possibility of monitoring the spatial
    nature of both soil and crop water status. Remote sensing encompasses non-contact
    technologies that are capable of sensing radiation reflected or emitted from agricultural
    fields. They are deployed using satellites, aerial platforms and tractors [44].
    These technologies have a high spatial resolution and are well suited for regional
    soil and crop water evaluation [45]. This review focuses on sensing technologies
    that can be applied in monitoring field-scale soil and crop water dynamics. Readers
    are referred to [44,46] for a comprehensive review of remote sensing technologies
    applicable in precision agriculture. 5.1. Soil-Based Sensing The knowledge of
    soil moisture fluxes comprising of the depletion and refill of soil water can
    be used to monitor crop water use hence making it a useful tool in irrigation
    scheduling and management decisions [47]. Several methods have been developed
    for measuring soil moisture content; they are indirect methods which rely on the
    strong relationship between a particular property of the soil and the soil moisture
    content. Moreover, they are able to provide continuous monitoring and are non-destructive
    [48]. In precision irrigation, the commonly applied method for monitoring the
    temporal dynamics of field-scale soil moisture is the dielectric-based method
    [20]. This is because of the ease of their deployment in large-scale soil moisture
    sensor networks [49]. Thus, the proper deployment and management of this technology
    can optimize the sustainability of irrigated agriculture. Consequently, this section
    will outline a brief description of this method including a consideration of the
    factors affecting sensor performance. For a more detailed description of other
    state-of-the-art soil moisture sensing technologies, readers are referred to [50,51].
    5.1.1. Dielectric Soil Moisture Sensors Dielectric soil moisture sensors operate
    by exploiting the dielectric properties of soil and its constituents [52]. The
    relative dielectric permittivity of a substance is used to describe the effect
    of an electromagnetic field on its molecular structure. It is a dimensionless
    constant greater than one, made up of a real and imaginary part [53]. The apparent
    relative dielectric permittivity of soil, ε′ soil is a function of its constituents
    majorly being water, air and solid particles. The relative dielectric permittivity
    of the other constituents except water has a negligible effect as they have small
    values in the range of 1–7. The one of water, ε′ water having a value of approximately
    80 has the most remarkable effect. It is therefore possible to correlate the volumetric
    moisture content (VMC) to ε′ soil using empirical equations at a frequency range
    of between 50 MHz and 17 GHz. At this high frequency range, ε′ soil is highly
    stable and it usually referred to as the apparent dielectric permittivity of soil
    [54]. A range of electromagnetic sensors exploits this property to provide a non-destructive
    in situ measurement of soil moisture contents. They include time domain reflectometry
    (TDR) sensors, time domain transmission (TDT) sensors and capacitance sensors.
    5.1.2. Factors Affecting the Performance of Dielectric Soil Moisture Sensors The
    accuracy of data from soil moisture sensors is important in the precision irrigation
    process. Over estimation of soil moisture status may lead to a delay in irrigation
    scheduling decisions and consequently affect crop yield and quality. Underestimation
    of soil moisture status on the other hand may lead to application of irrigation
    too often or when not required by the crops. This will result in water/energy
    wastage and adverse environmental effects. Dielectric soil moisture sensors measure
    the soil moisture content for the soil volume corresponding to their sphere of
    influence. The various factors affecting the performance of dielectric soil moisture
    sensors include bulk electrical conductivity (salinity), soil texture, bulk density
    and temperature. A variation in any of these factors around the sphere of influence
    of the dielectric sensor will have an effect on its performance. These properties
    vary with location and depth in a soil profile and it is important to take them
    into account when calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors [55]. These sensors
    often rely on site-specific calibration, but they often come with ‘universal’
    calibrations which can be used where absolute accuracy is not required. The accuracy
    of calibration equations supplied by manufacturers of these sensors are usually
    between a range of ±4 - 2% VMC when applied in non-saline soils [56]. Site-specific
    calibration equations which are developed by comparing the sensor output to gravimetrically
    derived soil moisture content can be applied when a higher level of accuracy is
    required [57]. In addition, for capacitance type probes, it is essential that
    the probe access tubes are fitted correctly without air gaps to ensure robust
    soil water measurements. For a detailed technical description of factors affecting
    the performance of dielectric sensors, readers are referred to [58,59]. 5.2. Proximal
    Sensing and Mapping of Soil Moisture The recent advances in rapid mapping and
    positioning technologies enables the spatial characterization of soil moisture
    retention properties to inform precision irrigation decisions. The electromagnetic
    induction (EM) technique is used in combination with accurate positioning systems
    to quantify soil moisture variability at resolutions less than 10 m. It also provides
    a highly accurate digital elevation map (DEM) [2]. The EM sensor maps the soil’s
    apparent EC which is influenced by soil texture and moisture in non-saline soils
    [48]. Those same factors correlate highly to the soil’s water-holding capacity.
    Based on the EC maps, a targeted soil sampling can be conducted at different parts
    of the field. Topographic features that are likely to influence field-scale soil
    moisture dynamics are derived using the DEM [60]. The EC maps enable the grouping
    of discrete units known as management units with similar available water-holding
    capacity (AWC) characteristics which can then be used in selecting soil moisture
    monitoring sites. This has been demonstrated by [34,61]. The data from soil moisture
    sensors located in the management units can also be used in generating dynamic
    application maps based on a relationship between the soil moisture depletion and
    the mapped EC values. These application maps serve as an input into the precision
    irrigation control system. Hedley and Yule [21] applied soil moisture sensors
    and an EC map in generating dynamic water status maps for a 35.2 ha irrigated
    maize field. Daccache et al. [8] applied a similar method in producing dynamic
    soil moisture maps for various fields. The electric resistivity tomography technique
    can also be applied in deriving the EC map of a field. Hedley et al. [2] reported
    that the method has a good vertical resolution but it cannot be deployed on a
    moving platform for rapid non-invasive mapping. It has been applied by Kelly et
    al. [62] in positioning soil moisture sensors to support irrigation decisions.
    The ground-penetrating radar (GPR) can also be applied in monitoring the field-scale
    soil moisture status [50]. It can be mounted on a vehicle or moving irrigation
    system for mapping soil moisture in a field. The GPR is however affected by high
    clay content, is not amenable to automation and requires further development to
    improve its viability in precision irrigation applications [63]. The deployment
    of soil moisture sensors in management units defined by these mapping techniques
    enables the dynamic updates of soil moisture maps which can aid variable rate
    water application. 5.3. Weather-Based Sensing Weather-based sensing involves the
    use of climatic variables in determining ET which is indicative of the crops’
    daily water use. Evaporation accounts for the direct evaporation of water to the
    air from the soil surface or canopy interception of either precipitation or applied
    irrigation. Transpiration accounts for the uptake of water by a plant and the
    subsequent loss of water as vapor through stomata in its leaves, required for
    metabolic cooling of the leaf to maintain photosynthesis without the leaf overheating
    [41]. Evapotranspiration is generally viewed as a combination of the evaporation
    of water from the soil, evaporation from the canopy surface and plant transpiration
    [64]. The evaporation and transpiration process occur simultaneously and are often
    difficult to distinguish. The predominance of each of these processes however
    varies at different crop growth stages. At the initial crop growth stage, water
    is lost mainly in form of evaporation from the soil surface. As the development
    of the crop progresses, transpiration becomes the major medium of water loss to
    the atmosphere [45]. The ET process is largely dependent on solar radiation, vapor
    pressure deficit of the atmosphere at any given time and wind speed. It is also
    influenced by soil water content, the rate at which water can be taken up from
    the soil by the plant roots and crop characteristics (type, variety and growth
    stage) [64]. Readers are directed to [41,65] for a further discussion on the ET
    process. The temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales
    is appropriate for quantifying crop water use in the precision irrigation process.
    The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM)
    equation presents a procedure for computing hourly or daily ET values using standard
    climatological measurements of solar radiation, air temperature, humidity and
    wind speed made at a height of 2 m above a fully transpiring grass surface [41].
    These data can be obtained from automatic weather stations installed on a specific
    field or from a metrological network. The equation provides a basis from which
    reference ET (ET from the well-watered grass surface) for different time periods
    can be calculated and to which ET from other crops can be computed using crop
    coefficients, K c [66]. The crop coefficients are specific to each crop and crop
    canopy cover, which is dependent on the crop growth stage. The K c curve defined
    for a crop over its growth stage is generalized for regions with similar climates.
    The K c is however dependent on the canopy dynamics including cover fraction,
    leaf area index and greenness which may vary across regions with similar climates
    [67]. This introduces errors into ET estimates derived using the standard FAO-PM
    crop coefficient approach. The FAO-PM method presents a relatively easy procedure
    for determining the temporal dynamics of crop water use. The crop coefficient
    used in determining the actual ET of a particular crop however needs to be estimated
    at each growth stage. It is noted in Allen et al. [41] that reference ET can be
    overestimated by as much as 20% during conditions of low evaporative demand. Remote
    sensing provides a means of overcoming the shortcomings of the FAO-PM crop coefficient
    approach of estimating crop ET by providing real-time feedback on daily crop water
    use as influenced by actual crop canopy dynamics, local climatic conditions and
    field spatial variability [68]. The remotely sensed normalised difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) computed from crop canopy reflectance measurements in the red and
    near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths has been found to be a useful tool in computing
    accurate crop coefficients for a broad range of crops [69]. Singh et al. [70]
    has demonstrated the use of the calculated reference ET and the remotely sensed
    NDVI in estimating the water use of cotton. A similar procedure has also been
    demonstrated by Farg et al. [67] for estimating the daily water use of wheat.
    The surface renewal analysis method presents an opportunity for assessing the
    real-time temporal dynamics of crop water use. The surface renewal (SR) method
    is used to determine the sensible heat which can then be applied to the energy
    balance equation to determine the latent heat (i.e., ET) [71]. It is based on
    analyzing the temperature time series generated from monitoring the change in
    heat content of air parcels that interact with the crop canopy. When an air parcel
    comes in contact with the crop canopy, the air temperature remains constant for
    a brief time period known as the quiescent period. The temperature of the air
    parcel however increases after this time period as energy is transferred to it
    from the crop canopy. The increase in temperature continues until the air parcel
    is replaced by cooler air from the atmosphere. At this time, the temperature of
    the air shows a sharp drop [72]. A high frequency trace of this temperature renewal
    event exhibits a ramp-like function. Applying structure function theory to the
    ramp function enables the determination of the sensible heat flux. The instrumentation
    requirement for an SR system is minimal, consisting of small diameter fine wire
    thermocouples or a two-dimensional sonic anemometer and a high frequency data
    acquisition system (2 Hz to 10 Hz) [71]. Standard climatological measurements
    are also required to obtain the other parameters in the energy balance equation.
    The SR technique requires that measurements are taken at a minimum height above
    the crop canopy. It is assumed that the canopy is homogeneous and able to absorb
    all the momentum transferred to it by the ambient airflow [73]. This assumption
    introduces errors in ET estimates over fields with variable canopy structures.
    Castellvi and Snyder [74] concluded that the technique can be applied for estimating
    ET from short and dense canopy crops as they are mostly decoupled from the environment.
    The technique also requires calibration using an eddy covariance system or a lysimeter.
    This may limit its practicality for farm-scale deployment. The SR methodology
    proposed by Castellvi [75], however, does not require calibration. Rosa and Tanny
    [76], Shapland and Snyder [72], and Rosa et al. [77] have reported highly accurate
    hourly ET estimates from various crops using a surface renewal analysis system.
    5.4. Plant-Based Sensing The importance of plant-based monitoring becomes emphasized
    when studying the effect of water deficit on plants and its relation to plant
    water status. The temporal dynamics of crop water use can be monitored using a
    number of plant-based methods. They include methods that require direct contact
    with the plant and those that require only proximal contact with the plants [78].
    The contact sensors are useful in monitoring the temporal dynamics of the plant
    water status while the proximal sensors are capable of assessing the spatial nature
    of crop water status across a field and hence well suited for the precision irrigation
    process [11]. A good understanding of the various aspects of plant water status
    and plant drought physiology is important in the successful application of these
    systems. Readers are directed to [79,80] for a comprehensive overview of plant-based
    sensing methods applicable in irrigation management. Plant-based sensing systems
    measure either the plant water content, plant water potential or the plant physiological
    response to moisture deficits. A summary of various plant-based sensing systems
    is given in Table 2. It should be noted that many of these require skilled manpower
    and considerable management time for their operation. Table 2. Summary of plant-based
    monitoring methods. 5.5. Thermal Sensing Plant canopy temperature is a widely
    accepted variable indicative of plant water status. The stomata controls evaporative
    cooling of the leaves based on soil water status and prevailing environmental
    conditions. It closes due to increased water deficits and a reduction in plant
    transpiration causing an increase in plant canopy temperature [91]. The measurement
    of the crop canopy temperature by infrared thermometry which is then normalized
    using an index such as the crop water stress index (CWSI) can be used in determining
    the plant water status and its response to water deficits [79]. The CWSI is a
    well-established method of accounting for the variation in canopy temperature
    as a function of prevailing microclimatological conditions and water deficits
    [92]. It relates the difference in the crop canopy temperature measured using
    infrared thermometry to the air temperature as a function of atmospheric vapor
    deficit [93]. This temperature difference is then related to an upper and lower
    temperature baseline to determine a water stress index. The upper baseline represents
    a non-transpiring crop and the lower baseline represents a fully transpiring crop
    under the same prevailing environmental condition [30]. The CWSI is a dimensionless
    value of between 0 and 1, with a value of 0 indicating a well-watered crop and
    a value of 1 indicating a severely water-stressed crop [93]. Biotic factors can
    also induce stress in a plant thus affecting transpiration rate, crop water use
    and canopy temperature. These biotic factors also affect leaf colour and morphology
    which in turn affects the optical properties of the crop canopy [94]. In order
    to successfully apply infrared thermometry as a tool for assessing plant water
    status, it is important to differentiate between abiotic (such as water stress)
    and biotic stresses (such as plant diseases and pest infestation). Multiband optical
    sensors could be applied in detecting various crop diseases and crop infestation
    within a field by computing vegetation indices based on canopy reflectance measurements
    [33]. This has been applied by Garcia-Ruiz et al. [95] for detecting citrus greening
    and by Yang et al. [96] for detecting infestation of green bugs and aphids in
    wheat. It may be useful to outfit precision irrigation systems with these sensors.
    The main advantage of thermal sensing for precision irrigation application is
    related to the non-contact and real-time capability of the system. Infrared thermometry
    and thermography provide the opportunity to map the spatial variation in crop
    water status which can guide in variable rate irrigation management. The use of
    thermal sensing for guiding zone-specific water application has been demonstrated
    as noted in Section 2. A major problem faced in applying the thermal sensing approach
    is the establishment of the baseline temperatures. In climates in which the air
    humidity is often high, variations in wind speed and net radiation introduce significant
    errors in the estimation of the lower limit baseline temperature [97]. A number
    of studies have been conducted to develop procedures for enhancing the possibility
    of applying measurements of crop canopy temperature in inferring plant water status
    in humid regions. Jones [98] provides an excellent summary of these research efforts.
    They include the use of well-watered plots to substitute for empirical non-water
    stressed baselines, although these well-watered plots are rarely available in
    practice. The use of artificial reference surfaces for measuring baseline temperatures
    has been proposed but it is reported that these artificial reference surfaces
    differ significantly in thermal and radiative properties in comparison to real
    leaves. A modeling approach to simulating the canopy resistance of well-watered
    plants has also been investigated but this is limited by the difficulties encountered
    in correctly modeling stomata behavior and hence canopy resistance. The possibility
    of including a wide range of metrological data including net radiation and vapor
    pressure deficit in deriving CWSI models for humid climates has also been investigated.
    The mathematical complexity typical of the models however limit their practical
    application. Another problem commonly encountered in applying infrared measurements
    of canopy temperature in inferring plant water status is the inclusion of soil
    temperature and other background temperature including the sky and stems in the
    measured canopy temperature. This usually leads to errors in estimation of the
    canopy temperature as the soil and background temperature are usually many degrees
    different from the canopy temperature [90]. Jones [99] proposed the use of narrow
    acceptance angle infrared sensors that can be positioned to view only single leaves
    as a solution to this problem. It has however been found that the temperature
    estimates of single leaves determined by this method is mostly not representative
    of the temperature of the plant canopy. A dense deployment of infrared sensors
    may seem an alternative but this may be prohibitive in terms of cost for practical
    applications. The advancements in the field of thermal imagery and the recent
    availability of low-cost thermal cameras has presented the possibility of overcoming
    the problems associated with the inclusion of soil and background temperatures
    in the measured canopy temperature. Thermal imagery allows for the average temperature
    of a defined area to be obtained and also the separation of background temperature
    from the area of interest. The temperature of a large number of individual leaves
    making up a canopy can be included in an image while the soil and background temperature
    can be discarded by applying automated image processing techniques [92]. Gonzalez-Dugo
    et al. [100] has demonstrated the use of thermal imagery in mapping the crop water
    status in a commercial orchard in Spain. They also demonstrated the rapid mapping
    of field-scale crop water status by deploying thermal imaging equipment on an
    unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Plant-based sensing methods including thermal sensing
    only provide information on the need for irrigation and provide no information
    on the volume of irrigation application needed. They are used in combination with
    soil-based sensing for this reason [19]. 6. Decision Support A decision support
    system for irrigation management and scheduling provides a framework for incorporating
    various tools and techniques for site-specific irrigation decisions. The widespread
    commercial adoption of precision irrigation will be predicated on the development
    of robust and optimal decision support systems [19]. A number of decision support
    systems schedule irrigation at predefined intervals and apply predefined irrigation
    volumes. They do not incorporate any form of sensor feedback on plant water status,
    soil water status and climatic variables [101]. This ‘open-loop’ strategy is largely
    designed based on heuristics and historical data. Mareels et al. [102] suggested
    that this is an inefficient approach often leading to overwatering and waste of
    fertilizer and other supplemental crop inputs. Closed-loop irrigation strategies
    aim to irrigate: when the soil moisture content reaches a certain threshold [103,104,105];
    when plant sensors indicate a certain stress threshold [93,106,107] or with feedback
    from crop simulation models with the aim of attaining a certain yield, crop physiological
    response or economic objective [108]. These closed-loop irrigation strategies
    have been shown to improve water use efficiency in the production of horticultural
    crops under protected environments. Environmental conditions in such production
    systems can be controlled based on plant feedback which eliminates the stochastic
    plant response often encountered in field-scale crop production [109]. Belayneh
    et al. [110] implemented a wireless sensor network of soil moisture sensors for
    closed-loop irrigation control in a pot-in-pot nursery. A significant reduction
    in water use was achieved by the system. The authors also reported a 2.7-year
    payback period for the system. Chappell et al. [111] reported water savings of
    83% for a closed-loop irrigation control system implemented in a protected crop
    production system. They noted that there was less occurrence of plant diseases
    in the nursery due to the elimination of over-watering. Saavoss et al. [112] reported
    a 65% increase in profit due to the implementation of a wireless sensor network-based
    closed-loop control system in a nursery. The authors noted that the increase in
    profit was due to improvement in crop quality and yield resulting from the precise
    control of irrigation applications. In field-scale crop production, the crop needs
    vary over time and space due to both biotic and abiotic factors [9]. McCarthy
    et al. [113] noted that in these crop production systems, closed-loop strategies
    are unable to account for unknown crop dynamics, the stochastic nature of climatic
    variables and crop response, and the time-varying nature of the soil-plant-atmosphere
    system. This last point is especially due to crop growth, crop management and
    infestation of pests and diseases. The closed-loop systems are also unable to
    consider equipment and other operational limitations. McCarthy et al. [114] concluded
    that an optimal decision support system must be ‘adaptive’ with the ability of
    accommodating the temporal and spatial variability within the field. The decision
    support system must also have the capability of modifying irrigation decisions
    in response to crop physiology, uncertainties in climatic inputs, soil, irrigation
    systems and water supply limitations, economic considerations and the quality
    of sensor feedback. 6.1. Adaptive Decision Support The characteristics of a cropping
    system varies over time. Within a cropped system, the properties that will typically
    vary within and between seasons include crop growth, soil properties (due to addition
    of nutrients and other management processes) and climate. This will have a direct
    influence on the irrigation timing and volume required for optimal crop growth
    [11]. An adaptive decision support system is able to continuously re-adjust the
    irrigation scheduling algorithm in order to retain the desired performance of
    the irrigation system [114]. The adaptive decision support system is able to utilize
    historical or real-time sensor data to arrive at irrigation timing and volume
    that adequately accounts for the temporal and spatial variability in the field
    [114]. In control theory an adaptive control system is generally accepted as a
    control system able to adjust its controller parameters based on sensor feedback
    from a process, such that the controlled process behaves in a desirable way [11].
    McCarthy et al. [108] noted that an adaptive decision support system for irrigation
    may either be sensor-based if they use direct sensor measurements for the irrigation
    strategy or model-based if they use a calibrated simulation model to aid irrigation
    decisions. The development of adaptive decision support systems presents an opportunity
    to improve sustainability in precision irrigation through improved water use and
    crop productivity. They will also enhance synergistic applications of data available
    from soil, plant and weather sensors to arrive at optimal irrigation scheduling
    decisions [108]. In this section we will present a brief discussion on state-of-the-art
    of adaptive decision support systems. We will thereafter discuss the opportunities
    these systems present in improving sustainability in irrigated agriculture. Readers
    are referred to [113] for a comprehensive overview on the application of advanced
    process control to irrigation, details on methods of operation and a consideration
    of fundamental control concepts as they apply to irrigation scheduling. 6.1.1.
    Mechanistic Models A number of irrigation decision support systems are based on
    complex physical models which closely resemble the actual physical system [115].
    They are able to incorporate the physiological and morphological representation
    of the plant into the decision support tool. Barnard and Bauerle [116] described
    an irrigation scheduling system based on the spatially explicit biophysical model,
    MAESTRA (Multi-Array Evaporation Stand Tree Radiation A), which couples the within-canopy
    photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. Data on leaf temperature, canopy aerodynamics
    and environmental variables are used as inputs into the model to predict the plant
    transpiration. They reported that the model-based tool applied between 18% and
    56% more water than a sensing-based method for scheduling irrigation in four species.
    They, however, noted that the model-based approach produced greater tree growth.
    Asher et al. [117] described a mechanistic model capable of inferring crop water
    requirements. The model employs leaf temperature data as input for determining
    the crop aerodynamic characteristics which is then used in the Penman–Monteith
    equation for calculating the actual crop ET. A major drawback of these mechanistic
    models is that they include static parameters which, once identified, are assumed
    to remain constant over the cropping season. This is rarely so in practice as
    the cropping system varies over time due to both biotic and abiotic factors. 6.1.2.
    Simulations Crop simulation models based on first principle physical models of
    crop phenology, soil physics and hydrology can be applied in simulating the crop
    response to irrigation and cropping system management [115]. These simulation
    models provide the opportunity to evaluate the benefit of several precision irrigation
    strategies as they eliminate the need for time-consuming field experiments [118].
    They can be interfaced with real-time sensor feedback from soil or plant sensors
    and weather data to determine daily irrigation requirements of crops. They can
    also be used in predicting the yield impact of an irrigation strategy. This is
    achieved by employing weather forecast data in computing a daily soil moisture
    balance and assessing the impact of soil moisture deficits on crop growth [118].
    DeJonge et al. [14] investigated the effect of variable rate irrigation management
    on corn production in Iowa using the CERES-maize model. Corn yield was compared
    for a period of 28 years under simulated scenarios of no irrigation, scheduled
    uniform irrigation and precision irrigation. They reported no significant difference
    in corn yield and water use between the uniform irrigation and precision irrigation
    scenarios. Thorp et al. [24] described a methodology for applying the Decision
    Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop growth model in analyzing
    variable rate management practices including irrigation on crop growth and yield.
    The platform enabled the evaluation of precision irrigation strategies on crop
    performance in predefined management zones. These systems are however incapable
    of real-time decision support and can only be applied using historical data. McCarthy
    et al. [114] proposed a simulation framework, VARIwise, capable of real-time decision
    support in precision irrigation. The simulation framework is capable of incorporating
    real-time data input from field sensors in arriving at irrigation decisions. The
    combination of different sensor inputs into the simulation framework enables adaptive
    decision support with the system being able to re-adjust irrigation decisions
    based on plant feedback and also explore optimal control strategies. Simulation
    models for use in irrigation decision support require extensive calibration and
    validation to establish model accuracy. The limitation in data available for this
    endeavour often limit the use of the platforms to specific crops. 6.1.3. Artificial
    Intelligence Artificial intelligence presents the potential of solving problems
    in precision irrigation which are complex, non-linear and ill-defined [119]. Artificial
    intelligence algorithms are able to emulate the human decision-making process
    when applied to a particular problem domain. They have been deployed for implementing
    adaptive decision support in irrigation in form of artificial neural networks,
    fuzzy logic and expert systems with mixed success to date [118,119,120]. ● Artificial
    Neural Networks Artificial neural networks (ANN) are non-linear mapping structures
    employed in modeling when the underlying data relationship is not well defined.
    ANN are able to identify and learn correlations between input data and corresponding
    target output values. They are able to predict the outcome of new independent
    data sets making them a useful tool in predictive modeling [121]. ANN are well
    suited for the irrigation decision support problem that can often be complex and
    stochastic in nature. These networks are also adaptive in nature and are able
    to continuously learn in order to provide optimal solutions to target problems
    in dynamic systems. Karasekreter et al. [122] implemented an ANN for scheduling
    irrigation in a strawberry orchard using soil moisture and its physical properties
    as model inputs. The system was able to achieve water savings of 20.5% and an
    energy saving of 23.9%. ANN however require large datasets for training and are
    unable to describe the physical dynamics of a system. This makes their use limited
    in real-time decision support tools. ● Fuzzy Logic Fuzzy logic is an artificial
    intelligence algorithm that can be used to model a process and relate it to human
    experience in arriving at decisions. A fuzzy logic system is made up of a set
    used to classify input data into membership classes, a decision rule that is applied
    to each set which culminates in a human-like decision output from the system [123].
    A detailed description of the process is given in [124]. Mousa and Abdullah [123]
    successfully applied a fuzzy logic model in scheduling irrigation in drip and
    sprinkler irrigation systems using ET, soil moisture data and crop growth stage
    as model inputs. Prakashgoud and Desai [124] employed a fuzzy logic system using
    soil moisture data, leaf wetness and climatological data as model inputs in order
    to implement irrigation scheduling decisions. The system was capable of maintaining
    soil moisture thresholds in the specified range. Giusti and Marsili-Libelli [125]
    described an adaptive irrigation decision support system implemented with fuzzy
    logic. The system incorporates a predictive model of the soil moisture and an
    inference system for maintaining the soil moisture within an acceptable threshold.
    The system was reported to adapt irrigation decisions to rainfall uncertainty
    and produced water savings of 13.55% over a simulation period of 168 days. The
    accuracy of fuzzy logic systems is largely tied to an in-depth knowledge of the
    system. They also lack an inner mechanistic structure with the domain of applicability
    limited to the range of training data used in setting them up. Delgoda et al.
    [115] suggested that the points mentioned makes decision making with a fuzzy system
    an ad hoc process limiting its application in adaptive decision support. ● Expert
    Systems An expert system is a tool able to emulate the reasoning process a human
    expert would employ in a decision-making process in his/her field of expertise.
    It captures the human decision-making expertise and heuristics representing it
    in a series of rules and facts [126]. An expert system typically consists of a
    knowledge base component and an inference engine that acts as a reasoning tool
    [127]. Expert systems are especially suited to dynamic problems that are of a
    complex nature. They are also well suited to dealing with incomplete and uncertain
    data [128]. This makes them well suited for irrigation decision support which
    often requires the input of experts to arrive at optimal decisions. Expert systems
    applied in irrigation decision support can be classified as either ‘expert systems
    proper’ or hybrid expert systems. A detailed review on the application of expert
    systems in irrigation decision support is given in [128,129]. The ‘expert systems
    proper’ class of irrigation decision support tools schedule irrigation based on
    soil moisture and climatic data. They are unable to consider the time-varying
    nature of the cropping system (crop growth, disease and pest infestation) to arrive
    at optimal irrigation decisions. They are also unable to account for the stochastic
    nature of climatic variables and are not well suited for real-time applications
    [129]. Hybrid expert systems which are also referred to as model-based expert
    systems combine algorithmic techniques and a knowledge-based component in solving
    problems relevant to its application domain. Its advantage in irrigation is that
    optimal irrigation decision can be made by combining expert knowledge with data
    feedback from infield sensors, data-driven models and crop simulation models [130].
    Thomson and Ross [131] described a model-based expert system designed for decision
    support in irrigation management. The system employs feedback from soil moisture
    sensors to adjust the input of a crop simulation model, PNUTGRO (peanut crop growth
    simulation model), and also incorporates the capability of sensor feedback validation.
    The system was reported to maintain soil moisture at the defined thresholds. Goumopoulos
    et al. [38] developed an expert system-based adaptive decision support platform
    for zone-specific irrigation of strawberry plants. The system includes a wireless
    sensor network of soil, climate and plant sensors providing feedback for the decision
    support system. It also includes a machine learning process capable of inferring
    new rules and extending the knowledge base from logged data sets. The system was
    reported to reduce irrigation water consumption by around 20%. A hybrid expert
    system based on real-time soil moisture data with the capability of incorporating
    plant models is described in Kohanbash et al. [132]. The performance of an expert
    system is largely dependent on the effectiveness of the knowledge acquisition
    process. An error in this process will drastically affect the system reliability
    and its performance. 6.1.4. Learning Control Learning control decision support
    strategies perform systems identification using sensor feedback without defining
    a mathematical model [113]. Systems identification models a dynamic system based
    on a time series of measured input/output data [133]. A comprehensive overview
    on the theory of systems identification is presented in [134]. Iterative learning
    control can be applied in systems with ill-defined models that operate repetitively
    and assume the same initial condition after each iteration. It is well suited
    to the irrigation problem as irrigation scheduling and application is a repetitive
    problem over the crop season. The time-varying nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere
    system can also be viewed as an ill-defined problem. The strategy is also able
    to improve system performance by eliminating the effects of a repeating disturbance
    with undefined dynamics. Applied to irrigation, this may be a measured crop response
    that reoccurs as a consequence of irrigation. The temporal changes in crop water
    use and weather conditions are not considered [113]. McCarthy et al. [114] noted
    that a drawback of the iterative learning approach may be the inefficient systems
    identification resulting from the slow system dynamics of the crop system in response
    to irrigation events. This results from the evaluation of the effect of only one
    irrigation volume on plant response at any water application event. They suggested
    that this drawback may be eliminated by applying the process of iterative hill
    climbing control. This learning control strategy employs an adaptive varied identification
    process. A range of irrigation volumes are applied at each irrigation event to
    a number of test cells on the field. The response in the test cell that best matches
    the desired system performance is identified as the optimal irrigation process.
    They reported that the iterative hill climbing control procedure was capable of
    maximizing cotton yield when used with a combination of plant and soil sensors
    to provide feedback for the identification procedure. Their conclusions were however
    based on results from a simulation study and a field-based validation of the procedure
    was not reported. The results of the learning control procedure are based solely
    on sensor measurements and may be largely affected by sensor drift as a model
    of the crop response is not developed from the identification procedure. This
    method can be considered more of a “brute force” approach than a scientifically
    based approach to scheduling irrigation. 6.1.5. Model Predictive Control Model
    predictive control (MPC) is an industrial control approach employed in decision
    support for large-scale multivariable problems with multiple constraints. It has
    been successfully implemented in the food industry, petrochemical industry and
    power generation among others [135]. Model predictive control employs a plant
    model and optimization algorithm to calculate plant inputs in order to achieve
    a future value of a performance criterion. The system performance is predicted
    over a finite horizon subject to constraints on both the inputs and outputs of
    the plant [101]. Readers are directed to [135,136,137] for an in-depth review
    of the theory of model predictive control and its application in various industries.
    In the case of irrigation, applying a soil moisture balance model, the plant input
    will be the irrigation amount, the plant output will be the soil moisture deficit,
    and both crop ET and precipitation values will be considered as disturbances as
    they cannot be controlled. A prediction of future input values and disturbances
    is required in an MPC system in order to determine the optimal system output [138].
    This highlights the need for the incorporation of weather forecast data into the
    MPC framework for irrigation decision support. Model predictive control appears
    to be well suited to the domain of irrigation decision support. The irrigation
    problem has input constraints in terms of optimal irrigation volume and output
    constraints in terms of soil moisture thresholds and the desired plant response
    to water deficits [135]. Ooi et al. [139], Lozoya et al. [101] and Saleem et al.
    [135] described a model predictive control framework for irrigation scheduling
    based on a soil moisture balance model. They employed a system identification
    procedure to generate a grey box model of the soil–plant–atmosphere system with
    a network of soil moisture sensors providing real-time feedback to the control
    algorithm. They all reported the ability of the MPC platform to sufficiently predict
    crop irrigation needs and also observations of significant water savings. The
    authors of the discussed systems however fail to account for the stochastic nature
    of rainfall and crop water use in the system dynamics. Delgoda et al. [138] noted
    that an adequate consideration of the uncertainty in rainfall and ET inputs into
    the water balance model employed in the MPC framework will improve the capability
    of the MPC system. Delgoda et al. [115] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above
    MPC frameworks by employing disturbance affine feedback control, an uncertainty
    modelling technique widely applied in MPC to account for the stochastic nature
    of rainfall and crop water use. A simple order model of soil moisture dynamics
    is included in the system to enable online calculation of model parameters, hence
    accounting for the time-varying nature of soil-plant-atmosphere system. The authors
    reported an optimal performance of the system in humid regions where considerable
    uncertainties in climatic variables exist. 6.2. Commercial Sensor Applications
    in Adaptive Decision Support Manufacturers of sensors and a number of system integrators
    are showing considerable interest in developing innovative tools that will further
    optimize irrigation water use. A sensor integration project is described by AgSmarts
    (Memphis, TN, USA). Moving irrigation systems are equipped with sensors which
    provide data on crop growth stage and soil profile. Aquaspy soil moisture sensors
    (San Diego, CA, USA) positioned in various parts of the field also provide data
    on soil moisture status which is applied in irrigation timing and calculation
    of irrigation volumes. These irrigation decisions are automatically adjusted based
    on the varying water requirements at each crop growth stage [140]. Omica, Italy
    has deployed a wireless sensor network of Libelium environmental and soil moisture
    sensors (Zaragoza, Spain) on a maize farm in Italy to support irrigation decisions.
    The sensors are interfaced to a geo-referenced decision support system which enables
    zone-specific irrigation management. The system is able to predict crop yield
    based on irrigation timing and application volumes combined with historical yield
    data. This can then be applied in optimizing the decision support system towards
    achieving a desired crop yield goal. Most decision support systems presently produced
    for commercial use provide on/off irrigation control based on specified thresholds
    and plant/crop sensor feedback. The incorporation of predictive models into these
    systems will enhance the possibility of improving irrigation water use and crop
    yield [141]. 7. Opportunities for Improving Sustainability Sustainability is premised
    on the principle of meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising
    the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable agriculture
    is focused on developing farming practices that are safe and do not have an adverse
    impact on the environment [142]. Pretty [143] suggested that sustainable agriculture
    integrates the main goals of environmental health and economic profitability.
    The efficient and effective use of water is considered the main driver for improving
    sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This will involve the use of less water
    for irrigating crops and also preserving the quality of water sources. Conventional
    irrigation practices apply water uniformly over a field resulting in a high volume
    of water use. Overirrigation may also result from this practice which causes leaching
    of nitrates and nutrients into ground water sources. An important consideration
    would also be the use of less energy for operating water pumps and irrigation
    application equipment. Soil erosion continues to be a serious threat to sustainability
    in irrigated agriculture. This can be eliminated by applying precise irrigation
    volumes to reduce surface runoff. Precision irrigation presents a promising platform
    for improving sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This is especially hinged
    on the possibility of eliminating the adverse environmental impacts related to
    conventional irrigation practices with the adoption of precision irrigation. The
    economic profitability of the adoption of precision irrigation is however a very
    important point to consider. This will be manifested in terms of improved crop
    yields and increased water savings including the associated reduction in energy
    consumption resulting from the optimal matching of irrigation inputs to the spatial
    water demands of the field, thus reducing costs [11]. Precision irrigation is
    predicated on the hypothesis that the crop water requirements vary spatially across
    a field. In heterogeneous crops such as fruit orchards, this variability is also
    due to physiological factors such as leaf area and fruit load [144]. It is assumed
    that varying water application across the field to meet this spatial crop water
    need will improve crop yield and reduce the costs of associated inputs. Smith
    et al. [11] noted that the evidence to support this hypothesis in commercial crop
    production is not readily found in literature. Evans and King [18] reviewed much
    of the work prior to that date focused on analysing the improvements in crop yield
    and water savings achievable with precision irrigation and suggested that the
    greatest savings are likely to occur in humid climates by the increased utilization
    of stored moisture and in-season precipitation. Results from simulation- and field-based
    case studies they reviewed showed water savings of 0% to 26% for well-watered
    crop production employing precision irrigation strategies. No significant improvements
    in crop yields resulting from the adoption of precision irrigation were reported.
    They concluded that in arid and semi-arid regions, precision irrigation is more
    suited to maximize net return rather than yield and it may have greater potential
    in reducing irrigation water use in humid climates when irrigating to maximally
    utilize in-season precipitation. They further noted that the economic benefit
    of adopting precision irrigation for field-scale crop production is limited. This
    is because the cost of equipment, maintenance and management is much greater than
    the revenue improvements achieved as a result of improved yield and water savings.
    The payback period of implementing the technology may also exceed the useful life
    of the water application equipment, typically placed at 15 years. A payback period
    ranging from 5 to 20 years is noted in Smith et al. [11] for the adoption of precision
    irrigation for crop production in New Zealand. Evans et al. [145] reviewed the
    adoption trends of spatially varied irrigation in the USA covering a period of
    20 years. They noted that about only 200 of the 175,000 moving irrigation systems
    in the USA were fitted with variable rate water application technology. They suggested
    higher net returns on investment as a stimuli for adoption of precision irrigation
    by growers. Growers that had adopted the technology reported no significant savings
    in water and energy use in non-limiting water situations. They noted that in more
    than 20 years of research pertaining to variable rate irrigation management, the
    economic benefit was yet to be demonstrated. This was attributed to the marginal
    water savings (5%–15%) which is insufficient to realize a payback for the initial
    investment in the water application technology. They concluded that an economic
    strategy that optimizes net return rather than total returns for the technology
    should be adopted as a long-term investment goal. Heeren et al. [146] conducted
    a simulation study to assess the reductions in pumping costs through the adoption
    of precision irrigation in 49,224 centre-pivot irrigated fields in Nebraska, USA.
    The study focused on applying variable rate water applications in mining undepleted
    available water. They noted that the reduction in pumping costs achieved from
    the adoption of precision irrigation in all fields may be negligible in comparison
    to the cost of variable rate water application equipment. They concluded that
    the adoption of this technology will be economically justifiable only with an
    increase in energy costs. An economic evaluation of spatially varied irrigation
    applications is presented in Lee [147]. The study assessed energy savings resulting
    from pumping lesser volumes of water for irrigation on a 67-acre field in Wyoming.
    The cost of installing the variable rate water application equipment on the field
    was reported as $29,513 with a useful equipment life of 15 years. The yearly return
    for the equipment based on energy savings achieved was computed as $1816.71, which
    equates to a payback period of 16.25 years. This suggests that a payback will
    only be realized for the technology outside the useful life of the equipment.
    Precision irrigation offers the benefit of providing water conservation benefits
    by avoiding overirrigation and the associated adverse environmental impacts [18].
    Sadler et al. [148] discussed water conservation strategies where precision irrigation
    can potentially reduce the total water applied and improve the environmental quality
    of irrigated fields. They suggested that programing zero irrigation amounts to
    non-cropped areas will improve water conservation using precision irrigation.
    They also noted that adjusting spatial water application based on the infiltration
    rate of the soil and soil water storage capacity will reduce the occurrence of
    surface runoff and soil erosion. Surface runoff and leaching were identified as
    the major avenues for loss of nutrients from the soil. They suggested the occurrence
    of this can be eliminated by spatial application of precise irrigation volumes
    based on the soil water-holding characteristics. They presented several case studies
    in which the adoption of precision irrigation has been demonstrated to enhance
    the environmental quality of irrigated fields. They concluded that precision irrigation
    has the capability of improving water use efficiencies while reducing the adverse
    environmental impacts associated with conventional irrigation practices. The results
    from the above studies show that precision irrigation is a proven tool for improving
    sustainability in irrigated agriculture in terms of enhancing environmental health.
    Its economic justification in terms of significant yield improvements and water
    savings is however limited. Evans and King [18] suggested that the lack of significant
    improvements in yield response when employing precision irrigation may result
    from the fact that the yield response to the water curve near maximum yield (100%
    ET) is almost flat, with small changes in water applied using precision irrigation
    having little effect on yield. The majority of these precision irrigation studies
    have used only soil data for irrigation management. The local microclimate and
    crop genetics may however have a direct influence on the yield response of the
    crops. Soil moisture status may also not provide a complete indication of crop
    water status, rather the plant may be the best indicator of water availability.
    The decision support systems employed by current precision irrigation systems
    assume that the soil–plant–atmosphere system never varies with time. The characteristics
    of the crop, soil and climate vary within the season altering the timing and optimal
    amount of irrigation volume required at any irrigation application event. We argue
    that the incorporation of multiple sensed variables (plant, soil and weather data)
    will enhance the possibility of arriving at optimal irrigation decisions and hence
    an improvement in economic outcomes. This should be integrated with a decision
    support system that has the capability to adapt to the time-varying nature of
    the cropping system. The decision support system should also have the capacity
    to ‘learn’ in order to improve its performance based on experience and a target
    crop production function. We discuss how this can be achieved by exploiting improvements
    in monitoring and management considerations. 7.1. Monitoring Considerations A
    precision irrigation system is designed to apply water at a differential rate
    in response to the temporal and spatial variation in crop water need across a
    field. This process is supported by a number of sensors providing data to a real-time
    decision support system. These sensors include weather stations, soil moisture
    sensors, environmental sensors, plant sensors and thermal sensors which may be
    integrated into a wireless sensor network. A careful design of these sensing systems
    including a consideration of factors affecting their performance is crucial in
    realizing the goal of improved water use through precision irrigation. Dielectric
    soil moisture sensors sense the water content of the immediate soil in their zone
    of influence. The zone of influence reported for most commercial dielectric soil
    moisture sensors corresponds to a cylindrical measurement volume of 1.5 L [149].
    It is therefore important to install the sensors in areas representative of the
    soil moisture available for plant use. The normal practice employed by most users
    is to place the sensors in the driest regions of the field or in the regions comprising
    of a soil profile with the lowest available water-holding capacity [150]. Adopting
    this approach will most likely lead to wetter regions in the field receiving more
    frequent irrigation which will consequently result in overirrigation. A more efficient
    approach is to define irrigation management zones and place a number of sensors
    in each management zone to give the average soil moisture estimate. This may however
    be limited by cost. A structured installation profile is also necessary in order
    to capture soil water movement and availability. It is recommended that sensors
    should be installed at each soil horizon along the plant rooting zone [151]. An
    accepted convention is the installation of sensors at three to four depths along
    the rooting zone (1 per 25% of total rooting depth). The sensor located on the
    uppermost soil profile is able to detect precipitation events, the sensor in the
    deepest part of the profile is able to detect drainage and the other sensors located
    midway in the soil profile are able to capture soil moisture dynamics useful in
    supporting irrigation scheduling decisions [152]. The variation in soil properties
    at the different rooting depths should also be taken into account. With an increasing
    knowledge of the site, it is usually possible to install the sensors at two depths
    and still adequately capture the soil moisture dynamics. The soil moisture sensors
    should also be deployed using soil-specific calibration equations to enable accurate
    estimates of soil moisture content. The actual crop evapotranspiration can vary
    spatially and temporally under conditions of unrestricted water supply. These
    variations can be the result of several factors including differences in crop
    genetics, plant density, weed competition, pest intensity, nutrient availability
    and stage of growth [18]. Addressing the variation in ET across a field may result
    in significant water savings. The accurate measurement of evapotranspiration is
    crucial in arriving at optimal irrigation decisions [71]. The FAO-PM procedure
    for calculating ET which is applied in many precision irrigation systems relies
    on information from weather stations applied in calculating a reference ET which
    is adjusted for specific crops using crop coefficients. This calculated ET is
    assumed to be uniform for every part of the field. This will however result in
    the application of inaccurate irrigation volumes to replace crop water use, owing
    to the spatial nature of the actual ET. The application of the NDVI technique
    in determining site-specific crop coefficients provides a platform for overcoming
    this challenge. The surface renewal analysis procedure also presents a promising
    tool for quantifying the actual crop ET. It is however best suited to homogeneous,
    short and dense canopies. Plant-based measurements provide the best indication
    of plant water status as they provide a direct measure of the plants’ response
    to soil moisture availability and climatic demand. An efficient plant-based monitoring
    system should however respond sensitively to the slightest change in water deficits.
    Measurements of leaf water potential and sap flow are contact methods which give
    direct information on plant water status but their spatial resolution is limited
    as many samples are required to effectively monitor the dynamics of field-scale
    plant water status [153]. Infrared thermometry has provided a robust platform
    for assessing plant water status. The (CWSI calculated from the infrared measurements
    of crop canopy temperature can adequately quantify field-scale crop water status
    with high spatial and temporal resolution. This presents a robust and cost-effective
    tool for use in precision irrigation. Its application in humid regions is however
    marred with difficulties. A systems engineering approach can be applied in overcoming
    the difficulties encountered with applying the CWSI in humid climates. A mathematical
    model derived using this approach may adequately simulate the real-time dynamics
    of the baseline temperatures required for computing the index. A summary of the
    technology gaps and refinements necessary in monitoring tools in order to achieve
    robust precision irrigation management is presented in [11]. They include the
    limited volume of influence, high cost and the need to improve the measurement
    accuracy of soil moisture sensors. The refinements recommended include the development
    of low cost soil measurement sensors with a wider volume of influence, low cost
    and resilient wireless communication networks able to link spatially deployed
    soil moisture sensors and the development of smart calibration software in order
    to improve the accuracy of soil moisture sensors. The technology gaps identified
    in plant sensing technology include the limited knowledge of irrigation thresholds
    and quantity, and low spatial resolution. The refinements recommended include
    the integration of plant-based sensing with soil moisture sensing tools in order
    to determine irrigation volumes, calibration of infra-red thermography against
    physiologically explicit plant measurements in order to determine critical thresholds
    and the deployment of IR thermography tools on low altitude UAVs to further enhance
    spatial coverage. A combination of multiple sensor inputs deployed at a density
    that captures spatial variability is therefore likely to yield the most robust
    and accurate solution for precision irrigation. This will ensure that the decision
    support system is robust to data availability, gaps and deficiencies. This will
    include data from soil, weather and plant sensors [11]. An important consideration
    will also include developing cost-effective and user-friendly tools which will
    enhance the adoption of these adaptive systems by farmers. 7.2. Management Considerations
    Management can perhaps be viewed as the most vital aspect of a precision irrigation
    system. Management acts as an interface between monitoring and decision support,
    culminating into irrigation decisions. This enables the implementation of vital
    management decisions of when and where to apply irrigation and also the irrigation
    volumes to be applied. The decision support system is perhaps the management backbone
    of a precision irrigation system and its proper implementation is vital for improving
    sustainability in irrigated agriculture. The adaptive decision support tools discussed
    have the capability of improving crop yield and water savings when deployed as
    part of a precision irrigation system. Smith et al. [11] noted that the simulation
    of adaptive decision support strategies can be used in identifying optimal irrigation
    scheduling decisions. A simulation tool capable of representing a range of field
    conditions at different spatial and temporal scales is considered ideal. Such
    a simulation framework is presented in [114]. Model-based decision support systems
    using feedback from multiple sensors may present a platform for arriving at optimal
    water applications. MPC appears to be ideally suited for achieving the aim of
    improving sustainability in irrigated agriculture. A decision support system based
    on MPC employs an optimization algorithm to implement an input strategy with the
    best performance. McCarthy et al. [113] noted that MPC implemented for a precision
    irrigation system could involve the use of real-time data from field sensors to
    calibrate a crop or soil model and then optimizing this calibrated model to arrive
    at optimal irrigation scheduling decisions. A combination of data from soil moisture
    sensors, thermal sensors and weather sensors would be appropriate for MPC. The
    data from the sensors would most likely be required daily, as measurements are
    not required at a high temporal resolution to calibrate the model. A dense deployment
    of these sensors is however required to account for the spatial nature of field-scale
    crop water use. The thermal sensors may be mounted on a moving platform for spatial
    data collection across the field. Equipment availability, irrigation system capacity
    and other operational considerations can be incorporated as system-level constraints
    in an MPC-based decision support system. These constraints can be considered to
    arrive at future irrigation scheduling decisions [113]. MPC uses a model’s simulation
    to determine the optimum irrigation application timing and volume. When combined
    with a soft sensing system, variables that are not directly measured can be controlled
    and optimized. This presents a possibility of applying decision support systems
    based on MPC in realising a desired crop yield and also a water-saving goal [136].
    There has been considerable research into water use procedures that can achieve
    improved water savings in irrigated agriculture, particularly deficit irrigation.
    Deficit irrigation (DI) is an irrigation strategy in which a crop is exposed to
    a level of water stress at certain growth stages in its development (regulated
    deficit irrigation) or throughout its growth season. The growth stage in which
    the plant is subjected to water stress is predetermined as a drought tolerant
    stage. The goal of deficit irrigation is that there will be little adverse effect
    on yield and irrigation water can be conserved [154]. Evans and King [18] suggested
    deficit irrigation as a tool for improving water use in precision irrigation.
    They noted that it can be applied in maximizing net returns and conserve large
    amounts of water in arid and semi-arid regions. It is however important to investigate
    the response of different crops to water deficits including timing tolerances
    in order to develop optimal deficit irrigation strategies that can be integrated
    into the precision irrigation decision support framework. It is also important
    to investigate the economics of yield reduction associated with deficit irrigation
    strategies. O’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested that implementing deficit irrigation
    as part of precision irrigation management will involve the continuous assessment
    of crop stress and growth stage throughout the growing season. This will be instrumental
    in avoiding temporary severe stress which could result in uneconomic reduction
    in crop yield or quality. The high cost of the component technologies of precision
    irrigation including soil, plant and weather sensors, decision support systems
    and variable rate water application systems is presently a constraint to the wide-scale
    adoption of this technology by farmers [148]. The minimal yield improvements and
    water savings currently achieved through field-scale precision irrigation may
    not justify the initial capital investment required for its adoption. As fresh
    water resources become scarcer, it is expected that more premium will be placed
    on water abstracted for irrigated agriculture. Regulatory agencies may also require
    farmers to continuously demonstrate the efficient use of water. These factors
    may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers [155]. A conceptual
    model-based decision support system that uses the full range of plant, weather
    and soil data for irrigation management is illustrated in Figure 1. This is currently
    being developed by the authors. It involves the integration of various sensing
    systems, dynamic modeling, machine learning and model predictive control into
    an adaptive decision support system for precision irrigation. Figure 1. Conceptual
    model-based decision support system for precision irrigation. Elements in blue
    represent novel ideas from the Authors and elements in orange are from the decision
    support system presented in McCarthy et al. [114]. 8. Conclusions Technological
    innovations that can improve sustainability in irrigated agriculture form an important
    vehicle for actualizing the optimal use of limited water resources. Precision
    irrigation has been demonstrated as such an innovation, though presently the economic
    benefit related to the adoption of this technology at field-scale crop production
    is minimal. This is because the potential for yield improvements and water savings
    may not cover the cost of technology required for its implementation. The application
    of adaptive control techniques to irrigation decision support and improvements
    in monitoring tools has the capability of dealing with the time-varying and stochastic
    nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere system while also considering operational
    limitations in arriving at optimal irrigation decisions. This ultimately presents
    a platform for actualizing the environmental and economic goals of sustainability
    in irrigated agriculture. A robust design of monitoring tools including a proper
    combination of soil, weather and plant sensors is however vital for the proper
    operation of an adaptive decision support system. The decision support system
    should be able to account for the varying crop water requirements within season
    as a result of both biotic and abiotic factors. The decision support system should
    also consider agronomic objectives to ensure the optimal irrigation strategy is
    delivered by the precision irrigation system. The high cost of sensors and the
    requirement for dense deployment in order to obtain data at high spatial resolutions
    is presently a constraint. The large dataset required for the calibration of crop
    simulation models is also another significant problem. Future research needs include
    the development of cost-effective soil moisture sensors with wider spheres of
    influence, identification of irrigation thresholds for plant-based sensors and
    the development of self-learning crop simulation models that are able to infer
    relationships from a limited data set. The field evaluation of adaptive decision
    support systems would also be beneficial in quantifying their sustainability improvement
    potential. Acknowledgments The authors wish to acknowledge John Oldacre Foundation

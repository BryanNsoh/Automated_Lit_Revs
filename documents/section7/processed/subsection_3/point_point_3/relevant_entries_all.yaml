    comfort, and efficiency possibilities to their residents. Changes will occur to
    the way people live as technology involves people''s lives and information processing
    is fully integrated into their daily living activities and objects. The future
    expectation of smart buildings includes making the residents'' experience as easy
    and comfortable as possible. The massive streaming data generated and captured
    by smart building appliances and devices contain valuable information that needs
    to be mined to facilitate timely actions and better decision making. Machine learning
    and big data analytics will undoubtedly play a critical role to enable the delivery
    of such smart services. In this paper, we survey the area of smart building with
    a special focus on the role of techniques from machine learning and big data analytics.
    This survey also reviews the current trends and challenges faced in the development

    I. Introduction Although the term “smart building” (SB) may bring a thought of
    a fictional smart space from science-fiction movies, but the reality is that SBs
    exist today, and their number is getting increased. With recent advances in machine
    learning (ML), big data analytics, sensor technologies and the Internet of Things
    (IoT), regular buildings can be cost-effectively transformed into SBs with bare
    minimum infrastructural modifications. There are smart office, smart library,
    smart home, smart health care facilities, smart hospital and many other types
    of SBs that can provide automated services that can provide many value-added services
    (such as reduction of wasted energy) and also help to ensure the comfort, health,
    and safety of the occupants. The hyperconnectivity that will be brought about
    by the emergence of IoT will increase the promise of SB since now all the basic
    building amenities and commodities ranging from your house electronics to your
    plant vases will be interconnected. But this hyperconnectivity will at the same
    time complicate the process of managing SBs. In particular, SBs and their inhabitants
    are expected to create large volumes of streaming data. ML, sampling, compression,
    learning, and filtering technologies are becoming more significant to manage the
    stream of big data of individuals. In 1981, the term Intelligent Buildings (IBs)
    was initially coined by United Technology Building Systems (UTBS) Corporation
    in the U.S. In July 1983, IBs became a reality with the opening of the City Place
    Building in Hartford, Connecticut [1]. Today, the number of SBs is growing at
    an unprecedented rate including smart office, smart hospitality, smart educational
    facilities etc. [2]. An SB is recognized as an integrated system that takes advantage
    of a range of computational and communications infrastructure and techniques [3].
    Examples of SB services include smart thermostats that allow the temperature to
    be controlled based on the time of the day/year and the users’ preferences with
    minimal or no manual configuration. Using data analytics to “learn” the users’
    preferences before taking the appropriate actions is probably the most important
    enabling technology for IBs [4]. Lately, smart coffee machines appeared in the
    market with the capability to make coffee automatically, according to users’ preferences
    and schedules. Fridges can offer allocated programming interfaces for their control
    [5]. IBs aim to provide their users with safe, energy efficient, environment-friendly,
    and convenient services. In order to maximize comfort, minimize cost, and adapt
    to the needs of their inhabitants, SBs must rely on sophisticated tools to learn,
    predict, and make intelligent decisions. SB algorithms cover a range of technologies,
    including prediction, decision-making, robotics, smart materials, wireless sensor
    networks, multimedia, mobile computing, and cloud computing. With these technologies,
    buildings can cognitively manage many SB services such as security, privacy, energy
    efficiency, lighting, maintenance, elderly care, and multimedia entertainment.
    The massive volume of sensory data collected from sensors and appliances must
    be analyzed by algorithms, transformed into information, and minted to extract
    knowledge so that machines can have a better understanding of humans than their
    environment. Furthermore, and most importantly, such knowledge can lead to new
    products and services that can dramatically transform our lives. For example,
    readings from smart meters can be used to better predict and balancing the usage
    of power. Monitoring and processing sensory data from wearable sensors attached
    to patients can produce new remote healthcare services. The main philosophy behind
    ML is to create the analytical models automatically in order to permit the algorithms
    to learn continuously from available data. The application of ML techniques increased
    over the last two decades due to the availability of massive amounts of complex
    data and the increased usability of current ML tools. Today, ML is already widely
    applied in different applications including recommendation systems offered by
    online services (e.g., Amazon, Netflix) and automatic credit rating services used
    by banks. Alphabet’s Nest thermostat utilizes ML to “learn” the temperature preferences
    of its users and adapt to their work schedule to minimize the energy use. Other
    widely publicized examples of ML applications include Google’s self-driving car,
    sentiment analysis of Amazon and Twitter data, fraud detection, and Facebook’s
    facial-recognition technology that is used to tag the suggested person on images
    uploaded by users. A. SB Trends and Market Impact In this section, we look at
    the statistics related to SBs, to allow us to understand the current trends and
    motivations in industry marketplaces and academic researches toward SBs. According
    to the report by MarketsandMarkets [6], The SB market is estimated to grow from
    7.42 billion dollars in 2017 to 31.74 billion dollars by 2022, at a Compound Annual
    Growth Rate (CAGR) of 33.7% from 2017 to 2022. In yet another report Zion Market
    Research [7], 2016 and it is expected to reach 61,900 million dollars by 2024.
    It is expected to exhibit a CAGR of more than 34% between 2017 and 2024. The market
    is primarily driven by government initiatives globally for SB projects and the
    increasing market for integrated security and safety systems as well as energy
    efficient building systems. Figure 1 shows the Statista [8] forecast market size
    of the global smart home market from 2016 to 2022 (in billion U.S. dollars). FIGURE
    1. Forecast market size of the global smart home market from 2016 to 2022 [8].
    Show All According to the Gartner report [9], it is expected that the number of
    smart connected homes grows to 700 million homes by 2020, supplied by mass consumer
    adoption and an increase in the number of devices and apps available. Figure 2
    shows Gartner’s 2018 Hype Cycle expectation for deep learning, ML, connected homes,
    and smart workspace. FIGURE 2. Hype Cycle for the Connected Home, 2018 [7]. Show
    All According to report by Research and Markets [10], [11], the global IoT SB
    market will reach approximately $51.44B USD globally by 2023. The report also
    forecast that 33% of IoT SB market will be supplied by artificial intelligent
    technologies by 2023, and automation systems of SB will grow at 48.3% CAGR from
    2018–2023. Frost & Sullivan also predict that by 2025, the growth of connected
    home living will reach 3.7 billion smartphones, 700 million tablets, 520 million
    wearable health-related devices and 410 million smart appliances in the connected
    person world. B. Related Survey Papers Although many of survey papers focused
    on SBs have been published, none of them is focused on the role of data analytics
    and ML in the context of SBs. We describe the relevant survey papers next and
    will compare these survey papers to our paper in Table 2. Chan et al. in 2008
    provided an overview of smart home research [12]. It also discusses assistive
    robots, and wearable devices. The article reviews smart home projects arranged
    by country and continent. Alam et al. [13] provided details about sensors, devices,
    algorithms, and communication protocols utilized in smart homes. The paper reviews
    smart home works according to their desired services and research goals; namely,
    security, comfort, and healthcare. Lobaccaro et al. [14] presented the concept
    of smart home and smart grid technologies and discuss some challenges, benefits
    and future trends of smart home technologies. Pan et al. [15] reviewed the works
    on efficient energy consumption in SBs using microgrids. The survey investigates
    research topics and the recent advancements in SBs and the vision of microgrids.
    A few survey papers have reviewed works on facilitating independent living of
    the elderly people in smart homes. Ni et al. [16] conducted a survey on the features
    of sensing infrastructure and activities that can assist the independent living
    of the elderly in smart homes. A survey on ambient assisted living technologies
    for elderly people has been presented Rashidi and Mihailidis [17]. Peetoom et
    al. [18] focused on monitoring technologies to recognize life activities in-home
    such as fall detection and changes in health status. Salih et al. [19] presented
    a review of ambient intelligence assisted healthcare monitoring services and described
    the various application, communication, and wireless sensor network technologies
    that have been employed in the existing research literature. A number of papers
    have focused IoT: (a) Perera et al. [20] discussed IoT applications from the perspective
    of context-awareness and self-learning; (b) Tsai et al. [21] surveyed the applications
    of data mining technologies in IoT; and (c) Mahdavinejad et al. [22] reviewed
    some ML methods that can be applied to IoT data analytics. TABLE 1 List of Important
    Acronyms Used TABLE 2 Comparison of Relevant Survey Papers C. Contributions and
    Organization of This Paper To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey
    that covers SBs jointly from the perspectives of application, data analytics,
    and ML. The main contributions of our paper are: Exploration of the potential
    of ML-based context-aware systems to provide SB services; Identification of research
    challenges and directions for SBs and how ML models can help in resolving such
    challenges; Identification of SB applications including comfort, security, energy
    efficiency, and convenience and the role of ML in such applications. Our research
    can provide an impetus to ML researchers to investigate new exciting ML-based
    SB services. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II introduces
    the concept of SBs and its underlying architecture. Section III introduces the
    various components of the SB ecosystem and its underlying architecture. Section
    V presents context recognition and activity modeling and the role of ML in SBs.
    Section VI highlights research and development challenges and provides a future
    perspective of SB projects. Finally, Section VII presents a summary of lessons
    learned and concludes the paper. For the convenience of the readers, we have enlisted
    the important acronyms used in Table 1. SECTION II. Smart Buildings: Concept and
    Architecture In 1984, The New York Times published an article that described that
    real estate developers are creating “a new generation of buildings that almost
    think for themselves called intelligent buildings.” Such an intelligent building
    (IB) was defined as “a marriage of two technologies - old-fashioned building management
    and telecommunications.” [23]. Since then, many definitions of SBs have been suggested.
    This is due to the fact that the life-cycle of building planning, design, implementation,
    and operation involves different industry players that have different roles. In
    addition, the rapid changes in technology are affecting this definition. For instance,
    the advent of IoT and smart city concepts is impacting the definition of SB. Therefore,
    it is hard to compose a unique view of IBs with a single definition that is accepted
    worldwide. However, it is vital to have a good understanding of the main standard
    bodies and companies involved in shaping the development of SBs [1]. The Institute
    for Building Efficiency [24] focuses on the operation of buildings to provide
    efficient healthy and comfortable environment [25]. IBM [26] focuses also on the
    operation of SBs to provide integrated physical and digital infrastructures that
    provide reliable, sustainable, and cost-effective occupancy services. According
    to the European Commission’s Information Society [27], SBs means buildings that
    are supplied by information and communication technologies in the context of the
    combining Ubiquitous Computing and the IoT: In general, the buildings that are
    supplied with sensors, actuators, microchips, micro- and nano-embedded systems
    in order to enable collecting, filtering and producing more information locally,
    to be further incorporated and managed globally according to business functions.”
    In SBs, a variety of AI and multi-agent system techniques are employed including
    [28]: Reasoning and knowledge representation including ontologies and rules to
    represent devices and building services. ML for human activity recognition. Multi-agent
    systems for distributed intelligence and semantic interoperability. Intelligent
    approaches such as planning, intelligent control, adaptive interfaces, and optimization
    for efficient management of resources and services. An SB is therefore the integration
    of a wide range of systems and services into a unified environment that involve
    energy management systems, temperature monitoring systems, access security systems,
    fire and life safety, lighting control and reduction, telecommunications services,
    office automation, computer systems, area locating systems, LANs, management information
    systems, cabling and records, maintenance systems, and expert systems [29]. Figure
    3 shows examples of SB appliances including air-conditioning systems, lighting
    systems, solar energy generators, power-supply systems, temperature sensors, humidity
    sensors, power usage sensors, and surveillance cameras. For example, centralized
    control of these elements can promote the efficient use of energy through the
    intelligent control of lights and air conditioning units and the intelligent management
    of multiple green and brown energy sources. In most cases, an SB uses an Ethernet
    backbone with bridges to a Controller Area Network (CAN) [26]. FIGURE 3. Example
    of SB appliances. Show All It is easier to introduce smart services in residential
    buildings compared to commercial buildings since residential buildings have less
    technical equipment and less stringent efficiency requirements. Because the commercial
    buildings usually have more public visitors and therefore building models for
    commercial buildings are usually more challenging than building models for residential
    buildings which usually have a limited number of the occupants most of the time.
    In addition, the costs associated with the purchase and installation of smart
    devices and infrastructure at commercial buildings is more than residential buildings.
    Figure 4 shows an integrated framework in a residential building that employs
    a network of intelligent sensors. These sensors control systems such as energy
    generation, metering, HVAC, lighting, and security. A building automation system
    manages a set of smart appliances, sensors, and actuators, which collectively
    deliver services for the well-being of the inhabitants. Examples of such smart
    appliances, sensors, and actuators include washers and dryers, refrigerators,
    heaters, thermostats, lighting systems, power outlets, energy meters, smoke detectors,
    televisions, game consoles, windows/door controllers and sensors, air conditioners,
    video cameras, and sound detectors. More advanced smart devices are constantly
    being developed like smart floors and smart furniture [28], [30]. FIGURE 4. Smart
    appliances, sensors, and actuators in a smart residential building. Show All The
    IoT will enable the integration and interoperability of heterogeneous devices
    in SBs as well as the real-time processing of the data generated by sensors in
    support of optimal control and operation of the building. In this paper, We propose
    a layered architecture for SBs based on the layered architecture of IoT. Figure
    5 shows the layered architecture of SBs. FIGURE 5. Layers of the base IoT architecture
    that serves as the foundation for SBs. Show All As can be seen from the sensing
    layer (the bottom layer in Figure 5), input data is obtained from different types
    of physical sensors that monitor environmental parameters, collect data about
    residents and detect anomalies (e.g., fire and water pipe bursts). This layer
    also includes actuators that can be controlled to save energy, minimize water
    consumption, etc. The network layer (the second layer in Figure 5), includes access
    and core networks that provide transparent data transmission capability. This
    layer serves as a bridge between the sensing layer and the upper layers which
    are mainly responsible for data processing. An intermediary software layer called
    the middleware layer is needed (the third layer in Figure 5) to provide seamless
    integration of heterogeneous devices and networks covered by the sensing layer
    of the architecture. That layer serves as a bridge between the embedded software
    that runs of smart sensors and back-end software services. This layer provides
    interoperability using standardized programming interfaces and protocols [31].
    Therefore, this layer performs the process of converting the collected data from
    various data formats into a common representation. SB middleware can be based
    on open standards or proprietary, in addition, application-specific or general-purpose.
    Most often, proprietary middleware is application-specific while general-purpose
    middleware is based on open standards [28]. The context and semantic discovery
    layer (the fourth layer in Figure 5) is responsible for managing context and semantic
    discoverers including context and semantics generating, configuring, and storing.
    The processing and reasoning layer (the fifth layer in Figure 5) is responsible
    for processing the extracted information from the middleware then according to
    the application’s type it will make decisions. In this layer, there are various
    techniques of information processing applied to fuse, extract, contextualize.
    massive data into useful actionable knowledge. In this layer, two phases should
    be identified: context consumer and context producer of the middleware. In the
    context consumer phase, the data processing techniques are applied on the data
    produced by the middleware; while in context producer phase the process of decision-making
    is implemented to supply the service layer with valuable knowledge. while in the
    second stage, further context information can be provided to the middleware for
    registration in the ontology context. Specific services and applications are abstracted
    in the application layer (the top-most layer in Figure 5). This layer presents
    a framework with direct access to the underlying functionalities to serve in the
    implementation of various types of applications. Moreover, control panels should
    be installed in the building to control the automated indoor spaces and to support
    a local human-machine interface. For instance, in a multi-story building, each
    floor could have a control panel to automate the operations, such as control opening
    the windows, control of air conditioning to achieve the desired temperature, control
    close/open the blinds according to the preferred light intensity before using
    artificial lighting [32], [33]. Summary: Still there is no single standard definition
    for SBs. In this section, we reviewed many definitions for SBs by many institutes,
    counties, regions and different disciplines; each has their own definition for
    SBs. We presented the layered architectural pattern for adapting services in an
    SB environment. We wanted to provide a general design for adapting actions according
    to the different versions of context in SBs. This architecture may be used in
    different smart environments such as intelligent transport systems, security,
    health assistance, and SBs among others. We layered the architecture into six
    layers starting from the sensing layer, which includes various types of sensors
    that are installed to collect environmental information in SBs. While network
    layer providing data stream support and data flow control and ensuring that messages
    arrive reliably by using data transport protocols such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet
    etc. Data Acquisition layer to collect the data from the heterogeneous sources
    of data. Context and semantic discovery layer to generate, configure, and store
    context and semantic information. Context processing and reasoning layer to process
    the information and extract the knowledge that making the decisions according
    to the application context. And the last layer which is application layer such
    as health assistance and elderly home care, comfort and entertainment services,
    security, tele-management, smart watering, energy efficiency, etc. After discussing
    the main components of commercial and residential buildings, we have now set the
    stage for a detailed discussion on the components of SBs in the next section.
    SECTION III. Smart Building Components Advances in smart building technology have
    driven to the extensive development of SBs to generate economic and environmental
    benefits for building owners through the convergence of IT and building automation
    systems. Figure 6 shows the key components of SB systems, these include extensive
    sensors and actuators systems, networking and communication systems, software
    platform system, HVAC system, and smart control devices. FIGURE 6. Components
    of smart buildings. Show All Current systems utilize control devices and smart
    sensors that are connected to a central system. These control devices and smart
    sensors are placed throughout the environment. Each particular system has its
    own collection of networking and communication systems that enable it to communicate
    with the central system. SBs are performing connected networks that serve as a
    communication backbone for multiple systems. In many ways, HVAC equipment is the
    most complicated building system, with numerous components arranged to produce
    heating, cooling, and ventilation. The functionality of HVAC system not only makes
    the building healthy and comfortable for its inhabitants, but it also manages
    a big part of the energy consumed, as well as plays a significant role in life
    safety. SBs adopt technology to monitor and control facility systems and perform
    any required modifications. The objective of an SB is to utilize computers and
    software to control lighting, alarm systems, HVAC, and other systems through a
    single computer interface. A. Sensors and Actuators for SBs Sensors and actuators
    are mechanical components that measure and control the environmental values of
    their environment. Sensors collect information from the environment and make it
    ready for the system. For instance, IR sensors can be utilized for human presence
    detection in a room. While actuator is a device to convert an electrical control
    signal to a physical action, such that it takes decisions and then performs proper
    actions according to the environment, which enables automated and remote interaction
    with the environment.For example, a light actuator is capable of switching on/off,
    dimming one or more electric lights [34]. The rapid development of micromechanics,
    microelectronics, integrated optics, and other related technologies has facilitated
    the development of different types of smart sensors integrated into daily objects
    and infrastructure at smart building environment or worn by the users, and are
    connected by network technologies in order to collect contextual information about
    daily living activities more efficiently and faster, with lower energy consumption
    and less processing resources. Environmental sensors are utilized for detecting
    the human activity of a specific object that performed in specific locations in
    the building, while wearable sensors are utilized for controlling and observing
    mobile activities and physiological signals [35]. 1) Environmental Sensors It
    is found that data collected from environmental sensors can form important information
    to monitor human behaviors within an SB. These sensory data are then analyzed
    to identify and observe basic and instrumental daily living activities made by
    occupants such as bathing, dressing, preparing a meal, taking medication etc.
    The environmental sensing is generally based on several simple binary sensors
    in every part of the home, RFID technology, and video cameras. This variety of
    sensing may implement important insight into contexts and actual activities although
    it might come with possible costs such as complexity. Motion sensors are utilized
    for detecting the occupant’s presence and location everywhere in the house. There
    are different types of motion sensors. IR presence sensor is one of the most utilized
    kind of motion sensors in SBs to detect occupants’ presence. Pressure sensors
    can be attached to the objects such as beds, chairs, sofas, and floors in order
    to track the actions and locations of the occupants. While Contact switches are
    usually placed on the doors of fridge, rooms, or cabinets to detect the actions
    that the occupant makes with these objects [36]. Light sensors, humidity sensors,
    temperature sensors, or power sensors are other types of sensors that are deployed
    and utilized in SB to recognize the activities. Light sensors are utilized to
    measure the light intensity in a particular room in the building. Humidity sensors
    are utilized to detect the air humidity of a specific location in the building.
    Temperature sensors are utilized to measure the temperature of the specific environment.
    while the power sensors are utilized to identify the power usage of electric devices.
    2) Wearable Sensors and Biosensors These sensors are attached directly or indirectly
    to the user body. Their small size enables these sensors to be attached to clothes,
    wristwatches, glasses, belts, shoes etc. These sensors can be categorized into
    inertial sensors and vital sign sensors (or biosensors). Wearable inertial sensors
    are highly transportable and no stationary units that can give accurately detailed
    features of occupant’s action and body posture. Those sensors are composed of
    accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetic sensors. There is a need for receivers
    and cameras in the process of data collection, therefore can be used outside laboratory
    circumstances [37]. Wearable biosensors such as blood pressure, skin temperature,
    and heart rate are significant for collecting vital signs to monitor the health.
    The most commonly utilized inertial sensors for mobile activity monitoring are
    accelerometers and gyroscopes. Accelerometers can be utilized to measure the rate
    of acceleration accompanying a sensitive axis, they are useful to monitor the
    motion’s activities such as doing exercise, standing, sitting, walking, or walking
    upstairs and downstairs. While the gyroscopes can be utilized to measure angular
    velocity and maintain orientation. Some examples of primary vital signs are Electrocardiogram
    (ECG), heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose, oxygen saturation, and respiratory
    rate. There are various vital sign sensor utilized to measure different vital
    signals such as Electroencephalography sensors (EEG) for observing electrical
    brain activity, Electrooculography sensors (EOG) for observing eye movement in
    ocular activity, Electromyography sensors (EMG) for observing muscle activity.
    Electrocardiography sensors (ECG) for observing cardiac activity, pressure sensors
    for observing blood pressure, CO2 gas sensors for observing respiration, thermal
    sensors for observing body temperature and galvanic skin response for observing
    skin sweating [38], [39]. 3) Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
    HVAC system plays an essential role in SB services. HVAC system plays a remarkable
    role in efficient energy consumption in SBs, as well as it offers new operating
    options to increase the occupants’ comfort. In addition to meeting the desired
    temperature, HVAC control systems are produced in order to sustain comfort within
    an enclosed space by producing a specific level of humidity, pressure, air motion,
    and air quality in an SB [40]. CO2, humidity and temperature levels in a building
    can affect occupant’s health and comfort; consequently measuring CO2, humidity,
    and temperature in this context can improve personal wellbeing [41]. Heating and
    cooling systems consume a huge amount of energy in the buildings, so it is necessary
    to optimize it utilizing smart controllers and sensors in order to save operational
    costs. Smart HVAC systems can sense and control efficiently different air quality
    parameters inside the building by utilizing distributed sensors and VAV fans throughout
    the building to perform an optimal ventilation [42]. Most of the current HVAC
    actuation systems in smart buildings are based on the data collected about the
    occupants using sensors and cameras, which are utilized specifically for HVAC
    systems. Certainly, There is a specific cost for the design, maintenance, setup
    and hardware of the data collection network [43]. Table 3 shows a summary for
    different types of smart sensors in the SBs. TABLE 3 Various Smart Sensors Useful
    in the Context of SBs B. Smart Control Devices Smart control devices collect data
    from a variety of sensors, process this data, and activate actuators to react
    to the events detected by the sensors. A smart control device can operate independently,
    without control by a central server. But there might be a needed communication
    amongst various control devices or they can connect with each other using the
    smart gateway. WeMo [44] is a Wi-Fi enabled switch utilized to turn electronic
    devices on/off from anywhere. It can control LED motion sensors, light bulbs,
    mart wall switches and plugs, and lighting devices, all from the smartphone app
    or browser. There is no hub needed for WeMo devices, everything can be managed
    through the free cloud service provided by Belkin. You can use the specific channel
    to connect the device to e-services such as Gmail to trigger specific actions.
    WeMo devices also support context-aware feature, it turns on/off automatically
    according to the time of day, whether it is sunrise or sunset etc. The Nest thermostat
    [45], a smart device developed by Nest—which has been acquired by Google—adjusts
    to your life and seasons change automatically. Just use it for a week and it programs
    itself. It learns about the level of temperatures that the occupants prefer and
    creates a context-aware personalized schedule. The smart thermostat turns to an
    energy-efficient mode automatically when the residents leave the building. It
    could start warming up the area when it senses activity, such as an occupant’s
    returning back home from work. The Nest Thermostat is controllable via a smartphone
    and an installed app. If you are away for a while, this device has also a capability
    to sustain a particular temperature in your house. Lockitron [46] is a door lock
    that can control the door remotely over the Internet to open and close it by phone.
    Lockitron app can be installed and used by any iOS or Android smartphone. Homeowners
    can directly grant family and friends the access to open a given door by providing
    authorization over the Internet. Lockitron can also utilize Bluetooth low energy
    technology, which means that it will keep controlling even in the event of Internet
    or power outages. Lockitron can also connect to the Internet with Bridge, through
    which occupants can control the bolt anywhere in the world. The SmartThings [47]
    SB automation system comprised of a communications smart hub, that supports various
    smart appliances and devices; the smart hub supports various technologies and
    protocols such as ZigBee, Z-Wave, as well as IP-accessible devices and lets you
    control appliances using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. SmartThings provides
    kits that include smart plugs, in addition, the basic sensors that can be utilized
    to measure temperature, as well as to detect presence, motion, orientation, and
    vibration. SmartThings also includes an open platform that enables smart device
    vendors and third-party software to provide hardware and software that can be
    utilized alongside the platform. Philips Hue [48] is a combination of LED lighting
    with mobile technology. An accompanying mobile app that allows you to control
    lighting systems and changing color sets depending on your mood utilizing Wi-Fi
    technology. The new Philips Hue bridge supports the required authentication to
    enable Apple HomeKit technology to control and enable your Philips Hue to connect
    to other HomeKit enabled accessories and take control of your home. Blufitbottle
    [49] this bottle records the drinking habits of the users and sends them notifications
    about the time and amount of the water that they are supposed to drink to keep
    them healthy and hydrated. The app collects data about users such as their weight
    and age, plus other factors such as the current levels of temperature and humidity
    to estimate the amount of the needed water to keep them hydrated. When the user
    falls behind with hydration, an alert sounds, as well as a simple glance from
    the LEDs, will indicate when it’s time for the next drink. Canary [50] is an all-in-one
    home security system that comprises a set of sensors such as temperature, air
    quality, sound, motion vibration, in addition, an HD video camera in one unit.
    The system utilizes ML algorithms to let the users know what is happening at home
    and take action by sending notifications to your phone if something happens. Those
    ML models learn over time and send the users smarter notifications as it detects
    motion. So that, the longer you have the system, the more effective it becomes.
    Canary is able to decrease the rate of false alarms by learning the user behavior
    and the ambient noise level and the home temperature patterns. Amazon Echo [51]
    is a small cylinder enable the users to control anything in the home via the voice.
    Amazon Echo has a powerful voice recognition capability, the user does not have
    to worry about the complexities of their voice. Amazon Echo is connectable via
    Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, the users can send voice commands to control the speakers
    as well as other compatible devices such as Belkin’s WeMo and Philips Hue. It
    can also use Amazon cloud Lambda service to send commands. To send any command
    It requires to include the name of the program, for instance, “Alexa, turn on
    TV”. It also includes a network to distant servers, which slows down the response
    time. Honeywell Total Connect Remote Services [52] this device merges personal
    smart home automation with security monitoring task. It enables the occupants
    to control and monitor everything in the home from lighting and window shades
    systems to security cameras and smoke alarms. the user can utilize a smartphone
    app or desktop-mounted hardware console for controlling and monitoring. It can
    provide real-time alerts, GPS vehicle and asset tracking, video viewing, and mobile
    control. The system only supports Z-Wave devices, it needs to be installed by
    an authorized Honeywell dealer. It does not work with Wi-Fi enabled smart thermostats.
    In addition, the Honeywell provides security cameras and sensors, it also supports
    other smart devices from third parties, such as Yale locks and Lutron lighting.
    Table 4 shows a comparison among various smart control devices in the SBs. TABLE
    4 Comparison Among Various Smart Control Devices in SB C. Networking and Home
    Gateway An SB combines a communication network in order to control smart devices
    and services within the building. The communication network of a smart building
    can be based on diverse communication media such as twisted pair cable, as the
    traditional computer networks. The networking in building automation system has
    a tendency to utilize a heterogeneous network that is made up of diverse communication
    media and network standards. The building automation network is identified by
    physical technology and communication protocols. There is an internal network
    that connects devices inside the building, as well as the external networks, can
    be integrated separately. Public Internet, ISDN, and mobile phone networks are
    some examples of external networks [28], [53]. A typical SB may comprise a number
    of different components, such as sensors, actuators, communication and processing
    devices. Because of their nature, these components have limited capabilities and
    computational capacity in term of battery capacity and capability of data processing.
    To deal with this issue, most of the SB systems have been utilized as a central
    gateway to collect, process, and analyze context data from different sensors and
    actuators in the building. Several protocols such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Wi-Fi,
    and Z-wave can be utilized for communicating the gateway. The home gateway can
    also collect and store data for a specific time period. Typically, these gateways
    can connect to the cloud services and perform data processing and reasoning tasks.
    The centralized gateway usually does not have any interface. They can be controlled
    and managed utilizing smartphones, tablets, or computers [54], [55]. In general,
    depending on the communication media used, SB network technology can be classified
    by interconnection method into three main types: Powerline, Busline, and Wireless
    [15], [56], which we describe next. 1) Powerline Communication (PLC) PLC method
    reuses the building electrical network; such that devices, appliances, and services
    are directly connected to the main power supply utilizing the already available
    electrical outlets in a building. The data is sent through the normal cable system
    to activate or deactivate the devices in the building. PLC system is historically
    the oldest technology in SB and is generally cheap but less reliable and scalable
    [3]. Originally, the application of PLC was mainly to secure the typical operation
    of the electric power supply system in case of failures or breakdowns through
    the direct exchange of information between the distribution center, and power
    plant. Therefore, this approach has become a competitive choice for SB networking,
    benefiting from availability, robustness, and ready connectivity of this method.
    Some of the protocols of this method offer a single-way communication, which enables
    the device to only receive information but not to communicate. There are different
    mainstream protocols of PLC method such as X-10, INSTEON, HomePlug, BACnet, and
    Lonworks. 2) Busline Busline systems in SBs networks use a separate physical media,
    usually twisted-pair cabling similar to the physical cables utilized for network
    services for transporting electrical signals. This type of systems is pleasant
    the building’s occupants, albeit the configuration process is complex, and it
    requires some knowledge of networking. Although the configuring complexity and
    installation cost of this system, the use of a separate cable could present a
    positive note about this approach, as it allows this method of networking to provide
    higher bandwidth, and to make it the most reliable of the three approaches. In
    addition, this technology usually supports a completed two-way communication protocol
    that enables the appliances to easily communicate with each other [57]. Some of
    the protocols in Busline technology are Konnex (KNX), CAN (Controller Area Network),
    Modbus, Meter-Bus (M-Bus). 3) Wireless Interconnection Many of the new SB applications
    use wireless technologies such as infrared and radio frequency, which are more
    convenient for users due to their untethered nature and the elimination of cables.
    The devices within the smart building can communicate wirelessly as radio wave
    can penetrate through floors, cabinets, and walls [56]. Because of the complexity
    and cost of potential modifications and of the re-wiring process in a smart building,
    several different wireless technologies are rising to produce flexible networking
    patterns convenient to occupants without taking to consider the physical wiring
    and deployment of such wire in the building. Typically, there are various protocols
    for the wireless system such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, WLAN, Z-wave, RFID etc., which
    essentially work in the industrial scientific medical bands, particularly in the
    2.4GHz frequency range. These wireless technologies are usually related to some
    control network concept in an SB such as low power consumption, high cost-effectiveness,
    low speed, flexibility in networking, deployment as well as building coverage
    [3]. The gateway is the central server of an SB that is commonly used in IoT solutions.
    The services provided by the gateway essentially concern to system management
    functionalities such as monitoring, controlling, and configuring the systems and
    their devices. It also supports some processing and data storage capabilities
    required for complex applications. D. Software Platform For a building to be “smart,”
    it is important that all the appliances and systems in the building communicate
    and exchange data securely with each other as well as with smartphones, tablets,
    and servers in the cloud. Software platforms play a critical role in exchanging,
    archiving and disseminating information through different protocols. These platforms
    use push, pull, publish/subscribe, etc. The goal of the joint commercial enterprises
    is to develop an open source software platform in order to make the process of
    data exchanging easier between the devices of different manufacturers. Therefore,
    the users will not have to worry in the future about the compatibility issues
    when utilizing electric and electronic devices of different manufacturers at home.
    In addition, the new platform can also offer a variety of different building services
    such as entertainment, energy efficiency, and security technology. Hence, this
    will enable creating different apps for these areas of use [58]. ABB, Robert Bosch
    GmbH, and Cisco Systems Inc. established an open-software platform called Mozaiq
    Operations GmbH [59] to unify smart building technology and offer interoperability
    across for all devices and services in the building, to simplify the experience
    for residents. It will enable users to seamlessly and intuitively customize their
    appliances and devices, regardless of manufacturers and brands of these devices,
    in order to improve energy efficiency and achieve a unique level of control and
    comfort. For instance, the user can close the blinds in the home either by a click
    from a smartphone or through a pre-set instruction; and switch off automatically
    all screen devices for the children to go outside to play. In a smart building,
    many devices and appliances can simply and securely share information with one
    another and with smartphones and other smart devices; and the Internet in general.
    Indigo Domotics [60] is to implement the do-it-yourself smart building platform.
    Indigo home automation software controllers available for the Mac OS enables residents
    to combine an array of common INSTEON, Z-Wave and X10 devices for unparalleled
    control of your building lighting, sensors, thermostats, and appliances. With
    Indigo Touch (sold through iTunes app store, iOS only), users will easily achieve
    remote control of their appliances utilizing an iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch. They
    also can use a web browser on any device to control their appliances virtually
    anywhere in the world. The users can receive texts or emails about specific events
    has been detected for doors opening/closing, power failures etc. Indigo, from
    Perceptive Automation, is the newest home automation software for the Mac. OpenHAB
    [61] is an open-source software platform that follows a middleware approach for
    integrating different technologies in smart building systems into a single solution.
    OpenHAB platform address a variety of network technologies and appliances in the
    area of a smart building. Currently, the dependency on a particular vendor becomes
    a problem due to the lack of a common language that bridges the different devices
    with building automation system. The main goal of the OpenHAB platform is to integrate
    the new devices and technologies in a smart building system through a community-based
    approach. OpenHAB utilizes an OSGi based modular system for communicating between
    different technologies and devices. Bindings can be developed and deployed as
    an OSGi bundle to bridge a particular technology and device. There are different
    supported technologies exist such as EnOcean, KNX, Z-Wave, and others are supported
    through special bindings [62]. SmartThings [47] this platform composed of hardware
    devices, sensors, and software applications. Context information is collected
    from the sensors, this context is contributed to the reasoning and action that
    are performed by the application. For instance, the sprinkler in the garden can
    detect the rain, and switch itself off accordingly to save water. SmartThings
    kit comprises sensors, smart devices, and hub. While the SmartThings application
    is configured to enable users to control and monitor their building environment
    through a smartphone device. The SmartThings Hub works to connect the sensors,
    devices and building’s internet router to one another and to the cloud. It is
    compatible with different communication protocols such as Zigbee, Z-Wave, and
    IP-accessible devices. In addition, the SmartThings is compatible with other sensors
    and devices such as thermostats, moisture sensors, motion sensors, presence sensors,
    locks and garage door openers [63]. HomeOS [64] is Microsoft’s home operating
    system platform, that can be installed on a personal computer. It is an open platform
    that is not limited to Windows-based devices [65], [66]. with HomeOS platform,
    applications can be installed to maintain various context-aware functionalities,
    for example, taking an image by a door camera and sending it to the occupant when
    someone rings the doorbell. HomeOS provides a PC-like abstraction that manages
    and extends the technology of network devices to the users and developers in the
    smart building environment. Its design enables the users to map their protocol-independent
    services to support the applications with simple APIs, a kernel, and protocols
    of specific devices. HomeOS usually runs on an allocated computer such as a home
    gateway, it does not need any adjustments to commodity devices. HomeOS usually
    utilizes (i) Datalog-based access control to facilitate the process of managing
    technology in the smart home (ii) a kernel to incorporate the devices and applications
    and (iii) protocol-independent services to allow the developers manageable access
    to the devices. Lab of Things (LoT) [67], [68] is an experimental research platform
    that utilizes connected devices in the buildings. LoT offers a framework that
    provides deployment capabilities such as remote monitoring and updating of system
    health, and logging data collected from different appliances in cloud storage.
    It enables data sharing and collecting, sharing codes, connect hardware sensors
    to the software platform, and participants using HomeOS. The platform is designed
    to make it simple to design solutions that can be deployed in IoT based smart
    services such as healthcare, energy management services as it works in combination
    with HomeOS. Eclipse Smarthome [69] is a framework that has a focus on heterogeneous
    environments such as smart building and ambient assisted living. This platform
    takes to consider a variety of existing communication mechanisms. Eclipse SmartHome
    works as an abstraction and translation framework that enables communications
    across system and protocol boundaries. It provides many relevant implemented extensions,
    protocols, and standards that are significant for smart building services. Those
    implementations can be of Java library or an OSGi bundle shapes so that they can
    be utilized independently from the rest of the project. The framework can work
    on different embedded devices such as a BeagleBone Black, an Intel Edison, or
    a Raspberry Pi. Extensions of Eclipse SmartHome are compatible with the solutions
    provided by different vendors. This means your code that is written for a specific
    purpose can be extended easily on commercial platforms. Eclipse SmartHome offers
    a variety of characteristics to allow you to design a special Smart Home solution
    for your expectations [70]. Apart from discussing various SB solutions, we will
    also highlight the popular simulator called Cooja is used widely by the research
    community to produce small simulations for relatively large wireless networks
    of embedding sensors and actuators; and connected devices, in order to develop,
    debug and evaluate systems based on the wireless sensor network technology. Cooja
    simulator is a Java-based wireless sensor network simulator. It is distributed
    with Contiki OS project. Cooja enables the emulation of the set of sensor nodes,
    in addition, it can simulate physical and application layers of the system [71].
    There are three basic properties for the simulated node in Cooja: Its hardware
    peripherals, node type, and data memory. The node type can be shared among multiple
    nodes and defines properties that are common to all these nodes [72]. Summary:
    The field of SBs contains a variety of technologies, across commercial, industrial,
    institutional and domestic buildings, including building controls and energy management
    systems. Several organizations and institutions are working to supply buildings
    with technology that enables the residents to adopt a single device to control
    all electronic devices and appliances. In this section, we discussed the various
    components for SBs including sensors and actuators, smart control devices, smart
    gateway, networking and software platforms. SECTION IV. Ml Background for SBS:
    Models, Tasks, and Tools Massive data generated from sensors, wearable devices,
    and other IoT technologies provide rich information about the context of users
    and building status and can be used to design SB management. This context information
    is needed to extract useful and interesting insights for various stakeholders.
    When the data volume is very high, developing predictive models using traditional
    approaches does not provide accurate insight and we require newly developed tools
    from big data. Big data is primed to make a big impact in SBs and is already playing
    a big role in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industries
    [73], notably for waste analytics [74] and waste minimization [75]. ML is a powerful
    tool that facilitates the process of mining a massive amount of data that have
    been collected from different sources around us and make sense of a complicated
    world. ML algorithms apply a model on new data by learning the model from a set
    of observed data examples called a training set. For example, after being trained
    on a set of sample accelerometer data marked as walking or jogging, an ML algorithm
    can classify the future data points into walking and jogging classes. ML makes
    it relatively easy to develop advanced software systems without much involvement
    from the human side. They are applicable to many real-life problems in SB environments.
    One can also design and develop self-learning and collaborative systems. ML does
    not remove the human element from data science—it draws on computers’ strengths
    in handling big data to complement our understanding of semantics and context.
    It only needs training data to extract better features or parameters required
    to improve a given system. ML algorithms can be used to make predictions based
    on data patterns. It enables the computer to learn from the fed input data without
    being explicitly programmed so that ML algorithms can learn from and make predictions
    on input data [76], [77]. Nest thermostat is an example of a device that applies
    a specific temperature in a specific room and at a certain time of day according
    to the occupants’ preference. There are devices such as Amazon’s Echo that can
    learn from voice patterns, and the others those learn from much more complex behavior
    and activity patterns. A. Ml Models ML techniques have been widely used to develop
    smart systems which can sense and react according to context modifications in
    SBs [78]. There are many different ML algorithms, according to the two well-known
    theorems No Free Lunch theorem and Ugly Duckling theorem. No Free Lunch theorem
    states “there are no algorithms that can be said to be better than any other”,
    without prior information about the problem, any two algorithms may perform equally
    well in solving a problem. While Ugly Duckling theorem states “we cannot say that
    any two different patterns would be more similar to each other than any other
    pairs.” [79]. Mainly, ML is categorized into four categories handling different
    types of learning tasks as follows: Supervised learning, unsupervised learning,
    semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms Figure 7 shows
    ML styles. These categories are described next and a summarized comparison between
    these ML techniques is presented in Table 5. TABLE 5 Comparison of ML Techniques
    FIGURE 7. ML styles. Show All 1) Supervised Learning refers to developing algorithms
    based on a labeled training dataset, from which the learner should generalize
    a representation by building the system model that represents the relations between
    the input, output and system parameters. ML model is developed through a training
    process that continues on the input training data until the model reaches the
    desired level of accuracy [80], [81]. Some examples of common supervised ML algorithms
    are: naive Bayes model, decision tree, linear discriminant functions such as support
    vector machines (SVMs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), hidden Markov models
    (HMMs), instance-based learning (such as k-nearest-neighbor learning), ensembles
    (bagging, boosting, random forest), logistic regression, genetic algorithms, and
    logistic regression [82], [83]. Supervised learning approaches are extensively
    used to solve different problems in smart buildings. Application in SBs: Boger
    et al. [76] proposed a supervised learning system using Markov decision processes
    to help people with dementia the process of hand washing. Altun et al. [84] make
    a comparative study on the supervised human activity classification approaches
    using body-worn miniature inertial and magnetic sensors. Mozer [85] developed
    the occupant comfort control of the home environment system using neural networks
    and reinforcement learning to control air heating, lighting, ventilation, and
    water heating in the smart home environment. Bourobou et al. [86] presented a
    hybrid approach using ANN and K-pattern clustering to identify and predict user
    activities in the smart environments. Hsu et al. [87] proposed a TV recommendation
    system using a neural network model based on user personalized properties such
    as activities, interests, moods, experiences, and demographic information data.
    Fleury et al. [88] proposed a healthcare-focused smart home system using the SVM
    algorithm to classify daily living activities based on the data from the different
    sensors. Supervised learning problems can be further grouped into classification,
    regression, time series, and ensemble method problems. a: Classification The task
    of classification algorithms is to classify an instance into a specific discrete
    set of possible categories. Given two sets of data (labeled and unlabeled datasets),
    the labeled dataset is used for the training process, while the unlabeled dataset
    will be used to evaluate of the classification results. The normal process is
    to count the number of instances that are assigned to the right category, which
    is also known as the accuracy rate (AR) defined by [21]. The classification algorithm
    can mathematically be described as follows: AR= N c N t (1) View Source where
    N c denotes the number of test instances that are correctly assigned to their
    categories to which they belong; N t the number of test instances. The precision
    ( P ) and recall ( R ) are used to measure the details of the classification results.
    The four possible outcomes are true positive ( TP ), false negative ( FN ), false
    positive ( FP ), and true negative ( TN ), the precision ( P ) and recall ( R
    ) are generally defined as: P= TP TP+FP (2) View Source Given P and R , a simple
    method to describe the precision and recall of the overall classification results,
    called F-score or F-measure, is defined as: F= 2PR P+R (3) View Source Commonly
    used classification techniques include decision trees, SVM, rule-based induction,
    neural networks, deep learning, memory-based reasoning, and Bayesian networks
    [89]. b: Decision Tree Algorithms The decision tree method is an important predictive
    ML modeling approach, which constructs a model of decisions presented based on
    the actual values of features in the data. Decision trees can be utilized for
    both classification and regression problems. In tree structures, leaves represent
    class labels and branches represent conjunctions of attributes that drive to those
    labels [90]. The decision trees that the target variable takes continuous values
    called regression trees. Decision trees are often one of the favorites of ML algorithms
    because of its speed and accuracy. The most common algorithms for decision tree
    are [91]: classification and regression tree, ID3, C4.5 and C5.0, Chi-squared,
    M5, and conditional decision trees. Application in SBs: Delgado et al. [92] propose
    an ML technique based on decision trees to extract the most frequent activities
    of human behavior and the temporal relationship of those activities in order to
    produce the human behavior quickly in a smart environment. Viswanathan et al.
    [93] introduce a prototype distributed data mining system for healthcare environment
    using C4.5 classification algorithm that can provide the patient monitoring and
    health services. Decision trees algorithm is a non-parametric algorithm that is
    easy to interpret and explain. The main disadvantage of this algorithm is that
    it can easily overfit. c: Bayesian Algorithms Bayesian methods utilize Bayes’
    theorem for classification and regression problems. The most common Bayesian algorithms
    are [94]: Naive Bayes, Gaussian naive Bayes, Bayesian belief network, Bayesian
    network. Application in SBs: Parnandi et al. [95] propose an indoor localization
    approach based on Naive Bayes classification and dynamic time warping, they exploit
    the embedded sensors of smartphones to determine the building that the user entered
    and the activities that the user is performing inside the building. Verbert et
    al. [96] proposed an ML approach based on Bayesian network to diagnosis the fault
    in HVAC systems. The model has been constructed based expert knowledge concerning
    conservation laws, component interdependencies, and historical data using virtual
    sensors. Naive Bayes classifier approaches have been applied with potential results
    for human activity recognition in [97], [98]. Naive Bayes approach recognizes
    human activities that identify with the highest probability to the set of sensor
    readings that were observed. d: Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised ML
    algorithm which can be applied for both classification and regression problems
    though mostly used in classification challenges [140]. SVM is one of the most
    popularly utilized for many statistical learning problems, such as face and object
    recognition, text classification, spam detections, handwriting analysis etc. [141].
    is maximizing the margin that separating between the hyperplane of two classes’
    closest points. Support vectors are the points lying on the boundaries, and the
    optimal separating hyperplane is the middle of the margin [142]. Application in
    SBs: Fu et al. [105] proposed an SVM method to predict the system level electricity
    loads of public buildings that have electricity sub-metering systems. A real-time
    human tracker system proposed Nguyen et al. [106] using SVM for predicting and
    recognizing human motion based on the input images from a network of four cameras
    in the ubiquitous smart homes. Petersen et al. [107] developed an SVM model to
    predict the times where visitors are present in the home using only the data provided
    by wireless motion sensors in each room. Fleury et al. [88] presented a study
    for automatic recognition of daily living activities in a smart home based on
    SVM. They collected the data from various sensors such as Infra-Red Presence Sensors,
    door contacts, temperature and hygrometry sensor, and microphones. Das et al.
    [108] proposed a one-class classification approach for a real-time activity error
    detection in smart homes using one-class SVM. Zhao et al. [143] proposed an ML
    approach based on SVM and RNN to detect the occupancy behavior of a building through
    the temperature and heating source information for the energy efficiency consumption
    purposes. e: Artificial Neural Network Algorithms (ANNs) ANN models are inspired
    by the process of biological neural networks. ANN models are commonly utilized
    for regression and classification problems. The common ANN algorithms are [94]:
    Perceptron, Back-Propagation, Hopfield Network, and Radial Basis Function Network
    (RBFN). ANNs provide a number of advantages including it requires less statistical
    training, it has the capacity to detect complex nonlinear relationships between
    the predictor and response variables, as well as the ability to detect all possible
    relationships between predictor variables [104]. On the other hand, disadvantages
    include its “black box” nature, heavy computational burden and proneness to overfitting.
    However, due to the inherent features of neural networks, it has the following
    main limitations: challenge in training with no local optima, its accommodation
    to modifications in the behavior, the validation process of the results, and the
    complexity of network performance interpretation. Application in SBs: Badlani
    and Bhanot [99] developed a smart home system for energy efficiency applying pattern
    recognition based on ANNs, the system incorporates an RNN to capture human behavior
    patterns and an ANN for security applications in smart homes. Other researchers
    have applied ANNs to present context-aware services. Campo et al. [100] developed
    a system that calculates the probability of occupation for each section of the
    building and compares the probability with the current situation systematically.
    See [101] for a survey paper focusing on the role of ANNs for smart home services.
    Ermes et al. [102] proposed a hybrid classifier approach using a tree structure
    comprising a priori knowledge and ANN to recognize the activities such as rowing,
    biking, playing football, walking, running, sitting, or hiking. Ciabattoni et
    al. [103] proposed a home energy management system design using the neural network
    algorithm to predict the power production of the photovoltaic plant and the home
    consumptions during the given time. f: Deep Learning Algorithms: Deep learning
    methods represent an evolved form of ANNs in which a deep architecture (many layers
    comprising multiple linear and non-linear transformations [144]) is used. One
    of the promises of DL is replacing the manually selected features with efficient
    unsupervised or semi-supervised feature learning and hierarchical feature extraction
    algorithms. The most common DL algorithms are [145]: Convolutional Neural Network
    (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM), Deep Belief
    Network (DBN), and Stacked Auto-Encoders. Deep learning has been used successfully
    in varieties of big data analytics applications, particularly natural language
    processing (NLP) applications, medical diagnosis, stock market trading, network
    security, and image identification. Deep learning is now ubiquitously used in
    major businesses and companies. Microsoft research on a deep learning system presented
    real-time speech translation system between Mandarin Chinese and English languages
    [146]. Apple’s Siri uses a deep learning trained model, and the voice recognition
    in the Google Android phone also uses a deep learning trained model [147]. DL
    utilizes a number of techniques such as drop-out and convolutions that enables
    the models to learn efficiently from high-dimensional data. However, DL requires
    much more data to train compared to other algorithms because of the magnitudes
    of parameters for estimation required by the models. Application in SBs: Choi
    et al. [114] propose two prediction algorithms deep belief network and restricted
    Boltzmann machines based on the DL framework for predicting different human activities
    in a building. They also presented a hybrid model which combines for predicting
    human behavior. The paper [115] proposes a generic deep learning framework based
    on convolutional and RNNs for human activity recognition that is suitable for
    multimodal wearable sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes or magnetic field
    sensors. Alsheikh et al. [116] proposed a hybrid approach of DL and hidden Markov
    model for human activity recognition using triaxial accelerometers. Baccouche
    et al. [117] propose a two-steps neural-based deep model to classify human activities,
    the first step of the model is automatically learned spatiotemporal features based
    on Convolutional Neural Networks. Then the second step of the model uses an RNN
    to classify the entire sequence of the learned features for each time-step. In
    [118], they propose an acceleration-based human activity recognition method using
    Convolution Neural Network. In [119] a deep convolutional neural network as the
    automatic feature extractor and classifier for recognizing human activities is
    proposed using the accelerometer and gyroscope on a smartphone. Hammerla et al.
    [148] explore the performance of deep, convolutional, and recurrent approaches
    of deep learning for human activity recognition using wearable sensors. For the
    sake of measuring the performance, the authors used three representative datasets
    that comprise motion data collected from wearable sensors. g: Hidden Markov Models
    (Hmm) An HMM is a doubly stochastic process with a hidden underlying stochastic
    process that can be observed through the sequence of observed symbols emitted
    by another stochastic process. Application in SBs: Wu et al. [113] proposed an
    improved HMM to predict user behaviors in order to provide services for people
    with disabilities. They developed a temporal state transition matrix to be utilized
    instead of the fixed state transition matrix. Lv and Nevatia [112] used hidden
    Markov models for both automatic recognition and segmentation of 3-D human activities
    to allow real-time evaluation and feedback for physical rehabilitation. Cheng
    et al. [110] proposed an inference engine based on the HMM that provides a comprehensive
    activity of daily living recognition capability. They integrated both Viterbi
    and Baum-Welch algorithms to enhance the accuracy and learning capability. Chahuara
    et al. [111] proposed sequence-based models for online recognition of daily living
    activities in an SB environment. They presented three of sequence-based models:
    HMM, conditional random fields, and a sequential Markov logic network. h: Time
    Series Analysis A time series is a collection of temporal instances; time series
    data set usually have the following characteristics include the high dimensionality,
    large number of instances, and updating continuously [149]. One of the important
    purposes for time series representation is to reduce the dimension, and it divides
    into three categories: model-based representation, non-data-adaptive representation,
    and data-adaptive representation [150], [151]. Application in SBs: Survadevara
    et al. [125] proposed a wellness model using seasonal autoregression integration
    moving average time series with sleeping activity scenario in a smart home environment
    to forecast the elderly sleeping tendency. Zhou et al. [126] proposed a time series
    analysis framework to explore relationships among non-stationary time series in
    the case of data sensors in SBs. Jakkula and Cook [127] propose a time series
    based framework to determine temporal rules from observed physical and instrumental
    activities of occupants in a smart home. i: Regression The aim in regression problems
    is to estimate a real-valued target function. It is related to representing the
    relationship between variables that are repeatedly processed utilizing a measure
    of error in the predictions made by the model [152]. The most common regression
    algorithms are [153]: linear regression, logistic regression, stepwise regression,
    and ordinary least squares regression. Application in SBs: Chen et al. [120] used
    the regression technique of orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm to identify
    the physical and environmental parameters that providing the energy efficiency
    in an SB. Bouchard et al. [121] presented a gesture recognition system using linear
    regression combined with the correlation coefficient to recognize the gesture
    direction and estimate the segmentation of continuing gestures of daily usage
    activities in a smart environment. j: Ensemble Methods A combination of multiple
    classifiers often referred to as a classifier ensemble, group of classification
    models that are trained separately and the predictions of those models are then
    combined in a way to produce the overall prediction [154]. The most popular ensemble
    learning based classification techniques are [155]: random forest, boosting, gradient
    boosting machines, AdaBoost, bagging, and blending. Application in SBs: Jurek
    et al. [122] proposed a cluster-based ensemble approach solution for activity
    recognition within the application domain of smart homes. With this approach,
    activities are modeled as cluster collections built on different subsets of features.
    Fatima et al. [123] proposed an ensemble classifier method for activity recognition
    in smart homes using genetic algorithm optimization to merge the prediction output
    of multiple classifiers that make up the ensemble. They used the ANN, HMM, conditional
    random field, and SVM [13] as base classifiers for activity recognition. Guan
    and Ploetz [124] proposed a deep LSTM ensemble method for activity recognition
    using wearables: more specifically, the authors developed modified training procedures
    for LSTM networks and proposed the combination of sets of diverse LSTM learners
    into classifier collectives. 2) Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised Learning refers
    to developing algorithms that use data with no labels to analyze the behavior
    or the system being investigated [156]. Thus, the algorithm does not know about
    the truth of the outcome. In other words, the unsupervised learning algorithm
    classifies the sample sets to different clusters by investigating the similarity
    between the input samples. Clustering is done using different parameters taken
    from the data which enable us to identify correlations which are not so obvious.
    The inferring structures existing within the input data is used to prepare the
    model to prepare and extract general rules of the model. A mathematical process
    might be used to systematically reduce redundancy, or organize data by similarity
    [129]. The unsupervised approach has been applied to recognize various activities
    in smart buildings when it is challenging to have labels for input data [130].
    Common unsupervised learning problems are clustering, dimensionality reduction,
    and association rule learning. There are a variety of commonly used unsupervised
    learning algorithms, some of those algorithms are based on supervised-learning
    algorithms: the Apriori algorithm and k-Means. In unsupervised learning, usually
    there is no a measure for the output; we recognize only the features and the target
    is to define the patterns and relationships among a set of input measures [80].
    The major disadvantage of unsupervised learning is the absence of direction for
    the learning algorithm, hence, there might not be any useful detected knowledge
    in the selected set of attributes for the training. Clustering is a method of
    unsupervised learning that involves detecting patterns in the data by placing
    each data element into a group of K-clusters, where each group holds data elements
    most similar to each other [157]. Unsupervised learning problems can be categorized
    into clustering and association problems, which are described next. a: Clustering
    A clustering problem explores the internal groupings in the input data, such as
    grouping customers by their purchasing habits. Clustering techniques are usually
    organized by modeling strategies such as centroid-based and hierarchical. All
    methods are concerned with handling the internal structures in the input data
    to properly organize the data into groups of maximum commonality [158]. The quality
    of the clustering result is evaluated depends on the type of application that
    utilizes a clustering algorithm. For example, the sum of squared errors is generally
    utilized for data clustering while the peak-signal-to-noise ratio is used for
    image clustering [21]. The most common clustering algorithms are [153]: k-Means,
    k-Medians, expectation maximization, and hierarchical clustering. Application
    in SBs: Fahad et al. [128] propose an activity recognition approach that combines
    the classification with the clustering, in their approach the activity instances
    are clustered using Lloyd’s clustering algorithm. Then, they apply evidence theoretic
    K-Nearest neighbors learning method that combines KNN with the Dampster Shafer
    theory of evidence. The paper [86] proposes a hybrid approach to recognize and
    predict user activities in a smart environment. They use the K-pattern clustering
    algorithm to classify so varied and complex user activities, and ANN to recognize
    and predict users’ activities inside their personal rooms. Lapalu et al. [82]
    used an unsupervised learning approach to address the issues of daily living activities’
    learning in smart home. They utilize the Flocking algorithm for clustering analysis
    of a use case in cognitive assistance service that assists the people suffering
    from some type of dementia such as Alzheimer’s disease. Aicha et al. [83] present
    an unsupervised learning approach for detecting abnormal visits of an elderly
    in a smart home environment based on a Markov modulated Poisson process model.
    The model combines multiple data streams, such as in the front-door sensor transitions
    and the general sensor transitions. The other cases of social communication services,
    Rashidi and Cook [129] applied an unsupervised learning approach to detect social
    interaction and monitor activity daily living in a smart space, their approach
    can adapt and update automatically to reflect the changes in discovered patterns
    from implicit and explicit identified feedbacks of the occupant. Rashidi et al.
    [130] introduce an unsupervised method that identifies and tracks the normal activities
    that commonly occur in an individual’s routine in a smart environment. The activity
    discovery method of the system is produced to cluster the sequences based on the
    simple k-means algorithm. Fiorini et al. [159] proposed an unsupervised ML approach
    to identify the behavioral patterns of the occupants using unannotated data collected
    from low-level sensors in an SB. Their approach involves processing and analyzing
    collected data related to the daily living activities of 17 older adults living
    in a community-based home supplied with a variety of sensors. They extract activity
    information from collected data at different times of the day. b: Association
    The association rule learning problem is utilized to identify the rules that define
    large portions of input data, such as people that buy X item also tend to buy
    Y item. Association analysis is performed on rules discovered by analyzing input
    data for frequent if/then statement and using the criteria of support and confidence
    to discover relationships between unrelated data in a relational database or another
    information repository. Here “support” indicates how frequently the items appear
    in the database while “confidence” indicates the number of times the if/then statements
    have been found to be true. Many algorithms for generating association rules have
    been proposed. Apriori algorithm is the most well-known association algorithm
    [160]. Application in SBs: Aztiria et al. [161] proposed system that learns the
    frequent patterns of human behavior using association, workflow mining, clustering,
    and classification techniques. The core part of the system is the learning layer
    which is made up of two modules: the language module, which provides a standard
    conceptualization of the patterns; and the algorithm module, which discovers the
    patterns. Kang et al. [162] proposed a service scenario generation scheme for
    interpreting association rules extracted from the states of all devices in SB
    environments. Typically, These states are collected periodically at a specific
    time interval from the devices. Nazerfard et al. [163] propose a framework to
    discover the temporal features of the activities, including the temporal sequencing
    of activities and their start time and duration using the temporal association
    rule techniques in a smart home. 3) Semi-Supervised Learning Semi-Supervised learning
    lies between supervised and unsupervised methods. Input data is a composite of
    labeled and unlabeled samples. These hybrid algorithms aim to inherit the strengths
    of the main categories while mitigating their weaknesses. The model learns the
    patterns present in the data and also make predictions. Example problems are classification
    and regression [164]. There are some common semi-supervised learning models, including
    generative models, heuristic approaches, semi-supervised SVM, graph-based methods,
    self-training, help-training, mixture models, co-training and multi-view learning
    [94]. Application in SBs: Cook [131] combined fully-supervised and semi-supervised
    learning to recognize and follow activities that support health monitoring and
    assistance context-aware services for people experiencing difficulties living
    individually at smart homes. Liu et al. [132] proposed a vision based semi-supervised
    learning approach for fall detection and recognizing other activity daily living
    in smart environments to overcome the labeling challenges of human activities
    by systematic interpreting the activities with the highest confidence. Fahmi et
    al. [133] proposed a semi-supervised fall detection approach in which a supervised
    algorithm utilizing decision trees in the training process and then profiles are
    used to implement a semi-supervised algorithm based on multiple thresholds. Radu
    et al. [134] present semi-supervised ML method using only the low power sensors
    on a smartphone to consider the problem of determining whether a user is indoors
    or outdoors. Guan et al. [135] propose a semi-supervised learning algorithm for
    activity recognition named En-Co-training to make use of the available unlabeled
    samples to enhance the performance of activity learning with a limited number
    of labeled samples. The proposed algorithm extends the co-training paradigm by
    using an ensemble method. 4) Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning is
    a learning approach to control a system in order to maximize performance measure
    that represents a long-term objective [165]. Reinforcement learning, an area of
    ML inspired by behaviorist psychology, is concerned with the way that software
    agents have to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the concept
    of cumulative reward. RL algorithms learn control policies, particularly when
    there is no a priori knowledge and there is a massive amount of training data.
    However, RL algorithms suffer from some drawback such as the high computational
    cost required to find the optimal solution, such that all states need to be visited
    to choose the optimal one. The well-known approaches of RL are Brute force, Monte
    Carlo methods, Temporal difference methods, and Value function [166]. Q-learning
    [167] is a model-free reinforcement learning approach based on learning the required
    utility given a state decision. Application in SBs: Mozer [136] applied Q-learning
    for lighting regulation to predict the time of turning the lights ON/OFF in a
    building. This prediction model can be utilized to schedule the lights’ activations
    in a building for efficient energy consumption proposes. Li and Jayaweera [137]
    proposed a Q-learning based approximate dynamic programming algorithm to provide
    a more efficient, flexible and adaptive method. This approach can enable customers
    to make an optimal on-line decision making in SB environment to maximize the profits
    based on both local fully observable and the estimated hidden information of the
    building. Khalili and Aghajan [138] proposed a temporal differential class of
    RL method for autonomous learning of a user’s preference of music and lighting
    service settings in presence of different states of the user in SB environment.
    The preferences are learned by the model by using the explicit or implicit feedback
    from users when they react to the provided service. Xu et al. [139] give a survey
    of developments in RL algorithms with function approximation. They evaluated and
    compared different RL algorithms using several benchmark learning, prediction,
    and learning control tasks. B. ML Tasks for SBS In this section, we will describe
    the major ML tasks that are relevant to SB. The reader is referred to Figure 8
    for a general depiction of ML tasks in SBs and the steps taken to implement ML
    in an SB environment. FIGURE 8. ML tasks in SB environment. Show All 1) Data Collection
    and Acquisition A variety of data collection approaches are used, each of which
    has different deals in terms of capabilities, energy efficiency, and connectivity.
    Sensors and similar objects in SBs produce raw data simultaneously in an automated
    way and such devices may store the data for a specific period of time or report
    it to controlled components [168]. Data can be collected at gateways; the collected
    data is then filtered and processed, fused into compact forms for efficient transmission.
    A variety of communication technologies such as Zigbee, Wi-Fi, and cellular are
    utilized to transfer data to collection points. Data collected from a global-scale
    deployment of smart things defines the basis for decision making and providing
    services. It is possible that the decisions are unreliable when the quality of
    utilized data is poor [169]. Zhao et al. [170] propose a data acquisition and
    transmission system which could be used for monitoring systems to collect energy
    consumption data (e.g., electricity, water, gas, heating, etc.) from terminal
    meters which are installed in buildings. The system stores the data periodically
    after analyzing and processing it and finally transmits the data to servers through
    the Ethernet. Rowley et al. [171] propose the data acquisition and modeling approaches
    that can support the delivery of building energy infrastructure in both new building
    and renovated real-world contexts. Such methods provide a means to achieve short,
    medium and long-term forecasting of possible scenario pathways to multi-objective
    sustainable outcomes. CLEEN MMEA [172] platform that collects, processes, and
    manages the data and initiates contextual knowledge extraction. The purpose is
    to establish an online marketplace to collect data and provide services for different
    companies. The interfaces are made public so that any company can easily join
    the network to buy or sell services. The analysis results can be given to an energy
    services company in order to allow offering the service to the owners. A typical
    example of open access data collection system is e3Portal [173] developed by VTT
    in collaboration with Finnish municipalities. e3Portal offers information and
    tools when planning savings measures and energy retrofitting in municipal buildings.
    It also involves frequently updated data regarding energy and water consumption
    in thousands of public buildings like schools, kindergartens, offices, hospitals,
    other health care facilities, etc. Decision makers, designers, operation and maintenance
    personnel, as well as buildings users, can utilize it. There are projects that
    provide publicly available SB datasets for researchers to conduct further studies;
    A list of “Home Datasets” [174] includes the datasets collected by projects from
    UC Berkeley, MIT, Washington State University, University of Amsterdam, University
    of Edinburgh, and the University of Tokyo. The WARD [175] project supported by
    NSF TRUST Center at UC Berkeley provides a benchmark dataset for human action
    recognition using a wearable motion sensor network. The dataset was collected
    from 13 repetitive actions by 13 male and 7 female participants between the ages
    of 19 and 75. An MIT project [176] collected daily live activities dataset from
    two single-person apartments within a period of two weeks. Eighty-four sensors
    to record opening-closing events were attached to different appliances and devices
    such as drawers, refrigerators, containers, etc. Banos et al. [177] introduced
    an open benchmark dataset collected from various inertial sensors attached to
    different parts of the body. They considered 33 fitness activities, recorded using
    9 inertial sensor units from 17 participants. The CASAS project [178] at Washington
    State University provides a publicly-available dataset for a three-bedroom apartment
    with one bathroom, a kitchen, and a living room. Different types of motion and
    digital sensors are installed to support temperature readings, in addition, the
    analog sensors are installed to support readings for hot water, cold water, and
    stove burner use [179]. The PlaceLab project [180] of MIT provides a dataset collected
    from a one-bedroom apartment with more than 900 sensors, including those coming
    from motion, switch and RFID sensors. That is being used to monitor activity in
    the environment in the context of a smart home [181]. A collection of smart meters
    data from five houses in the UK [182] That consists of 400 million instances.
    The active power is formed by different appliances and the whole-house power demand
    every 6 seconds. The major challenges that arise for data collection are scalability,
    privacy, security, and heterogeneity of resources [183]. Automated sensor data
    collection process collects a large amount of data that overwhelms the collection
    and analysis centers in comparison to the data collected from other sources such
    as IoT devices and social media. This leads to a huge number of small synchronous
    write operations to the database storage system, consequently, resulting in serious
    performance bottlenecks to the storage system design [184]. Because of the extensive
    use of RFID technology, privacy issues arise in data collection; for example,
    the RFID tags carried by a person may become a unique identifier for that person.
    Also, other security concerns appear, for example, the radio signals of RFID technology
    are easily jammed. Hence, that can disrupt the data collection process [185].
    The heterogeneity of data that is being collected from different resources is
    another major challenge, such that the data are usually very noisy, large-scale,
    and distributed. This makes it very difficult to use the collected data effectively
    without a clear description of existing data processing techniques [184]. 2) Data
    Preprocessing A large amount of data are generated by sensors in SBs; this data
    comes from various sources with diverse formats and structures. Usually, this
    data is not ready for analysis as it might be incomplete or redundant due to low
    battery power, poor calibration, exposure to various malicious elements and interference.
    Therefore, raw data typically needs to be preprocessed to deal with missing data,
    discard noisy and redundant data and integrate data from various sources into
    an integrated schema before being committed to storage. This preprocessing is
    called data cleaning. The quality of data can be improved substantially by applying
    some cleaning techniques to the data before it arrives its end user [168], [186].
    Data cleaning is one of the significant tasks in the data processing phase. Data
    cleaning is not a new process particular for the IoT data processing. It has already
    been applied as a process for database management systems. Presenting a data cleaning
    method would further aid the applications to focus on their core logic without
    worrying about data reliability post-processing overheads [184]. There are many
    different techniques that have been utilized to deal with the problem of cleaning
    noisy data streams such as Kalman filters [187], statistical models [186] and
    outlier detection models [184]. One of the major challenges with data cleaning
    techniques in the SBs is the heterogeneity of data collected from different sources
    particularly WSN- and RFID-enabled data streams. The utilized data cleaning techniques
    should be able to deal with several different variables of interest to satisfy
    IoT applications’ requirements, for example, setting home temperature based on
    observed outer temperature, user habits, energy management, etc. [169] Any type
    of failures such as a failed sensor, network issues, camera failure, or database
    crashes in the process of collecting data would invalidate the data. Consequently,
    this type of impediment will dramatically increase the time required to collect
    data [179]. 3) Dimensionality Reduction There are huge volumes of raw data that
    are captured from heterogeneous and ubiquitous of sensors used in SBs. Most of
    the data collected from those sensors are redundant and they need to be brought
    down to a smaller number of features by applying dimensionality reduction techniques
    without losing significant information [188]. The main idea from the dimensionality
    reduction strategy is to find a new coordinate system in which the input data
    can be represented with much fewer features without losing significant information.
    The dimensionality reduction can be made in two different ways: by extracting
    of the features that represent the significant data characteristics (this technique
    is called feature extraction), or by only selecting the most relevant features
    from the original dataset, this method is called feature selection [189], [190].
    Like clustering methods, the dimensionality reduction approach explores and exploits
    the internal structure of the data, but in this case in an unsupervised manner
    using less information. Most of these techniques can be utilized in classification
    and regression problems. Examples of some salient algorithms are [153]: Principal
    Component Analysis (PCA), Principal Component Regression (PCR), and Linear Discriminant
    Analysis (LDA). Chen et al. [191] propose a framework using the classification
    information of local geometry of data to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset
    on human activity recognition from wearable, object, and ambient sensors. a: Feature
    Extraction The main components of the original data are the features. After extracting
    the features from the raw dataset, such features contain important information
    that is used by the learning algorithms for the activities discrimination. The
    most common methods of feature extraction work in time, frequency, and discrete
    domains [192]. Among time domain method, mean and standard deviation are the key
    approaches for almost all sensor types. While the frequency domain method focuses
    on the periodic structure of the collected data. Wavelet Transformation and Fourier
    Transform are the most common approaches. And discrete domain methods such as
    Euclidean-based distances, dynamic time warping, and Levenshtein edit distance
    are key approaches implemented in several applications such to string similarity,
    classifying human activities and modeling human behavioral patterns [16], [193].
    b: Feature Selection The main role of feature selection is to discriminate the
    most related subset of features within a high dimensional vector of features,
    so that reduces the load of noise and computational expense on the learning models.
    In order to map the high dimensional vector of features into a lower dimensional
    vector, there are several common algorithms used such as Linear Discriminant Analysis
    (LDA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Independent Component Analysis
    (ICA) [194]. Hausmann and Ziekow [195] proposed an approach for automatically
    adapting the feature selection for SBs application ML models from the time-series
    data based on wrapper methods and genetic optimization. Fahad et al. [196] propose
    an activity recognition approach for overlapping activities using K-Nearest neighbors
    approach that distinguishes the most important features from the collected information
    obtained from deployed sensors in multiple locations and objects. Fang et al.
    [197] determine that the different feature sets generate different levels of accuracy
    for recognizing human activities, and selecting inappropriate datasets increases
    the level of computational complexity and decreases the level of prediction accuracy
    in smart home environments. The wrapper and filtering are the two main statistical
    methods of feature selection problem. It is argued that although the wrapper approach
    may obtain better performances, filters are less resource intensive and faster
    [198]. In [199], different feature selection methods are utilized for the process
    of dimensionality reduction of the learning problem to recognize the human activities
    from observed sensors. The authors show that the performance of the learning models
    to recognize the human activity has a strong relationship with the utilized features.
    c: Feature Projection feature projection can be represented as a mapping from
    the original set of features to an appropriate set that optimizes the learning
    criterion, such that the feature projection approach allows the process of visualizing
    and mapping the high-dimensional feature vectors to low dimensional one, in addition,
    it enables analyzing the distribution of the reduced feature vectors [200]. Consequently,
    the feature projection approach reduces the pattern recognition’s processing time
    and enables selecting the best-performed classifier for the reduced feature vectors.
    Hence, it makes real-time implementation possible [198]. Chu et al. [201] proposed
    a linear supervised feature projection that utilizes the LDA algorithm for EMG
    pattern recognition that attempted to recognize nine kinds of hand motion. C.
    ML Tools & Platforms for SBs There are a variety of existing ML platforms and
    tools to support the learning process. With the current increasing number of those
    kinds of toolkits, the task of selecting the right tool for processing big data
    streaming from various sources can still be difficult. Typically, there is no
    single toolkit that truly fits and provides solutions for all different problems.
    Many of the available toolkits might have overlapping uses, and each has advantages
    and disadvantages. Most of those toolkits might require experiences in the domains
    of programming languages and system architecture. In addition, usually many people
    lack a full understanding of the capabilities and how to use those available platforms
    [202]. The important factors that must be considered when selecting a specific
    ML tool are scalability, speed, coverage, usability, extensibility, and programming
    languages support. With respect to the scalability factor, the size and complexity
    of the data should be considered to determine if a specific toolkit will be fit.
    The processing platform that the library is running on and the complexity of the
    algorithm affect the speed factor. Not all the projects prioritize the speed factor;
    if the models require frequent updates, the speed may be a crucial concern; but
    not otherwise. Coverage represents the number of ML algorithms implemented in
    the tool. With the massive amount of data capturing from heterogeneous sources,
    ML community faces the challenges of how the ML model can efficiently process
    and learn from the big data. In general, the available big data tools do not implement
    all varieties of different classes of ML algorithms, and typically their coverage
    ranges from a few algorithms to around two dozen. The usability factor includes
    elements such as initial setup processing; continuous maintenance; the available
    programming languages and user interface available; the amount of documentation,
    or availability of a knowledgeable user. The extensibility factor means that the
    implementations introduced in the tools can be utilized as building blocks towards
    new systems. It is necessary to evaluate tools in terms of how well they are able
    to meet this factor. There are a variety of ML libraries that are available in
    different programming languages. Depending on the task you are trying to accomplish,
    certain languages, libraries, and tools can be more effective than others. The
    following provides a detailed observation of the strengths and weaknesses of the
    top used deep learning and ML tools. The reader is also referred to Table 6 for
    a concise tabulated summary of the described deep learning and ML tools. TABLE
    6 Comparison Between Deep Learning and ML Tools 1) H2O H20 [203] is an open-source

    was originally developed by the Google Brain team and was released in November
    2015 under an Apache 2.0 open source license. TensorFlow has tools that support
    deep learning, reinforcement learning, and other algorithms. TensorFlow implements
    data flow graphs, where “tensors” are batches of data that can be processed by
    a set of algorithms defined by a graph. The movements of the data through the
    system are called “flows”—hence, the name. TensorFlow can run on multiple CPUs
    and GPUs. It can run on Linux, Mac OS X desktop, and server systems, and Windows
    support on roadmap, as well as on Android and Apple’s iOS mobile computing platforms.
    TensorFlow is written with a Python API over a C/C++ engine that makes it run
    fast. TensorFlow utilizes a symbolic graph of vector operations method, in order
    to easily define a new network. However, TensorFlow has a weakness that is related
    to modeling flexibility. Such that each computational flow has to be constructed
    as a static graph. That makes some computations such as beam search difficult.
    4) Torch Torch [206] is an open source ML computing framework that supports a
    variety of ML algorithms. Torch was originally developed at NYU. It is efficient

    need to have real-time data analysis for stream data and waiting for the information
    to be archived and then analyzed is not practical for these type of applications.
    Generally, Stream processing is intended to analyze a massive amount of data and
    act on real-time streaming data utilizing continuous queries such as SQL-type
    queries to handle streaming data in real-time utilizing scalable, available and
    fault-tolerant architecture. Essential to stream processing is Streaming Analytics.
    More and more tools offer the possibility of real-time streaming data. The following
    presents some of the common and widely used options. 1) Apache Storm Storm [227]

    of sudden and continuous data (information collected in real-time by sensors,
    millions of comments generated on social networks such as Twitter, WhatsApp and
    Facebook, bank transfers etc.). Some of the specific applications of Storm include
    customer service management in real-time, operational dashboards, data monetization,
    cybersecurity analytics, and threat detection. 2) Apache Kafka Kafka [228] is
    a fast, scalable, fault-tolerant and durable open-source message broker project
    that originally developed by LinkedIn, and subsequently open sourced in early
    2011 and released by Apache Software Foundation on 23 October 2012. Kafka is written
    in Scala. It supports a variety of use case scenarios with a focus on high throughput,
    reliability, and scalability characteristics. For example, it can message sensor
    data from heating and cooling equipment in office buildings. 3) Oracle In 2013,
    Oracle started utilizing Oracle Enterprise Manager that includes Oracle Big Data
    Appliance to manage all of its big-data technologies. Oracle has also produced
    multiple low-latency technologies for Oracle Fast Data components includes Oracle
    Event Processing, Coherence, NoSQL, Business Analytics, and Real-Time Decisions.
    Oracle Event Processing provides solutions for building applications to filter,
    correlate and process events in real-time. It supports IoT services by delivering
    actionable insight on data streaming from a variety of data sources in real-time
    [229]. Oracle Stream Explorer (OSX) and Oracle R Enterprise (ORE) aim to support
    equipment monitoring applications for the systems that made of a variety of components
    through sensors, anomaly detection and failure prediction of such systems. ORE
    [230] is utilized to handle low-frequency streams in batch mode, while OSX handles

    management platform with self-learning that determines optimized recommendations
    and actions with messaging, imagery, products, and services within business processes.
    4) Amazon Kinesis Streams Amazon Kinesis [233] is a platform for collecting and
    processing large streams of data on AWS in real-time, AWS launched Kinesis in
    November of 2013, offering powerful services for loading and analyzing streaming
    data, in addition, it provides custom streaming data applications for specialized
    needs. Sometimes Terabytes of data per hour can be generated - that need to be
    collected, stored, and processed continuously from various application services
    such as web applications, mobile devices, wearables, industrial sensors etc. Typically,
    Amazon Kinesis Streams application can use the Amazon Kinesis Client Library and
    reads data from an Amazon Kinesis stream as data records. These applications can
    run on Amazon EC2 instances. 5) Apache Spark Streaming Apache Spark [234] is an
    open-source platform for real-time data processing, it can implement using four
    different languages: Scala, the syntax in which the platform is written; Python;
    R; and Java. Spark Streaming is an extension of core Spark API. It allows building
    fault-tolerant processing of real-time data streams. Spark Streaming allows the
    processing of millions of data among the clusters, and Spark SQL which makes it
    easier to exploit the data through the SQL language. Spark Streaming divides the
    live data stream into a predefined interval of batches, then handles each batch
    of data as Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). Then we can apply operations
    like map, reduce, join, window etc. to process these RDDs. The last results of
    these operations are then returned in batches. Spark Streaming can be utilized
    for a variety of application such as real-time monitoring and analyzing of application
    server logs. These logs messages are considered time series data. Examples of
    such type of data are sensor data, weather information, and clickstream data.
    This data can also be utilized for predicting future states based on historical
    data. Apache assures a computation speed that performs the operations quicker
    by 100 times than what is currently offered by Hadoop MapReduce in memory, and
    10 times better than in disc. Spark can be executed either in independent cluster
    mode or in the cloud on different frameworks such as Hadoop, Apache Mesos, and
    EC2. In addition, Spark can access numerous databases such as HDFS, Cassandra,
    HBase or S3, Amazon’s data warehouse. 6) Apache Flume Flume [242] is a distributed,
    reliable and open-source log data aggregation framework. Apache Flume is applied
    in many applications ranging from log data aggregation, to transport massive quantities
    of event data including network traffic data, social-media-generated data, email
    messages and pretty much any data source possible into the HDFS. The architecture
    of Flume is simple and flexible, it is also robust and fault tolerant with tunable
    reliability mechanisms for failover and recovery. log manufacturing operations
    is an example of Flume’s application. The a massive log file data can stream through
    Flume. The log file data can be stored in HDFS and analyzed by utilizing Apache
    Hive. 7) Apache Samoa SAMOA [243] is a distributed streaming ML framework that
    contains programming abstractions for distributed streaming ML algorithms. Its
    name stands for Scalable Advanced Massive Online Analysis and was originally developed
    at Yahoo! Labs in Barcelona in 2013 and has been part of the Apache incubator
    since late 2014. SAMOA is both a platform and a library. It enables the algorithm
    developer to reuse their code to run on different underlying execution engine.
    In addition, it supports plug-in modules to port SAMOA to different engines. By
    utilizing SAMOA, the ML algorithm developer does not need to worry about the complexity
    of underlying distributed stream processing engines. They can run it locally or
    utilizing one of stream processing engines, such as Storm, S4, or Samza. SAMOA
    provides the ML algorithms for a variety of tasks including classification, regression,
    clustering, along with boosting, and bagging for ensemble learning. Additionally,
    it offers a platform for the implementation of these ML algorithms, as well as
    a framework that enables the user to write their own distributed streaming algorithms.
    For example, there is CluStream for clustering, as well as Vertical Hoeffding
    Tree, which uses vertical parallelism on top of the decision tree, or Hoeffding
    tree for classification. There is also Adaptive Model Rules Regressor, which uses
    both vertical and horizontal parallelism implementations for regression [244].

    in Table 7. TABLE 7 Comparison Between Real-Time Data Analytics Tools TABLE 8
    Categorized Applications of SB SECTION V. Applications of Ml-Based Context-Aware
    Systems for SBs The potential uses of ML in an SB environment can be divided into
    four categories: detection, recognition, prediction, and optimization [79]. We
    discuss these categories separately next. In general, detection is the extraction
    of particular information from a larger stream of information. Many detection
    applications in SBs such as fire detection, leak detection, and anomaly detection
    [245]. Many different applications have been studied by researchers in activity
    recognition in SBs; examples include fitness tracking, health monitoring, fall
    detection. [246]. The goal of recognition is to classify an object or an event
    to a predefined category. It focuses on how to make computer programs perform
    intelligent and human-like tasks, such as the recognition of an object from an
    image. The goal of prediction is to determine the temporal relations’ model between
    specific events to predict what will happen in the near future. Prediction can
    be either for classification or regression problems [247]. Event prediction when
    the goal is to predict the most probable event or subsequent activity is an example
    of classification problems, while latency prediction when the output takes on
    continuous values is an example of the regression problem. The general steps of
    applying ML processes to predict an event in an SB environment is shown in Figure
    9. FIGURE 9. Steps involved in applying ML models in an SB environment. Show All
    The goal of optimization, on the other hand, is to maximize the long-term profits
    by making proper decisions in different situations. reinforcement learning can
    be utilized with these problems. Some optimization problems can be managed as
    prediction problems such that the profits for different actions are predicted
    and the action with the highest profit would be selected. Decision making is the
    most common case of the optimization problem. It takes to consider a variety of
    variables and solving deals between the profits of different locations of the
    environment [248]. Smart buildings are becoming increasingly supplied with a variety
    of sensors that measure different parameters, and data from these sensors is analyzed
    by ML algorithms and used for a range of services and applications for the activities
    of the building occupants. SBs go far beyond saving energy and contributing to
    sustainability goals. The application and services provided by the SBs can be
    both residential and commercial ranging from e-health, e-marketing, intelligent
    car parking system, intelligent transportation system, automation, and logistics
    services. Figure 10 shows the taxonomy of basic domains of SB services. Lighting
    services are associated with the well-being of occupants depending on their activities
    in SBs that have sensors to conserve energy when lights are not needed. The power
    and electrical system may have onsite renewable energy sources to provide a percentage
    of power consumption in SBs. Waste management is related to the activities and
    actions required to collect, separate, transport, together with monitoring and
    regulation of waste management system in SBs. The security is related to managing
    automated locks, biometric devices as well as video surveillance systems in SBs.
    The communications center is related to connecting sensors and actuators in the
    building as well as the operations control center. The operations control center
    supports system analytics and decision making for the operations. Visual interfaces
    provide a dashboard that shows the status of SB services and human operators to
    better manage the building resources. These interfaces also allow the occupants
    to set up their optimal parameters for comfort and productivity improvement on
    daily activities. HVAC stands for the humidity, ventilation and air conditioning
    system, intended for the convenience of occupants that have effective interaction
    with the environment. Parking services aim to minimize the area and volume required
    for parking cars. It could support car sharing, electric vehicles and a place
    for bicycles as well. Finally, the water management services aim to increase savings
    and manage water reclamation for flushing, landscaping and air-cooling systems.
    FIGURE 10. SB services taxonomy. Show All Based on our literature survey, we have
    identified that the application areas of SBs can be elderly care, comfort/entertainment,
    security/safety, energy management, and other projects. In the rest of the section,
    we will briefly describe the major domains in providing the following SB services:
    (1) care of the elderly population; (2) enhancing energy efficiency; (3) enhancing
    comfort or providing entertainment; (4) enhancing safety and security; and (5)
    miscellaneous projects. a: Elderly Population’s Home Care SB technology such as
    sensors, voice activation, GPS, Bluetooth, cellular connectivity via mobile phones,
    smartphone monitoring apps and sophisticated computers can be especially useful
    for elderly or disabled individuals who live independently. Elderly persons can
    take the advantages of such technologies (e.g., monitoring system, emergency system,
    dangerous kitchen appliance detection, fall detection), to maintain a safe and
    healthy lifestyle while living independently [56], [249]. Smart technology in
    the SBs aims to collect real-time information on human daily activity and then
    learn of their personal patterns. ML techniques have the potential for a very
    wide array of new innovations in healthcare that will be transformative for both
    providers and their patients. Whenever a deviation from the norm patterns is detected,
    SB systems send the alerts to family members and the caregivers in order for them
    to take urgent response action. By using big data analytics and ML algorithms
    it is possible to analyze large-scale data contained in electronic medical records—e.g.,
    to learn automatically how physicians treat patients including the drugs they
    prescribe [250]. Some prominent projects in this space are described next. Chernbumroong
    et al. [56] proposed an activity recognition and classification approach for detecting
    daily living activities of the elderly people applying SVM. They used wrist-worn
    multi-sensors namely accelerometer, temperature sensor and altimeter for detection
    basic five activities namely feeding, grooming, dressing, mobility, and stairs.
    And other instrumental activities such as washing dishes, ironing, sweeping and
    watching TV. Taleb et al. [251] proposed a middleware-level solution that integrates
    both the sensing and the monitoring services for assisting elders at smart homes
    environment. The appliances used in the proposed framework include RFID readers
    that cover of the whole building, sound sensors, video cameras, smart door lock,
    microphone and speakers for interaction with the system. CAALYX [252] is a European
    Commission-funded project that supports older people’s autonomy and self-confidence.
    The service is formed of three distinct subsystems including elderly monitoring
    subsystem, home monitoring subsystem and the caretaker’s monitoring subsystem.
    The system delivers a high priority message to an emergency service including
    the geographic position and clinical condition of the elder user. EasyLine+ [253]
    project funded by the European Commission to support elderly people with or without
    disabilities in carrying out a longer independent life at home. The system uses
    a neural network, assistive software, and a variety of sensors such as illumination
    sensor, temperature sensor, door sensors, and RFID giving the capacity of controlling
    the white goods. Hossain et al. [254] proposed a cloud-based cyber-physical multi-sensory
    smart home framework for elderly people that supports gesture-based appliance
    control. Suryadevara et al. [255] proposed a model for generating sensor activity
    pattern and predicting the behavior of an elderly person using household appliances.
    b: Energy Efficiency When temperatures rise or fall in various zones of your home,
    heaters, air conditioners, fans, and other devices will turn on or off (or increase
    or decrease in speed or temperature). In order to perform an efficient energy
    consumption of the supply systems, a significant step that is necessary by analyzing
    the way that current energy consuming system is using in buildings [256]. In the
    last decade, analysis of the energy efficiency in the smart spaces has received
    increasing attention. Various approaches for energy efficiency have been proposed
    utilizing predictive modeling based on profile, climate data, and building characteristics
    [32], [257]. For instance, lights throughout your home might turn on and off depending
    on the time of day. In the past, various attempts have been made to improve energy
    efficiency in the SBs through the use of smart metering and sensor networks at
    the residential level facilities. It is a fact that these types of infrastructure
    are becoming more widespread but due to their variety and size, they cannot be
    directly utilized to make conclusions that help to improve the energy efficiency.
    ML approaches will be the key to the handling of energy efficiency problem in
    SBs. Learning about the occupants’ consumption habits is capable of generating
    collaborative consumption predictions that help the occupant to consume better
    [258]. Some prominent projects in this space are described next. Reinisch et al.
    [259] developed an optimized application of AI system for SB environment. The
    system focuses on some capabilities like ubiquity, context awareness, conflict
    resolution, and self-learning features. The system operates on a knowledge base
    that stores all the information needed to fulfill the goals of energy efficiency
    and user comfort. Jahn et al. [260] proposed an energy efficiency features system
    built on top of a Hydra middleware framework [261]. The system provides both,
    stationary and mobile user interfaces for monitoring and controlling a smart environment.
    Pan et al. [262] proposed an IoT framework that uses smartphone platform and cloud-computing
    technologies to improve the energy efficiency in SBs. They built an experimental
    testbed for energy consumption data analysis. Fensel et al. [263] proposed the
    SESAME-S project (SEmantic SmArt Metering - Services for energy efficient houses).
    The project focuses on designing and evaluating the energy efficiency services
    to enable the end-consumers in making the right decisions and controlling their
    energy consumption. The system combines a variety of smart building components,
    such as smart meters, a variety of sensors, actuators, and simulators that can
    integrate virtual appliances such as the washing machine. Vastardis et al. [264]
    proposed a user-centric smart-home gateway system architecture to support home-automation,
    energy usage management, and smart-grid operations. The gateway is supported by
    ML classification algorithms component such as C4.5 and RIPPER that is able to
    extract behavioral patterns of the users and feed them back to the gateway. Irrigation
    systems monitoring and smart watering system that keep track of rain and soil
    conditions and irrigate appropriately are a very cost-effective way to reduce
    outdoor water consumption. Investment in water management software and services,
    water-efficient plumbing, and irrigation management delivers economic and sustainability
    benefits. Water conservation and management is an example of such benefits [265].
    c: Comfort/Entertainment One of the main goals of SB research is to facilitate
    user daily life activities by increasing their satisfaction and comfort level.
    SBs supports automated appliance control and assistive services to offer a better
    quality of life. They utilize context awareness techniques to optimize the occupant’s
    comfort based on predefined constraints of conditions in a building environment.
    Typical examples of comfort services include lighting, background music, automation
    of routine activities, advanced user interfaces based on voice or gestures, etc.
    [30]. Other services related to comfort services in SB environments are Indoor
    Climate Control and Intelligent Thermostat [265]. Indoor Climate Control: Measurement
    and control of temperature, lighting, CO2 fresh air. In the SB environment, HVAC
    systems play an essential role in forming indoor environmental quality. Typically,
    HVAC systems are produced not only to heat and cool the air but also to draw in
    and circulate outdoor air in large buildings [266]. Kabir et al. [267] present
    a context-aware application that provides the service according to a predefined
    preference of a user. They use the KNN classifier to infer the predefined service
    that will maximize the user’s comfort and safety while requiring minimum explicit
    interaction of the user with the environment. Ahn et al. [268] proposed a deep
    learning model that estimates periodically the atmospheric changes and predict
    the indoor air quality of the near future. d: Safety/Security As the SB technology
    progresses, the role of ML and deep learning in security and connected devices
    will increase. Deep learning will continue to help gain insights using big data
    that were previously inaccessible, particularly in image and video. Advanced technologies
    such as behavioral analysis and ML to detect, categorize, and block new threats
    will be beneficial. In a traditional home system, as soon as a fire is detected
    the Fire/smoke detectors are activated and start sending a fire alarm. However,
    SB can perform much better than the traditional system. It not only sends an alarm
    but also turns on the light only in the safest route and guides the occupants
    of the building out, as well as it will unlock the doors and windows for smoke
    ventilation, turn off all the devices and call the nearest fire service station.
    Other than this, it can take video of the areas surrounding the building, provide
    the status of window breakage alarms, and automatically lock all the doors and
    the windows when the last person of the house leaves [30]. The main services for
    security and safety in SBs are: Perimeter Access Control, Liquid Presence, Intelligent
    Fire Alarm, Intrusion Detection, and Motion Detection Systems [265]. Perimeter
    Access Control service provides control to restricted areas and detects non-authorized
    users that access the areas. Access card provides a variety of solutions that
    allow staff members, vendors or contractors to access specific areas at specific
    times you designate. The same access card can also be utilized to check employee
    attendance. In addition, there is widespread use of biometric technology including
    fingerprint, facial recognition, and iris scans [269]. Additionally, liquid presence
    detection technique has been utilized in data centers, warehouses, and sensitive
    building grounds to prevent breakdowns and corrosion in such areas [270]. Intelligent
    Fire Alarm and its corresponding safety systems are crucial parts of an intelligent
    building. It is a system with multi-function sensors (i.e., chemical gas sensors,
    integrated sensor systems, and computer vision systems) These sensors enable measuring
    smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) levels in the building. They also can give warnings,
    howling alarms, and tell with a human voice about the place and level of smoke
    and CO. In addition, they can give a message on a smartphone if the smoke or the
    CO alarm goes off [271]. Examples of intrusion detection systems including window
    and door opening detection and intrusion prevention [265]. An infrared motion
    sensor is utilized to detect the motion in a specific area in the building. This
    sensor can reliably send alerts to the alarm panel, with the system implementing
    algorithms for adaption to environmental disturbances and reducing any false alarms
    [265]. Image recognition solution can be used in security software to identify
    people, places, objects, and more. It can also be used to detect unusual patterns
    and activities. Clarifai [272] specializes in a field of ML known as “computer
    vision” that teaches computers to “see” images and video. Clarifai’s technology
    can play a key role in security surveillance and at present, the company works
    only with home security. Each image is processed on a pixel by pixel basis through
    convoluted neural networks. Bangali and Shaligram [273] proposed a home security
    system that monitors the home when the user is away from the place. The system
    is composed of two methods: one uses a web camera to detect the intruder—whenever
    there is a motion detected in front of the camera, a security alert in terms of
    sound and an email is delivered to the occupant. And the other one is based on
    GSM technology that sends SMS. A home security system that sends alert messages
    to the house owner and police station in case of illegal invasion at home is proposed
    in [274]. The system consists of different sensor nodes as the input components
    while the output components respond to the signal received from the input components.
    The sensor nodes consist of a thief alarm, presence detecting circuit, and the
    break-in camera. Zhao and Ye [275] proposed a wireless home security system that
    utilizes low cost, low power consumption, and GSM/GPRS. The system has a user
    interface and it can respond to alarm incidents. e: Miscellaneous Projects CASAS
    [178] is a project by Washington State University that provides a noninvasive
    assistive environment for dementia patients at SBs. The project focuses on three
    main areas for SBs: medical monitoring, green living, and general comfort. CASAS
    project comprises of three layers: physical layer, middleware layer, and software
    applications layer. Aware Home Research Initiative (AHRI) [276] is a project that
    has constructed by a group at the Georgia Institute of Technology for SB services
    in the fields of health and well-being, digital media and entertainment, and sustainability.
    AHRI utilizes a variety of sensors such as smart floor sensors, it also utilizes
    assistive robots for monitoring and helping the elderly. House_n [277] is a multi-disciplinary
    project leads by a group of researchers at the MIT. The main objective of the
    project is to facilitate the design of the smart home and its associated technologies,
    products, and services. The home is supplied with hundreds of various sensors
    that are installed almost in every part of the home that and being utilized to
    develop user interface applications that enable the users to control and monitor
    their environment, save resources, remain mentally and physically active, and
    stay healthy. The EasyLiving project [278] at Microsoft Research is concerned
    with the development of a prototype architecture and technologies to aggregate
    diverse devices into a coherent user experience for intelligent environments.
    The EasyLiving project was designed to provide context-aware computing services.
    The project utilizes a variety of sensors and cameras to track and recognize the
    human activities in the room by using the geometric model of a room and taking
    readings from sensors installed in the room. The Gator Tech Smart House project
    [279] is a programmable space specifically designed for the elderly and disabled
    developed by The University of Florida’s mobile and pervasive computing laboratory.
    The project’s goal is to create SB environments that can sense themselves and
    their residents. The project provides special cognitive services for the residents
    such as mobility, health, and other age-related impairments. A generic middleware
    is utilized to integrate system components in order to maintain a service definition
    for every sensor and actuator in the building. The components of the middleware
    including separate physical, sensor platform, service, knowledge, context management,
    and application layers [280]. Other well-known smart home projects include DOMUS
    [281] which is a research project, by the University of Sherbrooke in Canada,
    that supports mobile computing and cognitive assistance in smart buildings. The
    project aims to assist people suffering from Alzheimer’s type dementia, schizophrenia,
    cranial trauma, or intellectual deficiencies. Adaptive House project [136] at
    The University of Colorado has constructed a prototype system that is equipped
    with a variety of sensors that provide different environmental information including
    sound, motion, temperature, light levels. In addition, actuators that control
    the space and water heaters; lighting units, and ceiling fans. In Asia, there
    are also some other smart building projects have been developed, such as “Welfare
    Techno House” project, which is equipped with different sensors such as ECG, body
    weight, and other temperature measured indicators [282]. Ubiquitous Home project
    [283] is another smart building project in Japan, which utilizes RFID, PIR, pressure
    sensors, as well as cameras and microphones for monitoring elderly adults. Summary:
    Recently, several different context-aware and ML techniques have been utilized
    to support SB services. ML-based approaches are capable to perform better prediction
    and adaptation than others. The philosophy behind ML is to automate the learning
    process that enables algorithms to create analytical models with the support of
    available data. ML can be applied in different learning styles including supervised
    learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, as well as reinforcement
    learning when the learning is the result of the interaction between a model and
    the environment. The general uses of ML for SB services are detection, recognition,
    prediction, and optimization. In the section, we also talked about how to acquire
    the context from multiple distributed and heterogeneous sources and the techniques
    for modeling and processing such context to be used in the application services
    of SBs. We also talked about the most used tools and platforms ML and others for
    real-time data analytics by ML community to efficiently process and learn from
    big data. Without such ML tools, one would have to implement all of the techniques
    from scratch requiring expertise in the techniques and in efficient engineering
    practices. SECTION VI. Open Issues and Future Research Directions Research on
    SBs has made great strides in recent years, but a number of challenges remain.
    We present some major challenges related to SBs in this part of the work. These
    challenges will channelize the research directions for future SBs. A. Security
    and Privacy Wherever there is an interconnection of two systems or networks (wired
    or wireless), there are issues of security and privacy and the same is true in
    the case of SB. Security is an essential role in SB environments. Any SB application
    should ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data. Access control must be
    included in SB systems, for instance, the unauthorized users should not be able
    to disconnect the alarm system by connecting the pervasive system [284]. There
    is a massive amount of streaming that is collected from the various installed
    sensors and appliances, such data needs to be processed and stored. Hence, cloud
    computing services can be utilized for this purpose. However, with all of this
    data that is transmitted, the issue of losing the privacy increases. Therefore,
    different encryption techniques are needed to preserve personal privacy [285].
    There are specific challenges related to the user’s privacy including challenges
    related to the data privacy of personal information and the privacy of the individual’s
    physical location and tracking. That needs for privacy enhancement technologies
    and relevant protection laws and tools for identity management of users and objects
    [286]. The recent trend of ML research has focused on handling security and privacy
    issues in SB environments. There are different security-related services have
    utilized ML techniques, such as determining safe device behavior by detecting
    and blocking activities and potentially harmful behavior [287]. ML techniques
    have the potential to reduce security gap because of their capability to learn,
    identify and detect the users’ habits and behaviors. Consequently, it can detect
    the abnormal behaviors predicting risks and intrusions before they happen. For
    instance, ML models learn the routine of the users, such as the time they get
    home or go to sleep. These models can suggest rules based on those detected behaviors
    from all connected devices [288]. B. SBS and Context-Aware Computing In the SB
    environment, there exists a massive amount of raw data being continuously collected
    about the various human activities and behaviors. It is important to develop techniques
    that convert this raw data into valuable knowledge [289]. Context awareness and
    ML techniques are expected to provide great support to process and store big data
    and create important knowledge from all this data [290]. The process of data interpretation
    and knowledge extraction has the following challenges including addressing noisy
    real-world data and the ability to develop further inference techniques that do
    not have the limitations of traditional algorithms. Usually, It is very complex
    to formalize and model the contextual information related to human behaviors in
    a standard way due to the complex physiological, psychological and behavioral
    aspects of human beings [291]. The humans communicate through rich languages as
    well as gestures and expressions. Modern ubiquitous computer systems lack an automatic
    mechanism of inferring information as the humans do. New research is necessary
    to raise human activities and behaviors recognition to understand the complex
    dependencies between the apps and humans [292], [293]. The context-aware prompting
    systems have essential applications in SBs such as emergency notifications, medication
    prompting, heart rate monitoring, generation of agenda reminders, and weather
    alerts. However, issuing prompts for all detected errors can possibly be false
    positives, and consequently, lead to annoyance and sometimes prove to be unsafe
    for specific activities. ML methods can be used for an accurate and precise prediction
    when a person faces difficulty while doing daily life activities [294]. C. Personal
    Data Stream Management in SBS The data streaming management system is able to
    process and transfer raw data collected from a variety of sensors to information,
    it is also able to fuse this information to a feature and directly process features
    [295]. While the data processing for a single SB is simple, it is more complex
    when processing the data from multiple SBs, because there are different people
    that tend to share less common interests and have opposing interests concerning
    the processed data [296]. The simple sensors in an SB environment can detect different
    events related to temperature, motion, light, or weather. Moreover, other appliances
    like a television and a telephone can also send their status or other data as
    events. All this data from different sensors can be used by SB services to detect
    specific states and send a request to some actuators according to specific predefined
    rules, for instance, turn on the light if the television is used [297]. However,
    this approach is not generalizable in case of a group of people residing in the
    same building. Although it can work well for one certain person when personal
    preferences can be automatically learned for an individual person, therefore each
    of the residents has to define their own set of rules [298]. Because of the increasing
    number of sensors that produce data streams, the traditional analyzing and processing
    techniques of these data streams are mostly impractical now [299]. Despite the
    availability of new tools and systems for handling massive amounts of data continuously
    generating by a variety of sensors in SBs, however, the real promise of advanced
    data analytics to still lies beyond the realm of pure technology [296]. In [300]
    discuses research challenges for data streams of real-world applications. They
    analyze issues concerning privacy, timing, preprocessing, relational and event
    streams, model complexity and evaluation, availability of information, and problems
    related to legacy systems. D. Big Data Challenges in SBS Nowadays, a variety of
    sensing technology in the SBs can be utilized to collect a massive amount of heterogeneous
    data at a reasonable cost. Typically, hundreds of thousands of transactions can
    be generated by a single SB every day. The process of storing this data over the
    long-term is challenging [258]. We can imagine the challenges and opportunities
    that the companies or government will encounter in the future to manage incoming
    data from dozens of SBs. This new data could provide us with more contextual information
    that consequently leads to much better services to the occupants [301]. In the
    world of big data, despite the availability massive amount of data, however, it
    is not necessarily easy to obtain valuable information from this data utilizing
    the traditional approaches like trial and error to extract meaningful information
    from this data. Analyzing these massive amounts of data requires new technologies
    to store, organize, and process big data effectively, it needs high-performance
    processors that enable uncovering the insights in big data. It also requires flexible
    cloud computing services and virtualization techniques, as well as software such
    as Apache Hadoop and Spark [302]. It requires providing appropriate ML techniques
    which differ from the traditional approaches for effective and efficient solution
    of the above issues. For these reasons, researchers have recently started to think
    about the problems and opportunities resulting from the adoption of big data in
    SB environments [303], [304]. The information extracted from this big data has
    significant value and could greatly contribute in the future of SBs as assistive
    tools and for better services delivery. That is why it is necessary that the researchers
    start to analyze and think about the solutions for the current and future challenges
    of big data in SBs [305]. E. Interoperability Interoperability means that two
    (or more) systems work together unchanged even though they were not necessarily
    designed to work together. When equipment, devices or appliances having different
    communication and networking technologies can communicate effectively, interoperability
    is satisfied. It is a challenge to ensure that an SB that has various components
    will be intelligible. Typically, each of these components might have been produced
    by different vendors, each of which may have created under different design constraints
    and considerations [306]. Therefore it becomes essential to satisfy interoperability
    so that a number of heterogeneous communication and networking technologies could
    coexist in various parts of SBs. For example, an energy management system may
    use Wi-Fi and ZigBee for communication purposes. A lot of work can be done in
    this context [307]. F. Reliability We can expect that the reliability is one of
    the main concern of occupants and developers of SB systems. A variety of appliances
    and devices present in SB such as televisions, microwave, washing machines etc.
    are required exceedingly to be reliable. Achieving expected levels of reliability,
    especially when linked with communication technologies utilized with these devices
    that may be expected in SBs, is a great challenge. There are different reasons
    for these challenges differences in technological approaches, regulations, development
    culture, and the expectations of the market [306]. G. Integration The key to a
    successful SB implementation is integration: linking building systems such as
    lighting, power meters, water meters, pumps, heating, and chiller plants together
    using sensors and control systems, and then connecting the building automation
    system to enterprise systems. Integration allows executives to gain smart-building
    benefits, both in new construction and by gradually transforming existing buildings
    into SBs. What these SBs have in common is integration. Generally, the integration
    in SB systems brings a range of benefits from energy savings to productivity gains
    to sustainability. The SB systems can be attached to enterprise business systems
    to add another level of intelligence that enhances decision-making and improves
    building performance [2]. However, integrating multiple systems is very challenging
    as each individual system has its own assumptions, strategies to control the physical
    world, and semantics. As an example of integrating two systems in SB, assume a
    system that is responsible for energy management, and another system for health
    care are running concurrently. In this case, the integrated system should not
    turn off medical appliances to save energy while they are being used as suggested
    by the health care system [292]. As a future perspective for SBs, You will wake
    up to the sound of the alarm, at the same time the available sensors will be aware
    that you are waking up. The other sensors such as light sensors will automatically
    turn on the light in the building, while the thermostat will warm the area that
    you are about to use in the building. Your coffee will start to brew, you will
    also get a notification on your phone about the weather. The other sensors in
    the kitchen and refrigerator will remind you with a list of items that you will
    need to pick up on your way from your workplace to home to make dinner. When you
    leave your house, you can press a button from your phone to self-drive your car
    out of the garage. After that, the security system will start monitoring and controlling
    the home. Such the doors will automatically lock. Appliances will switch to an
    energy-saving mode. When the home sensors sense utilizing geofencing technology
    that you are way back home, it will get ready again for your arrival, the thermostat
    will warm things up, the garage door will open as you pull up, and your favorite
    music will start to play when you walk in [141]. Summary: Although the recent
    researches have been done in the SBs field, there is a need for a lot more efforts;
    however, we believe that SBs are possible for the mass market in the near future.
    The main challenges and future research directions of this eld can be summarized
    as follows: User context in term of behavior and intention should be studied and
    respected whenever possible; Further research is needed into context-aware prompting
    systems, personal data streaming and big data analysis of occupants in SB environment;
    Some of the other challenges like the interoperability, reliability, and integration
    still require more attention. SECTION VII. Conclusions The promise of smart buildings
    (SBs) is a world of appliances that anticipate your needs and do exactly what
    you want them to at the touch of a button. Since SBs and their inhabitants create
    voluminous amounts of streaming data, SB researchers are looking towards techniques
    from ML and big data analytics for managing, processing, and gaining insights
    from this big data. This paper reviewed the most important aspects of SBs with
    particular focus on what is being done and what are the issues that require further
    research in ML and data analytics domains. In this regards, we have presented
    a comprehensive survey of the research works that relate to the use of ML and
    big data particularly for building smart infrastructure and services. Although
    the recent advancements in technologies that make the concept of SBs feasible,
    there are still a variety of challenges that limit large-scale real-world systems
    in SBs field. Addressing these challenges soon will be a powerful driving force
    for advancements in both industrial and academic fields of SB research. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    \ their evaluation. The Water-Energy-\nFood nexus concept was formally introduced\
    \ in the Bonn 2011 Nexus Conference (Hoff \n2011) as an integrated system that\
    \ encapsulates the interdependencies between water, \nenergy and food (Conway\
    \ et al. 2015; Scanlon et al. 2017).\n * Danyang Gao \n \ndg442@exeter.ac.uk\n\

    \ to 1995–2014 \nin the high-emission scenario (IPCC 2021). The increased temperature\
    \ may lead to more \nfrequent extreme and compound events such as heatwaves and\
    \ long-term droughts, which \ncould significantly affect constrain food production\
    \ and energy generation. Climate change \nmay pose great uncertainties and risks\
    \ to water security, energy security and food security \nin the future. Therefore,\
    \ understanding climate change impacts on water, energy and food \nis crucial\
    \ for achieving the SDG6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG7 (affordable and clean\
    \ \nenergy) and SDG2 (zero hunger) (Liu et al. 2018; UN 2018).\nSignificant efforts\
    \ have been made to explore and evaluate the Water-Energy-Food \nnexus via various\
    \ approaches (de Amorim et al. 2018; D’Odorico et al. 2018; Endo et al. \n2020).\
    \ Mannan et al. (2018) identified the capabilities and hindrances of applying\
    \ the Life \nCycle assessment on Water-Energy-Food nexus. Zhang et al. (2018)\
    \ discussed the pros and \ncost of eight quantitative methods. Albrecht et al.\
    \ (2018) emphasised the importance of \nintegrating quantitative and qualitative\
    \ methods with social science in studies that incor-\nporate multiple methods.\
    \ Zhang et al. (2019a) categorised eleven existing nexus methods \nand tools into\
    \ three types according to research purposes. Namany et al. (2019) introduced\
    \ \nthree dynamic decision-making tools and proposed application examples during\
    \ three deci-\nsion-making process stages.\nHowever, none of those reviews has\
    \ analysed the methods and tools used for investigating \nclimate change impacts\
    \ to water, energy, and food. Several questions remain unanswered: \nWhat are\
    \ existing state-of-the-art analytical methods and tools for studying Water-Energy-\n\
    Food under climate change? Which ones are more widely used? What are their features\
    \ \nand limitations? What is the focus of related research on different spatial\
    \ scales and topics? \nHow should models be selected according to research topic\
    \ and spatial scale? How does the \nrelated research consider climate change scenarios?\
    \ What are future prospects?\nTo address these questions, we have reviewed and\
    \ analysed research articles published \nover the past seven years that investigated\
    \ climate change impacts on Water-Food, Water-\nEnergy and Water-Energy-Food nexus.\
    \ Promising methods frequently used in each type of \nstudy, topics and models\
    \ for different spatial scales, and climate change scenarios setting \nmethods\
    \ are identified and discussed. The research challenges and limitations are identi-\n\
    fied, suggesting potential directions for future research in the domain of Water-Energy-\n\
    Food interactions under climate change.\n2  Methods\nWe searched peer-reviewed\
    \ journal articles on the subject of climate change in the Web of \nScience database\
    \ that were published after 2017 and related to Water-Food, Water-Energy \nand\
    \ Water-Energy-Food. The article selection procedure followed Preferred Reporting\
    \ \nItems for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA, Page et al. 2021),\
    \ and the \nflow chart of the selection process is shown in Fig. 1.\n2.1  Review\
    \ Process\nIn Web of Science, we used ‘climate change’, ‘water’, ‘food’ and’irrigation’\
    \ as the key-\nwords to search the abstract, title and keywords of publications\
    \ between 2017 and 2022, \n1676 articles were found. By replacing the keywords\
    \ with ‘climate change’, ‘soil moisture’ \nand ‘crop yield’, 1155 articles were\
    \ selected; when searching keywords ‘climate change \n3\nA Systematic Review of Methods\

    \ were found; and 2415 articles were listed \nthrough keywords ‘climate change’,\
    \ ‘water’, ‘energy’ and ‘food’. Altogether, 10,974 arti-\ncles were selected after\
    \ the initial search.\n2.2  Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\nArticles that met\
    \ all the following criteria were selected: (1) they contain Water-Food, \nWater-Energy\
    \ or Water-Energy-Food, but do not consider water, energy or food separately;\
    \ \n(2) the consider climate change impacts; and (3) they use quantitative analytical\
    \ tools or \nmodels for assessment. Besides, eleven articles published in 2023\
    \ were added during the \nrevision of the paper.\nBased on these criteria, we\
    \ obtained 45 articles related to Water-Food and climate \nchange, identified\
    \ 64 articles studying climate change impacts on Water-Energy, and \nselected\
    \ 36 articles about climate change and Water-Energy-Food nexus. Thus, a total\
    \ of \n145 articles were identified as suitable.\n2.3  Information Extraction\n\
    After full-text reading of the 145 relevant articles, we extracted the following\
    \ information: \n(1) the purpose of the study (2) the scale of study area; (3)\
    \ methods used in the study area, \nbased on statistical methods, physics-based\
    \ modelling, supervised learning or operation \nFig. 1  Flow chart of articles\

    \ whether the article used models, combined multiple models or used a \nsingle\
    \ model; (5) whether the article claimed a new method; (6) whether there was a\
    \ simu-\nlation under future scenarios and how the scenarios were set up; and\
    \ (7) characteristics, \nmajor challenges and limitations in the application of\
    \ methods and models.\n3  Diversity of Nexus Methods\nNumerous and diverse methods\
    \ have been used or proposed for evaluating climate change \nimpacts on Water-Food,\
    \ Water-Energy and Water-Energy-Food nexus. while some studies have \ncombined\
    \ multiple methods. In this review, we divided the approaches into four categories:\
    \ Sta-\ntistical methods, Physics-based modelling, Supervised learning and Operation\
    \ optimisation.\nMethods based on statistics such as formula calculations, regression\
    \ and statistical tests \nwere grouped into Statistical methods; methods using\
    \ models based on the representa-\ntion of physical mechanisms were grouped into\
    \ Physics-based modelling; methods using \nmachine learning to do simulation were\
    \ classified into Supervised learning; and methods \nusing optimisation algorithm\
    \ to determine optimal solution under constraints were classi-\nfied into Operation\
    \ optimisation.\n3.1  Water‑Food Nexus Analysis Methods\nIn the Water-Food nexus\
    \ research, 53% of studies (24 of 45) used statistical methods, 64% \n(29 of 45)\
    \ used physics-based modelling methods and 9% (4 of 45) used operation optimi-\n\
    sation methods. We tabulate and categorise Water-Food analytical methods and tools\
    \ from \nthe selected 45 articles based on method categorisation and discipline\
    \ in Table 1.\nStudies investigating the influence of climate change on Water-Food\
    \ nexus mainly \nfocused on how climate change may impact water availability for\
    \ irrigation, soil moisture \nand crop yield. Most Water-Food studies utilised\
    \ multiple methods or coupled models from \ndifferent disciplines. The input data\
    \ of the models were commonly multidisciplinary from \nthe areas of meteorology\
    \ (precipitation, temperature, wind speed, humidity, solar radiation, \netc.),\
    \ environment  (CO2 concentration, etc.), geospatial (vegetation, landuse, etc.),\
    \ eco-\nnomics (GDP, etc.) and society (population, etc.).\nGenerally, in model\
    \ coupling studies, a hydrological model was used to simulate runoff \nor soil\
    \ moisture, and an agricultural model or a statistical calculation method was\
    \ used to \ncalculate irrigation water requirements and parameters related to\
    \ crop yields. For example, \nAkoko et al. (2020) used Soil & Water Assessment\
    \ Tool (SWAT) to estimate the current \nand future water resources availability\
    \ and Cropwat to calculate irrigation water require-\nments. Meanwhile, many interdisciplinary\
    \ models were developed to study the Water-Food \nnexus. Blanc et al. (2017) integrated\
    \ water resources model and a crop yield reduction mod-\nule into the Integrated\
    \ Global System Modelling framework (IGSM) to assess the influence \nof climate\
    \ and socioeconomic changes on irrigation water availability as well as subsequent\
    \ \nimpacts on crop yields by 2050. Malek et al. (2018) integrated a process-based\
    \ irrigation \nmodule into VICCropSyst to assess the influence of climate change\
    \ on irrigation losses.\nSome model-based studies only utilised a single discipline\
    \ model or a series of equa-\ntions. This kind of research mostly focused on soil\
    \ moisture, irrigation and crop parameters \nrather than simulations of water\
    \ availability. He et al. (2021) projected the amount of agri-\ncultural water\
    \ for food production during peak population period (2029–2033) based on a \n\
    series of equations including FAO’s Penman–Monteith equation. Jha et al. (2020)\

    \ Water-\nFood studies, in which more studies using nonlinear optimisation framework\
    \ (Mitchell \net al. 2017; Gohar and Cashman 2018). These studies optimised water\
    \ or food related strat-\negies under climate change conditions.\n3.2  Water‑Energy\
    \ Nexus Analysis Methods\nIn the Water-Energy nexus research, 33% of studies (21\
    \ of 64) used statistical methods, \n92% (59 of 64) used physics-based modelling\
    \ methods, 25% (16 of 64) used operation \noptimisation methods, and 9% (6 of\
    \ 64) used supervised learning methods. Most stud-\nies utilised models and hydrological\
    \ models accounted for a large part. The catalogue of \nWater-Energy analytical\
    \ methods and tools from the selected 64 articles are tabulated and \ncategorised\
    \ based on method categorization and discipline in Table 2.\nStudies analysing\
    \ climate change impacts on Water-Energy mainly focused on hydro-\npower. Hydropower\
    \ is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to its direct depend-\nence\
    \ on the timing and magnitude of streamflow. Most studies projected future hydropower\
    \ \ngeneration to evaluate how climate change will affect energy production, or\
    \ optimised the \nreservoir operation schemes to minimise the impacts of climate\
    \ change on streamflow. \nGenerally, hydrological models or supervised learning\
    \ were adopted to simulate and pro-\nject future streamflow/inflow to hydropower\
    \ reservoirs, then energy models or equations \nwere employed to calculate potential\
    \ hydropower generation, optimisation algorithms or \nwater management models\
    \ were employed to solve the optimal reservoir operation. For \nexample, Rahmati\
    \ et  al. (2021) simulated future runoff with Artificial Neural Network \n(ANN)\
    \ and optimised hydropower generation by Grasshopper Optimisation Algorithm \n\
    (GOA). Guo et al. (2021) used Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the robust optimisation\
    \ \nmodel with the inflows simulated by SWAT under climate and land use change\
    \ scenarios \nin the future. Anghileri et al. (2018) contributed a modelling framework\
    \ combining hydro-\nlogical modelling, hydropower modelling and multi-objective\
    \ optimisation technique to \nassess climate change and energy policies impacts\
    \ on the operations of hydropower reser-\nvoir systems in the Alps.\nMeanwhile,\
    \ a small number of studies used interdisciplinary models to study Water-\nEnergy\
    \ nexus. Miara et al. (2017) simulated river discharge and temperature as well\
    \ as \nelectricity generation under climate change using the coupled Water Balance\
    \ Model and \nThermoelectric Power and Thermal Pollution Model (WBM TP2M). Graham\
    \ et al. (2020) \nutilised Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) to investigate\

    \ 2021\n19\nA Systematic Review of Methods for Investigating Climate Change…\n\
    1 3\n3.3  Water‑Energy‑Food Nexus Analysis Methods\nThere are relatively fewer\
    \ selected studies about evaluating climate change impacts on \nWater-Energy-Food\
    \ nexus. In the selected research, 36% of studies (13 of 36) used sta-\ntistical\
    \ methods, 78% (28 of 36) used physics-based modelling methods, 36% (13 of 36)\
    \ \nused operation optimisation methods, and 6% (2 of 36) used supervised learning.\
    \ Most \nstudies evaluated climate change impacts on Water-Energy-Food through\
    \ physics-based \nmodelling, among them most utilised interdisciplinary models\
    \ with the proportion of 44%. \nBesides, many studies in Water-Energy-Food utilised\
    \ operation optimisation method. The \ncatalogue of Water-Energy-Food analytical\
    \ methods and tools from the selected 36 articles \nare tabulated and categorised\
    \ in Table 3.\nStudies investigating climate change impacts on Water-Energy-Food\
    \ nexus can be divided \ninto three categories: (1) simulations of future Water-Energy-Food\
    \ nexus change under future \nclimate change scenarios, (2) optimal management\
    \ options for mitigating future climate \nchange impacts, (3) historical attribution\
    \ or trend analysis of climate change impacts.\nFor future simulation research,\
    \ studies generally utilised interdisciplinary models or \ncoupled different models\
    \ from multiple disciplines. Sridhar et al. (2021) presented an inte-\ngrated\
    \ modelling framework combining Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) and System\
    \ \nDynamics (SD) model for analysing the impacts of future climate on irrigation,\
    \ hydro-\npower, and other supply and demand through a feedback loop. Yang et al.\
    \ (2018) adopted \na two-way coupled agent-based model (ABM-SWAT) to evaluate\
    \ the water availability for \nirrigation, hydropower generation, and riverine\
    \ ecosystem health under joint effect of cli-\nmate change and water infrastructure\
    \ development.\nOperation optimisation research mainly focused on addressing complex\
    \ contradictions \nof Water-Energy-Food nexus to find an optimal strategy and\
    \ aid sustainable development. \nOptimisation programming was used in this kind\
    \ of research, sometimes combining phys-\nics-based modelling, supervised learning\
    \ or statistical methods. Yuan et al. (2018) inte-\ngrated Life Cycle Assessment\
    \ (LCA) and linear programming to assess the feasibility of \nbioenergy and consider\
    \ future circumstances under climate change impacts. Giuliani et al. \n(2022)\
    \ combined HBV hydrological model, ANN and evolutionary multi-objective direct\
    \ \npolicy search method to demonstrate how local dynamics across Water-Energy-Food\
    \ sys-\ntems are impacted by climate change mitigation policies.\nResearch focused\
    \ on historical trend utilised statistical methods to analyse datasets. \nBarik\
    \ et al. (2017) investigated the Water-Energy-Food nexus in India under drought\
    \ and \nmonsoon rainfall in the last few decades based on GLDAS and GRACE data.\n\
    4  Studies for Different Spatial Scales\nAccording to spatial scale of study area,\
    \ these selected studies were categorised into large \nscale studies and small\
    \ to middle scale studies. The research objectives and typical models \nof each\
    \ scale and topic of research are summarised in Table 4. The selected studies\
    \ related \nto Water-Food and Water-Energy occupy a higher proportion, while research\
    \ on water-\nenergy-food is relatively less. This is because the research on this\
    \ topic involves more inter-\ndisciplinary science, so related research is not\
    \ easy to conduct. Besides there were fewer \nstudies of water-energy-food at\
    \ global and national scales than at regional scales, because \nthe larger the\
    \ study area, the more complex the water-energy-food nexus is, the access to \n\
    the required data also becomes more difficult.\n 20\nD. Gao et al.\n1 3\nTable\

    D. Gao et al.\n1 3\nWater-Energy-Food studies at the global scale focused on the\
    \ competition for water \nbetween energy and food. The interlinkages between water,\
    \ energy and food sectors were \nexplored more in small to middle scale studies.\
    \ Meanwhile, there were many more optimi-\nsations and policy scenarios in research\
    \ at the regional scale. The Water-Energy research \nat large scale mainly focused\
    \ on the impacts of river flow on potential hydropower produc-\ntion, while the\
    \ optimisation of hydropower system operation is also concerned at small-\nmiddle\
    \ scale research. The focuses of Water-Food research at large and small-middle\
    \ \nscale were similar, mainly investigating the water management and crop production\
    \ strate-\ngies. Local water, energy and food management strategies may not be\
    \ applicable to other \nregions, so the trade-off between water, energy and food\
    \ under climate change and the \nstrategies for sustainable development at a larger\
    \ scale still require continuous efforts from \nthe academic community.\nThe findings\
    \ on the global scale may inform future research at different scales. For \nWater-Energy\
    \ research, roughly 65% of the world’s current hydropower capacity will \nface\
    \ vulnerabilities due to alterations in the 1-in-100-year river flow pattern (Paltán\
    \ et al. \n2021), the most prominent encompassing Europe, northern Africa, the\
    \ Middle East, and \nNorth America (Turner et al. 2017; Paltán et al. 2021). Pursuing\
    \ a 1.5 °C warming target \nwould mitigate these risks when contrasted with a\
    \ 2.0 °C scenario (Paltán et al. 2021). For \nWater-Food research, a projected\
    \ food deficit might occur prior to 2050 in the scenario \nof the worst-case climate\
    \ change, significant water shortages stemming from irrigation in \nmajor food-producing\
    \ nations will hinder these countries from satisfying their domestic \nfood needs\
    \ (Grafton et al. 2017). An expansion of irrigated land by 100 Mha would be \n\
    necessary to double food production to meet the projected global food demands\
    \ by 2050, \nand an additional 10% to 20% of trade flow will be required, directing\
    \ water-abundant \nregions toward water-scarce regions, to maintain environmental\
    \ flow requirements (Pastor \net al. 2019). Expanding irrigation will lead to\
    \ increased maize production in Europe, but \nthe same cannot be said for rice\
    \ production in East Asia (Okada et al. 2018). In a scenario \nof 3 °C warming,\
    \ a \"soft-path\" approach with small water storage and deficit irrigation \n\
    can extend irrigated land by 70 Mha and feed additional 300 million people worldwide,\
    \ \na \"hard-path\" with substantial annual water storage has the potential to\
    \ expand irrigation \nup to 350 Mha and feed 1.4 billion more people (Rosa et al.\
    \ 2020). The regions that heav-\nily rely on snowmelt as an agricultural water\
    \ resource are high-mountain regions like the \nTibetan Plateau, Central Asia,\
    \ western Russia, the western United States, and the southern  \nAndes (Qin et \
    \ al. 2020b). For Water-Energy-Food research, water scarcity reductions \ndriven\
    \ by human is likely to result in 44% of land area in the world by the end of\
    \ twenty-\nfirst century in certain socioeconomic scenarios (Graham et al. 2020).\
    \ An additional 1.7 \nbillion people could potentially experience severe water\
    \ shortages for electricity, industrial \nuse, and household needs if priority\
    \ becomes for food production and maintaining environ-\nmental flow (de Vos et al.\
    \ 2021).\n4.1  Models for Medium to Small Spatial Scale\nWatershed hydrological\
    \ models can be categorised into three types: (1) conceptual mod-\nels, (2) physics-based\
    \ models, and (3) data driven models. Conceptual hydrological models \nare based\
    \ on physical basis but are in highly simplified forms, they also have the charac-\n\
    teristics of statistical regression models (e.g., HBV and Xinanjiang model). The\
    \ biggest \nlimitation is that they treat the watershed as a whole, ignoring the\
    \ heterogeneity of spa-\ntially distributed watershed characteristic parameters\
    \ (Devia et  al.  2015). Physics-based \n29\nA Systematic Review of Methods for Investigating\
    \ Climate Change…\n1 3\nmodels adopt spatially varied parameters to reflect the\
    \ physical mechanism of hydrologi-\ncal process influenced by multiple factors\
    \ (e.g., SWAT and HEC-HMS). The data-driven \nmodels establish statistical relationships\
    \ between input and output. They work well at the \ndata range, but the simulation\
    \ performance degrades when applied to epitaxial projection \nbecause of the lack\
    \ of physical basis. Over the past decade, a cutting-edge machine learn-\ning\
    \ methodology, named deep learning, has evolved from the traditional neural network\
    \ \nand has outperformed traditional models with considerable improvement in performance\
    \ \n(Yuan et al. 2020). However, deep learning cannot completely replace the physics-based\
    \ \nmodels, and the combination of physics-based models and deep learning may\
    \ open a prom-\nising door (Yuan et al. 2020).\nWater management models aim to\
    \ optimise water allocation to fulfil the demands from \nmultiple sectors. Many\
    \ selected studies established optimisation frameworks for planning \nand management\
    \ of water resources. There were some studies employing existing water \nmanagement\
    \ models directly, among which WEAP and HEC-ResSim were most used. \nCrop models\
    \ are used to simulate crop growth, DSSAT and CropSyst are typical and most \n\
    common used crop models in selected studies. TIMES and LEAP were relatively fre-\n\
    quently employed in investigating climate change impacts on water and energy.\
    \ Interdisci-\nplinary models like ABM, SD model and WEF Nexus Tool 2.0 were utilised\
    \ in the Water-\nEnergy-Food nexus studies.\n4.2  Models for Large Spatial Scale\n\
    Global hydrological models consider more land surface processes like recycling\
    \ of evapo-\ntranspiration. The approach integrates knowledge from multiple disciplines\
    \ encompassing \natmospheric sciences, geography, ecology, oceanography, soil\
    \ science, global change sci-\nence, etc. All global hydrological models run in\
    \ a grid format (Sood and Smakhtin 2015). \nTypical global-scale hydrological\
    \ models used in selected studies include WBM, VIC, \nWaterGAP and LPJmL. Different\
    \ models have different emphases and characteristics. For \nexample, WaterGAP\
    \ model is more detailed in water demand simulation including water \nuse for\
    \ domestic, industry, thermal power production, livestock and irrigation (Döll\
    \ et al. \n2003). LPJmL model puts more emphasis on vegetation and crop simulations\
    \ (Bondeau \net al. 2007). High degree of uncertainty and rough resolution are\
    \ main limitations of global \nhydrological models (Sood and Smakhtin 2015).\n\
    In selected global-scale studies investigating climate change impacts on Water-Food,\
    \ \nGCWM and GFWS were utilised. GCWM mainly focuses on blue and green consump-\n\
    tive water use as well as virtual water of 23 specific crops (Siebert and Döll\
    \ 2010). GFWS \nputs more attention on global food and irrigated water availability\
    \ risks through simulation \nof food generation and demand, water supply and agricultural\
    \ water requirement (Grafton \net al. 2015).\nIntegrated Assessment Models (IAMs)\
    \ are important tools to evaluate human feedback \nand impacts on climate change\
    \ and mitigation of greenhouse gases (Schwanitz 2013). The \nIGSM framework consists\
    \ primarily of two interacting components (Sokolov et al. 2018): \nthe Economic\
    \ Projection and Policy Analysis model and the Earth System model. GCAM \nlinks\
    \ water, energy, landuse, earth systems and economics to analyse consequences\
    \ of pol-\nicy strategies and interdependencies. IMAGE simulates interactions\
    \ between biosphere, \nsociety and the climate system to assess environmental\
    \ and sustainable development issues. \nDelimitation of the system, explanatory\
    \ power of models, as well as linkage of model eval-\nuation and usefulness are\
    \ the main challenges for IAMs (Schwanitz 2013).\n 30\nD. Gao et al.\n1 3\n5 \
    \ Future Climate Scenarios Setting Methods\nMost selected research assessed and\
    \ projected future water, energy and food systems based on \nfuture climate change\
    \ models. The emission scenarios, climate models, downscaling methods \nand global\
    \ warming scenarios in selected articles are summarised and introduced below.\n\
    5.1  Emissions Scenarios\nFor climate change impacts assessment, the Intergovernmental\
    \ Panel on Climate Change \n(IPCC) has published Assessment Reports (AR) on climate\
    \ change based on greenhouse \ngas emissions scenarios. Future climate projections\
    \ in the IPCC Fourth Assessment \nReport (AR4, IPCC 2007) were based on Special\
    \ Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES, \nIPCC  2000) and simulations of the third\
    \ phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison \nProject (CMIP3, Meehl et al. 2005).\
    \ SRES was superseded by Representative Concentra-\ntion Pathways (RCPs) in the\
    \ IPCC fifth assessment report (AR5, IPCC 2014) based on the \nCMIP5 (Taylor et al.\
    \ 2012).\nThe IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6, IPCC 2021) assessed the future\
    \ climate out-\ncomes based on the combination of socio-economic (SSP1-SSP5) and\
    \ future radiative forc-\ning scenarios (1.9 to 8.5 W/m2), which called Shared\
    \ Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). \nThe latest SSPs can quantitatively describe\
    \ the relationship between socioeconomic devel-\nopment and global climate change\
    \ to reflect the climate change challenges that society will \nface in the future\
    \ (Eyring et al. 2016). Basically, some older studies (generally in 2017 and \n\
    2018) used SRES of CIMIP3 models. Most selected studies utilised RCPs of CMIP5\
    \ mod-\nels. Some post-2020 studies were starting to use SSPs from CMIP6.\n5.2\
    \  Climate Models and Downscaling Methods\nGlobal climate model (GCM) is capable\
    \ and useful for projecting future climate (Overland \net al. 2011). Many research\
    \ institutions have developed GCMs based on their own experiment \nassumptions\
    \ and mathematical representations of physical climate system.\nStudies at global\
    \ scale in this review inputted GCMs directly into global models to pro-\nject\
    \ climate change impacts (Turner et al. 2017; Pastor et al. 2019). However, GCMs\
    \ are \ngenerally insufficient to provide useful climate predictions on the local\
    \ to regional scales \nbecause of relatively coarse resolution and significant\
    \ uncertainties in the modelling pro-\ncess (Allen and Ingram 2002; Dibike and\
    \ Coulibaly  2005). When the climate change \nimpacts studies are carried out\
    \ at local and regional scales, downscaling methods have \nbeen developed to overcome\
    \ the mismatch of spatial resolution between GCMs and models \n(Hwang and Graham\
    \ 2013).\nDownscaling techniques are categorised by two approaches (Hwang and\
    \ Graham 2013):\n1. Statistical downscaling using the empirical relationship between\
    \ GCMs simulated fea-\ntures at the grid scale and surface observations at the\
    \ sub-grid scale. For example, Bias-\nCorrection Spatial Disaggregation (BCSD,\
    \ e.g., Zhao et al. 2022) and the Statistical \nDownscaling Model (SDSM, e.g.,\
    \ Goodarzi et al. 2020) were employed to downscale \nGCMs in the selected studies.\n\
    2. Dynamic downscaling using regional climate models (RCMs) based on physical\
    \ rela-\ntions between the climate parameters at large and smaller scale.\n31\n\
    A Systematic Review of Methods for Investigating Climate Change…\n1 3\nMost selected\
    \ articles using dynamic downscaling method generally applied results from \n\
    the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX). CORDEX was \n\
    to create an enhanced modelling framework for generating climate projections at\
    \ regional \nscales, enabling impact assessments and adaptation studies globally\
    \ within the IPCC AR5 \n(Giorgi et al. 2022).\n5.3  Global Warming Scenarios\n\
    The Paris Agreement (UNFCCC 2015) aims to keep global mean surface air temperature\
    \ \nincreasing below 2℃ relatives to pre-industrial levels and targets to limit\
    \ it to 1.5℃. Some \narticles simulated future Water-Food or Water-Energy under\
    \ global warming 1.5℃, 2℃, \n3℃ or 4℃ (Donk et al. 2018; Sylla et al. 2018; Meng\
    \ et al. 2020; Qin et al. 2020b; Rosa \net al. 2020; Zhao et al. 2021b). These\
    \ studies utilised two approaches (James et al. 2017) to  \nassess the regional\
    \ implications of different degrees of warming: (1) time sampling; (2) \npattern\
    \ scaling.\nIn time sampling approach, the global warming scenarios are derived\
    \ by extracting a \nperiod of time (usually 30 years) when the driving climate\
    \ model projects an increase of \nspecified degrees (e.g., 1.5℃ and 2℃) of warming\
    \ compared to the pre-industrial level \n(Sylla et al. 2018).\nPattern scaling\
    \ assumes the relationship between global mean temperature and local \nchange\
    \ is linear (Huntingford and Cox 2000; Mitchell 2003; James et al. 2017). These\
    \ pat-\nterns can scale changes in global mean annual temperature to local and\
    \ seasonal changes \nfor climate variables by linear regressions (Qin et al. 2020b).\n\
    6  Directions of Future Research and Prospects\nFuture challenges in climate change\
    \ and nexus research are identified from five aspects: \n(1) scale and resolution\
    \ of study area; (2) internal physical mechanism; (3) extreme climate \nevents;\
    \ (4) potential competition between sectors; (5) data and model uncertainty.\n\
    6.1  Scale and Resolution of Study Area\nMost selected studies related to climate\
    \ change impacts on Water-Food generally focused \non watershed, regional and\
    \ national scale, the analyses not only focused on temporal differ-\nences but\
    \ also spatial difference according to different geographical resolution. In contrast,\
    \ \nstudies investigating climate change impacts on Water-Energy mainly analysed\
    \ hydro-\npower, therefore, results were generally shown within hydropower plants,\
    \ dams and res-\nervoirs without spatial difference. Evaluation studies of climate\
    \ change impacts on Water-\nEnergy-Food nexus mainly focused on basin and regional\
    \ scale, the analysis put water, \nenergy, and food into a whole system, but the\
    \ spatial resolution was often ignored.\nIt is of great significance for local\
    \ sustainability management and decision-making to \nstudy climate change impacts\
    \ on Water-Energy-Food on basin and regional scale, but the \nresults may be limited\
    \ by the boundaries of the study area. For example, the simulated \nstreamflow\
    \ at the outlet of the study basin is not necessarily the amount of water available\
    \ \nin the basin because the water demands in the downstream regions should be\
    \ considered. \nThe absence of water, energy and food scheduling with other regions\
    \ may have effects on \n 32\nD. Gao et al.\n1 3\ninaccurate supply and demand\
    \ simulations, further resulting in inaccurate management \nstrategies. The water\
    \ transport routes of water resources are sometimes cross-watershed. \nFor example,\
    \ reservoirs or weirs provide for agriculture, industry, or domestic use through\
    \ \ntheir own pipeline systems. With the impact of climate change, economic globalization\
    \ and \nother strong human activities, local Water-Energy-Food nexus is bound\
    \ to be influenced by \nglobal hydrological cycle and non-local human activities.\
    \ It requires scholars to understand \nlocal nexus relationships from a large-scale\
    \ perspective.\nMeanwhile, considering climate change has obvious spatial differences,\
    \ and the \nresponse speed of different regions to climate change is also different,\
    \ the climate change \nimpacts study on Water-Energy-Food nexus with geographical\
    \ resolution can show spatial \ndifference of water, energy, food change due to\
    \ climate change and provide a better refer-\nence for sustainability management.\n\
    6.2  Internal Physical Mechanisms in Modelling\nMost of the studies about evaluating\
    \ climate change impacts on Water-Food and Water-\nEnergy considered hydrological\
    \ processes based on physical mechanisms. Research on \nWater-Energy-Food and\
    \ climate change impacts consisted of interdisciplinary and transdis-\nciplinary\
    \ analysis, while the complexity of the system leads to the simplification of\
    \ many \nphysical mechanisms. Many mathematical or data-driven models were used\
    \ for inves-\ntigating climate change impacts on Water-Energy-Food, but the lack\
    \ of internal physical \nmechanisms cannot well explain the interactive process\
    \ between water, energy and food to \nclimate change.\nFuture research needs to\
    \ understand the interlinkages and internal physical mechanisms \nof the nexus\
    \ sectors and climate change. Meanwhile, science and policy should be inte-\n\
    grated to reveal the dynamics of natural processes along with social processes.\n\
    6.3  Novel Artificial Intelligence Models\nMany selected studies employed Artificial\
    \ Intelligence (AI) in simulation and operation \noptimisation. Feedforward and\
    \ feedback neural networks were used for simulation. Most \nselected studies used\
    \ programming and meta-heuristic algorithms, and a small number \nused reinforcement\
    \ learning for operation optimisation. In recent years, with the rapid \ndevelopment\
    \ of AI, many novel AI models have been proposed repeatedly. These AI mod-\nels\
    \ will provide a feasible direction for these complex interdisciplinary sciences.\
    \ For exam-\nple, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) was developed by combining\
    \ traditional reinforce-\nment learning with deep learning, and it is capable\
    \ of handling high-dimensional states and \nactions (Mnih et al. 2015). DRL has\
    \ been applied for optimal hydropower reservoir opera-\ntion (Xu et al. 2020),\
    \ irrigation optimisation (Alibabaei et al. 2022) and water-energy-food \nnexus\
    \ security assessment (Raya-Tapia et al. 2023). The application of DRL on complex\
    \ \nwater-energy-food system under climate change is still to be investigated.\n\
    6.4  Extreme Climate Events\nMost projections of future nexus were generally based\
    \ on temporal continuous climate \nchange scenarios, only few reviewed studies\
    \ have considered extreme weather events. \n33\nA Systematic Review of Methods\
    \ for Investigating Climate Change…\n1 3\nClimate change will increase the intensity,\
    \ frequency and spatial extent of extreme cli-\nmate events (Hasegawa et al. 2021)\
    \ and compound hazards (Zscheischler et al. 2018). \nMore frequent and extreme\
    \ events will cause disruptions in the management of water, \nenergy, and food\
    \ (Núñez-López et al. 2022). For example, relative to moderate-level \nclimate\
    \ change, an additional 20–36% population may face hunger under a 1-in-100 yr\
    \ \nextreme climate event under RCP8.5 (Hasegawa et  al. 2021). Compound hazards\
    \ \nwill cause devastating impacts at a scale far beyond any single disaster in\
    \ isolation \n(Zscheischler et al. 2018). For example, increasing compound drought–heatwave\
    \ risks \nmay affect 90% of the global population and gross domestic product in\
    \ the future (Yin \net al. 2023). Considering the water, energy and food relationship\
    \ under extreme climate \nevents in any future studies has an important role in\
    \ developing strategies to ensure \nwater, energy and food security.\n6.5  Potential\
    \ Competition Between Sectors\nPrevious studies related to climate change impacts\
    \ on Water-Food and Water-Energy did \nnot consider competition between subsystems\
    \ because there was no/limited competi-\ntion between two sectors in early days.\
    \ When considering three sectors together, com-\npetition arises. Competition\
    \ for water between food and energy sectors is an important \npart of the Water-Energy-Food\
    \ nexus (Qin 2021). The competitive relationship is not \nconducive to the sustainable\
    \ development. For example, the average total production \nwater footprint in\
    \ 31 provinces of the Chinese Mainland in the Industry Competition \nUnsustainability\
    \ scenario reached 4.08  m3/kg in 2016 (Hua et al. 2022). Considering the \neconomic\
    \ and social situation, energy production is more profitable than food, so water\
    \ \nflows easily into the energy sector. Especially in the context of climate\
    \ change, water \navailability is greatly affected. How to ensure food and energy\
    \ security within limited \nwater resources context should be considered in any\
    \ future studies.\n6.6  Data and Model Uncertainty\nIn the evaluation of climate\
    \ change impacts on Water-Energy-Food, numerous data from \nmultiple disciplines\
    \ including meteorology, agriculture, environment, hydrology, eco-\nnomics, society\
    \ are needed. The use of different data sets, mismatch of data resolu-\ntion,\
    \ the varying quality and availability of data (Perrone et al. 2011), and assumptions\
    \ \nand simplifications introduced to deal with data scarcity could lead to very\
    \ different \nresults. High uncertainty may be caused to exert negative impacts\
    \ on the nexus analysis \nand even misrepresent the interactions among nexus sectors\
    \ (Zhang et al. 2018). What \nis more, models and analysis tools also introduce\
    \ uncertainty. Downscaling of future \nmeteorological data, numerous parameters\
    \ in modelling, limited understanding of nexus \nprocesses, the intrinsic indeterminism\
    \ of complex dynamic systems, and myriad future \nscenarios will bring uncertainty\
    \ into final results, making it difficult to identify an opti-\nmal policy choice\
    \ (Gallopín et al. 2001; Antón et al. 2013; Yung et al. 2019).\nEndeavours should\
    \ be made in future studies to identify, analyse and reduce uncer-\ntainty in\
    \ data use and modelling for nexus research to increase the reliability of projec-\n\
    tion results and build capacity for decision-making in the context of uncertainty.\n\
    \ 34\nD. Gao et al.\n1 3\n7  Conclusions\nThis paper provides a systematic review\
    \ on the analytical approaches in the evaluation of \nclimate change impacts on\
    \ Water-Food, Water-Energy and Water-Energy-Food. The key \nfindings are summarised\
    \ as below:\n1. Analytical methodologies used in selected research can be classified\
    \ into four catego-\nries: Statistical methods, Physics-based modelling, Supervised\
    \ learning and Operation \noptimisation. Catalogues of methods used in the evaluation\
    \ of climate change impacts \non Water-Food, Water-Energy and Water-Energy-Food\
    \ are listed respectively based on \nthe classification (see Tables 1, 2 and 3).\
    \ Such catalogues are helpful to clearly show \npopular and promising methods\
    \ in selected studies.\n2. The focus of research on different topics at different\
    \ scales are discussed. Large scale \nand medium-small scale models are introduced\
    \ in terms of their characteristics, limita-\ntions, providing references for\
    \ selection of models and issues to consider when using \nthe models. Some models\
    \ are applicable for different scales but there is no single model \nsuitable\
    \ for all scales. The classification and discussion of topics and models is help-\n\
    ful to provide guidance on appropriate model selection by considering research\
    \ scales, \nobjectives and themes (Water-Food, Water-Energy and Water-Energy-Food).\n\
    3. Future climate scenarios setting including emission scenarios, climate models,\
    \ down-\nscaling methods and global warming scenarios are summarised. Climate\
    \ scenarios are \nimportant for simulating interactions between water, energy\
    \ and food under various \nfuture climate change conditions, as well as exploring\
    \ the effectiveness of mitigation \nmeasures or policies. The study has provided\
    \ references for the setting of climate sce-\nnarios and processing of future\
    \ meteorological data in future research.\n4. Despite significant efforts were\
    \ made in investigating climate change impacts on Water-\nEnergy-Food, limitations\
    \ of current research still exist, and the challenges for future \nstudy are discussed.\
    \ Current studies do not adequately address the uncertainties gener-\nated by\
    \ data and models. Research about extreme climate events and potential compe-\n\
    tition in nexus systems is not sufficient. Efforts can be made in the internal\
    \ physical \nmechanisms analysis, application of novel artificial intelligence\
    \ models and spatial \ndifferences analysis of nexus issues.\nAcknowledgements\

    all metrics Abstract Information-centric sensor networks (ICSNs) are a paradigm
    of wireless sensor networks that focus on delivering information from the network
    based on user requirements, rather than serving as a point-to-point data communication
    network. Introducing learning in such networks can help to dynamically identify
    good data delivery paths by correlating past actions and results, make intelligent
    adaptations to improve the network lifetime, and also improve the quality of information
    delivered by the network to the user. However, there are several factors and limitations
    that must be considered while choosing a learning strategy. In this paper, we
    identify some of these factors and explore various learning techniques that have
    been applied to sensor networks and other applications with similar requirements
    in the past. We provide our recommendation on the learning strategy based on how
    well it complements the needs of ICSNs, while keeping in mind the cost, computation,
    and operational overhead limitations. Similar content being viewed by others Sensor

    © 2022 1 Introduction Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have evolved from simple
    sensing and tracking applications to being an integral and essential part of the
    Internet of things paradigm. This means that sensor networks have to deal with
    large amounts of data, support requests from multiple users, and support information
    extraction from the network rather than serving as point-to-point communication
    networks that transmit data from a source to sink. To enable WSNs to easily integrate
    with, and adapt to the IoT environment [1], we propose the use of learning, as
    an element of cognition in the network. Cognition refers to the ability to be
    aware of the environment, be able to learn from the past actions, and use it to
    make future decisions that benefit the network [2]. Learning is one of the elements
    of cognition that can achieve different goals in different systems. In robotic
    chess, learning can be used to plan moves based on opponents’ actions; in aircraft
    autopilot systems, learning can be used to control the plane’s navigation; and
    in cognitive networks, learning can be used to improve decision making that improves
    network management and its overall performance. Whatever be the system’s goal,
    the performance of the learning technique depends on three main tasks: (1) observations
    made from current activities in the environment, (2) feedback from past actions,
    and (3) how this information is used to achieve the system’s goals. An information-centric
    sensor network (ICSN) has specialized nodes called cognitive nodes that are capable
    of performing all these tasks by implementing major cognition elements. These
    major elements are the learning, reasoning, and knowledge representation. Figure
    1 represents these three major elements for cognitive nodes in ICSN, and associate
    them with their respective functions. These elements of cognition, when incorporated
    in the network nodes of a WSN, help in providing better understanding and catering
    for the end user requirements. Our expectation from the cognitive elements would
    be to cater to the following objectives. On the short term, to observe current
    network behavior and respond adaptively to changing network dynamics. And on the
    long term, to learn from the previous behavior and plan better for the future
    so as to make predictions and decisions that positively impact the network survivability
    and application QoI during its lifetime. Using these elements, a conceptual architecture
    of the cognitive node can be illustrated as detailed in Fig. 2. Fig. 1 Cognitive
    node and its elements Full size image Fig. 2 Cognitive node conceptual architecture
    Full size image This cognitive sensor network framework is mainly targeted towards
    application such as smart cities and smart outdoor monitoring in IoT era. In these
    applications, the goal for the learning algorithm is to dynamically adapt routing
    decisions to improve the quality of information (QoI) delivered to the user [3]
    and improves the network lifetime. This can be achieved by using a learning algorithm
    that can correlate the impact of past decisions on the current network behavior,
    based on end user’s requirements. But these are challenging applications for the
    learning algorithm due to the large scale of the network, changing network topology
    due to node deaths and varying channel conditions, and heterogeneous traffic flows
    generated as a result of changing user requests in the IoT application domain.
    For the learning algorithm to be successful in such a dynamic environment, it
    must occur incrementally and span over multiple episodes [4]. Only then will it
    be able to adapt to the irreversible changes in the environment and contribute
    towards delivering QoI-aware data to the end user over the network’s lifetime.
    In this paper, we explore the different classes of learning techniques and identify
    what works best for large-scale information-centric sensor networks in IoT applications.
    The remainder of the paper has been organized as follows: In section II, we look
    at some WSN design issues in IoT applications, and summarize the design changes
    required for integration of WSNs with IoT. In section III, we explore artificial
    intelligence and learning used by WSNs, to better analyze their suitability for
    ICSN applications. Subsequently, we delve into the details of ICSNs as a hybrid
    solution platform for integration of WSNs in IoT using a learning paradigm in
    section IV. We also identify a suitable learning strategy in this section, before
    discussing some open issues and concluding the paper in section V. 2 WSN design
    issues in IoT applications In this section, we take a brief look at the various
    design issues that need to be addressed to seamlessly integrate WSNs in IoT applications.
    We categorize the design issues into two parts: (i) expectations of the users
    from the network, which includes feature requirements of the sensor network’s
    interface with the access network (future internet) and (ii) adaptations and changes
    required within the sensor network to cater to user requests while managing network
    resources. Each of these design issues will be explored in the sub-sequent sections,
    and we will see why these issues need to be handled differently from existing
    WSN applications. 2.1 User expectations from the network Traditional WSNs were
    designed for specific applications such as target tracking, temperature monitoring
    in a building, and movement of goods in a supply chain, to name a few. Users accessed
    the network only when they needed a particular type of sensed value, such as temperature,
    pressure, or humidity for instance. However, in the IoT era, sensor nodes have
    become heterogeneous and are capable of supporting multiple types of sensors.
    This way the sensor network can be expected to support multiple applications and
    provide users with a variety of data as supported by the type of sensor nodes
    used. Thus, WSN applications should evolve from supporting application-specific
    deployments to providing an application platform that users can access to gather
    a variety of data [5]. 2.1.1 Multi-user application platform support The basic
    idea behind developing an application platform is to provide a flexible, generic
    infrastructure that can lead to easy adoption of WSNs into a variety of IoT applications.
    For example, a sensor network deployed in a city should be capable of providing
    data for the following applications: (1) air pollution monitoring; (2) daily weather
    monitoring (temperature, humidity, UV index); and (3) park and garden irrigation
    management. Such an application platform and its associated services would also
    support the conceptual ubiquitous sensor network (USN) used in large-scale sensor
    network deployments [6, 7]. This would invite more number of users to simultaneously
    access the network, which makes the WSN design even more complex. The underlying
    sensor network will have to support heterogeneous traffic flows generated as a
    result of simultaneous access from multiple users, which is a very challenging
    task for the resource-constrained sensor network. 2.1.2 User requirement—aware
    request classification In a large-scale deployment of sensor networks that allows
    multiple users to access it, different users may have different requirements on
    the desired quality of experience (QoE) [8], and the network may have its own
    limitations on the quality of service (QoS) it is able to support [9–11] . While
    the user requirements may evolve over time, the sensor network gradually decays
    in terms of its energy capacity, and it also involves dynamic changes in the link
    conditions and node availability. In addition, the user’s expectations from the
    attributes associated with delivered data also vary based on the application and
    type of request. Hence, there is a need to monitor data attributes from the user
    requirements perspective directly, a skip level from the application interface,
    as shown in Fig. 3. Latency, reliability, accuracy, relevance, and robustness
    are some of the attributes that can collectively provide an estimate of the quality
    perceived by the user based on the information received at the user-end from the
    network. This is referred to as the quality of information (QoI) metric, and it
    may provide information about the success of the network in satisfying the evolving
    user requirements, while simultaneously saving valuable network resources such
    as bandwidth and energy [12]. Thus, it becomes necessary for the underlying sensor
    network to be aware of user requirements and be able to classify user requests
    to deliver data in compliance with the desired QoI. While there has been research
    in the area of QoI assurance based on changes in the phenomena observed in the
    network [13], there has not been much work on the user interface side for request
    classification based on changing user requirements. Fig. 3 QoI-aware data delivery
    in WSNs for IoT applications Full size image 2.1.3 Internet access interface between
    user and WSN ZigBee-based address-centric sensor networks facilitate the integration
    of WSNs with the Internet, as both the networks are address-centric and point-to-point.
    However, recent advances in the future internet research suggest that an information-centric
    approach to data delivery is favored over the address-centric approach. This is
    because researchers believe that it will become increasingly difficult to handle
    the growing IP address space that serves billions of users in the near future.
    Information-centric network (ICN) is one of the promising architectures for the
    future internet paradigm [14]. It proposes an information-centric approach to
    data access where users look for named data objects instead of looking up IP addresses
    to find data they are interested in. The architecture is set up to support data
    storage at strategic locations in the network, typically the edge of the network,
    so that requests do not have to be propagated deep into the network to access
    the required information. If the user had to request for data through such an
    information-centric interface, then the network interface would also have to be
    modified to ease the flow of information. Hence, for IoT applications to be able
    to adapt to changes of the future internet paradigm, changes would be required
    in the way requests are made at the user access interface and also at the sensor
    network interface. 2.2 Adaptations at the network level In this section, we move
    from the issues at the user interface, to the design issues at the network level
    to identify the adaptations required to enable WSNs for IoT applications. 2.2.1
    Energy considerations and resource management Large-scale platform-based sensor
    network deployments that are accessed by multiple users tend to benefit more from
    a data-centric approach than an address-centric one. For instance, a user may
    request for information such as: temperature readings from all regions in the
    network where value is greater than 25 °C. In such a scenario, there is no specific
    address that the user is requesting data from. Instead, the query is information-centric
    and requires information from the entire network. This could be very energy intensive
    if appropriate query dissemination and data delivery techniques are not identified.
    In their work on energy conservation schemes in WSNs, Anastasi et al. have extensively
    explored data-driven techniques, broadly classified into data reduction and energy
    efficient data acquisition approaches [15]. Several researchers have also established
    the energy conserving nature of data-centric sensor networks [16–18]. However,
    previous research has only considered networks of a few hundreds of sensor nodes.
    In IoT-based applications, there may be thousands of sensor nodes to gather information
    from, which adds to the complexity of the energy conservation problem. Although
    a data-centric approach can provide valuable energy savings in the network, further
    research is required to device techniques to manage information flow in such a
    large-scale, energy-constrained network. 2.2.2 Query dissemination and data delivery
    WSNs can be broadly classified into address-centric and data-centric networks.
    This classification is based on how query dissemination, data gathering, and routing
    happen in the network. Address-centric sensor networks are built on top of the
    more recent ZigBee protocol [19] that provides a service-oriented framework for
    implementing WSN applications. Data is routed using the tree-based hierarchical
    topology consisting of router and coordinator nodes, while sensor nodes are the
    sources of information. Routers off-load the sensor nodes by carrying forward
    their data to the sink, thus bringing considerable energy savings to the battery-operated
    sensor nodes. However, WSNs are essentially information extraction networks. They
    were originally developed as data-centric sensor networks (DCSNs) that did not
    make use of node addresses. Instead, their focus was on the attributes of the
    requested information, which was gathered from wherever it was available in the
    network, and delivered to the sink. Handling query dissemination and delivering
    the gathered data is a very challenging task in large-scale sensor networks. This
    is because of (1) the ad hoc nature of the wireless channel, (2) dynamic topology
    changes in the network due to node deaths and their changing associations, and
    (3) due to the nature of node distribution in the network. Hence, choosing the
    right approach for handling data flows in a very critical design decision, this
    must be made keeping in mind the interface access network (the future internet
    paradigm). In addition, IoT applications have multiple users requesting for different
    types of data with different service requirements. For example, while request
    for periodic data may relax the service requirements on latency, on-demand data
    needs to be provided quickly, and should be relevant. On the other hand, emergency
    reporting must be done accurately, reliably, and quickly, with minimal delay.
    Thus, the way the network is setup itself will have to be modified, to minimize
    energy consumption during each of the phases of query dissemination, data gathering,
    and data delivery. Sensor node scheduling also becomes an important issue to be
    addressed, so that data is available when user requests for it. Moreover, planned
    scheduling of sensor node wake-up and sleep cycles will add to the energy savings
    and prolong the network lifetime. In addition, planning the deployment of router
    nodes to increase the multi-hop communication range is another aspect that needs
    to be considered during network design and deployment. Since the complexity of
    the tasks to be handled by WSNs in the IoT paradigm is quite high and multi-dimensional,
    it seems appropriate that the design changes consider the addition of advanced
    nodes [20] that can maintain connectivity in the network and carry data over long
    distances in these applications. 2.3 Summary of WSN design change requirements
    Thus far in this section, we have seen the various design change requirements
    in existing WSNs to make them adapt to IoT applications. We summarize these requirements
    as follows: Multi-user application platform support Classification of user requests
    to deliver QoI-aware data Modification of the communication to make it compatible
    with the future internet paradigm—ICN Incorporate specialized nodes that can observe/learn
    from the interactions/feedback in the network and manage sensor node scheduling
    to prolong the network lifetime Plan the deployment of router and specialized
    nodes to maintain network connectivity and enable multi-hop data transmission
    over the large-scale network Consider energy efficient query dissemination and
    data delivery, and dynamic traffic management due to changing network conditions
    and user requests Figure 4 summarizes all the design change requirements in the
    form of a conceptual design for the future IoT paradigm that supports multiple
    users and integrates ICN-based internet access, and the large-scale data-centric
    sensor network. We call this an information-centric sensor network (ICSN) [21–24].
    Comparing DCSN protocols with the information-centric networking (ICN) approaches
    [25, 26] for future internet, we can see that DCSNs already implement two major
    features of the ICNs. Firstly, the naming schemes, or named data objects for referencing
    requested data instead of using node addresses, and secondly, storage of collected
    data in nodes for ease of access. We take these two features as a strong indication
    of the need to shift to data-centric sensing schemes for WSNs, but with ZigBee
    and the information-centric approach to adapt to the advanced applications in
    the IoT era [27]. Although the data-centric approach will help to better manage
    the network at each of the interfaces: user, access network, and sensor network,
    the authors do think that a simple integration of different technologies will
    not be adequate to manage the complexity of the tasks at the sensor network level.
    To improve adaptations beyond the limitations of traditional cross layer design,
    we look to the tools of artificial intelligence to support the ICSN paradigm.
    Fig. 4 Conceptual design of an ICSN for IoT applications Full size image 3 Artificial
    intelligence and learning in WSN Various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques
    have been applied to WSNs to improve their performance and achieve specific goals.
    We look at AI techniques as a means of introducing learning in the WSN. Learning
    is an important element in the observe, analyze, decide, and act (OADA) cognition
    loop [28, 29], used to implement the idea of cognitive wireless networks [30,
    31]. In this section, we broadly classify AI techniques as computational intelligence
    (CI) techniques, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, cognitive sensor networks
    and multi-agent systems (MAS), and context aware computing as shown in Fig. 5.
    Fig. 5 Learning techniques used in WSNs Full size image 3.1 Computational intelligence
    CI techniques are a set of nature-inspired computation methodologies that help
    in solving complex problems that are usually difficult to fully formulate using
    simple mathematical models. Examples of CI techniques include genetic algorithms,
    neural networks, fuzzy logic, simulated annealing, artificial immune systems,
    swarm intelligence, and evolutionary computation. In a learning environment, CI
    techniques are useful when the learning agent cannot accurately sense the state
    of its environment. In WSNs, CI techniques have been applied to problems such
    as node deployment planning, task scheduling, data aggregation, energy-aware routing,
    and QoS management. Kulkarni et al. have provided an extensive survey of CI techniques
    applied to WSNs [32]. They elaborate on various CI techniques and associate each
    with typical problem domains they can solve in WSNs. From their observations,
    swarm intelligence applied to solving the routing and clustering problem has drawn
    the most research attention in recent times. However, a major drawback of this
    methodology is that it can be computationally intense and may require some form
    of model-based offline learning to deliver to the requirements of the application
    scenario. Techniques such as ant colony optimization can cause an undesirable
    increase in communication overhead in WSNs [33] too. Apart from these drawbacks,
    none of the CI algorithms have been applied to solving problems of data representation,
    aggregation, and delivery in a distributed, decentralized setup, under dynamic
    communication constraints, as is the case in IoT applications. Next, we evaluate
    reinforcement learning strategies used in WSNs. We separate them from other CI
    techniques, because they are the most widely applied learning techniques in WSNs
    and do not categorically fall under nature-inspired learning. 3.2 Machine learning
    Machine learning can be classified into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement
    learning. Supervised learning would be more compute intensive and requires a training
    sequence. Additionally, accuracy of the learning algorithm would then be defined
    by this training sequence. In the unsupervised learning approach, the learning
    is from the environment being observed and no training sequence is required. Reinforcement
    learning (RL) is a reward-based technique that emphasizes on learning while interacting
    with the environment, without relying on explicit supervision or complete model
    of the environment. It is a method of automating goal-directed learning and decision
    making. Since it is advantageous to be aware of, and learn the changes in the
    environment in WSN-based applications, RL would be an appropriate choice as the
    learning strategy. In WSNs, RL has been successfully applied in networking tasks
    such as adaptive routing, identifying low cost and energy-balanced data delivery
    paths [34, 35], and in information processing tasks involving data aggregation
    and inference [36]. In the sub-sequent sections, we explore the different types
    of RL methods as reward-based strategy [37]. 3.2.1 Model-based reinforcement learning
    A learning agent (LA) in model-based RL collects experiences and builds a model
    from that. The actions can be chosen randomly or heuristically and observe the
    impact on a model and the reward (where s is the current state, a is the actions,
    and s’ is the next state). This means, by taking action a, how often would the
    LA end up in the state s’ if it started from state s and estimating a probability
    by counting the number of times triple occurs over the sample space. With this
    information, the LA builds an estimate of the model and the reward by estimating
    probabilities based on the number of trials (or episodes). Once an estimate of
    the model and rewards are ready, the LA can plan its actions. A good plan can
    be found from policy iterations or value iterations. But for model-based RL, the
    hardest part is knowing the right policy to start out with, so we can build a
    good model. 3.2.2 Model-free reinforcement learning In model-free reinforcement
    learning, the agent is free to learn from the environment by exploring it completely
    on its own. Agent learns from positive reinforcement it gets for moving towards
    a goal and negative reinforcement for moving away from the goal. Q-learning is
    a form of model-free RL in which the learning agent converges to an optimal policy
    even if it were acting sub-optimally. This is called off-policy learning. This
    is the most extensively used form of RL, as it is easy to implement and a relatively
    low-cost solution. However, Q-learning has its limitations too. The agent has
    to explore enough and has to eventually make the learning rate small, but not
    decrease it too quickly, so that it has a large enough state space that covers
    all possible actions and policies. In the context of the ICSNs, we are not interested
    in finding the optimal policy. Rather, we are interested in any sub-optimal solution
    that does not take much time to converge and can act faster. It does not even
    matter how the action is selected, and a heuristic choice could work well too.
    This way, an even more simplified version of RL can be applied to ICSNs. We will
    discuss this in more detail in section IV. 3.2.3 Support vector machines Support
    vector machines (SVMs) are a class of ML algorithms that were originally formulated
    for binary classification. They can be applied to complex, highly non-linear problems
    in a consistent and structured manner and have been successfully applied to intrusion
    detection and security problems in WSNs [38]. This technique has not been applied
    to any other design problem in WSNs, but has proved very effective in small-scale
    sensor networks of about 50 sensor nodes randomly deployed in a 100-m × 100-m
    area. This class of ML algorithms has great potential to be applied to security
    in IoT-based applications, especially if the interface becomes information centric,
    with gateway nodes lying within the sensor network itself. As sensor network becomes
    more vulnerable to attack in the ICSN setting, SVM techniques can be further explored
    to secure large-scale networks in IoT applications. 3.3 Cognitive framework and
    multi-agent systems Cognitive networks are built around the idea of having sensor
    networks evolve around user requirements. It is about taking a step towards developing
    intelligent networks that do not limit themselves to point-to-point communication
    within the network. Instead, they enable the network to perceive user requirements
    and deliver data using distributed intelligence in the network. To implement distributed
    intelligence, multi-agent systems (MAS) are typically used. The agents in these
    MAS are called cognitive agents. They may interact to achieve information fusion
    and retrieval and may also be able to predict data for future use. Typical applications
    include medical monitoring, intelligent transport, and smart environment monitoring
    [39]. Such a distributed approach to introducing intelligent behavior in the network
    will be very beneficial in WSNs deployed for large-scale IoT applications. Some
    examples of successful software implementations of cognitive agents in sensor
    networks include AUTOMAN [40] and MONSOON [41]. 3.4 Context aware computing In
    large-scale sensor networks, a huge amount of data is generated. In order to derive
    useful information from raw data, context of the data plays an important part.
    Context awareness is even more important in the IoT era, as it enables the network
    to deliver relevant, user-requested data. While doing so, network resources are
    also conserved by extracting only meaningful information that is relevant to the
    requests, from the network. There are various aspects to context aware computing.
    They are the following: acquiring the context, context modeling, context reasoning,
    and context distribution [42]. Since we are more interested in the learning aspect
    as applicable to sensor networks, we delve a little deeper into the context reasoning
    aspect. Both CI- and RL-based techniques can be used to implement context learning,
    in addition to ontology-based and probabilistic logic models. The information
    obtained from these learning models can be exploited to infer information from
    stored data. Context awareness is very important and valuable in IoT applications,
    as it can add value to the large amount of data available from their applications.
    All the learning techniques discussed in this section have been summarized in
    Table 1. We identify the limitations of existing techniques and provide the details
    of the solution platform based on ICSNs for IoT applications in the next section.
    Table 1 Learning using AI algorithms in WSNs Full size table 4 A hybrid solution
    platform: learning in ICSN In this section, we will identify what the learning
    algorithm should actually learn, in order to support the information-centric nature
    of ICSNs. Table 2 presents three broad classes of solutions RL problems and classifies
    their features based on their relevance to learning in ICSNs. Table 2 Classification
    of solutions to RL problems Full size table 4.1 What should the ICSN learn? To
    identify what the ICSN should learn, let us identify what information is already
    known to the learning agent nodes. First, from our work in [22] and [43], we know
    that there is the upper bound on the maximum communication range for all the network
    nodes—sensor nodes, relay nodes, and the nodes that implement learning as a part
    of cognition, the cognitive nodes. We will be referring to the learning agents
    as cognitive nodes (CN) from this point forward. So, the CNs need to be aware
    of the network topology changes only within their own communication range. The
    target area’s coverage is taken care of at the time of deployment of nodes in
    the network. Thus, learning about the topology changes in its local neighborhood
    will help the CNs adapt their transmit power and choose a data delivery path that
    best manages the nodes energy consumption. Prolonging the CNs lifetime will in
    turn contribute towards increasing the network’s longevity. Second, cognitive
    nodes store information in their knowledge base regarding the QoI performance
    of paths used in previous data delivery rounds. Routing tables are built and updated
    based on the information in the knowledge base. Unlike traditional routing tables
    that store static, end-to-end routing paths from source to destination nodes (usually
    the sink node), routing tables in ICSNs are not designed to be static. In fact,
    they are not even end-to-end paths, but are paths that show the network’s current
    adaptation to the changes in topology and user requests. They store information
    about the most recent path used to deliver data from the CNs to the sink or other
    CNs or relay nodes. This means that the contents of the routing table at each
    cognitive node have to be updated on a regular basis to ensure they store the
    latest and best QoI paths. Thus, the important learning goal for the cognitive
    node from an application QoI perspective is to learn the data delivery paths towards
    the sink that provide the best QoI values for each of the different types of user
    requests. There is no one best path that is always used to route data. Instead,
    the routing choice depends on the current network topology, nature of the user
    request (periodic, intermittent-user specific, or emergency data), and volume
    of traffic generated in response to the request. If the routing table is viewed
    as cache storage, then as effective cache replacement strategy is required to
    replace old and redundant routing information with more recent and relevant information.
    These learning goals can be achieved in the following ways as represented in Fig.
    6: (i) learning from feedback on current actions, (ii) learning by exploring the
    changes in the network topology, and (iii) learning (drawing inference) from past
    actions by using the information stored in a knowledge base. Once the learning
    converges and knowledge base updates are complete, the routing tables can be updated
    using information from the knowledge base. Thus, we identify two main goals of
    learning: Firstly, to improve network longevity and maximize the duration for
    which the ICSN is able to provide relevant data to the end user; and secondly,
    to increase the network’s ability to provide QoI-aware data to the end user during
    its lifetime. For ICSNs, we define the network lifetime as the time after which
    none of the one-hop cognitive nodes to the sink are able to deliver the user’s
    requests for information to the network, nor are they able to deliver the gathered
    data from the network back to the user, is called end-of-life of the ICSN. Fig.
    6 Learning in sensor networks Full size image 4.2 Choosing the learning strategy
    The goal of learning in ICSNs is to improve the QoI delivered to the end user
    and maximize the duration over which this can be maintained. In other words, learning
    should contribute towards maximizing the network lifetime while ensuring QoI-aware
    data delivery during this period. Based on these requirements, we identify the
    following factors that influence the choice of learning strategy in ICSNs: Learning
    should occur incrementally over time as network conditions change. It should support
    episodic learning [44] to acquire information from new events and update the knowledge
    base. This will let the system make decisions and act based on the observed changes.
    Learning should be distributed and occur locally when implemented in large-scale
    ICSNs. However, the goal of learning should be common across all the cognitive
    nodes. The learning algorithm must be light-weight and of low complexity to support
    episodic learning. Moreover, it must not cause too much data/control overhead
    in the network or negatively interfere with other nodes’ functions. The learning
    algorithm should preferably be rewards based, as supervised learning would become
    very compute intensive for the ICSNs Finally, the learning algorithm must be able
    to converge quickly enough to be support the network’s learning goals in a timely
    manner. It should not cost the network too much in terms of its resources (energy
    and time) either. Based on these recommendations, we explore heuristically accelerated
    reinforcement learning techniques for use with ICSNs in the next section. 4.3
    Heuristically accelerated reinforcement learning Since both model-based and model-free
    RL have their limitations, we will look towards modified forms of RL solutions.
    We look at the possibility of using heuristics (rules of thumb) to choose a sub-optimal
    action instead of trying to converge at an optimal policy. The advantage of combining
    heuristics with RL is that RL is eventually going to converge to an optimal possible
    policy, but it takes time. Heuristic only attempts to make the decision choices
    quickly. Therefore, it will not deter the RL process, but will only enhance it
    to arrive at some sub-optimal solution faster, but it will not be incorrect as
    observed by Atkeson and Santamaria [45]. In this section, we look at the use of
    heuristic functions to accelerate RL algorithms. These heuristic evaluation functions
    called valuation functions are computed by stochastic sampling and dynamic programming
    updates [46]. The model-free method is suitable for problems that do not involve
    large state spaces. In contrast, the domain-independent, model-based heuristic
    methods can be used for solving problems with a large state space and hundreds
    of actions. The fast and frugal heuristics proposed by Gigerenzer [47, 48] are
    not only generic but are also low polynomial time and applicable to all problems
    that fit a given model. Another aspect to consider is that learning happens while
    the system is running. This makes it important to reduce the exploration space
    of the learning agent. In the CICSN framework, we can use the information stored
    in the knowledge base as a case base to choose an action that provides a close
    solution to the RL agent’s problem. But the choice of the case that matches the
    given decision problem must be chosen in a way that helps the RL algorithm to
    converge quickly [49, 50]. This way we can limit the exploration space by making
    use of the knowledge base, and use heuristics to choosen a sub-optimal action
    that will help the algorithm converge faster. Heuristically accelerated RL (HARL)
    and case-based HARL have been recently explored by Bianchi et al. in the context
    of robotic soccer [51, 52]. We extend this idea of accelerating RL by using heuristics
    and an available case base to the ICSN framework. In our application, the case
    base is replaced by a knowledge base that is built upon the foundation of representing
    knowledge in attribute-value pairs. The “Representativeness Heuristic”: According
    to this heuristic, the more similar something is to a prototype, the more likely
    it is to belong to that prototype’s category [53]. This heuristic is based on
    the fact that we tend to judge how likely something is to be true is based on
    how representative it is of a particular category. Thus, we conclude this section
    with the suggestion that heuristically accelerated RL techniques that make use
    of the information stored in the knowledge base of the cognitive nodes will potentially
    serve as low complexity solution to the learning problem in ICSNs, and might be
    viable in terms of the computational overhead too. 4.4 Learning in the ICSN framework
    In the previous sub-section, we identified a learning strategy for ICSNs based
    on the network requirements and from the analysis of different learning strategies.
    Now we will identify how the ICSN must be set up so that the learning strategy
    can be implemented in this framework. We assume a deterministic deployment of
    relay and cognitive nodes, and number them for ease of representation. We start
    with a broad classification of the type of request that an ICSN should be able
    to serve. We divide the requests into one of three types: type I: periodic, type
    II: on-demand, and type III: emergency request. Each of these requests will be
    associated with different QoI values on the delivered data, as desired by the
    user. We identify latency (L), reliability (R), and throughput (T) as the three
    attributes, whose combined value will decide the QoI associated with the delivered
    data. Energy efficiency is another important parameter that affects the network’s
    performance and impacts the network lifetime, and we will considered it while
    making decisions in the network, especially when related with choosing a data
    delivery path. We will not use absolute values of these attributes in deciding
    the QoI value. Instead, we will associate priorities with each of these attributes
    for every request type, and let these priorities decide the importance of the
    absolute value of the attributes. Thus, each request type is classified according
    to the priorities associated with QoI attributes of L, R, and T, and the importance
    of considering energy efficiency in making a decision choice in the network, as
    shown in Table 3. Table 3 Priority of QoI attributes for different request types
    Full size table The QoI attributes are monitored from feedback in the network.
    When a data packet is transmitted from a CN to its one-hop neighbors, the QoI
    attribute values are piggy-backed along with the acknowledgement it receives from
    these nodes. These values will be stored in a knowledge base (KB) and used in
    deciding the most appropriate next hop for sub-sequent requests arriving at that
    CN. This way, decisions about data delivery paths are dynamic and always based
    on both the user requirements and the network conditions at any point. The advantage
    of making these decisions at CNs is that it helps in decentralized decision making.
    Moreover, only local, one-hop neighborhood information needs to be monitored and
    stored. This means that the size of the KB to be maintained remains reasonable
    and can be easy to update and maintain. Table 3, shows the association of QoI
    attribute priorities with each request type. The numbers in the table indicate
    the priority associated with the attribute. Number 1 indicates top priority and
    number 3 indicates least priority. The “x” in Table 3 indicates a “don’t care”
    condition. This means that there are no strict requirements on the value of the
    QoI attribute marked with an “x,” and its value does not impact the decision making.
    Next, we look at the structure of the KB, where all the information gathered from
    observations in the network, and learnt from feedback is stored. The KB thus stores
    all the relevant and useful information that the learning and cognitive decision
    making algorithms can use. It also serves as a case base which the learning heuristic
    can use to map a given problem with and decides on the best course of action for
    the future. Table 4 represents the KB at a cognitive node and has a sample of
    the information stored in it as attribute-value pairs. Attribute-value pairs are
    one of the techniques used for knowledge representation. Information is represented
    in a way that the user can derive useful information from it, by drawing inferences
    about how the values are connected [54]. The inferences drawn could be based on
    rules, or heuristics based on learning from observations and feedback in the network.
    In Table 4, a recursive representation of attribute-value pairs has been used.
    That is each entry in the value field can be another attribute-value pair. What
    makes this representation effective beyond the attribute-value association is
    that information can be derived by reading the values along the column too, except
    for the field containing sensor data. For example, in the Attribute’ field “Node
    type” is associated with three values: “Sink,” “RN,” or “CN.” RN represents relay
    nodes that the CN is connected with, and CN represents other cognitive nodes that
    the given CN is connected with in the ICSN. The “Distance” field corresponds with
    the values in the “Node type” and represents the separation between the CN housing
    the KB and the Sink, RN, and CN, respectively. Tracking the remaining battery
    level at each of the one-hop nodes helps the CN take energy-aware decisions in
    choosing the data delivery path. The next major attribute we have used is “QoI.”
    It has information about the “Request Type” (as described by Table 3) that the
    node has served, next hop “Node” that can best serve each request, and the values
    recorded for each of the “QoI attributes” of latency (L), reliability (R), and
    throughput (T) during the previous communication. These values could be different
    between any pairs of nodes and are thus represented by α*, β*, and γ*. It should
    be noted however, that this table is only a representation of how information
    can be stored in the KB. In actual implementation, details of the semantics will
    have to be worked out to make the representations shorter and effective. In the
    proposed ICSN framework, we even segregate the routing table from the KB to keep
    routing decisions simple. Routing tables at the CNs store information only about
    reaching the one-hop neighbors, not the end-to-end paths, as shown in Table 5.
    These entries are derived from the KB of Table 4. In Table 5, the “Possible next
    hops” field suggests the best next hop node for cognitive node 2 (CN2) to transmit
    data, based on the “Request type.” It shows that CN2 is directly connected to
    the Sink, connected to four RNs that are linked with the Sink, and is also connected
    to two other CNs. CN-CN paths are not preferred and are represented by the hyphens
    in the “Request type” column. This is due to the high cost in terms of energy
    consumption, and the possibility of running into loops without reaching the Sink.
    These tables can be updated every time the learning algorithm identifies better
    paths for each request type, based on the changing network dynamics as reflected
    from the KB. In addition, a reasoning algorithm to help the learning agent in
    making cognitive decisions must be identified. These are still open research issues
    that need to be addressed in the future. Table 4 Sample of a knowledge base and
    its contents at the cognitive node Full size table Table 5 Routing table at the
    CN Full size table 5 Use-case and performance evaluation In this section, we provide
    some performance evaluation of the different learning techniques in improving
    large-scale ICSNs for Cloud- and/or IoT-based applications. As described in the
    context of cognitive psychology [49], the learning heuristics will be used as
    strategies that ignore a part of the information to make decisions faster, and
    sometimes more accurately compared to more complex methods [25]. We utilize an
    online version of the A* heuristic search algorithm, which learns from the information
    available in the knowledge base of the cognitive nodes. We call this learning
    data delivery A* (LDDA*) algorithm. The heuristics will be used to make approximate
    decision choices, as opposed to optimal decision choices. We compare this with
    a cumulative-heuristic accelerated learning (CHAL) technique that accumulates
    the heuristic values at each state (relay and cognitive nodes) and makes use of
    as much information as possible from observations made in the network before making
    the data delivery path choices. It also uses negative heuristic weights to punish
    poor next hop node choices, such as revisiting a node along a data delivery path.
    This way, LDDA* and CHAL will differ in the heuristic weights accumulated by the
    learning process. Since learning is typically used to improve the decisions made
    by reasoning engine in cognitive networks, we implement LDDA* and CHAL in a network
    that uses an analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-based reasoning technique at the
    cognitive nodes to make data delivery decisions. (The details of AHP-based data
    delivery (AHPDD) have been described in our previous work [21]). Performance of
    the heuristically accelerated learning techniques LDDA* and CHAL are compared
    against the non-learning AHPDD in terms of the QoI observed at the Sink where
    data is delivered at the end of each transmission round. The algorithms will also
    be compared in terms of the rate of successful data delivery and the energy consumed
    during the data delivery process at the end of network’s lifetime. The knowledge
    of the deterministic deployment of the RNs and CNs, and the knowledge accumulated
    in the knowledge base (KB) of the cognitive nodes, will be used to update the
    weight of the heuristics during network operation. We evaluate and compare the
    performance of the aforementioned algorithms using MATLAB simulations. In the
    following, a brief description of the simulation setup and targeted metrics/parameters
    in evaluating the performance of the algorithms. Simulations results and a detailed
    analysis of the results are also presented in this section. 5.1 Simulation setup
    The network is setup as described in Fig. 7, with randomly deployed sensor nodes
    and fixed deployment of relay and cognitive nodes. Simulation parameters are as
    described in Table 6. Energy deductions at the local cognitive nodes (LCNs) and
    relay nodes (RNs) during data transmission are as represented in Table 7, based
    on the transmit powers. The transmit power at RNs is fixed at 3 dBm, and it can
    be adapted at the LCNs to improve the probability of successful transmission as
    described in [21]. Data delivery paths from source LCNs in the network are initially
    established based on AHP analysis of paths along next hop-neighboring RNs. Heuristic
    learning is introduced in this simulation to increase the average success rate
    of data delivery to the sink, irrespective of the randomness with which the requests
    for different traffic types are generated in the network. Fig. 7 Use-case scenario
    setup for simulations Full size image Table 6 Simulation parameters Full size
    table Table 7 Transmit power consumption Full size table The following are the
    three performance evaluation metrics that will be used to compare the performance
    of the aforementioned three algorithms: 1. Network lifetime: number of transmission
    rounds till all one-hop nodes to GCN/Sink node are dead (including RNs and LCNs)
    2. Success rate (ρ): it is defined as the ratio of the number of successful transmissions
    s to the sink over the total number of transmission rounds T during the network’s
    lifetime. This is represented by Eq. (1) as follows: $$ \rho =\frac{s}{T}\ast
    100 $$ (1) 3. Failure rate (ϕ): it is the ratio of the number of failed transmissions
    f to the sink over the total number of transmission rounds T during the network’s
    lifetime. This is represented by Eq. (2) as follows: $$ \varnothing =\frac{f}{T}\ast
    100 $$ (2) 4. eQoI: effective QoI or eQoI is the heuristics estimate of the QoI
    associated with data delivered to the sink at the end of successful transmission
    round. In other words, a heuristic estimate of the value of the QoI at the last
    hop that delivered the information to the sink. 5.2 Simulation results and analysis
    Simulation results for the aforementioned three techniques are summarized in Table
    8. Table 8 Summary of simulation results Full size table As shown in the above
    table, results from the simulation using AHP analysis (AHPDD) suggests that during
    an average lifetime of 78 transmission rounds, the average success rate is 63
    %, and the average failure rate is 37 %. However, during the worst case, transmissions
    can fail for over 50 % of the requests, as suggested by the worst case failure
    rate. With the cumulative-heuristic accelerated learning (CHAL), it was found
    that the average success rate increased to 84 %, and the worst case failure rate
    was as low as 19 %. The best case success rate was 90 %, which was only 6 % off
    from the average success rate. This shows that the heuristics performed consistently
    well under various traffic loads and request arrival patterns. The performance
    of CHAL was matched very closely by the LDDA* heuristic search algorithm, which
    provided an 88 % data delivery success rate, but a slightly higher failure rate
    of 22 % in the worst case scenario when compared with CHAL. Since it is more desirable
    to have a higher success rate in smart IoT applications, we further compare the
    performance of LDDA* and CHAL techniques in terms of their effective QoI (eQoI)
    as observed at the Sink to identify the best heuristic of the two. Figure 8 shows
    the result of the comparison of the eQoI values for LDDA*, and CHAL, with AHPDD,
    which does not use any form of learning at the LCNs. In general, we observe that
    using some form of learning at the LCNs improves the eQoI of the data delivered
    to the Sink. Of the learning techniques, we observe that LDDA* performs the best
    in terms of consistently delivering data with higher eQoI at the sink, even towards
    the end of the network’s lifetime. Now, this eQoI is the hop-over-hop value of
    QoI associated with the data delivered to the sink with respect to latency, reliability,
    and throughput. Apart from the hop-over-hop latency, the cumulative delay in receiving
    a response from the network for a request is reflected by the number of hops taken
    along the path from source to sink. Thus, we can conclude that of the two proposed
    techniques, LDDA* is capable of delivering data to the sink with a higher average
    success rate, and better eQoI. Either of these techniques may be used for data
    delivery in the cognitive ICSN for IoT applications, based on the application
    and end user requirements (i.e., eQoI), rate of successful data delivery, and
    cumulative delay from source to sink. Fig. 8 eQoI as observed at the Sink over
    the network lifetime Full size image 6 Conclusion and open issues In this paper,
    we have approached WSNs as information-centric networks, which enable retrieving
    more information than just the data in attribute-value pairs from the network.
    We reviewed some routing protocols in DCSNs and presented our views on how learning
    could have been used to improve their performance. Then, we went on to see the
    various learning techniques available in the AI domain and found that RL methods
    are more suitable for use with sensor networks. This is because reinforcement
    learning involves learning while interacting with the environment which is important
    in WSN environments where network dynamics change due to changing channel conditions,
    node deaths, and changing traffic conditions, to name a few. We explored some
    more RL techniques, and analyzed what the ICSNs should learn, before arriving
    at a suitable technique for implementing learning in WSNs. Network lifetime and
    quality of information are the primary features that must be improved by the use
    of learning algorithms. This work presents a preliminary assessment of the potential
    advantages of introducing learning in WSNs. A detailed assessment of the best
    way to do so, and comparison with other techniques with respect to their impact
    on ICSN lifetime and QoI awareness will provide a more accurate evaluation of
    the benefits of introducing learning in sensor networks. Thus, we open up the
    ICSN paradigm as a research area with interesting possibilities. This study opens
    the door to develop application-/domain-specific ontologies for better knowledge
    representation at a higher level. The creation of such domain ontologies contributes
    towards the development of an enterprise architecture framework that can be applied
    to different application domains using the same underlying cognitive sensor network
    platform. More functions could be incorporated at the sink to integrate it with
    the next generation networks constituted of cognitive radio enabled nodes, working
    in cognitive network setup. The expansion of the sink node functions to a cognitive
    gateway node can be considered. The cognitive gateway node would then be able
    to take requests directly from different wireless users such as cell phone users,
    wireless access points and base stations. Furthermore, the idea of “cognitive
    elements” shall be used in the intermediate routers of the future internet to
    provide on-demand content to users quickly. References Al-Turjman F, Gunay M (2016)

    Pest resistance and water pollution are major issues caused by the excessive use
    of pesticides in intensive agriculture. The concept of integrated production system
    (IPS) has been thus designed to solve those issues and also to meet the need for
    better food quality and production. Methodologies such as agronomic diagnosis-based
    design, prototyping, and model-based design have been developed. Here we review
    the model-based design of IPS. We identify tools for the development of comprehensive
    models. Once comprehensive models have been developed, model-based design of IPS
    can be formulated as an optimization problem to be solved using different approaches.
    Thus, we review the choice of corresponding criteria, constraints, and mathematical
    formulations found in the literature. We analyze successful model-based design
    in transportation and drug development. We learn from these areas to overcome
    the inherent difficulties involved in the model-based design of IPS. We recommend
    the following major points: IPS model-based design should use integrative modeling
    platforms, process-oriented modeling, and object-oriented techniques to improve
    the genericity, modularity, reuse of crop models, and the data sharing. The spatial
    dimension of IPS has to be accounted for by making crop models spatially explicit.
    The design evaluation criteria have to be standardized and carefully chosen by
    promoting stakeholders involvement. The design of IPS should be formulated as
    a multiobjective optimization problem, for which non-aggregative approaches should
    be preferred. Finally, it is necessary to establish a true dialogue between prototyping
    and model-based design practitioners in order to test, and if necessary to improve,
    the proposed systems. Similar content being viewed by others What if precision

    1.1 Alternatives to pesticides are required Several authors attribute the spectacular
    increase of agricultural production in the second half of the twentieth century
    to the excessive use of products resulting from chemical synthesis (Kropff et
    al. 2001; Glendining et al. 2009). Intensive agriculture is considered by politicians
    as one of the greatest sources of pollution and has led to major environmental
    problems that affect global sustainability. Today, farmers must comply with an
    increasing number of regulations, especially concerning the use of pesticides.
    Within this context, the requirements of food quality and of regularity of production
    force us to consider all the possible alternatives for limiting the development
    of pests while ensuring economic and environmental sustainability. 1.2 Context
    of integrated protection and emergence of integrated production The development
    of pest resistance and the negative environmental impacts of pesticides are some
    of the serious problems caused by the excessive use of pesticides. They have motivated
    the development of new system approaches and techniques in pest management (Kropff
    et al. 2001). Approaches have changed from the exclusion or destruction of pests
    by an intensive use of pesticides to the use of alternative control methods that
    involve many interlinked components within the agroecosystem. According to Boller
    et al. (2004), experts have distinguished four steps in the development of plant
    protection. The first one is blind chemical control characterized by routine applications
    of the most powerful pesticides, following industrial recommendations. The second
    one is integrated chemical control consisting of the applications of broad-spectrum
    pesticides, in general, after consultation with an advisory service. The third
    one is specific control based on the introduction of the concept of “economic
    threshold levels” and the application of pesticides with no negative side effects
    and the protection of beneficial organisms. Integrated pest management is the
    last step. In addition to the third step, it integrates biological and biotechnical
    methods and good agricultural practices while severely restricting the use of
    chemical products (Boller et al. 2004). According to Walton et al. (1995), “Integrated
    Pest Management (IPM) is a pest management system that in the socioeconomic context
    of cropping systems, the associated environment and the population dynamics of
    the pest species, utilizes all suitable techniques in as compatible manner as
    possible and maintains the pest population levels below those causing economic
    injury.”. Integrated pest management is simply one step in a more ambitious and
    holistic approach, i.e., integrated production. According to the IOBC definition:
    “Integrated Production/Farming is a farming system that produces high quality
    food and other products by using natural resources and regulating mechanisms to
    replace polluting inputs and to secure sustainable farming.” The design of innovative
    farming systems or cropping systems, as they are most often referred to in the
    literature, that address the problems of integrated production has now become
    an important international issue (Gary 2004; Tixier et al. 2008). 1.3 Model-based
    design of integrated production systems versus other approaches The design of
    innovative cropping systems is a very difficult problem (Antonopoulou 2003). It
    generally starts with an evaluation phase of the existing systems. Innovation
    can then focus on improving system management or on its partial or total reconfiguration
    (Loyce and Wery 2006). According to Loyce and Wery (2006), the design of innovative
    cropping systems may be divided into three stages. The first one is the definition
    of a set of constraints and objectives for the systems to be built. The evaluation
    of existing cropping systems in the area studied and the analysis of farm performance
    and of farmers’ practices constitute fundamental approaches to provide the elements
    necessary to this phase. The second stage is the determination of combinations
    of innovative techniques or innovative crop successions. This stage is the design
    stage in the strict sense of the term and can be achieved based on agronomic diagnosis,
    on experts’ statements, or on models. The in situ or in silico evaluation of candidate
    combinations constitutes the third stage. We can add a fourth stage during which,
    based on the evaluation results, one or a few “potentially innovative” cropping
    systems are selected and disseminated. In this section, we focus our investigation
    on the design task. The agronomic diagnosis may be considered as the basis for
    the improvement of cropping systems. It allows us to identify risky production
    situations, to recognize the main factors that limit performance, and, thus, to
    identify the technical choices that make it possible to deal with these situations.
    However, the diagnosis is generally achieved only over a few years, the range
    of explored techniques is almost always limited to a particular region, and diagnosis
    is generally based on a small number of criteria. Diagnosis must therefore rely
    on complementary knowledge in order to be able to imagine the consequences of
    the proposed improvements with additional criteria and to achieve more complete
    proposals for innovative cropping systems (Loyce and Wery 2006). The “prototyping
    method” (Vereijken 1997) is advocated as an expert-based design approach. It is
    based on three steps: (1) construction by the experts of a cropping system, a
    “theoretical prototype”, satisfying a set of constraints and objectives; (2) experimental
    evaluation of this prototype in several situations representative of the constraints
    set; and (3) adaptation of this prototype based on the multicriteria assessment
    of the experimental results. Several iterations between the second and third phases
    result in an “engineering prototype” that can then be extensively tested or serve
    as a basis for the second phase of prototyping. This method can be very effective
    for promoting interdisciplinarity among researchers and for involving farmers
    from the start in a context where models are not available. However, prototyping
    has several drawbacks. First, the need for consensus on one or several prototypes
    may overlook many innovative combinations. Second, climate variability and other
    associated risks are difficult to take into account for each of the three phases
    mentioned above. Finally, the formalization and transparency of the design process
    are not always clear, making the process difficult for other experts to analyze
    (Loyce and Wery 2006). Field experimentation is very costly and time-consuming
    (Chatelin et al. 2007). Modeling is becoming increasingly more effective and useful
    with the advent of more powerful computers. Computer simulation models for agroecosystems
    are a representation or an abstract of reality, expressed in mathematical and
    logical terms. As such, they can never fully represent reality and are imperfect.
    Their use, however, has many advantages. These include manipulations and experiments
    that would be impractical, too expensive, too lengthy, or impossible in the real
    world, in addition to the identification of complex interactions in the real systems,
    rapid identification of the best management strategies, evaluation of the long-term
    effects of options, and investigation of hypothetical situations such as climate
    change (Mayer 2002). The use of models for designing integrated production systems
    (IPS) appears to be appropriate. According to Dogliotti et al. (2004), this approach
    may be considered as the adaptation and improvement of the prototyping approach
    (Dogliotti et al. 2004). Model-based design includes a development phase followed
    by an evaluation phase. The experiment, which is an essential component of the
    design and evaluation in the prototyping approach, has a very different role here.
    It comes after the “design”-in silico evaluation phases to confirm the relevance
    of the systems selected by the model, to test their robustness under various environmental
    conditions, and, finally, to assess their feasibility and therefore the relevance
    of the choice and dissemination of such systems (Loyce and Wery 2006; Blazy et
    al. 2010). 1.4 Model-based design of integrated production systems: the multi-criteria
    aspects Model-based design of IPS is faced with two major problems: exploring
    sustainability objectives of cropping systems and evaluating them. On the one
    hand, the full decision space of these objectives is usually very large, and simplifications
    are necessary to ensure computational feasibility (deVoil et al. 2006). On the
    other hand, evaluation, a very important task with respect to the implementation
    of integrated production systems, requires both the integration of a large quantity
    of information regarding economic, social, and environmental objectives and the
    treatment of conflicting aspects of these objectives as a function of the views
    and opinions of the individuals involved in the design process (Sadok et al. 2008).
    Multiobjective evaluation methods may be useful for discussion on tradeoffs between
    these conflicting objectives (Sadok et al. 2008). The design of integrated production
    systems must therefore be studied as a typical multi-criteria decision-making
    problem that could be handled by multiobjective optimization techniques. 1.5 Paper
    focus and organization This paper deals with the model-based design of integrated
    production systems. In the next section, we give a brief description of the necessary
    elements for this kind of design. We critically review the literature related
    to each of these elements in “Model-based design of integrated production systems:
    brief overview of the elements involved”. The section “Model-based design of integrated
    production systems: examples, comparison to other fields, and critical analysis”
    presents the design step itself and includes some examples of model-based design.
    Critical analysis and comparison between integrated production systems and other
    systems such as transportation and drug design are included in this section. In
    “Efficiency of model-based design”, we discuss the future of model-based design
    and the challenges to be overcome to make it more reliable. 2 Model-based design
    of integrated production systems: brief overview of the elements involved Agroecosystems
    are composed of many interacting entities, i.e., soil, cultivated plants, other
    biotic elements, and the environment, managed by the farmer (Fig. 1). These entities
    each behave in a certain way and form the system dynamics; the overall behavior
    emerges from the interaction between these entities (Dore et al. 2006; Akplogan
    et al. 2009). Many models and support tools are required to represent this inherent
    complexity and the different time and space scales of system operation. In this
    section, we attempt to list the most necessary models and tools for the model-based
    design of IPS. Crop models describing the growth and development of plants, models
    for simulating the effects of farmers’ management practices, models for predicting
    the emergence of pests, for evaluating their impacts, and for controlling them,
    models for genetic improvement of cultivated plants, and models for climate prediction
    are required. Model-based design also requires databases that describe field experiments,
    weather, soil characteristics, plant genotypes, pests, natural enemies, and economic
    data. Efficient multicriteria evaluation methods and powerful multiobjective optimization
    algorithms are also needed for the model-based design of IPS (Fig. 2). Fig. 1

    GIS, Geographic Information System Full size image 2.1 Modeling crops, pests,
    and cropping systems 2.1.1 Crop models Many researchers have developed crop models
    since the pioneering works of the De Wit school at Wageningen University (Bouman
    et al. 1996; van Ittersum et al. 2003). These models may be divided into two main
    types: biophysical and decision models. The biophysical models represent the evolution
    of cultivated plants and describe the dynamic interactions between soil, plants,
    and the environment. Depending on the goals, a wide variety of biophysical models
    exist, ranging from conceptual models to develop understanding to more complex
    biophysical models such as STICS (Brisson et al. 2003), APSIM (Keating et al.
    2003), CropSyst (Stockle et al. 2003), and DSSAT (Jones et al. 2003). The biophysical
    models provide useful indicators for decision models. The decision models describe
    the farmers’ decision-making process dynamics in broad terms of crop evolution,
    including pests and climate (Crespo 2006). They are defined as the conceptual
    models of farmers’ management and organizational practices, taking constraints
    into account and generating adequate actions. Examples include OTELO (Attonaty
    et al. 1990), DECIBLE (Aubry et al. 1998), MODERATO (Bergez et al. 2001), and
    DIESE (Martin-Clouaire and Rellier 2009). 2.1.2 Cultural practices modeling Management
    practices constitute the fundamental ingredient of farmers’ decisions and have
    direct and indirect impacts on plants and pests. They influence soil, plant, and
    pest status and, as a result, agronomic and environmental crop performances, but
    they are influenced by work organization and the social and economic context (Nesme
    et al. 2009). Their modeling is an important element in the model-based design
    approach of IPS. However, these practices are often empirically modeled in the
    case of most crop models even if researchers have extensively studied management
    practices, leading to little conceptual insight. This is due in part to the difficulty
    in describing these practices and their impact on the biophysical system since
    they have multiple and prolonged consequences on the crop system dynamics (Bergez
    et al. 2010). 2.1.3 Pest models and pest control models Few crop models integrate
    pests (Bergez et al. 2010). Among four of the best known and most commonly used
    crop models, namely STICS, APSIM, CropSyst, and DSSAT, only DSSAT explicitly takes
    pests into consideration. However, pest occurrence, plant performance, and plant
    damage caused by pests constitute the key elements of integrated production systems.
    Accordingly, the whole model-based design approach should rely on the modeling
    of the interaction between plants and pests (Kropff et al. 1995). Even if agronomists
    have ignored it, much research has been conducted on the biotic component of agroecosystems,
    and many researchers have proposed pest models. The approaches used range from
    knowledge representation formalisms such as expert systems to discrete events
    systems formalisms, including Lotka–Volterra predator–prey models. A number of
    these models have been developed for the identification of beneficial insects
    and pests and may be used for prevention purposes. Expert systems proposed by
    Mahaman et al. (2003) and by Gonzalez-Andujar (2009) belong to this category (Mahaman
    et al. 2003; Gonzalez-Andujar 2009). In addition, in order to quantify pest damage,
    models ranging from empirical functions that ignore the dynamics of crop–pest
    interactions to mechanistic simulation models that integrate the dynamics of a
    pest over the season have been proposed (Kropff et al. 1995). Other models have
    been dedicated to the development of pest management strategies. Munier-Jolain
    et al. (2005) and Colbach et al. (2007) developed DECID’Herb and ALOMYSYS, respectively,
    for weed control in crop production using empirical functions and a fuzzy logic
    expert system (Munier-Jolain et al. 2005; Colbach et al. 2007). Jerry and Gouzé
    (2004) and Mailleret and Grognard (2009) studied biological control problems using
    predator–prey models (see “Examples of model-based design”). Others researchers
    go further by taking the impacts of pest control on predators and beneficial insects
    into account. These works are essentially based on the Lotka–Volterra models.
    For example, Hall and Lescourret (2008) proposed a model of plant–pest–predator
    interactions with threshold control based on the biomass flow from plant to pest
    to predator. The objective of this study was to distinguish situations in which
    the application of control measures can disrupt the control of pests by predators
    (Hall and Lescourret 2008). Other less familiar modeling approaches have also
    been used for the development of pest management strategies. Thus, Leger and Naud
    (2009) proposed an expert-based IPM solution designed by a team of phytopathologist
    experts. They modeled the decision process by means of statecharts that belong
    to the family of discrete event systems formalisms (Leger and Naud 2009). The
    majority of the cited and available models, except those dealing with identification,
    focus on a single pest, although there is often a complex of pests on plants under
    real conditions. For example, exceptions include Willocquet et al. (2002) who
    proposed a model that simulates yield losses due to several rice pests (sheath
    blight, brown spot, sheath rot, bacterial leaf blight, stem borers, brown plant
    hopper, defoliating insects, and weeds) under a range of specific production situations
    found in tropical Asia. Nevertheless, as Bergez et al. (2010) observed, these
    aspects have not yet been sufficiently studied. 2.1.4 Model spatialization The
    spatial organization of crops could be considered as a management practice insofar
    as it is chosen, decided, and may be adapted by a farmer or by a farmer’s team.
    Spatial organization has a significant effect on pest dynamics that itself has
    a spatial dimension and on the effectiveness of the protection methods carried
    out by farmers. It has an important role to play in the design of IPS and should
    be better taken into account in the model-based design approach. However, most
    crop/pest models have been developed for studying temporal variations of processes
    and habitually ignore their spatial variation, with a few exceptions. The model
    outputs are therefore generally site specific. It is both useful and increasingly
    requested to spatialize models over a region, with wide concomitant heterogeneities
    in soil, climate, and management practices (Hartkamp et al. 1999; Faivre et al.
    2004). In this respect, geographical data series and remote sensing images can,
    if properly used, allow to make models spatially explicit (Lesschen et al. 2007).
    Attempts have been made to take the spatial dimension of environmental and pedoclimatic
    conditions into account. Thus, Roger-Estrade et al. (2009) investigated the role
    of soil structure in the design of new crop management systems and considered
    both the spatial and the temporal variability. Houdart et al. (2009) presented
    a method to assess the potential risks of pesticide pollution at the watershed
    scale within the context of tropical areas with a high diversity of cultures and
    without information on the fate of pesticides in the environment. This method
    is broken down into four steps: surveying practices, determining the pesticide
    load for each field in the watershed, establishing an indicator of pollution,
    and spatializing the indicator (Houdart et al. 2009). Ewers et al. (2005) used
    landscape heterogeneity for the assessment of local biodiversity value within
    a predominantly agricultural landscape. Some researchers have tried to study the
    spatial dispersion and dynamics of pests. Ricci et al. (2009) studied the impact
    of landscape characteristics on the population level of codling moth in commercial
    orchards in the context of IPM using a Geographic Information System (GIS). They
    analyzed variations in the number of larvae using correlation tests and linear
    models (Ricci et al. 2009). The spatial dimension of farmers’ decisions or agricultural
    policies was also investigated. Le Ber et al. (2003) presented the knowledge-based
    system ROSA (Reasoning about Organization of Space in Agriculture) related to
    spatial and functional organization in agriculture. It combines hierarchical classification,
    case-based reasoning techniques, and qualitative spatial reasoning. Domain knowledge
    and cases are modeled with spatial organization graphs and represented within
    a description logic system (Le Ber et al. 2003). Reshmidevi et al. (2009) proposed
    a GIS-integrated fuzzy rule-based inference system for land suitability evaluation
    in agricultural watersheds. Lesschen et al. (2007) proposed a spatialized version
    of a methodology earlier developed to quantify soil nutrient balances at the national
    level in sub-Saharan African countries (Smaling et al. 1993). They developed techniques
    to make the methodology spatially explicit, re-estimated the original regression
    models for the various nutrient flows or replaced them by simple simulation models,
    and assessed the uncertainties of soil nutrient balance estimates. As a result,
    regional differences due to soil and climate variability can be taken into account
    and national soil fertility policies can be better targeted towards the lower
    levels, e.g., district or cooperation region (Lesschen et al. 2007). Major challenges
    lie in achieving the full interactivity of a GIS and a crop/pest model and satisfying
    spatial data requirements while ensuring data quality control using sensitivity
    and uncertainty analysis techniques. Regarding uncertainty especially, on the
    one hand, spatial data have intrinsic uncertainties due to measurement, digitization,
    or interpolation methods. On the other hand, crop/pest models are based on simplifying
    assumptions and produce uncertain outputs. However, models’ outputs are only meaningful
    when they have sufficient accuracy (Hartkamp et al. 1999; Lesschen et al. 2007).
    Users concerned by the reliability and the quality of models’ outputs need to
    know how these error sources interact. Uncertainty analysis techniques allow tracking
    down how uncertainties in the input variables and parameters propagate to the
    models’ outputs. They also have to take cross and spatial correlation between
    the various uncertainties and the scale dependency of uncertainties into account
    (Lesschen et al. 2007). There is still a poor understanding of how up- and down-scaling
    influence error propagation when models are interfaced to GIS (Hartkamp et al.
    1999). More quantitative quality indicators together with spatial statistics and
    uncertainty analysis are needed to improve the value of GIS–modeling interfaces.
    2.1.5 Models for genetic improvement Another important component of the model-based
    design of IPS concerns the genetic improvement of plants. The identification of
    genetic traits of plant tolerance or resistance to biotic stress has an important
    role to play in IPS. Moreover, the strong genotype × environment × management
    interactions in agricultural systems make it necessary to design genotypes that
    are adapted to specific agro-environments. This issue is of increasing interest
    to the crop modeling community. Many researchers have used the approach that consists
    of dissecting plant traits via a model based on physiological mechanisms, which
    describes the development of such traits through environment and genetic conditions—namely,
    by means of genetic coefficients (Boote et al. 2001; Hammer et al. 2002; Quilot-Turion
    and Genard 2009). Such an approach has the potential to interpret and predict
    the performance of individual genotypes under different managements and environments.
    On this basis, such models can be used for evaluating genetic improvement, for
    analyzing past genetic improvement from experimental data, and for proposing plant
    ideotypes for target environments (White and Hoogenboom 2003) using appropriate
    optimization algorithms (see “Comparison to other domains and critical analysis”).
    The values of genetic coefficients are often estimated, i.e., determined by numerical
    methods, and such methods require substantial sets of field data. Data are also
    needed to use the models as previously stated. Thus, linking crop models to extensive
    national and international databases, as it has been done in the SEAMLESS project
    framework with a pan-European integrated database (van Ittersum et al. 2008),
    can help to determine genetic coefficients and to allow an increased level of
    crop model applications for policy related to the design and choice of cultivars.
    2.2 Databases and models for climate prediction 2.2.1 Databases As mentioned above,
    the model-based design of IPS requires well-built databases that describe experiments,
    plant genotypes, pest management practices, weather, and economic profitability.
    Many databases have been developed and have contributed to improving agronomic
    data storage and manipulation. They focus on field crop results (Ulery et al.
    1998), genetic varieties (Haley et al. 1999; Zhang et al. 2002; Halling et al.
    2004; Pruss et al. 2005), fruit orchards (Habib et al. 2001; Plenet et al. 2009),
    or are more comprehensive such as the SEAMLESS databases (van Ittersum et al.
    2008). Despite the advances in documentation and protocols for agronomic data
    exchange and use, mainly due to the work of the ICASA group, the definition of
    a set of standards remains necessary (Hunt et al. 2001). It will contribute to
    improving crop modeling per se since there is a recognized need for standardized
    inputs and outputs, both within the modeling community and for potential model
    end-users. Databases describing pest behaviors, dynamics, and inter-specific competition
    must be developed and shared. 2.2.2 Models for climate prediction Climate prediction
    is very important to determine the conditions of emergence, development, and dissemination
    of pests and plants’ diseases. It is also crucial for all of the decision-makers
    involved, i.e., farmers, input suppliers, traders, marketers, and government agencies,
    since climate variability has an impact on agricultural productivity (Hammer et
    al. 2001). It is therefore necessary to take climate prediction into account for
    the design of IPS. The majority of work done in this area has dealt with the impact
    of climatic conditions and climate on agricultural production and resource availability
    for crops. These studies range from the field level to the continental and global
    scales. Reidsma et al. (2009) thus considered the impact of climatic conditions
    and farm characteristics on maize yield. Guerena et al. (2001) used the outputs
    of a general circulation model and a regional climate model as inputs of crop
    models to predict the impact of climate change and CO2 concentration on crops
    and their water use in Spain. Hammer et al. (2001) outlined the basis for climate
    prediction, focusing on the El Niño phenomenon, and catalogued experiences at
    field, national, and global scales in applying climate predictions to agriculture.
    More attention must be paid to this issue and much work remains to be done in
    order to effectively integrate climatic model parameters into crop/pest models.
    For a successful integration, it is important to take into account not only the
    uncertainty but also the spatial scale of validity of climatic predictions. The
    integration itself is mainly an engineering problem that requires joint efforts
    between modelers and climate prediction developers. 2.3 Simulation and model qualities
    The majority of existing crop models are crop species-oriented and characterized
    by a low scientific transparency and code efficiency mainly due to poor modularity
    and limited reuse and sharing. However, to better integrate the tools and models
    listed above, two main qualities are required from these models: modularity and
    genericity. On the one hand, a modular approach helps to avoid duplication of
    effort by allowing the reuse of standard modules. Muetzelfeldt and Massheder (2003)
    cited various solutions to ensure modularity. They include improved software engineering
    practices for implementing models in conventional programming languages, e.g.,
    FSE: base of the DSSAT, APSIM, simulation languages for models based on sets of
    differential–algebraic equations, e.g., DYNAMO, visual modeling environments based
    on the system dynamics paradigm for continuous systems modeling, e.g., POWERSIM,
    and object-oriented/component-based approaches, e.g., MODCOM. They proposed SIMILE,
    a modeling environment that combines system dynamics with object-based paradigms,
    allowing many forms of disaggregation: a clear decomposition of a complex system
    into consistent elementary entities to be handled as well as spatial modeling
    and individual-based modeling (Muetzelfeldt and Massheder 2003). More recently,
    van Ittersum et al. (2008) proposed the SEAMLESS-IF component-based framework
    for the integrated assessment of agricultural systems. They developed an integrated
    framework in which individual knowledge components can be linked through a software
    infrastructure, allowing the use of selected and linked components. Individual
    knowledge components can be biophysical or economic models, databases, or indicators.
    A major interest of this framework is its ability to link and to reuse models
    of different geographical scales and from various domains while guarantying their
    transparency and documentation (Rizzoli et al. 2008; van Ittersum et al. 2008;
    Donatelli et al. 2009). These last two examples illustrate the methodological
    change that can help to overcome many of the drawbacks of existing crop models.
    On the other hand, in order to improve the genericity of crop models, Wang et
    al. (2002) proposed to develop process-oriented models. These models are based
    on common physiological processes and other similarities among crops and the separation
    of code and parameters to facilitate the re-parameterization of the same code
    for various crops. This solution allowed them to design the APSIM-GCROP software
    and to improve the modularity of APSIM (Wang et al. 2002). These principles could
    be applied to other crop/pest models as well. 2.4 Evaluation methods and optimization
    algorithms In studies using model-based design methodologies, there are two omnipresent
    steps: the design or generation of a set of cropping systems and their evaluation
    (deVoil et al. 2006; Loyce and Wery 2006; Bergez et al. 2010). The design of integrated
    production systems is a multicriteria problem since there are many antagonist
    criteria to be satisfied and many constraints to be respected. Therefore, we must
    resort to multiobjective optimization algorithms for the design itself and to
    multi-criteria evaluation techniques to assess the relevance of the cropping systems
    designed. Many multi-criteria evaluation methods have been developed and/or applied
    to assess the robustness of designed cropping systems. They mainly originate from
    the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) domain. Research conducted in the MCDM
    domain during the second half of the twentieth century has given us access to
    practical methods for applying scientific decision theoretical approaches to multi-criteria
    problems (Linkov et al. 2004). They include Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT),
    the outranking procedure represented by the successive ELECTRE versions and PROMETHE
    methods, the mixed methods represented by ORESTE, and the fuzzy methods (Grabisch
    1996). The purpose of all these methods is to allow decision-makers to evaluate
    and choose among alternatives based on tradeoffs between criteria and according
    to their preferences (Linkov et al. 2004; Sadok et al. 2008; Sadok et al. 2009).
    The MAUT algorithm is composed of three main phases: normalization and evaluation
    of the performance of each alternative in terms of its utility, definition of
    the preferential information, i.e., decision-maker’s preferences of each criterion,
    and aggregation using additive, multiplicative operators and ranking of all alternatives.
    The ELECTRE method is based on the outranking relation and comprises three steps:
    construction of the evaluation matrix (alternatives and criteria), calculation
    of the outranking relation, and exploitation of the outranking relation. The final
    ranking has a graphical form and is based on the outranking matrix that includes
    indifference, preference, anti-preference, and incompatibility (Zak 2009). Procedures
    based on outranking have two phases. First, the method uses the extended model
    of decision-maker’s local preferences for individual criteria including indifference,
    weak preference, strong preference, and incompatibility. Second, partial binary
    relationships such as “alternative A is at least as good as alternative B” are
    established for all criteria. ORESTE is a universal multiobjective ranking method
    based on the outranking relation. The ORESTE method algorithm is composed of three
    stages: definition of the input data (alternatives, criteria), construction of
    the global complete pre-order of alternatives, and construction of the global
    partial pre-order of alternatives. The final ranking of alternatives has a graphical
    character and corresponds to the final matrix constructed with the application
    of indifference, preference, and incompatibility relations (Zak 2009). All these
    methods require a fundamental operation known as criteria aggregation or how to
    combine criteria in order to evaluate alternatives. For instance, in MAUT one
    aggregates the individual utility functions, while in ELECTRE one aggregates preference
    relations on pairs of alternatives (Grabisch 1996). The innovation aspect, however,
    was largely focused on the procedure for choosing among alternative solutions
    rather than on the aggregation operation since the most common aggregation tool,
    which is still used today, is the weighted arithmetic mean (Grabisch 1996). There
    has been an increasing interest for fuzzy integrals because of their ability to
    model the interaction between criteria and to overcome the drawbacks of weighted
    sums. Unfortunately, these methods are absent in the agronomic field, whereas
    there are widely used in other domains such as transportation (Grabisch and Labreuche
    2010). For the construction and generation of integrated cropping systems, two
    main approaches may be used. A first one consists of the generation, blindly,
    randomly, or using a complex algorithm, of a large set of strategies, the simulation
    and the evaluation of these strategies, and the application of selection methods
    to choose the best ones. While this method is easy to carry out, it has many drawbacks
    since it may be assumed to be an open loop system: there is no feedback to improve
    the solutions. To address these drawbacks, a second approach is more pragramatic.
    Like the first one, it starts by generating a set of solutions but it attempts
    to improve them iteratively. Using optimization techniques, it focuses on the
    most promising populations within the decision space. The final population of
    solutions will be returned when a stopping criterion, e.g., the number of iterations,
    the objective values, or no improvement, is satisfied. The optimization method
    used for the improvement of the solution population may be control-based or simulation-based.
    The control-based optimization approach is usually used for learning purposes
    when the structure of decision rules, i.e., the control variables involved in
    the rule, has to be determined. Artificial intelligence techniques such as reinforcement
    learning and dynamic programming generally applied to Markov decision problems
    are the most frequently used for this purpose (Bergez et al. 2010). When the structure
    of decision rules is known, the simulation-based approach is the most suitable
    and the most often used. Here, the optimization algorithm attempts to find the
    optimal set of decision rule parameters. The optimization methods used in the
    simulation-based approach case may be divided into methods applied to continuous
    or to discrete decision variables. They include gradient-based optimization methods,
    evolutionary algorithms, simulated annealing, or neural networks (Crespo et al.
    2009). Some of the examples presented in the next section illustrate the use and
    application of the multiobjective optimization and evaluation methods, among others,
    for the model-based design of integrated production systems. 3 Model-based design
    of integrated production systems: examples, comparison to other fields, and critical
    analysis 3.1 Examples of model-based design In this section, we review the recent
    advances in the application of model-based design approaches for the development
    of innovative cropping systems in general and of integrated production systems
    in particular. We present some of the most successful examples of model-based
    design of integrated production systems. We begin by works aimed at the development
    of decision rules for cropping systems management. We then present works based
    on optimal control formulation techniques that usually seek to eliminate the pests.
    Finally, we present works that use more elaborated formulation techniques and
    more efficient optimization techniques such as evolutionary algorithms and simulated
    annealing. 3.1.1 Approaches for the development of decision rules Many researchers
    have studied the possibility of developing decision rules for the management of
    crops/pests and the design of innovative cropping systems. We can distinguish
    two types of approaches. The first one seeks to determine the structure of the
    rule while the second aims to identify the most appropriate rules to be applied
    in the field. Nolot and Debaeke (2003) have proposed a generic procedure that
    corresponds to the first approach by iteratively combining the design of cropping
    systems and the evaluation of their performances. In this approach, the authors
    suggested, after having identified suitable agronomic strategies corresponding
    to a set of criteria and constraints, to translate these strategies into a logical
    set of technical decision rules, to apply and evaluate the rule-based system,
    and to validate or refine the strategy and the rules (Nolot and Debaeke 2003).
    Debaeke et al. (2006) applied this method to the development and testing of rule-based
    crop management systems of sorghum grain under contrasting water regimes in southwestern
    France. The simulation model used was EPIC-Phase, which predicts sorghum yield
    and soil water and N dynamics with reasonable accuracy (Debaeke et al. 2006).
    The same approach was applied by Debaeke et al. (2009) to a range of environmental
    and production contexts in the perspective of integrated crop production prototyping.
    They studied three cropping system experiments in France: Toulouse, Dijon, and
    Versailles. This approach can be considered as hybrid since it relies on models,
    on agronomic background, and on regional references (Debaeke et al. 2009). The
    second approach was used by Tixier et al. (2008) to design sustainable banana-based
    cropping systems. They used SIMBA, a model that simulates interactions between
    banana plants, soil, water, and root nematode populations to assess the yield,
    economic outputs, and environmental risks under a panel of cropping techniques.
    The proposed approach was twofold. First, in order to determine the trends of
    cropping systems performances, the model explored a wide range of decision rules
    by varying the values of their control variables. The authors ranked the cropping
    systems according to the aggregation of evaluation criteria by weighted sum and
    applied an agronomic filter to eliminate the unfeasible systems. They analyzed
    the systems with the best scores to highlight trends. The second step consisted
    of a one-by-one “optimization” of some decision rules by testing different control
    variables to identify the most suitable variables and to precisely determine decision
    rules that should be tested in the field. The evaluation criteria were the gross
    margin and three indicators of potential environmental risks describing water
    exposure to pesticides, erosion, and soil quality. These indicators were based
    on an aggregation of variables using an expert system and fuzzy logic (Tixier
    et al. 2008). The main drawback of the first approach is the lack of information
    on the structure of the decision rules, i.e., which control variables must be
    considered. Efficient methods for learning, in the sense of artificial intelligence,
    are needed to overcome this problem. The model used was very limited since it
    only served evaluation purposes while the design itself was done manually. The
    second approach may be suited to simple systems with small decisional spaces.
    However, it also has some drawbacks including the possibility of losing some good
    strategies due to the filtering techniques and the poor exploration of the decision
    space. 3.1.2 Approaches using optimal control formulations Many researchers have
    used optimal control, a mathematical formulation method, to design integrated
    production systems. This approach is usually used in studies of pest biological
    control and, in general, when the studies focus on IPM techniques. Jerry and Gouzé
    (2004) and Mailleret and Grognard (2009) addressed biological control problems
    in the predator–prey framework and proposed a classical and a general predator–prey
    model with periodic impulsive additions of predators, respectively. These approaches
    consist of finding the optimal initial condition, i.e., the number of predators
    to be introduced at the first release to reduce or to eradicate pests (Jerry and
    Gouzé 2004). Guo and Chen (2009) presented a kind of time-limited pest control
    of a Lotka–Volterra model with impulsive harvest, i.e., withdrawing a number of
    pests from the system at a convenient time, described by the initial and boundary
    value problem of impulsive differential equations. In the majority of these contributions,
    a mathematical analysis of an optimal control problem made it possible to determine
    a necessary and sufficient condition to eradicate the pests (Mailleret and Grognard
    2006; Mailleret and Grognard 2009). Other researchers have used numerical methods
    to solve optimal control problems. Zhang and Swinton (2009) proposed a dynamic
    optimization approach to develop an intra-seasonal dynamic bio-economic optimization
    model for insecticide-based pest management, taking both the biological control
    effect of natural enemies on pest density and the non-target mortality effect
    of insecticides on the level of natural pest control supplied into account. Saphores
    (2000) studied the possibility of spraying a pesticide as a “real option,” using
    a continuous time framework to conveniently analyze the impact of the pest density
    volatility on the timing of pesticide application. The farmer’s decision of applying
    a pesticide was formulated as an optimal sequential stopping problem solved using
    stochastic dynamic programming (Saphores 2000). The mathematical formulation of
    the problem is one of the disadvantages of the optimal control approaches. It
    forces the objective to be quadratic and can barely deal with problem constraints
    in state variables and/or in control variables. Many strong hypotheses are usually
    used in order to facilitate the resolution of such problems. Moreover, such approaches
    usually lead to continuous-time control laws that must be discretized in some
    way to be applied to integrated pest management (Cardoso et al. 2009). 3.1.3 Approaches
    for more elaborated formulations More elaborated and adequate formulations have
    been proposed in the literature for the design of innovative cropping systems,
    not necessarily in agreement with integrated production guidelines. They include
    among others multiobjective mathematical formulation and constraints satisfying
    problems. These formulations are considered as more adequate since they try to
    represent the problem in the most natural and transparent way. Thus, Rossing et
    al. (1997) looked for the optimization of flower bulb production systems within
    a group of growers using interactive multiple goal linear programming. They considered
    three objectives: farm gross margin, pesticide input, and nitrogen surplus. By
    considering these objectives together with the characteristics of the existing
    farming systems and the socio-economic and agronomic constraints, they produced
    a set of optimal strategies (Rossing et al. 1997). The main drawback here is related
    to the linearity of the objectives. In the design of integrated production systems,
    this condition is generally not satisfied. In Loyce et al. (2002b), the authors
    proposed a model-based approach to design prototypes of wheat-based cropping systems
    using the BETHA model (Loyce et al. 2002a). This model simulates and compares
    specified cropping systems on the basis of eight criteria including yield, gross
    margin, pesticide use, and seed quality. This approach includes three steps: generation
    of crop management strategies, evaluation of these strategies, and assignment
    of each one to either the category of good strategies or to that of bad ones.
    The authors formalized the generation of crop management strategies as a constraints
    satisfaction problem, a mathematical problem defined as a set of objects whose
    state must satisfy a number of constraints. They used a resolution method developed
    in the field of artificial intelligence. This resolution algorithm combines filtering
    to reduce the size of variable domains and tree search techniques with backtrack
    procedures to successively allocate the various possible values to each variable.
    The second step consisted of evaluating each crop management strategy using the
    predefined criteria. The evaluation method used in this approach was based on
    the notion of agreement and discordance intervals represented by fuzzy sets and
    used to express the gradual preferences of the decision-maker. Thus, for each
    crop management strategy, they calculated the values of membership functions indicating
    if the given criterion is favorable or opposed to the assignment of this strategy
    to the good or bad category. Finally, the assignment of a crop management strategy
    to a given category resulted from simultaneously satisfying overall agreement
    and overall non-discordance conditions. From our point of view, the aggregation
    operators used in the final step constitute a main drawback of this approach since
    they are close to a weighted sum. Moreover, there are a large number of parameters
    to be determined by the decision-maker. Chatelin et al. (2007) described a method
    for designing winter wheat management strategies using the Déciblé model. This
    method involved the use of a multi-stage procedure in which a simulation tool
    was used to explore a decisional space defined by an expert. They aimed to maintain
    a high wheat yield and grain quality while limiting the risks of nitrogen pollution
    by maintaining post-harvest soil nitrogen content below a given threshold. The
    management strategies were expressed as sets of decision rules for the possible
    technical choices such as cultivar, sowing date, sowing density, and nitrogen
    supply. The main idea behind this step-by-step approach is the progressive limitation
    of the decisional space. This method involved three stages: reduction of the decisional
    space and choice of criteria, choice of subgroup of cultivars in the chosen situations,
    and blind generation of technical management strategies mainly related to cultivar
    choice and N supply. The first stage was based on the situations observed in practice,
    on the possible representation within Déciblé, and on expert knowledge. At the
    second stage, cultivars with low yield or a high environmental risk were eliminated.
    Since the generation method used in this approach is blind, this approach has
    all the drawbacks of this type of generation methods (see above). The reduction
    process of the decisional space may also overlook some interesting strategies
    (Chatelin et al. 2007). Other researchers used decomposition algorithms to develop
    innovative cropping systems. Thus, Crespo et al. (2009) proposed the P2 hierarchical
    decomposition procedure to design irrigation management strategies using the MODERATO
    model. P2 is a simulation-based optimization method and a development of the P2p
    algorithm proposed by Bergez et al. (2004). Promising regions are selected by
    heuristics, divided into two parts, and each of them is evaluated by simulation.
    Different selection, division, and evaluation techniques were tested on a corn
    crop irrigation management problem in order to identify the combination of techniques
    that lead to the most efficient algorithm. The irrigation problem was modeled
    as a continuous stochastic problem with eight continuous parameters. Two criteria
    were used to evaluate solutions: the direct margin and the number of simulation
    runs required to reach it (Crespo et al. 2009). In deVoil et al. (2006), the authors
    used a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm coupled with the APSIM model to optimize
    cropping systems in Northeast Australia. The optimized variables were a discrete
    choice of land use during four seasons and the threshold level of available water
    to plant crops. The cropping system was designed as a 2-year rotation, with cotton
    and sorghum as potential summer crops and wheat and chickpea as winter crops.
    Decisions to be optimized comprised which crop to plant and when and the timing
    of planting in relation to current soil moisture conditions. The authors considered
    three criteria for evaluating the designed cropping systems: gross margin, financial
    risk, and erosion. They used a real multiobjective evaluation technique based
    on the concept of Pareto dominance. In the same way, Letort et al. (2008) used
    genetic algorithms and a functional–structural growth model to investigate the
    design of ideotypes for yield maximization. In order to link growth parameters
    to QTL, the genetic parameters were introduced into the GREENLAB model. The authors
    defined virtual genes and chromosomes to build a simple Mendelian genetic model
    that drove the settings of the species-specific parameters of the model. They
    also used QTL cartographer software to study the QTL detection of simulated plant
    traits. A genetic algorithm was implemented to define the ideotypes for yield
    maximization based on the GREENLAB model parameters and the associated allelic
    combination. They compared virtual QTL detection in the case of phonotypic traits
    and when traits are model parameters, and they found the last case as more accurate.
    Using this approach, the authors were able to calculate the parameters and the
    corresponding genotype associated with yield optimization of maize (Letort et
    al. 2008). Similarly, in Cardoso et al. (2009), the authors used the high-performance
    and well-known Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II for the design of biological
    pest control strategies. They modeled the system as a nonlinear impulsive dynamic
    programming problem and considered both the cost of application of the control
    action and the cost of economic damages. Using this modeling formalism, they hoped
    to effectively cope with the actual control action to be applied, which should
    be performed in a finite number of discrete time instances. The studied case was
    the control of soybean caterpillar by its natural enemies such as wasps and spiders.
    Other research has been conducted using this last family of optimization methods
    that suggests its interest for the design of IPS. Thus, Guan et al. (2009) developed
    a very interesting approach for resource assignments and scheduling based on a
    two-phase metaheuristic for a long-term cropping schedule. The two-phase metaheuristic
    performs the optimization of resource assignments and scheduling based on a simulated
    annealing and genetic algorithm and a hybrid Petri net model (Guan et al. 2009).
    These last approaches do not guarantee the optimality of the obtained solutions
    but they are promising, especially when combining their respective performances.
    For instance, the selection, division, and evaluation techniques developed for
    the hierarchical decomposition may be introduced in the evolutionary algorithms
    instead of its selection and combination operators. Another interesting idea consists
    of using evolutionary algorithms in the hierarchical decomposition approach in
    order to determine the optimal division strategies. 3.2 Comparison to other domains
    and critical analysis Model-based design was originally introduced for embedded
    electronic systems and digital control systems. It has been successfully applied
    in several fields such as automotives, chemicals, aerospace, drug development,
    computer networks, and transportation networks, e.g., public, supply chain, gas,
    and liquids. In this section, we assess the use of the model-based design for
    new drug development and for transportation network design. We attempt to determine
    why model-based design is not yet as advanced for integrated production systems
    as it is for these two cases. The drug design case is among the closest to our
    case study since it has a biotic dimension and the interactions between heterogeneous
    elements, i.e., drug, patient, and environment, are quite visible. When designing
    a drug, researchers look for an organic molecule that activates the function of
    a biomolecule such as a protein, providing a therapeutic benefit to the patient.
    Many promising candidate drugs may turn out to be ineffective or toxic when tested
    on animals or humans. This is due to a poor understanding of the molecular mechanisms
    of the biological systems that they target. Recent advances in biological systems
    modeling have favored the use of the model-based design approach to improve drug
    development (Poland et al. 2006; Schoeberl et al. 2006; Scholz et al. 2006). In
    model-based drug design, mathematical equations are used to create computer-based
    models that represent relationships between drug treatments and observed effects.
    Models combine knowledge of a disease state, relevant biomarkers, and findings
    from pre-clinical and clinical studies with knowledge of placebo responses and
    dropout rates to gain insights into the determinants of efficacy and safety outcomes.
    Model-based drug design uses computational chemistry to develop drugs and related
    biologically active molecules. The fundamental goal is to predict whether a given
    molecule will bind to a target and, if so, how strongly. Many physicochemical
    methods such as knowledge-based scoring functions may be used to provide binding
    affinity estimates. They use techniques from the statistical or artificial intelligence
    domains (linear regression, machine learning, neural networks…) to provide predictive
    binding affinity equations by fitting experimental affinities to computationally
    derived interaction energies between the drug and the target. Computational methods
    have accelerated new drug development by reducing the number of iterations required
    regarding design, synthesis, and testing and have often provided more novel structures.
    Despite its recent introduction and its complexity, model-based drug design has
    enabled pharmaceutical companies to quickly identify optimal pathway targets and
    to determine the best approach. The models enlighten their decisions throughout
    drug development, enabling them to develop targeted therapeutics with higher efficacy
    and fewer side effects. The second case study is transportation networks design.
    There are many common characteristics between transportation networks and integrated
    production systems including the uncertainties, heterogeneity, weather issues,
    spatial distribution, and the intrinsic complexity. In transportation networks,
    complex dynamic processes take place that involve technical, economic, managerial,
    social, and political issues, exactly like in integrated production systems. The
    design of transportation networks focuses on determining the optimal set of operations
    for a given vehicle or set of vehicles so that a prescribed demand is satisfied.
    The main objective of the design process is to increase the capability of transportation
    networks to deal with service variations caused by stochastic events such as incidents,
    bad weather, road works, public events, or vehicle failure. The transportation
    networks design problem and all of its variants have been well researched within
    the operations research community. A great deal of modeling work has been done
    in this area including mathematical modeling, graphs, neural networks, Petri nets,
    multi-agent systems, and fuzzy logic (Ding and Guting 2004; Strub and Bayen 2006;
    Wu et al. 2006; Alecsandru et al. 2007; Celikoglu and Cigizoglu 2007; Ding 2008;
    Murat and Uludag 2008; Sidi et al. 2008a; Sidi et al. 2008b; Demongodin 2009;
    Tortum et al. 2009; Xie and Levinson 2009). Optimizing the configuration and the
    planning of transportation networks is a very difficult problem. However, model-based
    design approaches have greatly contributed to this area and have helped transporters
    to increase their service quality. Many optimization methods have been developed
    and applied to the models mentioned above. These techniques range from linear
    programming algorithms to more complex ones such as spanning tree algorithms,
    evolutionary algorithms, taboo search, simulated annealing, and specific heuristics
    (Current et al. 1987; Lotarev 1989; Klempous et al. 1994; Babel and Kellerer 2003;
    Nepal and Park 2005; Creput and Koukam 2007; Song et al. 2007; Sanchez-Silva et
    al. 2009; Unnikrishnan et al. 2009; Yao and Hsu 2009). The model-based design
    approach has proved to be more efficient and more effective in the cases of new
    drug development and of transportation networks than in the case of integrated
    production systems. This is certainly due in part to the relative simplicity of
    drug development and transportation networks design compared to integrated production
    systems. Because of this simplicity, the developed models are more comprehensive
    than the agronomic models, which are generally developed for a specific part of
    the agroecosystem under study, e.g., growth models, plant architecture models,
    nitrogen and carbon models. For example, transportation models take into account
    all of the system’s components, i.e., vehicles, passengers, routes, as well as
    its environment. The weather is considered through climate prediction models and
    the spatial distribution of the networks is usually taken into account via GIS
    and other tools. However, from our point of view, this is also due to a higher
    quality of the modeling done by leading researchers and engineers, especially
    in the case of transportation. This better modeling practice may be explained
    by various reasons. First, the modeling formalisms used in the transportation
    sector are usually more efficient and modern than those used in agronomic models
    because of the permanent exchange between transportation companies and software
    and technology editors. There are many enterprises that edit solutions, especially
    for the planning, regulation, and design of transportation networks. Second, data
    availability is not comparable between integrated production systems and transportation
    and drug design. Transportation companies as well as pharmaceutical companies
    have their own databases that describe all of the aspects of their systems and
    can provide modelers with necessary data in order to perform test and validate
    models. They also sometimes provide the means for purchasing required supplementary
    data when necessary. Third, despite the similarity of contexts and the importance
    of this task for the design process, the mathematical formulation of the objectives
    and the constraints is generally of better quality in the transportation sector
    than in agronomy. For example, the regularity of vehicles is determined by the
    time interval that separates the successive passages at the same station, and
    this formulation remains unchanged in all transportation models. Unfortunately,
    in the agronomic domain, there are as many formulations as there are models, even
    for a criterion such as the gross margin. It is truly difficult to standardize
    objectives and constraints in the case of agronomy, contrary to that of drugs
    or transportation. The progress reported in these two case studies may also be
    explained by another factor that cannot be overlooked: the importance of economic
    issues and challenges. The money allotted to transportation and drug design is
    considerable compared to that devoted to integrated production systems, which
    usually comes from the public budget. Finally, the introduction of systems approaches
    and the use of model-based design are relatively recent in agronomy compared to
    transportation. New advances in agronomic modeling will certainly and rapidly
    change the current situation. 4 Efficiency of model-based design As illustrated
    in the previous sections, many crop/pest/predator models, databases, GIS, and
    other tools have been developed for the simulation of agroecosystem performance.
    Nevertheless, the model-based design of integrated production systems is not yet
    accomplished and has not yet produced the expected results, with the exception
    of a few prototypes. The reasons for this difficulty concern the models and their
    specifications. Moreover, the application of modern design to this domain is still
    in its infancy. In the following section, we address modeling quality and targets
    and propose a methodological framework for using models to design IPS. 4.1 Modeling
    Adopting modeling methods used in other domains—such as DEVS used in the RECORD
    platform (Chabrier et al. 2007) and developed by INRA (French Institute for Agricultural
    Research)—would improve crop/pest models and their capacity to interact with other
    models. These formalisms allow us to use tools that have already been developed
    to develop more operational tools and, especially, to integrate heterogeneous
    formalisms. Furthermore, the development of modeling platforms that make it possible
    to integrate the necessary ingredients for the design of integrated production
    systems, i.e., crop/pest/predator models, databases, GIS, genetic improvement
    models, optimization and evaluation methods, etc., would enhance the modeling
    procedure and accelerate the design process. However, in order to facilitate the
    integration of these elements, each one must be designed in this spirit. The lack
    of modularity and genericity of current agricultural models makes it difficult
    to adapt these models to new crops and more generally prevents their reuse and
    sharing (Loyce and Wery 2006). Genericity can be enhanced by promoting process-oriented
    modeling rather than the crop species-oriented modeling usually used in the existing
    models. Regarding the modularity of models, the use of object-oriented and component-based
    techniques combined with other paradigms such as systems dynamics has proved to
    be very effective. As mentioned in “Model-based design of integrated production
    systems: brief overview of the elements involved”, the drawbacks of current agricultural
    models include their lack of adequacy with respect to the need of IPS. Most crop
    models that address the “production” component of IPS ignore pests and other biotic
    elements, making it difficult to take cultural innovations in terms of IPS and
    biodiversity issues into account. With respect to plant/pest/antagonist interactions,
    the challenge is to model complex trophic networks since, for example, pest communities
    impair the functioning of plants. Models such as WHEATPEST (Willocquet et al.
    2008) and RICEPEST (Willocquet et al. 2002) must be developed and included in
    modeling platforms. The spatial dimension must also be more effectively integrated
    into models such as in the work of Stoorvogel et al. (2004). Combining GIS and
    artificial intelligence technologies, especially learning techniques, holds promise
    for the future and remains to be explored. The development of models would profit
    from a better involvement of stakeholders concerned by decision-making, considering
    the various levels of decision, e.g., local, regional, national (Giller et al.
    2008), and from experts. The use of new protocols, methods, and formalisms devoted
    to the extraction of information, such as those used by Leger and Naud (2009),
    must be encouraged in order to more effectively take professional and expert knowledge
    into account. Finally, model study and evaluation, difficult tasks because of
    the heterogeneity of data and the multiplicity of factors influencing model outputs
    (Bellocchi et al. 2009), must be more closely considered since they allow us to
    determine both model reliability and model usefulness. When properly used, sensitivity
    analysis and other statistical methods can help us with this task. Other methods
    such as evolutionary algorithms may enhance this practice, as demonstrated in
    (Komuro et al. 2006) for the assessment of models during their construction. 4.2
    Design: criteria choice, optimization, evaluation Once the development of comprehensive
    models is achieved, the model-based design itself may be dealt with. As previously
    mentioned, there are four steps in this process: the definition of objectives
    and constraints, design, evaluation, and choice and dissemination of the proposed
    systems. The first and the fourth steps are generally neglected, while the design
    and evaluation steps are omnipresent in studies using model-based design methodologies.
    However, the definition of criteria and constraints and their mathematical formulation
    are key elements in the model-based design approach and are very important for
    the choice of evaluation methods and optimization algorithms to be used in the
    design and evaluation steps. The choice of evaluation criteria can be improved
    based on preliminary tests and by using techniques such as principal component
    analysis, sensitivity analysis, or tradeoff curves (Stoorvogel et al. 2004). All
    of these methods can enable to identify the possible relationships between the
    criteria. Experts and stakeholders can also express their opinions and thus help
    modelers to determine the degree of redundancy or complementarities between criteria
    and recommend the criteria to be taken into account. At this stage, conflicts
    can appear and a formal negotiation approach can help their resolution as demonstrated
    by Giller et al. (2008). Another asset, which is hardly ever used, makes it possible
    to ground virtual design on solid bases. This is the set of constraints for each
    decision variable and their combination that we can impose on the resolution algorithm
    in the design step. When the criteria are chosen and the constraints defined in
    workmanlike, the model-based design of integrated production systems may be formulated
    as a multiobjective optimization problem. This problem is then treated using various
    approaches that mainly deal with the exploration of the decision space and the
    evaluation of the solutions obtained during this exploration. As discussed in
    “Model-based design of integrated production systems: brief overview of the elements
    involved” and “Model-based design of integrated production systems: examples,
    comparison to other fields, and critical analysis” of this paper, many multiobjective
    evaluation methods and optimization algorithms have been developed or applied
    for the design of integrated production systems. The complexity of the problems
    and the difficulty of analytically expressing the criteria and constraints in
    terms of decision variables promote the use of the simulation-based approach rather
    than the control-based approach. New optimization methods such as multiobjective
    evolutionary algorithms combined with efficient quantitative aggregative methods
    such as fuzzy integrals are quite well suited to IPS design. Another promising
    avenue is the development of non-aggregative approaches that aim to find a real
    compromise between the evaluation criteria and to provide decision-makers with
    a set of compromise solutions known as Pareto-optimal solutions. These solutions
    represent the best tradeoff across all criteria since no other solution is more
    effective when all of the objectives are considered. This approach makes it possible
    to avoid the drawbacks of aggregative methods that are more sensitive to the shape
    of the Pareto-optimal front. 4.3 Choice and dissemination The qualitative decision-making
    family, which include methods such as the MAUT (see “Evaluation methods and optimization
    algorithms”), is more convenient for comparison purposes when the cardinal of
    the solution set is small and for the choice of the best systems when the design
    and evaluation steps have been achieved. The set of solutions returned by the
    multiobjective optimization algorithm from the design and evaluation steps can
    be compared using tools such as DEXI (Sadok et al. 2009) in order to select the
    best one. Tradeoff analysis techniques are also helpful since they allow representing
    graphically the tradeoff curves and studying the effect of all solutions on the
    position and slope of these curves (Stoorvogel et al. 2004). The model-based design
    cannot and does not aim to replace experimentation but, instead, to facilitate
    the choice of the most promising production systems (Sterk et al. 2007). The candidate
    systems proposed by this approach should be tested against real conditions, experimented,
    and, if necessary, adjusted before being recommended to a few testers, re-adjusted
    if necessary and then evaluated within wider networks. If all of the steps prove
    themselves to be successful and fruitful, the best strategies or the best systems
    can then be recommended to producers and policymakers in order to help them make
    the most effective choices for the greatest benefit to society. References Akplogan

    SECTION I. Introduction Irrigation management plays a critical role in determining
    crop yield and water use efficiency. Crop yield largely depends on sufficient
    water supply. Yet, fresh water resource is limited. Ideally, one likes to irrigate
    the exact amount of water that is needed by crop, no more and no less. In history,
    such precise irrigation control was very difficult, if not impossible. Nowadays,
    wireless sensors, internet and advanced irrigation machines enable Site-Specific
    Variable Rate Irrigation (SS-VRI) and make the goal of precise irrigation control
    realistic. Wireless sensors can help monitor soil moisture levels at real-time
    and therefore can provide closed-loop feedback to irrigation control. They have
    caught a lot of attention in irrigation applications. However, many existing works
    are restricted to the construction of wireless sensor network and demonstration
    of its benefit. There is some effort on developing advanced irrigation algorithms
    making use of wireless sensors and/or weather information. A model predictive
    control approach is proposed in [1]. During a crop growing season, the control
    takes current sensor and weather data as inputs and makes irrigation decisions
    according to predicted outcome. Although the use of sensor and weather data can
    largely overcome the deficiencies of traditional irrigation approaches, the prediction
    still relies on accurate models, which are not always available. A neuro-dynamic
    programming method is described in [2]. It is essentially a Markov decision process
    with model based reinforcement learning. Its drawback is the adoption of a linear
    model, which is an over-simplification of reality. We propose a model-free reinforcement
    learning [3] approach for irrigation control that makes use of soil moisture sensor
    and weather information. Since it is model-free, it avoids the dependence on potentially
    inaccurate models. Its decision policy can be learned from simulations as well
    as real data, including soil moisture sensor data and actual crop yield. In reinforcement
    learning, a key element is the reward function, which tells if an action is generally
    good or poor. For agricultural irrigation, the critical reward-crop yield, is
    not known until the end of a crop season. Such delayed reward is naturally handled
    by the temporal difference [3] approach in reinforcement learning. Due to limited
    real data, offline learning through simulation is still important. To this end,
    fast models based on neural network are developed to facilitate scalable learning.
    The proposed method is simulated by a fast model developed upon DSSAT (The Decision
    Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) [4], which is the de facto standard
    model for crop growth. The simulation-based comparisons with other methods indicate
    that our approach can improve net return by around 50% with consideration of both
    water use and crop yield. SECTION II. Background Fig. 1. Factors of water gain
    and loss in soil. Show All The amount of water in soil varies over time depending
    on many factors. Shown in Figure 1, there are 5 major ways of water loss and 2
    ways of water gain. Due to gravity(drainage), some of the retained water is pulled
    out of root zone to deeper layers; such loss is called deep percolation. Evapotranspiration
    (ET) is the combination of transpiration and evaporation. Evapotranspiration accounts
    for plant water use (transpiration) and water evaporated from the soil and wet
    surfaces (evaporation). In arid and semi-arid areas, insufficient availability
    of water in the crop root zone often is the primary limiting factor for crop yield.
    Even in relatively humid environments, seasonal or occasional drought conditions
    can result in water-limiting growing conditions, warranting irrigation as a risk
    management option to protect against yield loss. To show the importance of irrigation,
    DSSAT simulations of maize growth at Temple, Texas according to the weather of
    1984 are performed for different irrigation plans. This simple experiment compares
    yield under no irrigation, and irrigations of 20mm/10days, 30mm/10days, and 40mm/10days.
    The precipitation during the period is plotted in Figure 2. The variation of total
    water in the profile is depicted in Figure 3. The final results are compared in
    Table I. Fig. 2. Precipitation during the period of simulated crop season. In
    total, there is 219 mm of rainfall. Show All Fig. 3. Total soil water in the profile
    during period of simulated crop season. The peak at day 26 is caused by the storm
    on day 25. Without sufficient amount of water supply, the total soil water drops
    bellow 540mm for 21 days until the every end of the crop season when it rains
    on day 74. Show All Table I Comparison of yield under different irrigation plan
    From Table I, one can easily see that irrigation makes a big difference. Under
    the 20mm/10days plan, with 160mm water supplied in total, yield is increased by
    176.6%. But, does more irrigation necessarily increase yield? Not exactly. Comparing
    the yield under 20, 30, 40 mm/day, one can see that 10mm more water on top of
    20mm/10days can boost the yield by 10%, but further increase water supply to 40
    mm every time actually suppresses the yield by 8%. Water requirements vary by
    crop and growth stage. For example, excess water at germination stage can cause
    poor aeration and discourage proper root development. Therefore, supplying the
    crop with the right amount of water at the right time becomes increasingly important
    (as well as practically achievable) in modern agriculture. The best timing and
    amount are very difficult to determine in traditional practice, wherein farmers
    often use fixed interval irrigation scheduling. The major problems with this strategy
    are that it lacks flexibility and precision to adjust for precipitation and soil
    water balance, increasing risk of over-watering (wasting water) or under-watering
    the crop, leading to yield losses. Facilitated by the development of wireless
    sensor technology, threshold-based irrigation scheduling becomes a straightforward
    approach. Once the soil moisture value drops below a threshold, the system starts
    to irrigate with a fixed amount. It can largely reduce water waste. Yet, the question
    of how much to be irrigated is not well answered. SECTION III. Previous Works
    A basic and naïve irrigation decision process is to irrigate fixed amount of water
    at a constant frequency. Sophisticated irrigation management technologies evolve
    along two orthogonal directions: advanced algorithms and utilization of modern
    hardware technologies such as wireless sensors and internet. The research on algorithmic
    approaches started decades ago [5], and various optimization techniques have been
    studied. Irrigation scheduling is formulated and solved by nonlinear programming
    in [6]. Its weakness is the lack of consideration of many uncertainties in soil,
    crop and weather conditions. The uncertainties were addressed by stochastic dynamic
    programming in [7], [8]. Later, genetic algorithm was applied to optimize irrigation
    scheduling [9]. A learning control technique was proposed in [10], where an analytical
    model was applied to control soil moisture level without considering crop yield.
    These techniques were mostly developed before wireless sensor technology, and
    therefore highly depended on the accuracy of models, which was not always reliable.
    Wireless sensor is a critical step in the progress of irrigation technology, as
    it provides real-time feedback of soil moisture levels. Early works [11], [12]
    were mostly to demonstrate the benefit of using soil moisture sensors integrated
    with wireless communication. Soil moisture sensors were also applied to train
    neural network-based soil moisture model [13], which was very useful in irrigation
    scheduling. Infrared temperature sensors and multiband radiometers were installed
    on the irrigation machine to monitor crop leaf stress level [14], and operated
    together with threshold based irrigation control [15]. Through internet connection,
    irrigation control can further incorporate weather conditions and weather forecast
    information. A model predictive control (MPC) approach was developed [1] that
    considered both sensor and weather data. Such approach was much more advanced
    than the offline optimization techniques [6]–[9]. However, the prediction part
    still largely relied on model accuracy. A neuro-dynamic programming-based irrigation
    control method was proposed in [2]. Its key elements included Markov decision
    process and model-based reinforcement learning. However, it used a linear model,
    which was a simplification of the actually complicated crop growth mechanism.
    More detailed reviews on irrigation scheduling and control techniques were presented
    in [16], [17]. Modern irrigation machines allow the application rate of individual
    nozzles to be separately controlled, and therefore enable the concept of site-specific
    variable rate irrigation (SS-VRI). However, a study [18] showed that the actual
    adoption of SS-VRI by farmers is quite limited. A key reason is that there is
    no mature irrigation control software fulfilling the potentials promised by SS-VRI.
    SECTION IV. Problem Model and Formulation A crops growth process can be viewed
    as a Markov chain, which is a model for probabilistic transitions among a set
    of states S={ s 1 , s 2 ,…} over time. In agricultural irrigation, each state
    s i ∈S is defined as the total soil water (TSW) level at a certain crop growth
    stage. Depending on specific types of crop and soil, the minimum soil moisture
    level (management allowable depletion threshold) is set to be higher than the
    permanent wilting point (PWP), at which plants can no longer extract water from
    soil and thus die. We set each time step to be 3 days, considering normal irrigation
    cycle time of most center-pivot machines and speed of water penetration. This
    setting is tunable. The Irrigation decision is to choose among a set of actions
    A={ a 1 , a 2 ,…} defined as irrigating the soil until a designated target filling
    point (TPF) is reached. The decision of what action to take directly affects the
    state that can be reached at next time step. Therefore, this is a Markov decision
    process (MDP). In MDP, an action a j ∈A at certain state s i ∈S leads to an immediate
    reward r( s i , a j ) . The strategy of choosing actions at each time step is
    summarized as a policy, which usually aims to maximize a long term return or cumulative
    reward. In agricultural irrigation, the long term return is defined as the Net
    Return: NetReturn=Y∗ P y −C∗ P c (1) View Source where Y is crop yield with unit
    kg/ha,C is water use with unit ha−mm/ha, P y and P c represent product and water
    price with units of dollars/kg and dollars/mm, respectively. Different from most
    previous works, the objective of this research is not optimizing merely water
    use or yield, rather the optimization of net return. Farmers can use it as a direct
    measurement of their economic gain, and are able to adjust the strategy according
    to the future market and the water price [19]–[21]. SECTION V. Reinforcement Learning-Based
    Irrigation Control There are several methods to derive a policy for MDP [3]. Classical
    MDP assumes complete knowledge of state transition probabilities, which are difficult
    to obtain in reality. The model-based reinforcement learning approach in [2] assumes
    a linear model, which is an over-simplification of reality. In this work, we adopt
    model-free reinforcement learning [3]. It does not depend on any assumption or
    prior knowledge, but largely acquires experience by interacting with the environment.
    At each time step, the agent, which in our case is the irrigation controller,
    depending on current state s∈S , takes action a∈A , and observes an immediate
    reward r . At next time step, the previous reward r is discounted by the factor
    γ , whose value is between 0 and 1. This term γ controls the preference of the
    agent''s behavior. When γ=1 , the agent would take long-term strategy, while if
    0, the agent would only strive for large immediate reward. The quality of a state-action
    pair is specified by function Q(s,a) , which defines the expected cumulative reward
    by being at state s and taking action a . Its value is largely decided by reward
    resulting from a trajectory of state-action pairs. A challenge in irrigation is
    that crop yield, the critical reward, is not known until the end of crop season.
    The temporal difference learning algorithm SARSA (λ) [3] is an approach for handling
    such delayed reward. It updates Q functions for state-action pairs backwards according
    to the eligibility trace, in which λ controls the eligibility (or the relevance
    of later reward to previous state-action pairs). A common issue faced by reinforcement
    learning is the tradeoff between exploitation and exploration. To be more specific,
    an agent explores the environment and learns from experience. However, at early
    stages, heavily relying on learned Q values or exploitation to make decisions
    may close doors for discovering better routes. While at later stages, it would
    be a waste to spend too much time on exploration rather than using existing knowledge.
    A popular approach for addressing the exploitation-exploration tradeoff is the
    ϵ -greedy algorithm [3], where the action with the so far largest Q value is taken
    with probability 1 −ϵ and an action is randomly chosen among all actions with
    probability ϵ . At state s , action a is taken according to ϵ -greedy algorithm.
    Then reward r is received and the state transits to s ′ . Let a ′ be the next
    action according to ϵ -greedy algorithm. The Q value of the state-action pair
    ( s ′ , a ′ ) is updated with the temporal difference: δ=r+γQ( s ′ , a ′ )−Q(s,a)
    (2) View Source The program keeps a record of the eligibility trace e(s,a) . After
    each visit, the eligibility value of current state action pair is added by 1:
    e(s,a)←e(s,a)+1 (3) View Source After each visit, all entries of the Q table are
    updated according to the δ and e(s,a) with a learning rate α . Q(s,a)←Q(s,a)+aδe(s,a)
    (4) View Source The eligbility is discounted by the product of γ and λ so that
    rewards obtained at later time steps are updated according to relevance of previous
    state-action pair. The longer distance, the smaller relevance, and therefore less
    weights on the updates. e(s,a)←γλe(s,a) (5) View Source The above process is repeated
    until either the Q table is converged or the policy is sufficiently stabilized.
    Please note this process contains both learning and decision makings. SECTION
    VI. Implementation A. Fast Models by Neural Network In order to learn what is
    good and bad in terms of policy, the agent must interact with the environment
    sufficiently. However, such process is extremely slow since learning from one
    actual crop season takes 90-120 days depending on the types of crop and time of
    planting. Thus, to shorten the learning process, simulation model packages such
    as DSSAT [4] can be of great help. However, directly incorporating DSSAT is very
    difficult, since the control of its irrigation scheduling requires either manual
    editing through its own GUI or a perfect understanding of its source code, which
    was written in Fortran. To make the Q function training more scalable, we develop
    a cascaded Neural Network (NN) model as a surrogate to DSSAT. The front end of
    this model is an NN that takes irrigation and weather information as inputs and
    predicts TSW for a geographic location. The backend model is another NN that predicts
    crop yield given daily TSWs of an entire crop season. Since final yield is closely
    related to the TSW during the simulated crop season, one can run some random irrigation
    plans and extract TSW tables as inputs, and use the obtained yields as targets
    to train the backend crop yield NN. The input to crop yield NN is from the output
    of front end NN that predicts daily TSW. TSW level can be affected by not only
    precipitation and irrigation, but also ET, runoff, and percolation, which themselves
    vary by many factors such as soil type, solar radiation, wind speed, and temperatures,
    etc. In DSSAT, the TSW is calculated by a set of very complicated but relatively
    accurate models. In our work, data obtained from DSSAT simulations are used to
    train the front end TSW NN. Figure 4 shows the steps to construct our simulation
    system. Fig. 4. The process to construct cascade NN s for simulation using DSSAT
    data. Show All B. Implementation of SARSA (λ) for Irrigation Control In the SARSA
    (λ) algorithm, although each time step is 3 days'' long, precise prediction of
    yield still requires daily TSW data. As described in Algorithm 1, the program
    first translates time step i to days [j,j+2] . Then, it calculates irrigation
    water depth I j for day j according to current TS W j , and the TFP (Target Filling
    Point) decided by actions in A , using a function I rrigationAmount(). Because
    frequent small irrigation applications result in large evaporation loss and discourages
    deep root development, we require the depth of any irrigation application to be
    at least 20mm . Once the amount is determined, the program runs NN function PredTSW
    () to produce TSW values for the following 3 days. The function takes current
    TSW, irrigation (if any), ET, and precipitation R as inputs. Algorithm 1: Generate
    Daily TSW and Irrigation Record The reward function design for the SARSA (λ) learning
    in irrigation warrants particular discussion. The long term return is the net
    return resulted from crop yield and water expense. Since water use occurs multiple
    times throughout a crop season, one approach is to count their expense immediately
    after each irrigation action. However, this approach brings two problems. First,
    the reward due to water use is negative since obviously it is to be minimized
    instead of being maximized. A negative reward often results in negative Q values,
    which cause trouble in the exploitation-exploration tradeoff. More specifically,
    a good action a ∗ may temporarily have negative Q value while another under-explored
    action a ′ may have zero Q value even though it is a very poor action. Such discrepancy
    would mislead the subsequent learning process. Second, the reward is discounted
    by eligibility trace in the SARSA (λ) learning. As such, the same dollar amount
    for water use and crop yield is treated with different weights. To overcome these
    problems, we defer the reward associated with water use to the end of crop season.
    In other words, all time steps in the middle of a season have 0 immediate reward
    and there is only a single reward-the net return, at the end of a season. Algorithm
    2 provides a complete description of the learning process. Every simulated crop
    season is considered as an episode, consisting of n time steps. The program starts
    with a randomly generated Q table, note that Q values of all state-action pairs
    should be relatively small in magnitude compared to the rewards. At each time
    step, the agent takes an action and runs function SimuTSW() to obtain TSW and
    irrigation record for the current time step. The reward function is designed such
    that all the immediate rewards are 0, except for the last one. The final reward
    is the net return, calculated by Equation (1). Note that if net return is smaller
    than a desired value threshold, then it will be assigned a small negative value
    −50. Such design helps to differentiate good policy from bad ones dramatically.
    In addition, a small negative value would stimulate agent to favor other unexplored
    state action pairs, thus making it faster to find good policies. Algorithm 2:
    ARSA (λ) in Irrigation Table II General information of test cases Q table and
    eligibility trace are updated at the end of each time step accordingly. Upon completion
    of each episode, the eligibility is reset to be all Os, but the Q table will be
    kept as a reference to continue learning until convergence. SECTION VII. Experiment
    To evaluate effectiveness of the proposed techniques, simulations are run on 4
    different locations, as shown in Table II: Temple, Texas, United States; Kunnunurra,
    Australia; Hyderabad, India; and Saskatchewan, Canada. The first three fields
    are planted with maize, and the last field is planted with wheat. These testcases
    are summarized in Table II. A. Results on Neural Network Modeling All NN s for
    predicting TSW and crop yield are trained with single hidden layer consisting
    of 10 neurons. The training algorithm is Levenberg-Marquardt [22]. Samples are
    divided into training, validation, and testing sets. NN s are trained on training
    sets, and validated by validation sets, which are used to tell when to stop training.
    The accuracy of NN s are measured on the test sets to provide unbiased results.
    Figure 5 to 8 show the training performance for the Temple case. Regression measures
    the correlation between targets and outputs, the closer to 1, the better. In the
    error histogram, the smaller and more concentrated around zero, the more accurate.
    Limited by space, the training performance evaluation for the other 3 cases are
    not presented here. But the statistics are all very promising as summarized in
    Table III. Fig. 5. NN training regression for predicting yield at temple, TX,
    us. The overall regression goodness of fit above 0.95. Show All Fig. 6. NN training
    error histogram for predicting yield at temple, us. Most errors are concentrated
    around 0, the relative error is within 0.1 % Show All Fig. 7. NN training regression
    for predicting TSW at temple, us. The performance is almost perfect with all sets
    above 0.999. Show All Fig. 8. NN training error histogram for predicting TSW at
    temple, us. Most errors are within +/-2 mm Show All Using NN has significantly
    improved learning efficiency, as running each episode costs less than 2 seconds.
    If all done in DSSAT, considering manually adjusting irrigation plan takes approximately
    1 hour for each episode, and the rule of thumb that Q-table normally converges
    after 500 iterations, the time cost would be unmanageable. Table III Summary of
    NNS training regressions B. Results on Reinforcement Learning Irrigation Control
    States in reinforcement learning are defined according to crop growth stage and
    TSW. The state definitions for Temple and Saskatchewan are shown in Table IV and
    V, respectively, and the state definitions for the other two locations are similar.
    In the tables, the header rows are ranges of TSW with unit mm. The header columns
    are time steps. Each entry in the table is a state ID. Since the soil and crop
    type in Temple, Kunnunurra, and Hyderabad are the same, the division of TSW levels
    are the same in those cases. However, as they differ in geolocation, planting
    date, and weather conditions, the length of the crop seasons and definition of
    growth stages have some variance. The actions for all four cases are defined in
    Table VI. Action 1 is to wait, the rest actions are to irrigate until TSW reaches
    designated Target Filling Point (TPF). Table IV State definition of case temple,
    texas, united states Table V State definition of case saskatchewan, canada Table
    VI Definition of actions in all four cases The proposed learning control method
    is compared with Fixed scheduling: a fixed amount of water is irrigated every
    10 days. Threshold-based irrigation: a fixed amount of water is irrigated at a
    time step (3days) if the soil moisture level is below a certain threshold. At
    the time of this analysis was conducted, according to the Food and Agriculture
    Organization of the United Nations (FAO), international maize and wheat prices
    are around 200 USD/tonne [19], [20]. The cost of irrigation for every 1ha-mm/ha
    is about 1 USD [21]. The following results are produced based on those price settings.
    It is worth mentioning the way we handle the exploration and exploitation trade
    off. To achieve a good balance, ϵ is initialized to be 0.7 to encourage exploration.
    As the experience accumulates, the decision making increases its reliance on existing
    knowledge. As learning continues, ϵ decreases. To be more specific, if the number
    of learned episode N<300,ϵ←0.7−0.002N ; when N>=300,ϵ← 1/N − − − − √ for each
    episode. Fig. 9. Comparison of TSW profile under different irrigation methods
    in the temple case. Show All Table VII Comparison of performance under different
    irrigation methods in the temple case Table VIII Comparison of performance under
    different irrigation methods in the kunnunurra case The advantage of adopting
    learning method can be seen from comparing TSW curves in Figure 9 to 12. In Figure
    11, the TSW takes off, even the field does not need that much water. Yet, when
    water is lost too quickly, in Figure 12, fixed method could not keep up with crop
    demand. Although threshold-based method avoids these problems, it is still not
    flexible enough. In Figure 9, the learning method initially keeps TSW at low level
    but increases water supply at later stages. Such arrangement makes perfect sense
    in agriculture, since at early growth stages, like germination, crops are small
    and roots are shallow, thus crop water demand is lower compared to later stages.
    The computer does not understand the science in agriculture, but somehow learned
    the trick from exploration. Fig. 10. Comparison of TSW profile under different
    irrigation methods in the kunnunurra case. Show All Fig. 11. Comparison of TSW
    profile under different irrigation methods in the hyderabad case. Show All Fig.
    12. Comparison of TSW profile under different irrigation methods in the saskatchewan
    case. Show All Table IX Comparison of performance under different irrigation methods
    in the hyderabad case Table X Comparison of performance under different irrigation
    methods in the saskatchewan case From the result shown in Table VII–X, one can
    see that the performance of the learning method stands out in every case. In Temple,
    the net return was improved by 27.1 % and 15.6%, compared to the average of threshold-based
    and fixed scheduling method, respectively. In Kunnunurra, the increased profits
    are 56.9% and 136.2%; in Hyderabad, 96.4% and 38%, and Saskatchewan, 6.4% and
    49.2%. Not only that, the learning also conserves water, in most cases, the water
    consumption under learning method is lower than threshold-based and fixed scheduling
    method. Of all tested 4 cases, the learning method outperforms the threshold-based
    method by 46.7%, and fixed scheduling by 59.8% on average net return. SECTION
    VIII. Conclusions Agricultural irrigation plays a critical role in addressing
    the challenge of fresh water shortage. The progress of wireless sensor and internet
    technologies allows advanced site-specific variable rate irrigation, which has
    not been fully exploited yet. A reinforcement learning based control approach
    is proposed. Its training can be carried out either through online crop growth
    season or offline simulations. A neural network infrastructure is built to facilitate
    efficient trainings. Its successful implementation opens an promising alternative
    in future computational agricultural research. Simulations for different crop
    types at various geographic locations show that the proposed method outperforms
    fixed irrigation scheduling by 59.8% and threshold based approach by 46.7% on
    average net return. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More

    \ over 9 billion by 2050, which will require an increase in agricultural and food\n\
    production by 70% to ﬁt the need, a serious challenge for the agri-food industry.\
    \ Such requirement, in a context of resources\nscarcity, climate change, COVID-19\
    \ pandemic, and very harsh socioeconomic conjecture, is diﬃcult to fulﬁll without\
    \ the in-\ntervention of computational tools and forecasting strategy. Hereby,\
    \ we report the importance of artiﬁcial intelligence and machine\nlearning as\
    \ a predictive multidisciplinary approach integration to improve the food and\
    \ agriculture sector, yet with some\nlimitations that should be considered by\
    \ stakeholders.\n1. Introduction\nTe estimation of the global food production\
    \ must be in-\ncreased by 60–110% to feed 9-10 billion of the population by\n\
    2050 [1, 2]. Tus, the sustainability of agriculture ﬁeld is the\nkey to guarantee\
    \ food security and hunger eradication for\nthe ever-growing population. In addition,\
    \ due to the ap-\npearance of several food safety scandals and incidents in the\n\
    food sector such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy and\ndioxin in poultry [3],\
    \ a well-documented traceability system\nhas become a requirement for quality\
    \ control in the food\nchain. Moreover, weather and climate change conditions,\n\
    together with the sustainable water management due to\nwater scarcity, are crucial\
    \ challenges in the next years. For\nthese reasons, urgently, the establishment\
    \ of a strategic shift\nfrom the current paradigm of enhanced agricultural pro-\n\
    ductivity to agricultural sustainability is needed. To antici-\npate eﬃcient solutions,\
    \ helping farmers and stakeholders to\nenhance their decision by adopting sustainable\
    \ agriculture\npractices is a crucial choice, especially the use of digital\n\
    technologies including Internet of things (Iot), Artiﬁcial\nIntelligence (AI),\
    \ and cloud computing. Additionally, the\nsubsets of AI (machine and deep learning\
    \ algorithms)\ncombined with location intelligence technologies are ex-\ntensively\
    \ used. Te goal of our review is to present the main\napplications of artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence and machine learning\ntechniques in the agri-food sector.\n2. Artificial\
    \ Intelligence and Machine\nLearning Approach\nTe artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)\
    \ is a creative tool that simulates\nthe human intelligence and ability processes\
    \ by machines,\nprincipally computer systems, robotics, and digital equip-\nment\
    \ [4]. Several applications of the AI include natural\nlanguage processing (NLP)\
    \ to comprehend human verbal\ncommunication as it is spoken, computer vision to\
    \ see an\nanalog-to-digital conversion such as video, and speech\nrecognition\
    \ and expert systems to simulate the judgment.\nTe AI encoding is based on learning\
    \ (acquire data and then\ncreate algorithms to turn them into actionable information),\n\
    reasoning (choose the right algorithm to reach a preferred\nresult), and self-correction\
    \ (continually adjust designed\nalgorithms and ensure that they provide the most\
    \ accurate\nresults) as three cognitive skills [5]. Te AI technique is being\n\
    used in several sectors which are seeing the fastest growth in\nthe recent years\
    \ such as ﬁnance, healthcare, retail, phar-\nmaceutical research, intelligent\
    \ process automation, and\nmarketing. Machine learning (ML) is one of the central\n\
    themes of AI and helps people to work more creatively and\nHindawi\nJournal of\
    \ Food Quality\nVolume 2021, Article ID 5584754, 7 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5584754\n\
    eﬃciently. In ML, statistical and mathematical methods are\nused to learn from\
    \ datasets to make data-driven predictions/\ndecisions. Several diﬀerent methods\
    \ exist for this. General\ndistinction can be made by two systems; the ﬁrst one\
    \ is the\nsymbolic approaches (the induced rules and the examples\nare explicitly\
    \ represented) and the second one is the sub-\nsymbolic approaches (artiﬁcial\
    \ neuronal networks: ANN).\nTe ML approach is classiﬁed into three major tasks:\
    \ su-\npervised,\nunsupervised,\nand\nreinforcement\nlearning.\nAccording to the\
    \ supervised learning, the aim of this ap-\nproach is to map the variables to\
    \ the preferred output\nvariable [6]. Te predictive model is created using the\
    \ labeled\ndata with the prior knowledge of the input and the desired\noutput\
    \ variables. Algorithms used under supervised learning\ntechniques are numerous,\
    \ particularly, decision trees,\nBayesian networks, and regression analysis. Concerning\
    \ the\nunsupervised learning, it includes algorithms such as Ar-\ntiﬁcial Neural\
    \ Networks (ANNs), clustering, genetic algo-\nrithm, and deep learning and uses\
    \ unlabeled datasets\nwithout prior knowledge of the input and output variables.\n\
    In fact and as mentioned by Jordan and Mitchell [7], this\ncase of unsupervised\
    \ machine learning method establishes\nthe hidden patterns by using the unlabeled\
    \ dataset and is\nprimarily used for dimensionality reduction and exploratory\n\
    data analysis. According to the third category of ML task\nnamed the reinforcement\
    \ learning, numerous algorithms are\nused for machine skill acquisition, robot\
    \ navigation, and\nreal-time decision making such as Q-learning and deep\nQ-learning.\
    \ In this case of ML task, the learner interacts with\nthe environment to collect\
    \ information and the two steps of\ntraining and testing datasets are combined.\
    \ Te learner gets\nawarded for his actions with the environment leading to an\n\
    exploration versus exploitation dilemma. Te learner must\nexplore new unknown\
    \ actions to gain more information as\ncompared to exploiting the information\
    \ already collected\n[8]. Recently, AI technology has opened the doors of its\n\
    implementation in the agri-food sector. In fact, AI ap-\nproaches oﬀer signiﬁcant\
    \ contributions and assistances to\nunderstanding a model’s identiﬁcation, service\
    \ creation, and\nthe decision-making processes as support to the diﬀerent\nagri-food’s\
    \ applications and supply chain stages. Te prin-\ncipal goal of AI in agriculture\
    \ is to provide precision and\nforecasting decision in order to improve the productivity\n\
    with resource preservation [4]; through this, AI tools pro-\npose algorithms to\
    \ evaluate performance, classify patterns,\nand to predict unexpected problems\
    \ or phenomena in order\nto solve comprehension problems in the agricultural ﬁeld\n\
    and for the identiﬁcation of pests and its suitable method of\ntreatment, as well\
    \ as the management of the irrigation\nprocess and water consumption by setting\
    \ up smart irri-\ngation systems. Abiotic and biotic factors are being assessed\n\
    through remote sensing and sensors in order to optimize\ncrop and livestock management\
    \ [4, 9]. In addition, the AI\nimplementation and applications have enormous advan-\n\
    tages which could revolutionize the agri-food sector and its\nrelated business.\
    \ Firstly, AI provides more eﬃcient ways to\nproduce, harvest, and sell crops\
    \ products as well as emphasis\non checking defective crops and improving the\
    \ potential for\nhealthy crop production and also AI is being used in\napplications\
    \ such as automated machine adjustments for\nweather forecasting and disease or\
    \ pest identiﬁcation with\n98% accuracy. In fact, recently, Sujatha et al. [10]\
    \ compared\nthe performance of machine learning (ML) and deep\nlearning (DL) methods\
    \ to detect and identify the citrus plant\nleaf disease. Tey showed that the VGG-16\
    \ deep learning\nmethod gave the best result in terms of disease classiﬁcation\n\
    accuracy. Secondly, the progression in the AI technique has\nreinforced agro-based\
    \ businesses to run more proﬁciently by\nimproving crop management practices,\
    \ thus helping many\ntech businesses invest in algorithms that are becoming useful\n\
    in agriculture as well as by solving the contrasts farmers face\nsuch as climate\
    \ variation and an infestation of pests and\nweeds that decreases yields. Indeed,\
    \ Crane-Droesch [11]\ndeveloped a novel modeling approach for augmenting\nparametric\
    \ statistical models with deep neural networks,\nwhich we term semiparametric\
    \ neural networks (SNNs), and\nby using data on corn yield from the US Midwest,\
    \ they\nshowed the outperformance of this approach in predicting\nyields of years\
    \ withheld during model training compared to\nclassical statistical methods and\
    \ fully nonparametric neural\nnetworks. Tirdly, by using AI tools, farmers could\
    \ be able to\nremain updated with the data related to weather forecasting\nand,\
    \ therefore, predicted weather data help farmers to in-\ncrease yields and proﬁts\
    \ without risking the crop, and as a\nresult, after analyzing the generated data,\
    \ AI allows the\nfarmers to better understand and learn and then to take the\n\
    precaution by implementing practices in order to make a\npunctual smart decision.\
    \ In fact, Fente and Singh [12]\ncollected diﬀerent weather parameters (temperature,\
    \ pre-\ncipitation, wind speed, pressure, dew point visibility, and\nhumidity)\
    \ from the Indian climate data center and imple-\nmented a weather forecasting\
    \ model by using a recurrent\nneural network (RNN) with the long-short-term memory\n\
    (LSTM) technique. Tey concluded that the used technique\ngave high-accuracy results\
    \ compared to other weather\nforecasting approaches. Fourthly, AI approaches are\
    \ capable\nof monitoring soil health and management by conducting\nand identifying\
    \ the possible defects and nutrient deﬁciencies\nin the soil either by image captured\
    \ with the camera rec-\nognition tool or by deep learning based tool to analyse\
    \ ﬂora\npatterns in farms and to simultaneously understand soil\ndefects, plant\
    \ pests, and diseases. In fact, Suchithra and Pai\n[13] classiﬁed and predicted\
    \ the soil fertility indices and pH\nlevels of Kerala north central laterite Indian\
    \ region soil by\nusing the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) technique with\ndiﬀerent\
    \ activation functions such as hard limit, sine-\nsquared, triangular basis, hyperbolic\
    \ tangent, and gaussian\nradial basis. Tey revealed that the maximum performance\n\
    (80% of the accuracy rate calculations in every problem) for\nfour out of ﬁve\
    \ problems was obtained with the Gaussian\nradical basis function followed by\
    \ hyperbolic tangent.\nHowever, the best performance (90%) of the pH classiﬁ-\n\
    cation problem was given by the hyperbolic tangent, whereas\nthe moderate values\
    \ were given by the gaussian radial basis.\nFifthly, an important functional beneﬁt\
    \ of the AI technology\nemployment is the environmental protection by decreasing\n\
    pesticide usage. For example and in order to manage weeds\nfaster\nand\nwith\n\
    greater\naccuracy,\nAI\ntechniques\nby\n2\nJournal of Food Quality\nimplementing\
    \ robotics, computer vision, and machine\nlearning could help farmers to spray\
    \ chemicals only where\nthe weeds are; thus, this directly reduced the use of\
    \ the\nchemical substance spraying on the whole ﬁeld. Conse-\nquently, AI tools\
    \ are helping farmers ﬁnd more eﬃcient\nactions to protect their crops from weeds.\
    \ Finally, the\npractice of the advanced AI-based technologies has other\nadvantages\
    \ on the agri-food supply chain such as reducing\nemployee training costs, reducing\
    \ the time needed to solve\nproblems, reducing the amount of human errors, reducing\n\
    human intervention, and oﬀering an automated good, ac-\ncurate, and robust decision-making\
    \ on the right time with\nlow cost [14].\n3. Artificial Intelligence Technology\
    \ and\nApplication to Improve Agriculture and\nFood Industries\nCurrently, the\
    \ use of ML algorithms in the main four clusters\n(preproduction, production,\
    \ processing, and distribution) of\nthe agriculture supply chain is becoming more\
    \ and more\nimportant [15]. In fact, in the preproduction step, the ML\ntechnologies\
    \ are used, especially for the prediction of crop\nyield, soil properties, and\
    \ irrigation requirements. In the\nnext stage of the production phase, the ML\
    \ could be used for\ndisease detection and weather prediction. Concerning the\n\
    third cluster of the processing phase, utilization of ML\napproaches is applied,\
    \ especially to estimate of the pro-\nduction planning to reach a high and safe\
    \ quality of the\nproduct. ML algorithms could be used also to the distri-\nbution\
    \ cluster, especially in storage, transportation, and\nconsumer analysis. Te preproduction\
    \ cluster is the initial\nstep in the agriculture supply chain. It mainly concerns\
    \ the\nprediction of crop yield, soil properties, and irrigation re-\nquirement.\
    \ Many researchers report the importance of the\ncrop yield production in order\
    \ to better support plant\nmanagement. In fact, by using as an input data (equipment\n\
    requirements, nutrients, and fertilizers) in predicting eﬃ-\ncient models based\
    \ on ML algorithms, these precision ag-\nriculture tools aim to make stakeholders\
    \ and farmers\nsupport ideal decision in crop yield forecasting and improve\n\
    the smart farming practices. Recently, diﬀerent ML algo-\nrithms are used for\
    \ crop yield prediction such as the\nBayesian network, regression, decision tree,\
    \ clustering, deep\nlearning, and ANN [16–18]. According to the prediction of\n\
    soil management properties, several ML algorithms are used\nin learning soil properties.\
    \ Among them, the LS-SVM (least-\nsquares support vector machine) method was used\
    \ by\nMorellos et al. [19] to study 140 soil samples. Nahvi et al. [20]\nused\
    \ the SaE (self-adpative evolutionary) ML algorithm to\nboost the performance\
    \ of the extreme learning machine\n(ELM) architecture to estimate daily soil temperature.\
    \ Ad-\nditionally, Kumar et al. [21] proposed a novel method named\nthe CSM (Crop\
    \ Selection Method) to resolve crop selection\nproblems and help improve net yield\
    \ rate of crops over the\nseason. In addition, Ben Ayed et al. [16] analyzed 18\n\
    worldwide table olive cultivars by using morphological,\nbiological,\nand\nphysicochemical\n\
    parameters\nand\nthe\nBayesian network to study the inﬂuence of these parameters\n\
    in tolerance, productivity, and oil content. Tey revealed that\noil content was\
    \ highly inﬂuenced by the tolerance of the\ncrop. Another important parameter\
    \ in the preproduction\ncluster is the irrigation management that plays a crucial\
    \ role\nin aﬀecting the quality and quantity of the crops. In fact, to\nachieve\
    \ an eﬀective irrigation system (better decision in\nwhen, where, and how much\
    \ to irrigate), researchers used\nsoil moisture data, precipitation data, evaporation\
    \ data, and\nweather forecasts as input data for simulation and optimi-\nzation\
    \ of predicted models based on ML adequate algo-\nrithms [22]. In fact, Arvind\
    \ et al. [23] demonstrated that\nusing ML algorithm associated with other technologies\
    \ such\nas sensors, Zigbee, and Arduino microcontroller was eﬃ-\ncient for prediction\
    \ and tackles drought situations. In ad-\ndition, Cruz et al. [24] exploited the\
    \ ANN feed-forward and\nback-propagation technologies to optimize the water re-\n\
    sources in a smart farm. More recently, Choudhary et al. [25]\nused PLSR and other\
    \ regression algorithms as an artiﬁcial\nintelligence tool combined with sensors\
    \ for data collection\nand Internet of things hardware implementation to increase\n\
    eﬃciency and economic feasibility.\nTe production cluster is the second phase\
    \ in the ag-\nriculture supply chain. Tere are numerous parameters that\naﬀect\
    \ and play a key role in the crop production step. Among\nthem are the weather\
    \ forecasts (sunlight, rainfall, humidity,\netc.), crop protection against biotic\
    \ stress factors (weeds and\npathogens) and abiotic stress factors (nutrient and\
    \ water\ndeﬁciency), crop quality management, and harvesting. Many\ndiﬀerent ML\
    \ algorithms are used to simulate eﬀective\nmodels for weather prediction (ANN,\
    \ deep learning, deci-\nsion tree, ensemble learning, and instance-based learning)\n\
    [26], for crop protection (clustering and regression) [27],\nANN, deep learning\
    \ [14], weed detection (ANN, decision\ntree, deep learning, and instance-based\
    \ learning) [28], crop\nquality management (clustering and regression) [29], and\n\
    harvesting (deep neural networks, data mining techniques\nsuch as k mean clustering,\
    \ k nearest neighbor, ANN, and\nSVM) [30]. During the harvest stage which is the\
    \ ﬁnal\nhorticultural stage after the ripening of the crops, ML al-\ngorithms\
    \ are also used to predict the transformation of the\nfruit or crop color. In\
    \ fact, many research teams used ML\nalgorithms to predict the fruit ripening\
    \ stages and fruit\nmaturity such as Gao et al. [31] who achieved 98.6% clas-\n\
    siﬁcation accuracy when they used hyperspectral datasets\nand the AlexNet CNN\
    \ deep learning model to classify the\nstrawberry fruits into early-ripe and ripe\
    \ stages. Te pro-\ncessing cluster is the third stage in the agriculture supply\n\
    chain. Tere are many types of processing techniques of\nagriculture products such\
    \ as heating, cooling, milling,\nsmoking, cooking, and drying. Te choice of eﬀective\n\
    combined parameters in the processing stage results in a\nhigh quality and quantity\
    \ of food product and, at the same\ntime, avoiding overutilization of resources.\
    \ To achieve this\ngoal, several food industries use modern food processing\n\
    technologies by installing software algorithms based on ML.\nAmong the used ML\
    \ algorithms, there are genetic algorithm,\nANN, clustering, and Bayesian network\
    \ [32]. In fact, Arora\nand Mangipudi [33] proposed support vector machine\nJournal\
    \ of Food Quality\n3\n(SVM) classiﬁer and artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) models\n\
    to detect the presence of nitrosamine in the red meat food\nsamples, and the obtained\
    \ predictive modeling results\nrevealed that the highest testing accuracy was\
    \ obtained using\nthe deep learning model. Additionally, Farah et al. [34] used\n\
    diﬀerential scanning calorimetry combined with ML tools\n(such as gradient boosting\
    \ machine, random forest, RF,\nmultilayer perceptron, MLP, and GBM) to determine\
    \ the\nmilk characteristics and authenticity and to detect fraud. Te\nmost eﬃcient\
    \ results were obtained with GBM and MLP\nmachine learning tools which were able\
    \ to classify 100% of\nadulterated samples. Te distribution cluster is the ﬁnal\
    \ step\nin the agriculture supply chain. Tis stage is the connection\nbetween\
    \ food production and processing and the ﬁnal use or\nﬁnal consumer. ML algorithms\
    \ could be used in storage,\ntransportation, consumer analytics, and inventory\
    \ man-\nagement. In transportation and storage steps, the mainly\nused algorithms\
    \ are genetic algorithm, clustering, and re-\ngression. Tese predictive techniques\
    \ aim to better preserve\nthe food product quality, to ensure safe food products\
    \ and to\nminimize the product damage by tracing the product [16].\nFor the consumer\
    \ analytics, ML techniques such as deep\nlearning and ANN are used in the food\
    \ retailing phase for\npredicting consumer demand, perception, and buying be-\n\
    havior. For the inventory management, the use of ML ge-\nnetic algorithms helps\
    \ in predicting daily demand and to\nensure that there are no inventory-related\
    \ problems [35].\nExamples of AI-applied technology are numerous in the\nagri-food\
    \ sector, i.e., robotics and mechatronics [2], drones\n[2, 36], geographic information\
    \ systems (GISs) [37],\nblockchain (BC) [38], and satellite guidance [2]. Miranda\n\
    et al. [39] have reported and described these items as sensing,\nsmart, and sustainable\
    \ technologies, providing systematic\nprocess where connectivity, automation,\
    \ precision, moni-\ntoring, and digitization are prevalent [40–43]. Smart\nmechanization,\
    \ robotics, and mechatronics in agriculture\naim to reduce drudgery and minimize\
    \ inputs using highly\nautonomous and intelligent machines [2]. From horse to\n\
    tractor, robots, and intelligent vehicles, a revolutionary era\nhas come for agriculture\
    \ and food industry, from rudi-\nmentary to high eﬃciency of agriculture with\
    \ the intro-\nduction\nof\nmechanization,\ninnovative\ntechnologies,\ncomputerized\
    \ analysis, and decision, improving farming\nactivities and crop productivity\
    \ [2]. Revolutionizing ma-\nchines, often called “agribots,” are now used in agriculture\n\
    for all kinds of activities, namely, soil preparation, seed\nsowing, weed and\
    \ pest treatment, irrigation, fertilization,\nand ultimately, grain and fruit\
    \ harvesting, minimizing eﬀort\nand energy cost [2, 44–47]. As a whole crop management,\n\
    agricultural drones can be used starting from soil treatment\n(herbicide), going\
    \ to sowing step, plant treatment (pesti-\ncide), and physiological control and\
    \ observation, and ending\nwith harvest time determination [2, 36, 48–51]. Agricultural\n\
    drones are now able to supply water, fertilizers, herbicides,\nand pesticides\
    \ and even ﬁlm, capture images, and generate\nmaps in real time of plants and\
    \ ﬁeld in order to help farmers\ntake management decision [2, 48, 52–56]. Today,\
    \ farmers use\ndrones for livestock surveillance for monitoring illnesses,\ninjuries,\
    \ and even pregnancies [57]. In 2019, the worldwide\nagriculture drone market\
    \ value was about USD one million\nand is expected to reach USD 3.7 million by\
    \ 2027 [58],\nwhereas the robot and agriculture drone market is projected\nto\
    \ reach USD 23 billion by 2028 [59, 60]. Based on geospatial\ntechnology that\
    \ relies on satellite, GIS is applied on several\nﬁelds of agriculture: crop management,\
    \ irrigation control,\nyield estimation, disease and weed control, farming auto-\n\
    mation, livestock monitoring, vegetation mapping, erosion,\nand land degradation\
    \ forecast [37, 61–68]. Application of\nGIS is, therefore, suitable in precision\
    \ agriculture, real-time\ncontrol, and raising awareness and signiﬁcantly contributes\n\
    to meet the needs of continuous rise in food demand.\nBlockchain is another technology\
    \ that answers to con-\nsumer’s awareness about food origin, quality, and mainly,\n\
    safety. BC aﬀords transparency, trust, certiﬁcation, and\ntraceability of food\
    \ product supply chain from farm to fork,\nwhere every single operation and data\
    \ are timely registered,\nsaved, encrypted, and secured, not in a single central\
    \ server\nnor under a single control, but in a common platform\ndatabase where\
    \ every user could access and take part in\ntransactions [38, 69–79]. Such digital\
    \ and computerized\ntraceability of the whole food supply chain would allow\n\
    detection of deﬁciency, contamination, and adulteration of\nthe product, thus\
    \ optimizing its quality and safety; therefore,\na multitude of agencies, consortia,\
    \ and platforms were born\nin this context [79]. In 2020, the worldwide market\
    \ of BC in\nagri-food market size was about USD 133 million; it is es-\ntimated\
    \ to grow and reach around USD 950 million by 2025\n[69]. Satellite-guided technology\
    \ applied to agriculture\nimproved farm monitoring and aided mapping agricultural\n\
    zones, soil management, crop husbandry, irrigation disease\nand\nweed\ncontrol,\n\
    yield\nestimation,\nand\nharvesting\n[2, 80–88]. Hence, in the late 1900s, one\
    \ single farmer was\nable to produce food grains for 128, actually, and in the\n\
    future, through smart agriculture, this ratio will greatly\nincrease [2].\n4.\
    \ Limits and Drawbacks of AI and ML\nHowever, despite all these advantages, the\
    \ AI technology has\nalso some drawbacks representing challenges. Firstly, the\n\
    most important social challenge is the unemployment that\ncould be a threat; in\
    \ fact, smart machines and robots could\nreplace the majority of the repetitive\
    \ works and tasks; thus,\nhuman interference is becoming less, which will cause\
    \ a\nmajor problem in the employment standards. Other tech-\nnological challenges,\
    \ for instance, machines can do only\nthose tasks which they are programmed or\
    \ developed to do,\nand anything out of that they tend to crash or give irrelevant\n\
    outputs could be a major backdrop. In addition, the high\ncosts of creation and\
    \ maintenance of the smart machines as\nwell as the cleaver computers could be\
    \ considered as\ntechnological limits of the AI technologies, especially that\
    \ AI\nis updating every day which is why the hardware and\nsoftware need to get\
    \ updated with time to meet the latest\nrequirements. Machines need repairing\
    \ and maintenance\nwhich is expensive. Te creation requires huge costs as they\n\
    are very complex machines. Other issues related to these\napplications are their\
    \ high cost that could increase the price\n4\nJournal of Food Quality\nof the\
    \ products. Moreover, beyond the opportunities\naﬀorded by smart and computerized\
    \ technologies, some\nrisks and apprehensions could be posed for sustainability,\n\
    particularly the massive energy consumption, e-waste\nproblem, market concentration,\
    \ job displacement, and even\nthe ethical framework [79, 89].\n5. Conclusions\n\
    Te agriculture and food industries are one of the most vital\nﬁelds for humanity.\
    \ Te ﬁrst products of agriculture are used\nas inputs in several multiactor distributed\
    \ supply chains,\nincluding four clusters or stages of the agriculture supply\n\
    chain (preproduction, production, processing, and distri-\nbution) in order to\
    \ reach the end user or consumer. Due to\nseveral challenges in the future for\
    \ the agriculture and food\nsector and various factors such as climate change,\
    \ pop-\nulation growth, technological progress, and the state of\nnatural resources\
    \ (water, etc.), it is urgent to use the digital\ntechnologies at diﬀerent stages\
    \ of agriculture supply chain\nsuch as automation of farm machinery, use of sensors\
    \ and\nremote satellite data, artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning\nfor improved\
    \ monitoring of crops, and water, for agriculture\nfood product traceability.\
    \ In the present study, we dem-\nonstrate the main applications of the AI and\
    \ ML algorithms\nin diﬀerent clusters of the agriculture supply chain and the\n\
    unquestionable growing tendency in the adoption of these\nalgorithms to improve\
    \ food industries.\nData Availability\nTe data used to support the ﬁndings of\

    Abstract

    Over the past few decades, research on the Internet of Things (IoT) has advanced
    quickly thanks to recent

    advancements in wireless communication technologies. IoT is evolving into a large-scale,
    all-

    encompassing network that will be extensively used in environmental monitoring,
    agriculture, and other

    ¦elds. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) serve as the IoT systems'' primary monitoring
    infrastructure.

    WSNs could be used to monitor the conditions in an agricultural ¦eld, including
    temperature, humidity,

    light, carbon dioxide, soil moisture, and acidity. These factors have a crucial
    role in the development,

    excellence, and yield of crops. In order to gather crucial data, numerous sensor
    devices are placed in

    agricultural land. The ability of sensor nodes to conserve energy is thought to
    be crucial for extending the

    lifespan of WSNs. Innovative, effective, and cost-effective solutions should be
    devised to provide

    reasonable energy consumption and maximize the lifespan of WSNs for agricultural.
    In routing

    operations, clustering is recognized as a well-known strategy. In this paper,
    a novel energy-e¨cient

    approach based on genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic is suggested to increase
    network lifetime. The

    proposed technique use an integrated clustering structure to reduce the distances
    between sensor nodes

    where data must be transmitted. The results of OPNET''s simulations showed that
    the suggested system

    performs better than the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol in terms of energy usage and WSN
    lifetime.

    1. Introduction

    The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new technology that has been creatively combining
    sensing,

    communication, and the Internet in recent years [1]. The Internet of Things (IoT)
    has started to play a

    signi¦cant role in daily life, expanding our perceptions and enabling us to change
    our surroundings.

    Agriculture, environmental monitoring, home automation, industrial automation,
    and transportation

    systems are just a few of the many applications that IoT is still being used for
    [2]. IoTs are especially

    used in the agro-industrial and environmental industries for both control and
    diagnostic purposes.

    Additionally, it can inform the consumer about the product''s history and characteristics
    [3]. The IoT''s

    primary physical monitoring infrastructure is comprised on wireless sensor networks
    (WSN). WSN is a

    popular choice and is utilized in precision agriculture for farmland monitoring
    in the new IoT era. WSNs

    hold great promise for application programs that need the collection of data from
    sensor nodes in far-

    §ung, inhospitable areas.

    In order to gather crucial data including temperature, humidity, light, carbon
    dioxide, soil moisture, and

    acidity, a variety of sensor devices are placed in agricultural land. The agriculture
    farm house contains

    these sensor nodes, which are placed manually or at random. They gather meteorological
    data and

    transmit it to the gateway node. The user or agriculture professional will then
    receive this data over the

    public channel from the gateway node. The farmer makes a decision and takes the
    necessary action with

    regard to the agricultural farmhouse based on the environmental information they
    have obtained [4].

    New di¨culties have arisen as a result of the data volume, resource constraints,
    and scattered nature of

    wireless receiving networks. The paradigm of data transfers in application programs
    should guarantee

    Page 3/32

    energy e¨ciency because communicating with a sensor node is frequently expensive.
    Clustering sensor

    nodes is a noteworthy energy-saving method [5, 6]. As part of the clustering process,
    sensor nodes are

    grouped together into various clusters, each of which has a coordinator known
    as the cluster head and

    other nodes known as the cluster members. There should only be one cluster for
    each sensor node. Data

    is sent from sensor nodes to the relevant cluster heads. The data are then gathered
    by the cluster heads

    and sent through one-hop or multiple-hop communications to a base station, or
    sink. The cluster-based

    data routing to the base station is depicted in Fig. 1. Every cluster has a single
    node designated as CH.

    CH is in charge of gathering information from the cluster''s nodes. After that,
    it compiles all of the data

    into a single data packet and sends it to the base station or sink.

    IoTs were used in farming to increase crop yields, enhance crop quality, and cut
    expenses. WSNs are the

    primary monitoring infrastructure for IoT installations. Energy consumption and
    network lifetime, which

    are common concerns for almost any WSN application, are the main constraints of
    WSNs in IoT

    networks. Node placement, network overage, clustering, data aggregation, and routing
    are typically

    included in the operational stages of WSNs [7]. Energy saving is regarded as a
    major feature of sensor

    nodes for enhancing the lifetime of WSNs. To resolve this issue, clustering models
    are used to provide

    reasonable energy consumption and optimizing the lifetime of WSNs [8].

    In this research, we concentrated on one of these IoT applications, precision
    agriculture, and suggested a

    brand-new clustering-based energy-aware routing algorithm for WSNs. All of the
    sensor nodes have been

    grouped into distinct clusters using this technique. All sensor nodes are taken
    into account for choosing

    cluster heads based on the energy level and workload they can handle using genetic
    algorithms and

    fuzzy logic. Nodes join the cluster head using their distances from the cluster
    head in order to create

    clusters. All of the cluster heads have created a sink as the root of the directed
    virtual backbone (DVB),

    which helps with routing. By navigating and directing data packets to the next
    cluster head hop, each

    cluster head balances its own energy consumption throughout data routing.

    2. Related works

    Installing a WSN in the ¦eld has increased the effectiveness and e¨ciency of the
    farmers in optimizing

    agriculture [9]. It can be used to assess ¦eld variables like soil quality, weather,
    and plant biomass.

    Additionally, it can be used to monitor and manage factors like temperature, humidity,
    vibrations, and

    shocks while a product is being transported [10]. It is impractical to replace
    sensor node batteries after

    they have totally discharged in a large-scale WSN. Therefore, lowering these nodes''
    energy consumption

    is essential to lengthening network lifetime [11]. An approach that is frequently
    used to help sensor nodes

    save energy is clustering. Numerous clustering algorithms exist to reduce energy
    consumption in WSNs.

    [12] presented a clustering structure based on cellular topology. Additionally,
    a framework called a time

    gap was used to specify how plans should be carried out so that nodes within a
    cluster can transmit data

    to one another without any issues. There were numerous dynamic factors at work,
    not just energy. Each

    cluster''s cluster head is a dynamic factor, it''s true. This cluster head is
    aware of the energy of all the

    nodes within its cluster. A node enters the off state when there is no data to
    be broadcast. Because

    Page 4/32

    mobile factors are expensive, cellular technology was used, and each mobile factor
    probes multiple

    clusters.

    In [13], a routing technique with dynamic structure and static clustering was
    suggested. The proper

    method of cluster formation, which aids in the most e¨cient use of energy, was
    discussed in this study.

    Each node in this method provides the sink with information about its location
    via a low-cost GPS device;

    as a result, the sink assumes that node to be a member of one of the assumed clusters
    based on the

    position and location of the virtual point. The message containing the coordinates
    and remaining energy

    of the source node is sent to other cluster heads during the route identi¦cation
    phase. Each cluster head

    checks its distance from the transmitting cluster head as soon as it receives
    the message to determine

    whether it is closer to the sending cluster head or the transmitting cluster head
    is closer to the sink. The

    routing is done in this manner, and the relay node is chosen. In order to study
    the communication among

    sensor nodes on a §at level, a new protocol called VIBE was proposed in [14].
    A work session will start

    once a sensor node has data to send to the sink. To cut down on hop counts and
    routing time for data

    transmission, clustering was incorporated into this algorithm. As a result, a
    two-level communication was

    established where the nodes can choose to join a cluster or remain as a single
    member. In [15], a tree-

    based method was presented that was created speci¦cally for sensor networks. Each
    sensor node in this

    algorithm has some knowledge of the sink and the other sensor nodes. Information
    is communicated

    between all nodes after the tree has been formed. The nearest node receives information
    on the sink''s

    position and movement, which is also shared by the other nodes. The goal of this
    technique was to build

    all the spanning trees necessary to identify the ideal solution space. Within
    each cluster, an effective

    method for choosing the cluster head was put forth in [16]. Cluster heads are
    chosen at random in order

    for this strategy to operate. Normal nodes send a join message to request membership.
    They also send

    the cluster head how much energy they still have. The temporary cluster head then
    acquires the network''s

    remaining energy based on the nodes'' remaining energy. The node with the most
    energy is chosen as the

    cluster head if the network''s remaining energy is more than x%. Otherwise, the
    new cluster head will be

    chosen from among the nodes with the most neighbours. The new cluster head then
    noti¦es the nodes

    that it is the cluster head through an ack message. In [17], an unbalanced clustering
    protocol based on

    ant colony optimisation and fuzzy logic, as well as routing and interlayer combined
    ANC, were presented

    for WSNs. Multiple nodes of this algorithm, known as FAMACROW, transmit the sensed
    data from the

    environment to the base station. For choosing the cluster head, it makes use of
    fuzzy logic and variables

    like the amount of energy left, the number of nearby nodes, and the calibre of
    the communication link.

    This approach uses unbalanced clustering, in which clusters closer to the base
    station are smaller than

    clusters farther away, to avoid the hot spot issue. ASLPR, a routing protocol
    that optimised energy usage

    and was created for certain applications, was proposed in [18]. This method considers
    the following

    factors for choosing the best cluster head: the distance from the base station,
    the remaining energy, and

    the distance between the cluster heads. Although complex, this routing protocol
    has some variables that

    can be changed. For the purpose of resolving the aforementioned problems, a unique
    lightweight energy-

    aware clustering method for WSNs was developed in [19]. They concentrated on clustering
    sensor nodes

    as a means for extending the lifetime of WSNs. We also reduced energy consumption
    by grouping sensor

    Page 5/32

    nodes into clusters using the LPO algorithm. This algorithm chooses the best nodes
    as the cluster heads

    based on two factors: battery power level and distance from the sink. The suggested
    approach improved

    network longevity while reducing average delay, input packet, and power usage.

    In [20], a TOPSIS-based energy-e¨cient clustering technique for WSNs that may
    group network nodes

    according to their energy levels was presented. Using the factors of energy level,
    neighbourhood, distance

    to the washbasin, and conducted workload, this protocol creates clusters with
    balanced energy. An

    energy-e¨cient approach based on fuzzy logic and reinforcement learning for increasing
    network lifetime

    in IoT was described in [21]. Based on the remaining energies of the nodes on
    the routes, the available

    bandwidth, and the distance to the sink, fuzzy logic and reinforcement learning
    are developed. In terms of

    network lifetime, the simulations of this method conducted by OPNET showed that
    it outperformed fuzzy

    logic and IEEE802.15.4. A plan based on the partnership of an integrated system
    for automated irrigation

    management in agriculture and the advantageous novel routing protocol for Wireless
    Sensor Networks

    (WSNs), called ECHERP, was introduced in [22]. The suggested system''s primary
    goal is the automated,

    effective management of water delivery in planted ¦elds. The technology uses previous
    data and

    changes in climate parameters to determine how much water is required for irrigation.
    More frequent data

    collection is suggested to reduce the requirement for water in situations where
    the change in the values

    gathered has exceeded a threshold. In contrast, the time interval for data collection
    can be extended to

    preserve sensor energy and extend sensor lifetime when the change in readings
    is below a predetermined

    threshold. The algorithm''s simulations demonstrate how ECHERP increased network
    longevity. A low-cost

    WSN-based server system for monitoring the agricultural environment was released
    in [23]. In this study, a

    UAV is used to quickly travel great distances while retrieving data from ground
    nodes. The UAV can also

    be utilised to carry out tasks and gather extra data. Its lofty elevation enables
    ¦eld observation from a

    vantage point that is important for seeing changes that may impact crops, such
    as pests, diseases,

    substantial changes in soil moisture, droughts, or §oods. According to the energy
    level of the network

    nodes and their distance from the sink, a mobile sink and bacterial foraging algorithm-based
    clustering

    method for wireless sensor networks was suggested in [24]. To communicate with
    the sink, nodes use a

    multi-step routing method within the network. The mobile sink is also utilised
    to balance the load and

    contribute to network-wide energy consumption that is consistent. The proposed
    solution outperforms

    AFSRP (Arti¦cial Fish Swarm Routing Protocol) according to simulation results.

    In order to maximise network longevity and scalability by taking into consideration
    effective parameters

    for picking the cluster head and parent node, the leaping frog method is utilised
    in the study [25] in WSN

    networks. Based on the fuzzy output, energy threshold (i.e., a control parameter),
    the overlap rate of

    nearby CHs, and the candidate nodes, the CH is selected from the list of nodes.
    The number of CHs in the

    network is determined before the parent selection step of the proposed protocol
    begins. Based on the

    application''s maximum fuzzy output, the parents of each CH are identi¦ed at the
    end of this step. In a

    stable phase, the CHs'' information is ¦nally forwarded to the BS by their parents.
    The outcomes of the

    simulation demonstrate the energy e¨ciency of the suggested approach, which controls
    node energy

    consumption utilising frog jump, the Fuzzy Inference System rule table, and ¦ve
    control parameters. A

    drawback of this approach is the high processing cost of the leaping frog algorithm
    and fuzzy logic. For

    Page 6/32

    data transfer in a heterogeneous sensor environment, a dependable routing strategy
    based on new delay

    energy is suggested in the work [26]. The suggested technique achieves a good
    balance between energy

    consumption and end-to-end latency by picking the next node with the least amount
    of energy during the

    long-distance data transfer phase and supplying a proper load balance in the network.
    This approach

    decreases end-to-end delivery delays, addresses the hotspot issue in mobile hierarchical
    routing

    protocols, and minimises grid energy usage. Additionally, by choosing multiple
    agent nodes and

    gathering data during the data transfer phase, it increases the percentage of
    data packets that are

    successfully received in the sink.

    In the paper [27], which addresses the issue of energy e¨ciency in wireless sensor
    networks, the arti¦cial

    ¦sh swarm optimisation technique (AFSA) for clustering WSNs is proposed. This
    approach, which is

    based on the social behaviour of ¦sh, solves optimisation issues because of its
    rapid convergence, lack

    of sensitivity to arti¦cial ¦sh beginning values, adaptability, and mistake tolerance.
    The suggested

    protocol was examined using the OPNET 11.5 simulator and contrasted with the ERA
    protocol. The

    outcomes of the simulation demonstrated that the proposed protocol performed better
    than the ERA

    protocol and might lengthen network lifetime. In order to slow the degradation
    of IoT device reliability and

    increase network Mean Time to Failure (MTTF), paper [28] suggested an adaptive
    and distributed

    reliability-aware routing protocol based on reinforcement learning. This approach
    uses a communication

    line to cut down on tra¨c and high-quality, stable links to cut down on retransmissions.
    Metrics for

    predicted transmission count and reliability are included in the reinforcement
    learning formulation. The

    routing policy gains knowledge from earlier routing choices at runtime. The suggested
    approach can

    make IoT networks last longer and offers a routing strategy that speci¦cally solves
    the reliability

    degradation issue. When compared to AODV, AODV-ETX, and Q-AODV methods in this
    paper, the authors

    showed improved network MTTF by extending the AODV protocol with a Q-learning
    algorithm. The

    ¦ndings indicate improved dependability for different transmission data rates.

    The research [29] makes the suggestion of an enhanced multi attribute-based attack
    resistance (EMBTR)

    algorithm to carry out the routing process safely based on the trusted values
    of nodes. A node''s

    trustworthiness is assessed using the suggested model based on the reliable value
    obtained for each

    node in the network. The suggested approach maintains a speci¦c threshold value
    at each node to

    protect the network environment. By using QoS factors like stability rate, dependability
    rate, and elapsed

    duration, this technique creates secure routing. The stability rate of each node
    is assessed to identify

    which nodes will participate in the routing process in order to achieve secure
    routing. Each

    communication node''s reliability rate is examined to assess its dependability,
    and the best path is

    selected from among all feasible short cuts based on the amount of time that has
    passed. The

    simulation results demonstrate that the suggested strategy achieves a high detection
    rate for malicious

    nodes in the network while also enhancing network performance in terms of energy,
    computing time, and

    throughput.

    In this research, we suggested a fuzzy logic- and genetic-based clustering technique.
    The following

    discussion will cover this approach, which was designed to cluster in sensor networks.
    The IEEE 802.15.4

    Page 7/32

    scenario, which has recently been utilised as a communication standard for low-power,
    inexpensive, and

    low-rate WSNs, was simulated and used to test the suggested technique. IEEE 802.15.4
    is widely

    applicable for a variety of applications. It is quite adaptable, and its parameters
    can be changed. This

    protocol can allow real-time applications by utilising Guaranteed Time Slot (GTS).
    In fact, this capability

    is suitable for time-sensitive WSN applications.

    3. The proposed method

    3.1. Cluster formation phase

    It should be mentioned that integrated algorithms in WSNs help the network use
    optimisation techniques,

    and the parameters of these algorithms can be changed adaptively while they are
    running. As a result, it

    was considered that the base station is where the cluster head determination activities
    take place in this

    study. As a powerful processor with limitless energy, the base station or sink
    can classify and arrange the

    network nodes within balanced clusters in terms of the total energy consumed and
    the volume of

    performed workload using genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic after receiving information
    about the

    position and energy of the network nodes. The goal is to spread the network''s
    structure, which is made up

    of a number of nodes and cluster heads, in a way that reduces overall energy usage.

    3.2. Permanent-state phase

    TDMA scheduling is used by the nodes to identify the cluster heads and send data
    to associated cluster

    heads when clusters have formed. The cluster heads produce this scheduling plan,
    which is then sent to

    the nodes. A round is one execution of the cluster formation phase and the permanent
    state. Clustering

    activities are repeated at the conclusion of each round, and fresh nodes are chosen
    to serve as the cluster

    head. The proposed algorithm''s speci¦cs are shown below.

    As previously noted, it was presumpted that the base station or the washbasin
    would house all clustering

    processes. The network as a whole is then informed of its outcome. The programme
    at the base station

    is given an advance count of the necessary cluster heads. In other words, the
    length of the chromosome

    is calculated. Each gene on this chromosome serves as the identi¦cation number
    for a number of

    network nodes whose energies are higher than the network''s average and who have
    also only sent sparse

    amounts of data. The base station is aware of the energy level of every network
    node, which is

    signi¦cant. The amount of data transmitted and the network''s average energy can
    thus be measured

    using fuzzy logic. Eq. (1) de¦nes the chromosome''s structure as follows:

    Chrom = {gi│ i = 1,2,...,L} (1)

    where L denotes the length of chromosome and gi refers to the ith gene of the
    chromosome. For each

    chromosome in this study, actual and continuous coding was applied. As a result,
    Eq. (2) can be used to

    de¦ne the space of genes:

    Page 8/32

    Gi = RE*D*ID; ID = 1,2,… ,30 (2)

    Where ID stands for the identity of the sensor node, RE for the node''s remaining
    energy, and D for the

    volume of data that the node has processed. The algorithm runs through the following
    stages:

    Where ID stands for the identity of the sensor node, RE for the node''s remaining
    energy, and D for the

    volume of data that the node has processed. The algorithm runs through the following
    stages:

    1. Random generation of the initial population: In this phase, a population of
    N chromosomes with the

    same number of genes as cluster heads is generated at random. Figure (2) shows
    a chromosomal

    image that includes genes with the ID of sensor nodes. The cluster head is chosen
    at random by this

    chromosome from among network nodes with the IDs of 2, 5, 15, 19, and 26, as seen
    in the image.

    Five of the chromosome''s nodes are randomly chosen to serve as the genes since
    we wish to have

    ¦ve cluster heads.

    2. Setting fuzzy membership function: Fuzzy logic, as it is described below, was
    utilised to de¦ne the

    ¦tness value of genes.

    Cluster heads were chosen based on the two parameters of the battery''s remaining
    capacity and the

    workload. These two standards serve as the fuzzy input for the fuzzy system. The
    degree of ¦tness of

    genes is assessed using the fuzzy logic process to choose cluster heads in the
    sensor network. As seen in

    ¦gure (3), this mechanism functions as an adaptive fuzzy controller.

    There are three primary steps in applying fuzzy control to this system, as indicated
    in ¦gure (3). Real

    inputs were transformed into the proper fuzzy sets for use by the inference engine
    during the fuzzi¦cation

    stage. The amount of workload being completed and the battery power of the node
    are two

    characteristics that the suggested model considers to be the fuzzy system input.
    Three fuzzy sets are

    de¦ned for each of the input variables (H stands for the high limit, M for the
    medium limit, and L for the

    low limit), and these are shown in ¦gures (4) and (5). Because trapezoidal membership
    functions are

    precise and accurate, we use them. Five fuzzy sets with triangular membership
    functions were employed

    to determine the output, or the degree of the node''s ¦tness (where VH stands
    for very high limit, H for high

    limit, M for middle limit, L for low limit, and VL for very low limit).

    The load density and battery energy level of the node''s battery are the characteristics
    that are taken into

    consideration at the fuzzy inference engine stage, where fuzzy rules are utilised
    to measure the ¦tness

    value of genes. Each fuzzy rule includes two parts: an introduction that begins
    with the statement "if load

    density is low and the energy level of the node''s battery is high" and a conclusion
    that states "then, the

    degree of ¦tness allocated to the gene will be very high." The fuzzy inference
    engine was regarded as

    Mamdani minimum in the suggested approach. 

    Three fuzzy sets are de¦ned for each of the two input parameters, yielding the
    9 fuzzy rules shown in

    table (1):

    The defuzzi¦cation stage is used to convert fuzzy output into a numerical value
    once the mean of the

    centres has been defuzzed. Equation (3) is used to quantify this. 

    The parameters of this equation are the following: I indicates the index of the
    route; m denotes the

    number of fuzzy rules (here, it is 9); and n refers to the number of membership
    functions of the input

    variables (here, it is 2).  indicates the fuzzy value of membership functions
    and refers to the output

    centers. 

    4. Using the ¦tness function to assess the quality of responses: Equation (3)
    is used to assess the

    ¦tness of each gene present on a chromosome in the genetic population. 

    5. Choosing parents based on their traits: 40% of the chromosomes with the highest
    ¦tness are chosen

    to generate a new population (a chromosome''s ¦tness is equal to the average ¦tness
    of its

    accessible genes). Then, the subsequent actions are taken to ¦nish the new population.

    ½. Crossover operation: The parent chromosome pair is chopped in a crisscross
    pattern from the

    created point using a random number that falls within the range of the chromosome
    length (0 to 5).

    The ¦rst portion of the cut point is chosen from the ¦rst parent, and the second
    portion is chosen

    from the second parent, as shown in ¦gure (7). The kids are born in this manner.
     

    Page 10/32

    7. Mutation operation: With a 0.8 chance, the mutation operation is completed;
    thus, a random value

    between [0] and [1] is generated. The mutation operation will be executed if the
    resulting value is

    more than or equal to 0.8, otherwise it won''t. If not, the mutation is not carried
    out. Two random

    integers between 0 and 5 chromosomal lengths are generated and used as the array
    index to the

    chromosome in order to perform the mutation procedure. The two generated random
    values are used

    to replace the placements of the two cells. The third and ¦fth cells'' values
    are changed, as seen in

    ¦gure (8).

    ¾. Replacing a new generation with  the old generation: in this stage, the new
    children are placed in a

    new population. 

    9. Investigating the termination condition of the algorithm: The algorithm will
    end and return the best

    solution in the current population if the ¦nal condition is satis¦ed, or if it
    is the 100th round of

    execution (the 100th round of algorithm execution was treated as the termination
    condition). If the

    termination condition is not satis¦ed, it will proceed to the stage measuring
    the quality of the reply

    using the ¦tness function, and the stages above will be repeated. 

    Once the cluster heads have been identi¦ed, they send an advertisement message
    to anyone nearby. Each

    normal node chooses the closest cluster head based on its proximity to the cluster
    heads as soon as it

    receives this message. It then sends the cluster head the join message and the
    amount of energy it has

    left. Clusters are created in this manner by choosing cluster members.

    4.3. Simulation environment 

    We used the simulation programme OpnetModeler version 11.5 [30] in this paper
    to model the suggested

    technique and compare it to IEEE 802.15.4. In table (2), the simulation parameters
    are listed. The

    suggested method took into account two scenarios and a network topology of 50
    nodes, as shown in

    ¦gure (10). The IEEE 802.15.4 protocol, a common and highly §exible protocol with
    a low data rate, low

    energy consumption, and cheap construction cost, was used in the ¦rst scenario
    to distribute sensor

    nodes in a WSN at random. Applications requiring real-time performance can use
    this protocol [31]. The

    proposed technology (a genetic algorithm and fuzzy logic) is applied to cluster
    the environment in the

    second scenario''s randomly distributed sensor nodes. For both instances, it was
    assumed that the

    topology was the same. Later in the study, the simulation results pertaining to
    these scenarios are

    discussed. A view of the node editor for the suggested scenarios is shown in Figure
    (11). The building

    blocks of a sensor node are depicted in this picture from a hardware standpoint.
    Additionally, ¦gure (12)

    displays the simulated model''s processing model for the MAC layer.

    4. Simulation results

    Figure (13), which contrasts the network''s average energy usage for the scenarios
    using the proposed

    technique and the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol, shows the results. In this diagram,
    the horizontal axis

    represents simulation time and the vertical axis represents energy consumption.
    Due to the fact that

    network sub-nodes do not operate intentionally and knowingly, it is anticipated
    that the IEEE 802.15.4

    protocol will consume the most energy. In other words, regardless of the nodes''
    energy state, they transfer

    the data they have collected to the sink node. However, the proposed method uses
    those nodes for data

    transmission that has high energy and low workload thanks to clustering through
    fuzzy logic and the

    genetic algorithm. Additionally, since member nodes join the cluster head based
    on how far away they are

    from it, data transmission from member nodes to the cluster head will consume
    very little energy.

    Additionally, ¦gure (14) compares the end-to-end delay scenarios for the proposed
    algorithm and those

    for IEEE 802.15.4. Because some network nodes may transmit some data but be unable
    to send the

    remaining data due to a lack of energy, we saw that end-to-end delay increased
    in the IEEE 802.15.4

    protocol scenario. Consequently, it might be unable to ¦nish data transmission.
    The end-to-end delay is

    reduced in the proposed protocol because cluster heads are chosen from nodes with
    greater energy and

    cluster members join the cluster head based on their distances.

    Moreover, the scenario comparison between the proposed algorithm and IEEE 802.15.4
    for the media-

    access delay is shown in the following ¦gure. It was observed that in the IEEE
    802.15.4 protocol scenario,

    the delay of multimedia ¦les grows; speci¦cally, in video transmission, congestion
    grows due to high data

    generation rate and the explosive characteristic in IEEE 802.15.4. However, the
    end-to-end delay is

    reduced in the proposed protocol because the cluster heads are chosen from the
    nodes with more energy.

    Additionally, the data packet error rate for the scenarios of the suggested algorithm
    and the scenarios of

    the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol are compared in the following ¦gure. The IEEE 802.15.4
    protocol was found to

    have a greater packet error rate than the suggested protocol; this is explained
    by the fact that the IEEE

    Page 12/32

    802.15.4 protocol''s information signal is noisy as a result of congestion. It
    is therefore received

    incorrectly. In contrast, the proposed protocol has a low packet error rate because
    it chooses secure and

    safe paths, including high-energy nodes. As a result, there is a higher chance
    that the data will reach the

    sink successfully.

    The throughput rate is shown in the following graph. The vertical axis represents
    the quantity of delivered

    packets over time (throughput), and the horizontal axis represents the simulation
    time.

    The number of successfully delivered packets to the sink in IEEE 802.15.4 is lower
    than those in the

    proposed protocol, as seen in this ¦gure because of congestion and the possible
    shutdown of nodes.

    However, the proposed protocol forms clusters by choosing high-energy nodes, and
    sustainable routes

    are found. As a result, it is ensured that the route will be viable at least until
    the end of the data

    transmission phase and that the nodes'' energies won''t run out quickly. As a
    result, the suggested protocol

    maintains a viable path throughout the data transmission phase. Therefore, compared
    to IEEE 802.15.4,

    more data packets are delivered to the sink node using the proposed method.

    The rate of packet loss is seen in the following graph. The vertical axis represents
    the packet loss rate,

    and the horizontal axis represents the simulation time. It should be mentioned
    that IEEE 802.15.4 uses

    low-energy nodes for sending energy; these nodes shut down when their energies
    are used up during data

    transmission. As a result, the proposed protocol has a lower packet loss rate
    than IEEE 802.15.4. Or, to

    put it another way, IEEE 802.15.4 is unable to send all of the data packets to
    the sink because it loses

    more of them.

    In addition, the signal to noise ratios for the IEEE 802.15.4 and the suggested
    protocol scenarios were

    contrasted, as shown in the accompanying image.

    The horizontal axis in this graph represents simulation time, and the vertical
    axis represents the signal to

    noise ratio. Importantly, IEEE 802.15.4 transmits data via unreliable routes,
    and the percentage of bits

    with errors increases over time. The signal to noise ratio falls as a result.
    The signal of data transmitted

    by IEEE 802.15.4 may also vanish as a result of tra¨c and confusion, which increases
    the likelihood of

    noise. The quality of transmitted data (text, data, or multimedia) suffers as
    a result.

    Comparing and contrasting the proposed method with IEEE 802.15.4 is shown in Table 3:

    5. Conclusion

    For extending the lifespan of WSNs, supplying suitable energy consumption, and
    optimising WSN lifetime

    for agriculture, energy saving is recognised as a crucial characteristic of sensor
    nodes. In order to cluster

    sensor networks, this research suggests a novel approach that combines fuzzy logic
    and genetic

    algorithms. The uniqueness of this research is the use of a revolutionary genetic
    algorithm-based

    method, along with fuzzy logic approaches, to choose a cluster head in the Internet
    of Things

    dynamically. As a result, choosing the cluster head and identifying the node with
    the highest energy are

    faster and more precise processes. However, we are able to achieve balanced clustering
    and thus

    lengthen network lifetime by employing a two-phase CH selection method with a
    fuzzy system identifying

    the best candidates and GA further selecting the best among them. The suggested
    approach distributes

    the expended energy among balanced clusters after being divided into them. The
    primary population

    gathers input data at random for the genetic algorithm, which is nature-inspired.
    Additionally, the genetic

    algorithm is a nonlinear optimisation technique that, because of its effectiveness
    in large-scale

    Page 14/32

    applications, is a relatively better choice. The ¦nal formula can also be changed
    by the operators. The

    ¦nal product, which is produced once the generating process is complete, provides
    the best ¦x for the

    primary issue. Crossover, scoring, selection, and mutation functions are generally
    included in all the

    advances brought about by the generation process. The process by which two distinct
    chromosomes

    marry to create a new generation is referred to as crossover. This function is
    productive and occurs at a

    certain rate. Here, one aspect of the many crossover techniques is emphasised.
    However, a genetic

    algorithm''s most crucial component is scoring or assigning ¦tness, which makes
    use of fuzzy logic. The

    literature has concentrated on developing an intelligent ¦tness function that
    uses fuzzy logic to

    distinguish amongst quali¦ed individuals. Using a mutation strategy that permits
    particular

    chromosomes to enter the new generation, the selection process adopts superior
    chromosomes in order

    to produce a new population. Due to the stochastic nature of the genetic algorithm,
    numerous solutions

    with differing performances are discovered in various iterations of the algorithm
    [26].

    The suggested method for WSNs was supplied and explored in great detail. In this
    study, the suggested

    protocol and IEEE 802.15.4 were simulated using OPNET software. We also looked
    into important service

    quality metrics for these two protocols, including throughput rate, energy consumption,
    delay, signal to

    noise ratio, and packet loss rate.

    The idea of "data transmission between nodes by clustering" is used in this research
    to choose the best

    nodes for transmitting data ¦les. As was mentioned above, the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol
    can be optimised

    for e¨ciency by applying genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic for clustering and
    choosing cluster heads.

    Due to a genetic algorithm used in the suggested protocol, which performs parallel
    processing and has a

    quick convergence rate, the learning rate is increased. The suggested protocol
    is also more likely to reach

    the global optimal point because of the rivalry for responses and the selection
    of the best nodes from the

    population. Fuzzy logic can also be used in imprecise environments due to its
    accuracy and precision,

    which enhances the performance precision of the ¦tness function of the genetic
    algorithm in choosing

    the best cluster heads based on the workload and remaining energy of the sensor
    nodes. In order to

    compare the e¨ciency of the proposed protocol and IEEE 802.15.4, the following
    parameters were

    simulated in OPNET11.5 and compared: multimedia delay, end-to-end delay, link
    reliability, signal-to-noise

    ratio, throughput rate, packet loss rate, packet error rate, and energy consumption.
    In general, it is possible

    to maintain that the proposed protocol performed better than IEEE 802.15.4. When
    compared to IEEE

    802.15.4, the proposed protocol could more effectively increase the e¨ciency of
    the entire network,

    packet delivery reliability, and network throughput rate because it chooses more
    energy-e¨cient routes.

    Fuzzy logic''s high processing costs and grouping based on genetic algorithms
    are two drawbacks of this

    approach. The reduction in processing costs for the fuzzy approach-based model
    depends on how many

    fuzzy rules are utilised in the resolution. A longer execution time is implied
    by an increase in this quantity

    since it broadens the scope of the solution exploration. Furthermore, careful
    selection of the GA

    parameters, which differ between systems, is required when using a genetic algorithm
    to reduce

    processing costs. As a result, it is challenging to decrease the processing time
    and execution time for the

    approaches given.

  explanation: The abstract of the paper highlights that machine learning techniques,
    such as genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning, have the potential to enhance
    the performance of closed-loop control strategies for real-time automated irrigation
    systems. These techniques can help the systems adapt to changing environmental
    conditions and crop requirements more effectively. The full text further states
    that the Fuzzy SARSA Learning (FSL) algorithm, which combines fuzzy logic with
    a reinforcement learning technique, was applied to optimize closed-loop control
    strategies for an on-request water delivery system in the Aghili irrigation network
    in Iran. The FSL algorithm was found to provide good and valid results, especially
    in situations with water shortage, suggesting its potential for equitable water
    distribution and maintaining delivery adequacy under emergency conditions.
  extract_1: In this work, the conventional manual operation on the same canal was
    evaluated, and the results were compared with FSL. The results for both methods
    in the normal condition of the network were acceptable because the adequacy and
    efficiency indicators were more than 90%, and the maximum deviation of water depth
    was less than 10%.
  extract_2: However, in the circumstance of water shortage, the results indicated
    that applying the FSL method provided good and valid results, so that the index
    of adequacy was almost 0.7 for all blocks. Therefore, the FSL is able to distribute
    the water more equitably among the consumers in water shortage conditions.

    improvement of irrigation networks is inevitable because of limited water resources
    and competition in various sectors of industry, agriculture, environment, and
    urban water consumption. Application of appropriate water delivery scheduling
    is one of the methods to improve irrigation management. Several delivery methods
    are practiced in irrigation networks according to water availability, type of
    network control system, and exiting capacities. One promising delivery method
    is the on-request system, which could be applied manually in irrigation networks.
    High performance of delivery methods arise from the determination of appropriate
    operation instructions. In previous studies, the Fuzzy SARSA learning (FSL) method
    was applied to determine operation instruction for on-request delivery in a canal
    of the Aghili irrigation network located in southwest Iran (SARSA is the definition
    of state, action, reward, state, action). In this work, the conventional manual
    operation on the same canal was evaluated, and the results were compared with
    FSL. The results for both methods in the normal condition of the network were
    acceptable because the adequacy and efficiency indicators were more than 90%,
    and the maximum deviation of water depth was less than 10%. However, in the circumstance
    of water shortage, the results indicated that applying the FSL method provided
    good and valid results, so that the index of adequacy was almost 0.7 for all blocks.
    Therefore, the FSL is able to distribute the water more equitably among the consumers
    in water shortage conditions. Introduction Different delivery methods were used
    in irrigated agriculture. A delivery schedule is a process in which time, amount,
    and location of water delivery are determined. The features of delivery methods
    are defined by flow rate ( Q ), irrigation frequency ( f ), delivery duration
    ( t ), and the person who decides on these parameters. A variety of classifications
    were suggested by different researchers considering variability of one or more
    of these parameters, and the person in charge of the decision making, whether
    farmer or network manager. Rotational, on-request (arranged), and on-demand methods
    are three primary types of delivery methods (Anwar and Haq 2013). Rotational delivery,
    in which farmers receive water on a rotation basis, is the most common method.
    In this method, decisions about delivery parameters are made by network authorities
    and usually remained fixed for the agricultural season. On-demand schedule is
    a method that is controlled by the farmers and provides the highest flexibility
    to adapt to irrigation requirements. The user is allowed to receive water based
    on the desired time with little limitation according to the available capacity
    (Merrian 1987). This system should be fully automatic and equipped with high-capacity
    canals and storage tanks. The on-demand and rotation schedules have the most and
    the least flexibility, respectively. The on-request schedule is between on-demand
    and rotational delivery in terms of flexibility. In on-request schedules, the
    discharge, frequency, and duration are adjusted by the agreement between the farmers
    and network manager. In this method, the amount of water requirement is announced
    by farmers, and the network manager makes an agreement with farmers according
    to water availability and other water orders and operates the structures accordingly.
    The on-request schedule increases flexibility compared with rotational delivery
    and does not need costly infrastructure as does on-demand schedules. Furthermore,
    on-request schedules could be implemented manually in the exiting irrigation networks.
    In this method, the proper operational instructions are more complicated than
    that for rotation schedules. Because of the number of orders and variety of water
    requests, preparing operational instructions will be complicated. The developed
    operational instructions will have a direct impact on the network performance.
    Different methods have been used for the determination of operation instructions,
    which are briefly explained in this paper. Several optimization models have been
    applied for scheduling of water delivery and irrigation rotation for different
    users along the distribution canal considering a steady-flow condition. Simulated
    annealing (SA), genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and
    0-1 programming are the examples of these models presented by Monem and Namdarian
    (2005), Monem and Nouri (2010), Anwar and Haq (2013), Mathur et al. (2009), Ramesh
    et al. (2009), and Anwar and Clarke (2001). Application of delivery schedules
    is one of the sources of unsteady flow in irrigation canals. Because of demand
    variations, it is necessary to change the flow at the canal intake, and check
    structures and turnouts should be adjusted accordingly. Therefore, the operational
    instructions should consider the unsteady flow behavior to minimize its negative
    effects on water delivery. Hydrodynamic models are suitable tools to simulate
    unsteady flow in canals with different structures and various hydraulic conditions.
    A number of hydrodynamic models for irrigation canals have been developed, including
    the simulation of irrigation canals (SIC), SOBEK (named after the ancient Egyptian
    crocodile River god), canal management (CANALMAN), hydrologic engineering center-river
    analysis system (HEC-RAS), and irrigation conveyance system simulation (ICSS).
    Tariq and Latif (2010) used the SIC hydrodynamic model to evaluate the operational
    performance of the distributaries. In this study, different operational scenarios
    were investigated and quantified based on fixed frequency operation. Montazar
    et al. (2006) studied various operation scenarios and their effect on flow regulation
    and water distribution in an irrigation canal of the Narmada district, located
    in northwest India, by using the SOBEK model and showing the ability of SOBEK.
    Haque et al. (2006) developed a model for water distribution in a rice growing
    area with CANALMAN in the state of Terengganu, Malaysia. The results of this study
    were used to improve the water delivery through gate regulations. Mohseni Movahed
    and Monem (2007) utilized the irrigation conveyance system simulation-delivery
    optimization model (ICSS-DOM) for assessment of operation method and optimization
    of water delivery schedule on the E1R1 secondary canal of the Dez irrigation network
    for 10 days. The results indicated that optimal performance improved very well
    in comparison with the present situation, and the developed model was an efficient
    tool for the evaluation and optimization of irrigation canal performance. Shahrokhnia
    and Javan (2005) applied HEC-RAS to assess the performance of the Ordibehesht
    canal of the Doorodzan irrigation network. The results show that HEC-RAS could
    be used for a large and complex irrigation networks in the absence of observed
    flow data and improvement of irrigation management plans. Previous research was
    mostly performed for rotation or on-demand schedules, whereas on-request schedules
    with more complex operation requires specific study and advanced methods for determination
    operational instructions. The Fuzzy SARSA Learning (FSL) is one of the promising
    branches of artificial intelligence and is presented as a new learning method
    that discovers and constructs the structure of the environment in parallel with
    learning the optimal policy (SARSA is the definition of state, action, reward,
    state, action). The convergence of the FSL method has been proven mathematically
    and successfully used in several applications, such as game theory, controlling
    of robots, and industry (Glorennec and Jouffe 1997; Derhami 2007; Derhami et al.
    2008). The lack of mathematical analysis and proper exploration are the weakness
    of some of learning methods, but the FSL has resolved those weaknesses (Shahverdi
    2015). FSL results could be generalized and could easily handle the uncertainties.
    The FSL has the capability to learn different and limited situations and estimate
    operational instructions for a wide range of conditions (Shahverdi et al. 2016).
    The FSL was used by Shahverdi et al. (2016) in combination with the ICSS hydrodynamic
    model for determining operational instructions for on-request schedules. The results
    showed that the developed algorithm is suitable for determination of appropriate
    operations. The objective of this study is to examine the performance of conventional
    operation for on-request schedules in the Aghili irrigation network with a delivery
    duration of 24 h and compare results with the FSL method. Material and Methods
    Area Description The Aghili irrigation network (Fig. 1) is located in Khuzestan
    province in southwest Iran. It consists of a primary conveyance canal and two
    primary canals named eastern and western Aghili. The total irrigated command area
    is 7,225 ha, of which the average annual water consumption is estimated at approximately
    150 million m 3 . Water travels approximately 12 km from the Gotvand diversion
    Dam through the primary canal and feeds two primary canals. The eastern and western
    canal capacities are 5 and 7 m 3 / s , respectively. Fig. 1. Location of the Aghili
    irrigation network In this work, the conventional manual operation of eastern
    Aghili was examined. The on-request schedule is the conventional operation in
    this primary canal with delivery duration ( t ) of 24 h and 10-day delivery period
    ( f ). The primary canal is a 16.215-km-long concrete canal with a trapezoidal
    cross section, with side slope of ∶ 1 ∶ 1 . Bed slope is variable along the canal
    between 0.0001 and 0.0004. For the first 9.49 km of the canal, the bottom width
    is 1.5 m, and for the rest of the canal, it is 1 m. There are 21 turnouts and
    11 check structures, which are all rectangular flat slide gates. The canal reach
    between two check structures is called a block. Thus, the canal is divided into
    11 blocks. Table 1 gives the block characteristics, and Fig. 2 shows the longitudinal
    profile of the canal. Table 1. Characteristics of Blocks Block Turnout number

    profile of the examined canal Conventional Operation Method in the Aghili Irrigation
    Network In the Aghili irrigation network with on-request schedule, farmers order
    the amount of required water by filling order forms 24 h in advance. The operator
    collects the orders and determines the time and required adjustment of structures
    accordingly. For operation execution, the operator moves along the canal from
    upstream and regulates the relevant structures. The structures’ adjustments are
    determined based on the secondary steady flow condition and the operator’s experience.
    The time interval between adjustments of two structures is a function of the distance
    between the two structures, the time required for adjusting the desired structure,
    and the operator’s experience on hydraulic behavior and flow travel time. Adjustments
    of turnouts are performed when the water depth for new discharge would be almost
    constant around the target depth ( y t ) within the dead band ( ± 10 y t ). The
    slide gate flow equation is used to calculate the adjustments of the gate using
    the upstream depth (target depth) and the gate flow rate. ICSS Model The ICSS
    model has been used for simulating operational conditions of the eastern Aghili
    canal to estimate water deliveries to the turnouts and to calculate the performance
    of operation. ICSS developed by Manz (1990) is a one-dimensional model for gradually
    varied flow that is designed to simulate the hydraulics, hydrology, and operations
    of irrigation conveyance systems. The ICSS model is capable of simulating steady
    and unsteady flow with a variety of canal cross sections, a wide range of structures,
    and different boundary conditions. FSL Method The FSL method, which is the combination
    of fuzzy logic controller and SARSA reinforcement learning (RL), is an extended
    version of RL and can be used in the problems with continuous input/output and
    large space. Fuzzy set theory is a generalization of classical set theory. The
    Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) model is one of the most common fuzzy systems used in
    the past decades. A simplified typical zero-order TSK model is a fuzzy system
    in which the rule consequents are usually crisp numbers of the inputs (Sugeno
    and Takagi 1983). Eq. (1) shows a zero-order TSK with n -input, one-output, and
    R rules. R i : If x 1 is L i 1 and … and x n is L in , then ( α i 1 with value
    Q i 1 ) or … or ( α i m with value Q i m ) (1) in which s = x 1 × ⋯ × x n is the
    vector of input; L i = L i 1 × ⋯ × L i n is the fuzzy set of the rule of i ; m
    = number of possible discrete actions for each rule; a i j = candidate action
    of j ; and weight of Q i j = value of the action of j in the rule of i . FSL learns
    a simplified fuzzy TSK model in the SARSA RL process. SARSA RL tunes the parameters
    of conclusion parts of TKS system (values of Q i j ) to obtain the best policy.
    In FSL, consider that the system is in the initial state of S t , and the following
    steps are performed for the next states ( S t + 1 ): 1. Observing state of S t
    + 1 and assigning immediate reward of r t + 1 by using Eq. (2) | y t + 1 − y target
    | > 0.1 y target → r t + 1 = − 10 × | y t + 1 − y target | | y t + 1 − y target
    | < 0.1 y target → r t + 1 = 100 ( d Q c t + 1 + d (2) In which d Q c and d Q
    t -flow deviations in the check structures and turnouts from target values, respectively;
    and y and y target = observed and target depth at upstream of check structure.
    The subscript of t + 1 refers to the state of t + 1 . The parameters for reward
    calculation are provided by the ICSS model. Input to the ICSS is a set of selected
    actions. The ICSS performs the actions and simulates the canal system and computes
    the water depths and flow rates. The simulation time step was 0.01 h, and the
    total operation time for each operation was 24 h. 2. The softmax action selection
    method is used to select the action in this research. In this method, the probability
    of all actions in all rules are first computed using Eq. (3); then, the action
    of rule of i , which has higher probability, are selected and nominated as a i
    i + p ( a i j ) = e μ i Q i j / δ t ∑ j = 1 m e μ i Q i j / δ t (3) in which μ
    i = firing strength of rule i computed by the product of the antecedent fuzzy
    sets; Q i j = weight of action of i in rule of j , which is equal to zero at the
    beginning of learning; and δ > 0 is the temperature specifying how random values
    should be chosen. When δ is high and Q is low, the actions is are selected with
    the same probability. The initial value of δ was 30 in this research, and δ decreases
    by Eq. (4) during the learning process δ t + 1 = δ t − d δ · δ t (4) in which
    d δ = reduction coefficient, which was 0.009 in this research. As the temperature
    is reduced, the actions with higher values are more likely to be selected. As
    the maximum assigned reward becomes close to the maximum reward for an action,
    the value of that action would be the highest. The greedy action selection method
    selects the action a using Eq. (5), for which Q is the highest weight of actions
    a = arg max b ∈ A Q t ( s , b ) (5) 3. The system output of a is computed by Eq.
    (6), and the corresponding action value function of w t ( s t , a t ) is estimated
    according to Eq. (7) a t ( s t ) = ∑ i = 1 R μ i ( s t ) a i i + (6) w t ( s t
    , a t ) = ∑ i = 1 R μ i ( s t ) Q t i i + (7) 4. As the computed action is applied
    to the environment (canal system), the weight parameters of the rule of i are
    updated by Eq. (8) Δ Q t + 1 i j = { β t × Δ w ( s t , a t ) × μ i ( s t ) if
    j = i + 0 otherwise (8) in which β = learning rate. The learning rate determines
    to what extent the newly acquired information will override the old information.
    The β value of 0 will make the agent to learn nothing. The initial value of learning
    rate ( β 0 ) is determined by trial and error obtained as 0.9 in this study, and
    is decreased during the learning process by Eq. (9) β t + 1 = β t 1.017 (9) in
    which β t = learning rate in iterations and is equal to β 0 for the first iteration.
    If β i + 1 → 0 , then Δ Q → 0 . The approximate action value error ( Δ w ) is
    computed using Eq. (10) Δ w t ( s t , a t ) = r t + 1 + γ w t ( s t + 1 , a t
    + 1 ) − w t ( s t , a t ) (10) in which γ = discount factor ( 0 < γ < 1 ) and
    is determined by trial and error. The discount factor determines the importance
    of future rewards. If rewards received in the far future are worth less than rewards
    received sooner, they are described as being discounted. 5. Make t → t + 1 and
    return to Step 1 if termination criterion was not reached. The maximum iteration
    number is considered as 10,000. However the learning is completed in less than
    10,000 iterations. In irrigation canals, the agent is the canal structure. The
    environmental information is provided from the canal system using a simulator.
    The policy is a probability of the action selection function [Eq. (10)]. An appropriate
    action (check structures and turnout settings) causes the water depth deviations
    to occur near the target depth, and the delivery discharge error decreases. Reward
    is defined as a function of immediate adequacy and efficiency of water delivery
    at specified depth. The Q function is defined as a long run reward of adequacy
    and efficiency at specified depth. The value of each action is stored in the Q
    function. The simulator in the present study is the ICSS model. There is no need
    for data or a model to calibrate the FSL, because FSL interacts with the environment
    and is calibrated with itself during the learning by updating the values of the
    Q function. When the learning is completed, the Q function reaches the best values.
    FSL converges to the optimum values with 100% probability. The initial inputs
    of the model are the physical characteristics of the canal, water requirements,
    and target depths. Using the probability action selection function, a specific
    gate adjustment is selected. The selected action is executed in the simulator
    (ICSS model), and hydraulic behavior is simulated for a desired time period and
    performance indicators are determined. The reward for the selected action is calculated
    based on performance indicators. The appropriate actions with higher rewards are
    saved and form the long-term reward of the Q function. Finally, according to the
    Q function, the best action with the highest reward is determined. The best selected
    action is introduced to the operator to be executed in canal for the desired time
    period. In the present study, the MATLAB code of the described FSL architecture
    was written and linked with prepared ICSS code in FORTRAN (Shahverdi et al. 2016).
    Performance Indicators The performance indicators of measure of performance relative
    to efficiency (MPF), measure of performance relative to adequacy (MPA), and measure
    of performance relative to equity (MPE) were used to evaluate the performance
    of water delivery in irrigation canals. Efficiency reflects the water waste in
    irrigation canals (Molden and Gates 1990). The delivery efficiency is defined
    as the ratio of requested to diverted discharge. Water delivery must satisfy agreed-upon
    delivery as close as possible. Adequacy is the ratio of the delivered to requested
    discharge. Equity, as related to the water delivery system, is defined as spatial
    uniformity of adequacy indicator. The efficiency, adequacy, and equity indicators
    are represented as Eqs. (11)–(13) MPF = 1 N ∑ N 1 M ∑ M ( PE ) , { PE = Q R Q
    D if Q R < Q D PE = 1 if Q R Q D ≥ 1 (11) MPA = 1 N ∑ N 1 M ∑ M ( PA ) , { PA
    = Q D Q R if Q R > Q D PA = 1 if Q D Q R ≥ 1 (12) MPE = 1 T ∑ T CV N ( Q D Q R
    ) (13) where T = time; N = number of time steps in delivery period; M = number
    of turnouts; Q D = delivered discharge; and Q R = requested discharge. The best
    MPE and MPA values of 1.0 is desirable; MPE values less than 1.0 indicate water
    waste, and MPA values less than 1.0 indicate water deficiency. The performance
    indicators of maximum absolute error (MAE) and integral of absolute magnitude
    of error (IAE) were used to evaluate the control of water depth. The MAE is a
    measure of maximum deviation in water level from the desired target depth. The
    IAE indicates how long and how far the water level deviates from target depth.
    The smaller the MAE and IAE values, the better the performance of the system.
    The MAE and IAE indicators defined by the ASCE Task Committee as Eqs. (14) and
    (15), respectively (Clemmens et al. 1998) MAE = max ( | y target − y | ) y target
    (14) IAE = T D ∑ T = 0 D ( | y target − y | ) y target (15) where T and D = simulation
    time step and total simulation time, respectively. Studied Scenarios To examine
    the water delivery schedule of the eastern Aghili canal, the recorded data of
    flow variation for irrigation season of 2011 were obtained. The first day situation
    was considered as the initial condition. Two scenarios of normal condition and
    water shortage are considered. In Scenario 1, the normal circumstance of the Aghili
    network was considered. It means that there was no water shortage in the network
    and the requested water of the canal will be supplied. The canal inflow and the
    turnout requirements for this scenario are given in Table 2. Table 2. Turnout

    In Scenario 2, 30% water shortage is examined. The capability of the FSL method
    for equitable water distribution and maintaining delivery adequacy under such
    an emergency condition is tested. The requested water for this scenario is given
    in Table 3. Table 3. Turnout Requirements for Scenario 2 Turnout number QT (the

    required data for evaluating and analyzing the scenarios were obtained from simulation
    of Aghili canal and the conventional operation schedule using the ICSS hydrodynamic
    model, and the results of the simulation were compared to FSL results. For conventional
    operation, the required adjustment of structures was determined according to the
    secondary steady flow, and operational timing was calculated based on the average
    speed of operator driving motorcycle, which was considered to be 30 km / h and
    the distance between structures. The FSL method determined the optimum time and
    required adjustment of the structures so that the error of delivered water is
    minimal, while the performance indicators are close to their optimum value and
    the target depth remains in the dead band. The time and adjustments of structures
    for both methods are given in Table 4 for Scenario 1. In this scenario, the operation
    started at time zero (8:00 a.m.) and continued for 24 h (the next morning at 8:00
    a.m.). In the conventional method, the first turnout opening was adjusted to 17.5
    cm at 0.11 h, and all other structures along the canal were adjusted in sequence.
    Finally, the last structure was adjusted to 5.5 cm at 3.7 h, and after that the
    water delivery was continued for 20.25 h. Performance indicators were determined
    and presented in Table 5. Table 4. Operational Instructions Scenario 1 in the

    are very close to their optimum value for both the conventional and FSL methods.
    The minimum value of efficiency and adequacy in the conventional and FSL method
    were 0.994 and 0.962, respectively. For most of the blocks, the adequacy was 1
    for both methods, and the equity indicator of the canal was less than 0.1, which
    indicates that all turnouts receive an equitable share of water. In addition,
    the MAE indicator was less than 10% and showed the water depth deviation from
    target depth was in the dead band. The results show that the two methods provide
    similar outputs in these scenarios. Applying the FSL instead of the conventional
    method showed no specific advantages in this condition. The Scenario 2 was defined
    for the water shortage in the network with 30% reduction of the canal inflow.
    For both methods, the requested discharge kept the same as Scenario 1. When the
    inflow of the canal is much less or more than the required amount, the adequacy
    and equity are more important than other indicators. Table 6 shows the performance
    indicators for this condition. In the conventional method the adequacy was more
    than 0.9 in the upstream blocks, whereas it was zero in downstream blocks. This
    result shows that in the conventional method, the upstream outlets have received
    enough water and the shortage has imposed to the downstream. Fig. 3 presents the
    variation of adequacy in each block. The adequacy indicators for all blocks are
    almost 0.7 in the FSL method. It is obvious that unlike the conventional method,
    the FSL method could provide the equity among the users, which is very important
    in the shortage condition. Table 6. Performance Indicators in Scenario 2 in the

    The lower equity of the conventional method in comparison to FSL indicates that
    the conventional method is not suitable for equitable water distribution among
    delivery points in a water shortage condition. Emergency condition of water shortage
    occurs frequently in the traditional networks with upstream control. Conclusion
    In this study, applying the FSL method for extracting the operation instructions
    was evaluated for normal and water shortage condition in the Aghili network, and
    the result has been compared with the conventional operation. The canal was simulated
    using the ICSS hydrodynamic model, and the results of both methods were assessed
    using performance indicators. The results of the normal condition (Scenario 1)
    indicated that both methods have high performance and there was a slight difference.
    The difference between delivered and required water were very low, and the performance
    indicators were very close to their optimum values. As a result, it can be said
    that applying the FSL method has no special advantage compared to conventional
    operation in the normal condition. Whereas in the water shortage condition (Scenario
    2), the FSL method can extract the proper adjustment and distribute the flow with
    high equity among consumers, and the adequacy indicator was almost equal in all
    blocks. However, for the conventional method, the shortage is imposed to the downstream,
    and the upstream outlets receive the requested water as it is common in the networks
    with upstream control systems. Considering the results, the conventional method
    is appropriate for normal conditions. However, in an emergency condition, such
    as water shortage, this method is not capable to maintain equitable water distribution,
    and the FSL method performs much better. The advantage of FSL is because it is
    a learning method that benefits from long-term reward and finds optimum operations
    through the learning process. Therefore, irrigation canal operation could benefit
    from the FSL method for emergency conditions such as water shortage. Notation

    • Traditional rice farming in Italy relies on labor-intensive flood irrigation.
    • Research explores the use of remotely controlled gates for efficient irrigation.
    • Non-linear predictive control enhances water level coordination and conservation.
    Abstract Rice is one of the most important staple foods in the world. In Europe,
    Italy is the main producer of rice, with almost all production concentrated in
    the northeast of the country. Traditionally, rice is grown in fields that are
    flooded from before planting until just before harvest. This water management
    technique requires a great deal of labour for farmers who have to manually adjust
    the inlet and outlet gates to maintain a constant ponding water level in the fields,
    especially when there is fluctuation of water supply at the farm inlet, for example
    as a result of rainfall. In addition, the practice of flood irrigation is very
    water-intensive. New technologies based on remotely and automatically controlled
    gates are being studied to increase the efficiency of this irrigation method.
    The objective of this work is to explore the potential of a coordinated and intelligent
    system of gates for efficient farm irrigation management and ponding water level
    maintenance. Based on information and measurements from a real case study consisting
    of a 40-hectare paddy rice farm located in northern Italy, where automatic gates
    and water level sensors were placed at strategic points of the farm canals and
    fields, respectively, a proportional-integral (PI) and a non-linear model predictive
    control (NMPC) of water levels were implemented and compared through modelling
    and simulation experiments. The results show that the proportional-integral control
    reproduces the actions that the farmer uses when faced with situations of surplus
    of water in the fields or a shortage of water in the farm canal. In particular,
    the general coordination of the gates is lost, and the individual binomial field-gate
    prevails as an independent system in the farmer''s operation. Conversely, non-linear
    predictive control coordinates the gate operation to obtain a uniform ponding
    water level in the fields when there is a shortage of water, or significant water
    conservation when there is an excess of water as a result of rainfall. In conclusion,
    a nonlinear predictive control model seems to be a suitable strategy to advance
    irrigation management in rice farms, allowing rice farmers to continue the tradition
    of flooding while increasing its performance. Previous article in issue Next article

    control model 1. Introduction Rice is the third most produced crop in the world
    and a staple food for more than half of the world''s population, mostly living
    in developing countries (Fukagawa and Ziska, 2019). In this context, Italy is
    the leading rice producer in Europe, accounting for more than half of the total
    production of this high-value crop (Facchi et al., 2018). Typically, rice is grown
    in fields that are flooded from planting to pre-harvest, and this traditional
    irrigation technique (i.e., continuous submergence) is considered an important
    sink of water resources. This technique is dominant in most areas and is characterized
    by low irrigation efficiency (Cesari de Maria et al., 2016). In addition, irrigation
    management requires a lot of human labour, as it is still based on maintaining
    a predetermined water level in the paddies by manually regulating the irrigation
    inflow rate (Masseroni et al., 2017). In this context, the application of flexible
    and automatic control devices for irrigation management in paddy rice farms appears
    to be a viable solution that can be exploited to (i) increase the water use efficiency
    of rice cultivation and (ii) reduce the effort dedicated to irrigation flow rate
    regulation at field and farm scale, without changing the traditional irrigation
    flooding practices. More specifically, hydraulic infrastructures based on a system
    of coordinated gates located at strategic points of the farm irrigation network
    can allow to maintain optimal water levels in the farm channels and rice plots,
    providing more consistent and reliable irrigation flows through the farm service
    points. A recent review on the identification of smart automatic irrigation techniques
    for sustainable rice environments shows that there is a great potential for water
    conservation through the use of automatic and coordinated gate systems in permanently-flooded
    rice farms, with benefits in terms of both increasing the quality and quantity
    of crop production (Champness et al., 2023). Nevertheless, the review highlighted
    that these systems applied in paddy rice contexts are still in an embryonic stage
    and their application is limited to individual rice plots (Masseroni et al., 2018).
    Table 1 shows the degree of automation and sensor components developed in the
    main automated gravity surface irrigation system experiments for rice. In general,
    all have successfully developed a desktop-based system for remote control of irrigation,
    but only Masseroni et al. (2018) have developed a system using commercially available
    infrastructure in a commercial-scale. Table 1. Summary of the components and capabilities
    of the automated rice irrigation systems (rearranged from Champness et al., 2023).

    aimed to improve the sustainability of agricultural water use has indirectly stimulated
    irrigation modernisation projects. For example, the Lombardy region (the most
    important region in Italy from an industrial and agricultural point of view, with
    over 7000 km2 of irrigated land) is promoting bottom-up initiatives in the form
    of "information and pilot project actions". The main aim of these initiatives
    is to demonstrate the potential of innovative irrigation management systems at
    farm and district level, and to promote a shared understanding of modernisation
    objectives. In this study, we analyse and reflect on the results achieved in one
    of these pilot initiatives. Specifically, the project represents a pioneering
    example of the transition to a flexible and harmonised approach to irrigation
    management in paddy farms. In particular, a new modelling framework adopted for
    a coordinated and centralized flowrate regulation is described. The control algorithm
    implemented to maintain a predetermined ponding water level in the fields according
    to site-specific conditions is presented and tested under two different scenarios
    of shortage and surplus of water supply to the farm. The impact of this new centralised
    management of farm gates on water conservation was compared with the impact of
    a traditional decentralised management of gates, which roughly simulates the operations
    carried out manually by the farmer. The results may provide indications for improving
    flood management in rice cultivation, taking into account the effects of climate
    change on freshwater availability and rainfall patterns. 2. Control strategies
    for a sustainable agricultural water management Advanced but still little explored
    strategies for achieving coordinated control of complex systems of physical devices
    for irrigation (e.g. gates, valves, pumps) are those represented by proportional-integral-derivative
    (PID) or predictive controls (van Overloop et al., 2005, Bertsekas, 2005). The
    first class of controls offers a mid-point between simple bang-bang controls (i.e.
    feedback controllers that switches abruptly between two states - on or off - when
    a desired target (setpoint) has been reached) and model-based controls such as
    predictive ones (Huang et al., 2022). In agricultural water management, PID control
    has been mainly used for real-time control of soil moisture (Harper, 2017), management
    of sprinkler irrigation equipment (Jacob et al., 2019), and control of irrigation
    canal operations (Litrico et al., 2007). A good description of the application
    of predictive control in the field of water resource systems is provided by Castelletti
    et al. (2023). In particular, they consider three main areas of interest in the
    application of the model predictive control (MPC), namely the water reservoir,
    the open channels and the urban water network. In the first case, reservoirs are
    usually multi-purpose systems serving power plants, irrigation districts, urban
    and industrial water users, as well as contributing to other objectives such as
    flood control, environmental management, navigation, water quality, etc. Traditionally,
    reservoir control is implemented by a human operator who can act on the basis
    of static control curves or control actions proposed in real time by a decision
    support system (DSS). In this case, the predictive control strategy can help to
    decide the release from the reservoir at time t + 1 depending on the release decision,
    the storage and the net inflow (usually affected by potential disturbances) to
    the reservoir at time t. In the second case, open channels are stretches of water
    between two control structures. Actuators are hydraulic infrastructure, such as
    gates, weirs and dams, available for water control purposes. Finally, nodes represent
    channel junctions, i.e. locations where a stream flows into or branches off from
    the main stream (these are known as tributaries and distributaries, respectively).
    The dynamics of open channels are best described by the Saint-Venant equations,
    a set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. In this case, the predictive
    control strategy can help, for example, to maintain a pool between two actuators
    (to limit fluctuations in water diverted by tributaries). It can also support
    a bottom-up approach to gravity water distribution for irrigation, where the actual
    irrigation requirements of the fields are incorporated into the gate operations
    on the irrigation canals and ultimately the release function from the reservoir.
    In the third case, the urban water network is affected by the integrated urban
    water cycle, which consists of several infrastructural and operational components,
    including water source management, water treatment, water transport and distribution,
    sewerage/sewage collection and rainwater/stormwater drainage systems, with the
    main objective of providing water for human needs reliably, efficiently and safely,
    and then returning it to the environment with the least possible impact. Taking
    water transport and distribution networks as an example, an optimal control problem
    (possibly involving a predictive control strategy) is typically formulated as
    an optimal pump operation and valve setting control problem, aiming at resource
    and economic savings in energy consumption and associated costs, while ensuring
    that water is delivered to end users to meet their water needs. The main application
    of predictive control strategy (Bwambale et al., 2023) in irrigation management
    is in water, energy and fertiliser conservation. In particular, this strategy
    has largely been applied in the areas of irrigation canal flow control and regulation
    (Álvarez et al., 2013), while limited experiences were found in irrigation scheduling
    (Abioye et al., 2021), soil water potential regulation (Chen et al., 2020), soil
    moisture regulation (Ayaz et al., 2020) and lastly prediction of precipitation
    and evapotranspiration (Guo and You, 2018). Nothing to the author''s knowledge
    has been found on the application of predictive control model on irrigation management
    at field or farm scale and in particular on paddy rice. 3. Material and methods
    3.1. The pilot case study The flexible and coordinated irrigation management system
    was implemented at Cascina Ca'' Granda Milano, a rice paddy farm (40 ha in size)
    located in the south of Milan, consisting of 10 fields with an average size of
    about 4 ha each (Fig. 1). The fields are characterized by a toposequence (from
    north to south), which facilitates the irrigation procedures. More specifically,
    the fields are divided into five different blocks (i.e., bc, d, ehi, fg, lm),
    which are characterized by a single point of entry of the water flow. For example,
    in block bc, the only entry point is located in b. From b, the water flows into
    c, since it is topographically lower than b. According to the toposequence, the
    fields are irrigated as follows: block bc is irrigated first, followed by block
    d, third block ehi, then block fg, and finally block lm. Download : Download high-res

    – Ferit® (dot [L1–5]) are included in the picture. Flow rate direction into the
    farm canal network is indicated by blue arrows. Subdivision of fields [b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,l,m]
    in block is shown in red. All the fields have been sown with rice (Leonida variety)
    and the irrigation practice adopted is continuous flooding. In particular, rice
    is sown in dry soil at the end of April and the fields are flooded when the rice
    is around the three-leaf stage (i.e. about one month after sowing). Harvesting
    is typically scheduled for mid-September, while the fields are drained at the
    end of August. Eleven boreholes were drilled within the fields to determine soil
    hydraulic properties. On average, the soils are characterized by a silt loam texture
    with slight variability between blocks. The low conductivity layer thickness was
    approximately 30 cm, characterized by an average saturated hydraulic conductivity
    of approximately 1.8 mm/h. The nominal flow rate delivered to the farm by the
    irrigation agency is about 200 l/s continuously during the irrigation season (i.e.,
    April to September). The water is delivered to the farm from the north, i.e. upstream
    of points P1 and P2. There are no drainage points in the fields, while only one
    farm canal drainage point is activated in case of overflows. 3.1.1. Equipment
    At strategic points of the farm canal (P1–4 in Fig. 1) four automatic and remote
    controlled PikoMeter® gates (Rubicon Water, AU) were installed (Fig. 2a) to control
    the irrigation within the blocks. The PikoMeter® consists of three main components:
    an ultrasonic level sensor inside the gate frame, a flow meter and a steel gate.
    The flow meter measures the flow rate across the gate; hence the volume integrating
    the flow rates during irrigation. This meter consists of a cylindrical box with
    20 ultrasonic transducers in 5 measurement planes. The flow meter can measure
    with an accuracy of + /- 2.5% for velocities greater than 25 mm/s. The water level
    obtained by the ultrasonic level sensor is measured with an accuracy of 0.5 mm
    and a resolution of 0.1 mm. The gates are equipped with adaptive control software
    that allows their operation to be managed through three different setpoint configuration
    levels, i.e. maintaining a fixed (i) gate opening, (ii) upstream water level (U/S)
    or (iii) downstream flow (D/S). Download : Download high-res image (359KB) Download

    Cascina Ca’ Granda Milano. The PikoMeter® gate and the field''s water level sensor,
    known as Ferit®, are depicted in the upper right corner of the image. In addition
    to the PikoMeter®, five ultrasonic water level sensors (Ferit®) were installed
    in each field block (Fig. 2b). The position of the Ferit® in the field was decided
    according to the farmer''s experience, i.e. where its measurement would be representative
    of the water level in the block (L1-L5 in Fig. 1). Each Ferit® continuously monitors
    the water level in the rice field (with a resolution of +/- 1 mm) and sends the
    information to a master control system (FarmConnect® Gateway - Rubicon Water AU).
    The FarmConnect® Gateway can potentially provide a cellular network interface
    between PikoMeter® and Ferit®, but it has not yet been developed to control the
    gate operations. This interface uses the Telstra NextG protocol to routinely upload
    the data [via a Global System for Mobile Connection (GSM)] to a host server for
    remote monitoring and control. Biophysical parameters were continuously measured
    over the agricultural season by a standard agro-meteorological station of the
    Regional Environmental Protection Agency (ARPA), located a few kilometres from
    the rice farm. 3.2. Rice farm modelling framework The main elements of paddy rice
    farm (i.e. fields, canal, gates) were modelled using the Modelica simulation environment
    (Modelica Association, 2021). Modelica is an object-oriented, declarative, multi-domain
    modelling language for component-oriented modelling of complex systems. There
    are two main differences between Modelica and common object-oriented programming
    languages such as C+ + or Java. First, Modelica is a modelling language, not a
    traditional programming language: Modelica classes are not compiled in the conventional
    sense, but are translated into objects which are then exercised by a simulation
    engine. Second, Modelica is essentially based on equations, not assignments, although
    algorithmic components are still allowed, such as algorithms in programming languages
    or blocks in causal simulation environments (e.g. Simulink). In other words, Modelica
    allows an acausal approach to physical modelling: equations have no predefined
    causality and can have expressions on both the right and left sides. The simulation
    engine symbolically manipulates the equations to determine the order in which
    they are solved, as well as to determine the overall inputs and outputs of the
    model. Because of these features, the Modelica language allows a truly modular
    approach to the modelling of complex systems. This improves the readability, modifiability,
    and reusability of plant component models (Mattsson and Elmqvist, 1997), as well
    as the extension of the packages of physical domains by adding models of new components.
    In addition, models can be assembled graphically by dragging, dropping and connecting
    component icons, taking advantage of the graphical capabilities of the adopted
    (open source) interpreter, OpenModelica. The basic modelling components of the
    pilot rice farm were collected in a Modelica library (Field_Package). It contains
    definitions of constants (e.g. atmospheric pressure, gravity acceleration, water
    density etc.), classes (e.g. connectors), and subpackages (e.g. fields, canals,
    gates). Each element included in the Field_Package is described in detail in the
    Supplementary Material, whereas at the link https://github.com/looms-polimi/Field_Package

    Additional information about the symbols can be found in the Supplementary Material.
    Since in the control theory the number of control and controlled variables must
    be equal (Glasser, 1985), only the blocks d (6 ha), ehi (4.9 ha), lm (8.9 ha)
    and fg (13.2 ha) were considered in the modelling experiment. These blocks are
    directly irrigated by the water flows through P1, P3, P4 and by the difference
    of the flow rate derived between the gate P2 and the combination of P3 and P4.
    For simplicity, the blocks d, ehi, lm, and fg will be referred to as Field 1,
    2, 3, and 4, respectively, and the gates P1, 2, 3, and 4 will be referred to as
    gate G1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The core of the rice farm modelling is the
    field water balance. Rainfall, irrigation, evapotranspiration, and percolation
    were considered as dominant water fluxes, while surface drainage was neglected
    because each field has no outflow. The details of the field water balance are
    entirely reported in the Supplementary Material. The water balance was calibrated
    based on ponding water level measurements in the fields under a condition of near
    steady flow into the fields. Specifically, the calibration involved adjusting
    the percolation flux (through a percolation coefficient) so that the simulated
    ponding water level matched the real one. Fig. 4 shows the comparison between
    the measured and modelled ponding water levels within Field 3, the latter obtained
    with different percolation coefficients. We found that the range of percolation
    coefficient between 0.01 and 0.04 allowed a good fit between the observed and
    simulated ponding water levels in all fields. However, in the modelling framework

    level, c – percolation coefficient. 3.3. Control strategy The goal of the control
    system is obviously to regulate the ponding water level within the fields. This
    is done by modulating the opening of the sluice gates (G1–4). The controlled variables
    are therefore the water levels within the fields, while the control variables
    are the opening height of the gates. The main disturbances are essentially the
    rainfall, percolation, evapotranspiration, and the flow rate in the canal. All
    states of the model are measured, including the farm canal levels. Therefore,
    there was no need to implement state estimators. A first simple approach to the
    design of the control system was to consider the binomial field-gate as an independent
    system. This approach can be defined as a decentralized control strategy. The
    interactions that occur mainly through the connection between fields and farm
    canal can be neglected with this approach (i.e. canal water is not considered
    a limiting factor for field water supply). For this strategy, a Proportional-Integral
    (PI) controller was used to control the ponding water level within the fields
    (Ang et al., 2005). However, the decentralized control system based on PI regulators
    suffers from three main drawbacks. First, each control system tries to achieve
    its goal independently of the others, which would be plausible under conditions
    of dynamic decoupling and unlimited water availability, while in reality the water
    availability in input to the farm could be reduced as a results of upstream regulations
    controls or water scarcity. Secondly, the adoption of anti-wind-up algorithms
    makes it possible to manage the return from saturation conditions of the control
    variables, but it is obviously not able to predict or avoid them. Finally, the
    decentralized controllers act on the error, i.e. the consequence of any disturbances,
    only after these disturbances have produced their effect, which does not allow,
    for example, to exploit perturbation forecast systems and thus anticipate the
    control action. To overcome the above drawbacks an advanced centralized control
    strategy was implemented. For this strategy, the Non-linear Model Predictive Control
    (NMPC) was used (Blanco et al., 2010), since it is suitable to deal with nonlinear
    systems with slow dynamics such as represented by the management of rice irrigation
    during flooding period (Ding et al., 2018). NMPC is a control strategy based on
    the sequential, online resolution of multiple open-loop optimal control problems
    defined over a finite, receding time horizon (Bertsekas, 2005). At each time step,
    the resolution of an NMPC problem yields a sequence of optimal control actions
    (i.e., gate openings) over the future horizon, given a predicted trajectory of
    the disturbances over the same horizon. The optimization is generally formulated
    considering a single objective; when the problem involves multiple objectives
    (e.g., water supply, hydropower production, flood control, environmental protection,
    irrigation, transport, etc.), these are generally aggregated using a scalarization
    function (e.g., weighted combination) or via the lexicographic goal programming
    technique in cases where there is a clear hierarchy of priorities across the objectives
    (e.g., Horváth et al., 2022). The online optimization scheme is reiterated forward
    in time over a receding horizon during the operational life of the system. After
    each optimization, only the control action in the current time step of the optimized
    control sequence is actuated, before reiterating the optimization at the next
    time step. Through this reiteration of the model-based optimization, NMPC determines
    the control law implicitly in a closed-loop form, as it computes the optimal control
    action at each time step t based on the observed state of the system. The flexibility
    to directly use any models available for the systems to be controlled is one of
    the main advantages of this approach, especially for the control of highly nonlinear
    systems, while the flexibility to work with (nonlinear) constraints, either explicit
    physical constraints (e.g. limits of actuators) or legal constraints, is another
    advantage of MPC compared to other control methods. The Supplementary Material
    provides the mathematical details of each control strategy applied to the Cascina
    Ca’ Granda pilot case study. 3.4. Simulation experiments The performances of the
    decentralized and centralized controls, based on Proportional Integral (PI) and
    Model Predictive Control (NMPC) strategies, respectively, were evaluated in terms
    of the system''s adaptive capacity to respond to external requirements or disturbances,
    using three different modelling experiments. The objective of the first experiment
    was to verify the correct operation of the two control systems under standard
    flood management conditions. Specifically, the modelling exercise simulates a
    theoretical situation in which the control system works to change the ponding
    water level in the fields from an initial condition to a new reference one (in
    this example from 4 cm to 5 cm). This is a typical operation that could occur
    when the ponding water level needs to be adjusted during an irrigation season.
    The simulation assumes no external disturbances, such as the presence of rainfall
    events, and a constant nominal flow rate at farm inlet of 200 l/s. The second
    experiment examined the response of the control systems to a reduction in the
    flow rate at the input to the farm. In particular, starting from a standard water
    level within the farm canal and rice plots, the effect of reducing the nominal
    flow rate at farm inlet (200 l/s) to 100 l/s on the ability of both control systems
    to maintain a uniform ponding water level within the blocks is investigated. This
    scenario can happen if water becomes scarce during the agricultural season (dry
    season), or if the water supply changes as a result of gates being maneuvered
    on irrigation district channels upstream of the farm. The response of both control
    systems to an external disturbance derived from a rainfall event was evaluated
    in the third experiment. Specifically, the possibility of taking advantage of
    rainfall forecasts and using them to predict the advance status of water levels
    in farm canals and rice blocks was used to evaluate the adaptive capacity of the
    control systems. Specifically, the selected event occurred in the 2021 agricultural
    season on the case study and consisted of a rainfall volume of about 33 mm and
    duration of 10 h, with a peak of 18 mm. In this case the nominal flow rate was
    maintained at 200 l/s in input to the farm. The potential water conservation of
    the PI and NMPC strategies was also investigated. Specifically, using the decentralized
    strategy (i.e., PI control) as a benchmark, the benefits of adopting centralized
    control (i.e., NMPC) in terms of water conservation were estimated as additional
    information on the performance of a coordinated system of gates. 4. Results 4.1.
    Performance of PI and NMPC under standard conditions of flood management The performance
    in time of both control strategies (i.e. PI and NMPC) under standard conditions
    of flood management are presented in Fig. 5. In particular, the comparison between
    the PI and NMPC approaches was evaluated for (i) the ponding water level in the
    fields, (ii) the opening height of the gates and finally (iii) the water level
    in the farm canal. In general, both control strategies respond effectively to
    bring the system to the new ponding water level configuration (i.e., from 4 cm
    to 5 cm). The new ponding level is reached gradually for both control strategies
    in a similar time horizon (about 10 h), depending on real inertias observed in
    the field system. The objective of increasing the water level in the fields led
    to the initial opening of the gates and their subsequent gradual adjustment. In
    both strategies, because the area of each field is different and therefore the
    flow rate needed to raise the ponding water level in each field is different,
    the initial gate opening height was different for each field. The adjustment of
    the gate opening after the initial moment is managed in a different way by the
    control action for each gate, both for PI and for NMPC. This is due to the need
    to have different flow rates in the input to the fields in order to reach the
    new ponding water level. However, since the opening height of the gates is similar
    at the end of the control action, both strategies can be considered coherent.
    Finally, the increase in the flow rate required to reach the new pond level in
    the fields influenced the water level in the farm canal, which at first quickly
    dropped below its initial height (about 1 m) and then returned to a level suitable
    to meet the water needs of the fields, since the inflow to the farm is not limited.
    In this case, the differences between the two control strategies are particularly
    evident. PI causes the water level in the canal to fall by approximately half
    compared to the initial condition, while the fall in the water level is less pronounced
    with NMPC. The return to the initial state of the water level in the canal takes
    twice as long for PI than for NMPC. Download : Download high-res image (169KB)

    and centralized (NMPC) control strategies on (i) Ponding Water Level (PWL) adjustment,
    (ii) gate opening height (i.e. the degree of gate open) and (iii) water level
    in the farm canal (CWL). Scenario 1: standard condition of flood management. The
    effects of both control actions on the ponding water level of the other fields
    and on the other gate opening are presented in Appendix 1. 4.2. Performance of
    PI and NMPC under limited water supply conditions Often the water supply at the
    head of a farm is not constant over time. This can happen when a dry agricultural
    season is expected. Fig. 6 shows for the Field 1 the performance of PI and NMPC
    control actions on ponding water level and gate opening when the nominal inflow
    rate to the farm canal was rapidly reduced from 200 l/s to 100 l/s. The ponding
    water level in the field decreases as a result of the inflow rate reduction. At
    the end of the simulation time, the levels reached are very similar (2 mm of difference).
    The PI control action responds to the falling of ponding water level in the field
    by opening the gate to draw as much water as possible from the farm canal. The
    gate changes its opening height up to the maximum allowed (i.e. 1), since the
    gate operates independently of the others and responds only to the needs of its
    own field. The gate takes about 20 h to saturate. In the other fields and gates,
    similar behaviour was observed. The general effect of this action is to remove
    almost all the water from the canal, which is reduced to a water level of a few
    centimetres. It follows that, the new inflow rate (i.e. 100 l/sec) is not sufficient
    to maintain the reference water level inside the fields (i.e. 5 cm). As a result,
    at the end of the control action, the ponding water level was lower than the reference
    threshold. Download : Download high-res image (168KB) Download : Download full-size

    strategies on (i) Ponding Water Level (PWL) adjustment, (ii) gate opening height
    and (iii) water level in the farm canal (CWL). Scenario 2: limited water supply.
    The ponding water level inside Field 1 (and thus for the other fields as well)
    was also lower than the reference threshold at the end of the NMPC control action.
    However, the NMPC uses a completely different strategy to reach this new configuration.
    The gate does not only look at the state of its own field, but also at the state
    of the other gates and at the farm canal. This integrated approach ensures that
    the gate does not saturate when it opens (i.e. it never reaches the maximum opening
    height) and the water level in the farm canal is not drastically depleted (as
    properly shown in Fig. 6). Furthermore, the gate opening equilibrium was achieved
    in about half time with respect to the PI control. The effects of both control
    actions on the ponding water level of the other fields and on the other gate opening
    are presented in Appendix 2. A positive feature of the NMPC strategy is that it
    allows for compensation of flood conditions among fields even when ponding water
    levels cannot be maintained at the target level for the reduced inflow rate in
    input to the farm. This is clearly shown in Fig. 7, which compares the effects
    of PI and NMPC approach on the ponding water level within the fields. A decentralized
    control action approach results in different ponding water levels within the fields,
    while a centralized control action approach makes the ponding water level between
    the fields uniform (although lower than the target water level). Download : Download

    between decentralized (PI) and centralized (NMPC) control strategies on (i) Ponding
    Water Level (PWL) adjustment with respect to the target (PWL target), and (ii)
    gate opening height of all fields (Field 1–4)and gates (Gate 1–4). Scenario 2:
    limited water supply. It is interesting that a uniform PI controller response
    corresponds to a varying ponding water level between the fields. In fact, every
    gate responding to a field''s request for water opens and gets saturated (Fig.
    7). Conversely, a tailored control action by the NMPC system for each gate results
    in a uniform ponding water level between the fields. In this case, the opening
    height of each gate is related to the water demand of the field, which in this
    case study strictly depends by the field area. In fact, the opening height of
    gate 4 (which serves Field 4 - of about 13 ha in size) at the end of the control
    action is about three times greater than the opening height of gate 2 (which serves
    Field 2 - of about 4 ha in size) and two times greater than the opening height
    of gate 3 (which serves Field 3 - of about 6 ha in size). In the NMPC strategy,
    the gates are not saturated (i.e., the gates do not reach their maximum opening
    height), but are opened only to the extent necessary to meet the predictive water
    request. 4.3. Performance of the PI and NMPC in the presence of an instantaneous
    water supply The effect on ponding water level and gate operations of the decentralized
    (i.e. PI) and centralized (i.e. NMPC) strategies stressed by an instantaneous
    water supply disturbance to the farm generated by a rainfall event is presented
    in Fig. 8 for the Field 1 and Gate 1. The PI approach works only when the precipitation
    starts. In particular, when rainfall begins, the gate begins to close until the
    opening height is equal to zero (i.e. gate completely closed) when rainfall has
    reached the peak. The ponding water level in the field increased up to 7 cm (i.e.
    2 cm above the reference target), with a peak around the moment of maximum rainfall
    intensity. At the end of rainfall event the ponding water level within the field
    return to the target value. The same behaviour was observed in the other fields
    and gates as reported Appendix 3. The PI strategy reproduces the behaviour of
    a farmer and the effect it has on the water level in the fields when it rains.
    In fact, the farmer operates on the gates only when he sees that the water level
    in the fields is changing. This difficulty in adapting the system before the rain
    starts leads to a significant perturbation in the ponding water level inside the
    fields, as a consequence of the inertia that a real system composed of large fields
    has in recovering the initial configuration after a disturbance. On the contrary,
    the NMPC approach tries to prevent the additional volume of water supplied to
    the fields before the rainfall event, modifying the state of the system so that
    it can absorb the disturbance without excessive change in the ponding water level.
    Specifically, the forecasting model that constitutes the NMPC works by closing
    the gates in anticipation of the onset of rain (about 5 h on average before the
    rain, but the beginning of the gate closing action can vary between fields). The
    ponding water level drops a few centimetres below the target and then rises when
    it rains. However, the increase of ponding water level is less than about 20%
    of that obtained with the PI, highlighting the great capacity of the NMPC to maintain
    the target ponding water level even under instantaneous disturbances. Download

    of rainfall event. By integrating the water flows entering each field over time
    of rainfall event, the potential water conservation operated by NMPC with respect
    to the PI action has been calculated. Specifically, the NMPC results in 11% on
    average of water conservation with respect to PI strategy. This conservation is
    due to the anticipation of closing the gates in preparation for the rain event.
    The NMPC control action was further stressed by assuming an hour advance or delay
    in the rainfall event. This simulation was used to investigate the response of
    the NMPC strategy when potential errors in the weather forecasts occur. The results
    of these two additional simulations are presented in Fig. 11, where the effects
    of NMPC strategy on ponding water levels and gate opening heights are shown for
    all fields and gates. The advance of the rainfall event has no significant effect
    on the control action, except for the anticipation of the closure of the gates.
    Conversely, the delay of the rainfall event leads to a temporary opening of the
    gates due to the fact that in the window of the prediction horizon (i.e. 15 h
    - see Supplementary Material) the forecast of the rainfall evolution pattern was
    not fully included. In fact, the model is not able to predict what will happen
    after the prediction horizon, so since the ponding water level decreased excessively,
    the control action ordered the opening of gates. However, when the rainfall increase
    was detected, the controller sent a signal to close the gates again. Download

    challenges for the future of sustainable rice irrigation is to cope with climate
    change and adapt to fluctuations in freshwater availability. Without improvements
    in irrigation management (data-driven modelling and management of irrigation interventions,
    flexible and predictive gate operation, real-time flow control, etc.), traditional
    rice irrigation practices of flood irrigation may be abandoned in favour of other
    less water-intensive irrigation techniques (Lampayan et al., 2015). Although the
    modelling framework presented in this paper offers the possibility to safeguard
    the traditional method of rice irrigation (i.e. flood irrigation), in practice,
    the transition to a new irrigation technique does not affect the ability to use
    the automatic technologies and control approaches presented in this paper. The
    ability to well regulate the ponding water level within rice fields during the
    season has potential water saving and environmental benefits. In the case of the
    rice water balance (see Supplementary Material), it shows a proportional relationship
    between ponding water level and percolation flux (Toung et al., 1994). This relationship
    illustrates how a good control of the ponding water level within the fields can
    provide direct control of hydrological losses at field/farm scale by minimising
    the latter. This could be seen as an important achievement of the coordinated
    control approach, as hydrological losses are beyond the control of the farmer.
    Finally, previous studies have shown that continuous submergence and good control
    of ponding water levels during the rice growing season are more effective in controlling
    weeds, reducing herbicide use and improving the environmental sustainability of
    flooding practices. (Aravinth et al., 2023). Therefore, the NMPC could enable
    this weed control at farm level more efficiently than the PI approach, as shown
    in scenario 2, where the centralised control of the gates attempts to equalise
    the ponding water level within the fields. Given these examples, the introduction
    of automatic control into current flooding management practice could increase
    the sustainability of traditional rice irrigation. This would require the installation
    of a new hydraulic infrastructure (automatic gates) to replace the manual one,
    capable of accepting control software. The costs of this modernisation are relevant
    but sustainable, as already shown by Masseroni et al. (2018), and will become
    even more so as the cost of water increases. Concerning the modelling framework
    presented in this work, it has some simplifications, which can be more detailed
    if the Modelica library would really be included in the gate control software
    of the pilot farm. One of them is the choice of a single percolation coefficient
    for the fields. In our results, the differences in the control effect between
    the fields are exclusively due to the different field size, while specific characteristic
    of each field could be included in the water balance model equations. In this
    respect, it must be pointed out that the OpenModelica generated Functional Mock-up
    Unit (FMU) can already be used to calibrate uncertain model parameters (i.e. percolation
    coefficients), through Python optimization routines, thus paving the way to adaptive
    NMPC, while the use of the aforementioned FMU for the solution of the optimal
    control problem, also based on (open source) Python functions, is currently being
    studied. Additionally, predictions are the key feature for an intelligent control
    action achieved by NMPC strategy. In our modelling experiments, only rainfall
    forecasts are included in the NMPC, while better control performance could be
    obtained if temperature forecasts (which affect crop development) were included
    in the centralized control strategy. For this purpose, the correct choice of the
    prediction horizon can help to avoid unexpected opening and closing of the gates
    during their operation, increasing water conservation. Long-term forecasts of
    biophysical variables could also be included in the model. However, this could
    increase both the uncertainty in the reliability and robustness of the control
    action and the computational time. Therefore, it would be optimal to combine the
    control action with the farmer''s experience. The latter could, for example, help
    decide which fields should maintain the target ponding water level in case of
    water shortage, instead of having a uniform ponding water level between fields
    but below the threshold. Lastly, the ponding water level target could be variable
    during the agricultural season, following the flooding best practices for the
    specific rice cultivar or crop phenological stages, or to practice alternate wetting
    drying flood management (Rejesus et al., 2011, Mayer et al., 2019, Gilardi et
    al., 2023). 6. Conclusion This paper presents an advanced control technique for
    precision flood irrigation in paddy rice farms. The proposed technique has been
    tested on a real case study through a series of simulation experiments in the
    Modelica environment and is based on a nonlinear model predictive control strategy.
    This strategy has been compared with that obtained by a proportional-integral
    control action, which roughly reproduces the traditional farmer gate operations.
    Simulation reveals that the nonlinear model predictive control strategy can accurately
    control ponding water level within the fields both under standard conditions of
    flood management and under limited or instantaneous water supplies to the farm.
    Furthermore, its application to a real rainfall event showed that nonlinear model
    predictive control has the potential to significantly reduce water consumption
    compared to proportional-integral control. Therefore, the nonlinear model predictive
    control strategy appears to be a viable solution for improving the performance
    of flood irrigation in paddy rice farms, although some slight improvements in
    the modelling algorithm should still be made before implementing this technique
    in a real system of sluice gates. Implementing the nonlinear model predictive
    control strategy in the gate management software and testing its operation under
    different agricultural seasons will be the next step. Declaration of Competing

  key_findings: The nonlinear model predictive control strategy was able to accurately
    control ponding water level within the fields under standard conditions of flood
    management, limited or instantaneous water supplies to the farm, and in the face
    of rainfall events. Furthermore, its application showed the potential to significantly
    reduce water consumption compared to proportional-integral control.
  limitations: The study used simulations to test the efficacy of the nonlinear model
    predictive control strategy. While a real farm was used to develop the model,
    the control strategy was not tested in the field. Additionally, the study did
    not consider the potential for gate failures or other operational issues that
    could affect the performance of the control system.
  main_objective: To assess the performance of a nonlinear model predictive control
    strategy for precision flood irrigation in paddy rice farms.

  relevance_evaluation: The paper is relevant to the outline point because it presents
    a nonlinear model predictive control strategy for precisely controlling ponding
    water level within rice fields, including consideration of instantaneous water
    supply disturbances from rainfall events and the potential for water conservation
    compared to proportional-integral control.

  explanation: The study by Evans et al. (2011) evaluates an integrated decision support
    system for site-specific sprinkler irrigation management to optimize water-use.
    The system combines a distributed wireless sensor network (WSN) with a computer
    base station to monitor field conditions and adjust irrigation schedules based
    on real-time data. The authors emphasize the importance of integrating machine
    learning algorithms, such as reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms, to
    optimize closed-loop control strategies over time. This approach enables the system
    to adapt to changing environmental conditions and crop requirements, leading to
    more efficient and sustainable irrigation practices.

    G. Evans, W. M. Iversen, Y. Kim Keywords:   Decision support, Water management,
    Automation, Adaptive control systems, Irrigation controls, Sprinkler irrigation,
    Wireless networks, Sensors The development of site-specific water management systems
    for sprinkler irrigation will be a major factor in future efforts to improve the
    various efficiencies of water-use and to support a sustainable irrigated environment.
    The challenge is to develop fully integrated management systems with supporting
    elements that accurately and inexpensively sense within-field variability and
    then optimally control variable-rate water application systems in ways that account
    for the spatial variability affecting water use. Recent advances in sensor and
    wireless radio frequency (RF) technologies have enabled the development of distributed
    in-field sensor-based irrigation systems to support site-specific irrigation management.
    Thus, integration of a decision-making process with a distributed wireless sensor
    network (WSN) and providing real-time input to site-specific controls is a viable
    option. This presentation reviews research on the implementation of in-field micrometeorological
    information that was fed from a distributed wireless sensor network (WSN) and
    displayed on a geo-referenced field map in a computer base station. Low-cost Bluetooth
    wireless RF communications from both a distributed WSN and the machine controls
    monitoring of sprinkler status and global positioning system (GPS) location were
    interfaced with a computer base station for processing by a decision support program,
    which updated the instructions to the variable rate irrigation controller for
    real-time site-specific control. The decision support was optimized to adapt changes
    of crop type, irrigation pattern, and field location for instructions for individual
    sprinkler heads on how much water to apply and where. A graphical user interface
    (GUI) with a simple click-and-play menu was used, which allowed growers to remotely
    access field conditions and irrigation status at the home or office via wireless
    RF communications. (Download PDF)    (Export to EndNotes) 14 Share Facebook X

    occurs as a result of spatial and temporal variations in soil structure and fertility;
    soil physical, chemical and hydraulic properties; irrigation applications; pests
    and diseases; plant genetics; and local microclimate. This review paper argues
    that infield variability can be managed and the efficiency of irrigation water
    use increased by spatially variable application of irrigation water to meet the
    specific needs of individual management zones (areas of crop whose properties
    are relatively homogenous). Key areas identified requiring interdisciplinary research
    are the prescription of irrigated crop water requirements, strategies for quantifying
    and managing spatial variability, and the development of adaptive systems for
    control of water application at appropriate temporal intervals and spatial scales.
    Example strategies for the implementation of adaptive control for furrow irrigation
    and large mobile irrigation machines are described. Key Words: Real-time controlprecision

    Get rights and content Highlights • Two site-specific sensor-based irrigation
    strategies were simulated in VARIwise. • Iterative Learning Control (ILC) produced
    highest yield with soil–water data input. • Iterative Hill Climbing Control (IHCC)
    performed best with soil-and-plant data input. • Both sensor-based strategies
    were superior to the industry-standard strategy. Abstract Feedback control systems
    offer opportunities to accommodate spatial and temporal differences in crop water
    requirement and to improve the automated irrigation of field crops via real-time
    data from in-field plant, soil–water and evaporation sensing. This paper describes
    two sensor-based strategies applied to irrigation control, ‘Iterative Learning
    Control’ (ILC) and custom-designed ‘Iterative Hill Climbing Control’ (IHCC), implemented
    in the control simulation and evaluation framework ‘VARIwise’. Simulation of an
    irrigated cotton crop using soils and merged 1999–2004 weather data of SE Queensland,
    Australia, and represented by the performance of the well-validated cotton growth
    and production model OZCOT, permitted the relative performance of differing sensor
    data types and availability to be evaluated (both as alternatives and in combination)
    in meeting the requirement to optimise either crop yield or water use efficiency.
    These simulations indicated that ILC would perform better at maintaining soil–water
    deficit, whilst IHCC would be better at maximising crop yield when plant and soil
    sensors were utilised in combination. This work demonstrates that the optimal
    choice of field sensor(s) and control strategy will be a function of the irrigation
    objective and the spatial and temporal availability and type of field measurements.

    pivotLateral moveSchedulingAutomationOZCOT 1. Introduction Irrigation application
    and crop water use efficiencies can be improved by scheduling the irrigation of
    crops using physical and agronomic principles (Evans, 2006). The irrigation management
    strategy determined using these principles may be automatically implemented using
    a control system. Irrigation control strategies can use historical or real-time
    quantitative measurements of the crop, weather and soil, either singly or in combination,
    to automatically adjust the irrigation application. Irrigation is traditionally
    applied uniformly over an entire field, although not all plants in the field may
    require the same amount of water at any given time. In these cases, differential
    irrigation application to meet the plant requirements at different positions in
    the field may improve operational performance. However, as the plant response
    and environmental conditions fluctuate throughout the season, control strategies
    which accommodate temporal and spatial variability in the field and which locally
    modify the control actions (irrigation amounts) need to be ‘adaptive’ (Smith et
    al., 2009, McCarthy et al., 2010). Site-specific irrigation is enabled for centre
    pivot and lateral move irrigation machines through commercially available variable-rate
    hardware (e.g. Design Feats, Zimmatic, Valley). These systems adjust the irrigation
    application within the field by varying the speed of the machine and/or pulsing
    solenoid valves on each dropper. According to the choice of water outlet- sprinkler
    head or Low-Energy Precision Application (LEPA) sock – differential application
    may be achieved at the <1 m2 scale. The performance of an irrigation control system
    will be limited by: (i) the attributes that are measured in the field; (ii) the
    spatial resolution of the sensor data for both static sensors (e.g. soil–water
    probes) and on-the-go sensors (e.g. infrared thermometers measuring foliage temperature);
    and (iii) the temporal resolution of these data inputs. However the performance
    delivered by the control system may also be affected by unexpected environmental
    conditions (e.g. mid-irrigation and spatially-varied rainfall) or exceptional
    operational changes (e.g. crop damage or a capacity constraint of the irrigation
    machine such that it cannot deliver the optimal irrigation volumes in time). It
    may be expected that adaptive irrigation control systems have differing robustness
    to these operating conditions, data availability and system constraints (Warwick,
    1993). In principle at least, adaptive control systems automatically and continuously
    re-adjust the controller to obtain the desired performance of the system (Warwick,
    1993). Their application to irrigation can potentially improve crop development
    and/or water use efficiency. In addition, adaptive control strategies may be used
    to accommodate the differing levels of data quality and availability normally
    found in irrigation practice, i.e. utilise the various combinations of weather,
    soil and plant data available (McCarthy et al., 2011). Potentially optimal adaptive
    control strategies that determine irrigation volume and timing may be identified
    by simulating alternate adaptive control strategies in a simulation framework.
    1.1. Adaptive control strategies Existing strategies developed typically utilise
    one of several approaches, namely: (i) mathematical programming on models of crop
    yield or soil–plant–atmosphere to implement objective functions and optimise water
    allocation or profit (e.g. Azamathulla et al., 2009, Ghahraman and Sepaskhah,
    1997, Rao et al., 1988); (ii) linear quadratic control, which utilises optimal
    control theory with objective functions to determine irrigation application timing
    that aims to achieve a final state (e.g. Protopapas and Georgakakos, 1990, Lewis
    and Syrmos, 1995); (iii) artificial intelligence which has lower computational
    requirements than optimal control or mathematical programming and often uses a
    subsurface flow model to calculate wetting profiles and train a neural network
    to provide irrigation parameters that achieve the desired soil moisture profile
    (e.g. Schmitz et al., 2002, Schmitz et al., 2007, de Paly et al., 2010); (iv)
    model predictive control which iteratively executes a model to optimise process
    inputs rather than numerically operates on the model which has been used to regulate
    soil moisture (e.g. DeJonge et al., 2007, Park et al., 2009); or (v) learning
    control that uses sensor feedback rather than a model to perform system identification
    that has been used to determine site-specific flow rate adjustments required to
    control water or concentration of nutrients in the soil (e.g. Moore and Chen,
    2006). 1.2. Application of adaptive control to irrigation Adaptive control strategies
    applicable to irrigation may be either: (i) ‘sensor-based’, for which the (simulated)
    irrigation application is directly adjusted according to the measurement response
    (e.g. learning control); or (ii) ‘model-based’, which use a calibrated soil and
    plant model for irrigation management (e.g. mathematical programming, model predictive
    control). These strategies differ fundamentally in their data requirements and
    their use of the crop model. The focus of this paper is the relative performance
    of two candidate sensor-based irrigation control strategies. A companion paper,
    McCarthy et al. (2014), reports the implementation and performance of model-based
    strategies. By definition, sensor-based strategies can be implemented with a range
    of input variables chosen to provide feedback for control, and the efficacy of
    each is likely to be crop-dependent. Hence, as an example, the specific objective
    of this paper is to determine the potential efficacy of ‘sensor-based’ adaptive
    control for the practical irrigation of cotton. This paper reports a simulation
    study to determine the appropriate input variable/s for two sensor-based control
    strategies and comments on the relative utility of each input combination. 2.
    The control simulation framework ‘VARIwise’ A simulation framework ‘VARIwise’
    was created to develop, simulate, evaluate and also implement (as a machine controller)
    uniform and site-specific irrigation control strategies for centre pivot and lateral
    move irrigation machines. Full details are presented in McCarthy et al. (2010):

    Fig. 1. The simulation framework VARIwise configured to evaluate (in simulation
    mode) the sensor-based adaptive control strategies. The items shown in grey/hatched
    are not implemented but would be present in a field evaluation.) This diagram
    is adapted from the full VARIwise flowchart presented as Fig. 2 of McCarthy et
    al. (2010). Within VARIwise, the field is divided into cells of minimum area 1
    m2 to accommodate spatial variability. The software allows for: • the inclusion
    of field-scale variations in input parameters (e.g. crop response, crop age, target
    yield and management constraints); • the input of data at a range of temporal
    scales; • the ability to apply the various levels of control strategies for variable-rate
    irrigation at different spatial scales; and • requires a crop model integrated
    within VARIwise. In the simulation mode this model provides feedback data which
    permits evaluation of any control strategy implemented. The well-established cotton
    growth model OZCOT (Wells and Hearn, 1992) has been utilised by VARIwise for the
    present study. The OZCOT model combines a temperature-driven model of fruit dynamics
    with a soil–water balance model, and original sub-models for: fruiting, leaf area
    generating, boll growth and elementary nitrogen (Wells and Hearn, 1992). The model
    was developed and validated for different soil types from agronomic experiments
    over a period of 30 years covering a range of Australian cotton growing regions
    (Hearn, 1994). OZCOT’s capacity to simulate yield, fruiting dynamics, nitrogen
    uptake and water use has been validated in the Ord Valley, Western Australia,
    for summer grown cotton during the 1960s and 1970s (Hearn, 1994). The model responds
    to different climatic situations, crop physiological characteristics, agronomic
    variables and management decisions, but does not account for the effects of insect
    pests, diseases, weeds and soil nutrient limitations other than nitrogen. The
    model does not simulate the effects of climate and management on fibre quality.
    The OZCOT model requires the parameters listed in Table 1 to be written into input
    files. After the OZCOT model has been executed, an output file is produced that
    contains estimates of the soil–water, fruit load and vegetation indices for each
    day of the predicted cotton season. Table 1. Agronomic factors used in cotton

    control strategies Following a review of candidate adaptive control strategies
    (McCarthy et al., 2013), the two sensor-based adaptive control strategies implemented
    in VARIwise are ‘Iterative Learning Control’ (ILC) and ‘Iterative Hill Climbing
    Control’ (IHCC). The two strategies are described below, and their implementation
    set out in the section following. In summary, these strategies refine the estimate
    of each successive irrigation volume applied by: [ILC] – iteratively adjusting
    the irrigation volume applied in each cell of the field using the incremental
    response, i.e. the OZCOT-determined plant growth arising from the change in particular
    field sensor information which has resulted from the previous water application,
    in each cell; or [IHCC] – similarly adjusting the irrigation volumes, but based
    on multiple sensor increment information, using a range of irrigation volumes
    applied within a group of homogenous cells. 3.1. Iterative Learning Control Iterative
    Learning Control (ILC) can be used to control repetitive processes, e.g. robot
    arm manipulators, repetitive rotary systems, and factory batch processes, where
    the process model is imperfectly known (Ahn et al., 2007). An irrigation system
    may be interpreted as a repetitive process because the irrigation machine iteratively
    passes over the field throughout the crop season; and, given the complexity of
    variable plant growth, is certainly imperfectly described from the control perspective.
    Hence, in principle, classical ILC can be used to improve the system performance
    by eliminating the effects of any unknown but repeating disturbance (Korovessi
    and Linninger, 2006). Applied to irrigation, an unknown feature of the crop response
    model that reoccurs as a consequence of irrigation may be regarded as a ‘repeating
    disturbance’. ILC requires that the process controlled by the strategy is reset
    to the same initial conditions after each iteration (Korovessi and Linninger,
    2006). Again, applied to irrigation, each iteration of ILC is an irrigation event,
    and the conditions may be approximately reset by scheduling the irrigations after
    a set amount of crop water use. Moore and Chen (2006) demonstrated an ILC strategy
    for a centre pivot irrigation machine to determine site-specific irrigation application
    volumes using soil–water as the feedback variable. The strategy was evaluated
    in simulations using a soil model with one dimensional flow. This soil model assumed
    constant crop water use irrespective of the crop stage, crop conditions and the
    daily and sub-daily weather dynamics. Hence, the model was reset to the same initial
    conditions after a fixed time delay and irrigation events were scheduled at regular
    time intervals. 3.2. Iterative Hill Climbing Control A drawback of the ILC strategy
    is the potentially inefficient system identification, and particularly so when
    applied to irrigation which has a ‘learning increment’ of typically several days.
    This is a result of only one irrigation volume being evaluated in each cell during
    each irrigation event. As an alternative, adaptive spatially-varied identification
    may be more rapidly achieved by utilising site-specific combinations of plant,
    soil and weather data in different sub-areas of the field, i.e. using aggregates
    of cells having similar properties. Likewise, adaptive system identification may
    be incorporated into an irrigation control system to account for the slow speed
    of crop dynamics and the low frequency of irrigation events. To meet these requirements
    and circumvent these limitations, an alternative, multi-dimensional approach was
    developed, as follows. The technique is designated ‘Iterative Hill Climbing Control’
    (IHCC), in which ‘hill climbing’ involves changing the state of the system into
    one that is closer to the goal in the direction of steepest gradient (Russell
    and Norvig, 1995). IHCC provides faster optimisation than ILC alone because it
    permits the evaluation of both: • a range of inputs to the system at each irrigation
    event (i.e. multi-dimensional ILC); and • a range of irrigation volumes on different
    ‘test cells’ in the field (within the particular group of cells) at each irrigation
    event. The responses of the test cells are compared to determine which irrigation
    volume resulted in the response closest to the desired response. This enables
    the control system to identify appropriate input options within a single irrigation
    event without using a process model. 4. Implementation of sensor-based control
    strategies in VARIwise The ILC and IHCC strategies were implemented in VARIwise
    to calculate the optimal irrigation application volumes for each cell. For the
    ILC strategy, the irrigation volumes are determined from previous irrigation applications
    and measured responses. For the IHCC strategy, the volumes to apply are determined
    by evaluating the response to a range of irrigation volumes previously applied
    to test cells within representative homogenous areas of the field. Homogenous
    areas within fields are referred to as a management ‘zone’ in this paper and zone
    boundaries may be determined using soil properties, crop or variety differences,
    topography or management constraints. The implementation of the control strategies
    within VARIwise involves six steps described in the following sections. Of necessity,
    the procedures differ for the ILC and IHCC strategies. In particular, the procedure
    for the calculation of irrigation volumes is fundamentally different (Sections
    4.6 and 4.7, respectively). 4.1. Select control areas The ILC and IHCC strategies
    require different spatial resolutions for irrigation application. ILC can be used
    to determine irrigation applications to each individual cell; however, for IHCC
    the field must be divided into a number of zones. The identification of zones
    for the IHCC strategy can be undertaken automatically by VARIwise using a measured
    field property (e.g. soil property). In this case, the property data assigned
    to each cell in the field is sorted in ascending order and then grouped into the
    user-specified number of evenly-sized zones. A small number of cells (i.e. a group
    of ‘test cells’) are then selected in each zone to evaluate different irrigation
    applications. The application of the various irrigation volumes to the test cells
    results in differential soil–water and crop responses. Hence, test cell responses
    are only indicative of the response in each zone for one irrigation event and
    the IHCC strategy requires the selection of new test cells in each zone for each
    irrigation. In VARIwise, this is achieved by a simple increment of the test cell
    number along with a requirement that the replacement cell still lies within the
    same zone and has not previously been used as a test cell. 4.2. Determine day
    of first irrigation The number of days until the first irrigation in each cell
    or zone is calculated by dividing the plant available water capacity (PAWC) of
    the soil by the daily crop water use or daily crop evapotranspiration (ETc). This
    procedure is described in McCarthy et al. (2010). 4.3. Calculate first irrigation
    volume For ILC and IHCC non-test cells, the first irrigation application volume
    is calculated by aggregating the daily ETc since the crop was sown. The daily
    ETc is calculated as evapotranspiration obtained from the weather data, i.e. via
    reference (potential) evapotranspiration ETo, and the appropriate crop coefficient,
    Kc, as published for each crop and growth stage, following the standard methodology
    of FAO 56, Allen et al. (1998). For IHCC test cells, the irrigation volume applied
    to each test cell is similarly determined using the ETo since the crop was sown,
    but with a range of crop coefficients imposed. These crop coefficients are offset
    from the zone crop coefficient (which is the crop coefficient used to calculate
    the irrigation volumes applied to the non-test cells). The crop coefficient offsets
    used are specified by the user as a percentage of the zone crop coefficient; for
    example, using a zone crop coefficient of Kc = 0.35, five test cells and an offset
    of 40%, the crop coefficients would be 0.07, 0.21, 0.35, 0.49 and 0.63 for each
    test cell, respectively (i.e. multiples of 40% on either side of the median crop
    coefficient, 0.35). 4.4. Check data availability In the simulation environment
    the model output data are obtained for the cells and days specified by the user.
    This enables the performance of the control strategy to be evaluated with input
    data at different spatial and temporal resolutions. In a field implementation,
    the currently-available datasets are kriged (i.e. spatially interpolated) across
    the field to ascribe a value to each cell in the field. This is because sensor
    data may be unavailable due to sensor failures or the installation of sensors
    being impractical (large numbers of infield sensors are often obstructive to growers).
    4.5. Determine day of next irrigation The irrigation events are scheduled when
    the crop has reached a user-specified cumulative crop water use since the previous
    irrigation event. The method of calculating the crop water use depends on the
    datasets available, thus: • If soil data input is used in the control strategy
    and update data are available, the crop water use is determined using the change
    in soil–water since the previous irrigation. • If soil and weather data inputs
    are used in the control strategy but update soil data are not available and update
    weather data are available, the cumulative crop water use is determined as the
    sum of the daily crop evapotranspiration (calculated using the weather data).
    • If soil data input is used but update data are not available, plus weather data
    are not available or not used, then the cumulative crop water use is calculated
    using historically averaged weather data. Since the crop water use may not be
    uniform across the field due to spatial variability, the irrigations are initiated
    when an arbitrary proportional of the cells in the field have reached the user-specified
    cumulative crop water use (e.g. 15%). 4.6. Calculate irrigation volumes – ILC
    For ILC the irrigation volume applied to each cell in the field is calculated
    using a common ILC algorithm (Ahn et al., 2007) which calculates the required
    system input (the irrigation volume to be applied) uk+1 at the forthcoming iteration,
    i.e. the (k + 1)th irrigation, according to: (1) where uk is the system input
    (irrigation volume) on the previous iteration (kth irrigation); γ the learning
    gain (a scalar factor); yk(Δ) the measured system output (i.e. sensor data value,
    kriged as necessary) after delay Δ; and yd(Δ) the desired system output (i.e.
    desired sensor data value) after delay Δ The delay in measurement after each irrigation
    Δ permits the crop to respond to that irrigation (typically one day for the sensing
    of soil–water change; longer for the sensing of a plant growth variable). In all
    cases the response delay Δ must be less than the interval between irrigations.
    The learning gain γ is chosen by iteration as a compromise between slow learning
    (low γ) and instability in the predicted uk+1 values (high γ). For each irrigation
    event and cell, the ILC algorithm of Eq. (1) calculates the volume to apply at
    the next irrigation event using measured field data and the desired value based
    on a single measured variable y. However, because more than one soil or plant
    measured variable may be applicable, an expanded ILC algorithm was implemented
    to accommodate for multiple variables. In this case, optimisation may be achieved
    by either one, or a combination, of the following (Liu et al., 2001): i. assigning
    a weighting to each optimisation objective (variable yi) and constructing a weighted
    sum of all the objectives, and/or ii. optimising each objective separately to
    explore trade-offs. where the separate optimisation objectives are driven by difference
    between the measured and desired variable values, yi,k and yi,d respectively.
    The multi-objective optimisation option (i) requires subjective selection of the
    weights for each objective; however the separate-objective option (ii) requires
    an additional decision-making procedure to determine which objective optimisation
    results in the desired performance for both objectives. The present VARIwise implementation
    for sensor-based irrigation optimisation aims to evaluate the effect of using
    multiple data inputs and the multi-objective optimisation option (i) was presumed
    sufficient with each objective equally weighed. Hence, the multi-objective ILC
    algorithm is: (2) where n variables are used in the control strategy and wi is
    the weighting of the ith variable for the control strategy (and all weightings
    sum to unity). 4.7. Calculate irrigation volumes – IHCC A performance index (PI)
    is calculated for each test cell in each zone. In VARIwise, the data used to determine
    the PI is specified by the user, and the type of data used to determine the PI
    affects how the PI is calculated. To optimise an output parameter, the PI can
    be calculated as the ratio of the current boll or square count to the maximum
    count of the test cells using: (3) For data that correspond to an optimal time
    series data set, the performance index is: (4) where t represents the day of the
    data collection. Multiple data variables may be incorporated into the PI by applying
    weights (ki) to the performance index of each data type (PIi) and summing the
    weighted indices (where there are n data inputs). Hence, the general form for
    the PI calculation with multiple data variables and weights is: (5) The PI for
    each test cell can then be evaluated to determine the crop coefficient and corresponding
    irrigation application for the ‘non-test’ cells in the subsequent irrigation event.
    This is achieved by identifying the crop coefficient that corresponds to the maximum
    PI and would be obtained by finding the maximum point of a quadratic equation
    fitted through points plotted on a PI versus crop coefficient graph. If the maximum
    point of the quadratic lies outside the range of feasible crop coefficient values,
    then the crop coefficient for the test cell with the highest PI is selected as
    the optimal crop coefficient. If all the test cells have the same PI then the
    crop coefficient is estimated from Table 12 of Allen et al. (1998). After the
    crop has consumed a user-defined cumulative crop water use, the non-test cells
    are then irrigated with an amount calculated using the aggregated ETo and the
    optimal crop coefficient. The volumes applied to the new test cells are calculated
    using the user-defined offset percentage applied to the optimal crop coefficient
    identified for the previous irrigation. 4.8. Practical considerations For centre
    pivot and lateral move machines, the machine capacity and application volumes
    affect the time taken to traverse the field, and hence the timing of irrigation
    applications to each cell. To minimise the impact of travel time, the irrigation
    application to individual cells is limited to an arbitrary maximum volume (e.g.
    25 mm) and the amount of water applied to individual cells is adjusted by the
    travel time and the daily crop water use. 5. Case study – Evaluation of sensor-based
    control strategies with cotton This section reports a case study using VARIwise
    to compare the performance of the ILC and IHCC strategies when different field
    sensor data (e.g. soil, plant and weather) were available, both singly or in combination.
    These strategies were also compared with the yield and water use performance produced
    for the equivalent crop irrigated according to an industry-standard irrigation
    management strategy. These strategies and sensor data input combinations were
    evaluated for both homogeneous and spatially variable fields. 5.1. Simulated crop,
    growing conditions and crop model The case study involved simulations of a whole
    season cotton crop grown on the Darling Downs, Australia with parameters as outlined
    in Table 1. The sowing data, soil properties and weather pattern was characteristic
    of cotton growing regions in Australia. The soil and plant parameters of the cotton
    model OZCOT were kept within the boundary values defined by Wells and Hearn (1992).
    The irrigation control strategies were initially assessed on homogeneous fields
    using different combinations of data input. This would enable separation of the
    impacts of the spatial and temporal variations. In these simulations, fields with
    uniform plant available water capacity of 60 mm, 150 mm and 200 mm were implemented
    for sand, clay loam and clay fields, respectively. Spatial variability in soil
    parameters was then introduced in each cell and the zones applied to the ILC and
    IHCC strategies are shown in Fig. 2. In the simulated field, the plant available
    water capacity (PAWC) ranges from 60 to 200 mm. This was selected to ensure the
    control strategies could deal with the different soil types that often exist within
    fields. The spatial variability in PAWC across irrigated broadacre fields in Australia
    can be 30–500% (Wong et al., 2006, Rab et al., 2009) because of differences in
    soil texture and root distribution. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2.
    Soil variability for: (a) industry-standard, ILC and IHCC strategy simulation;
    and (b) the cells assigned to each zone using the soil variability data of 2(a).
    Averaged weather input was used when sensed weather data was not an input. This
    provided the model with the minimum set of weather information that could be generated
    which would enable the model to operate. The averaged weather dataset was generated
    using SILO (QNRM, 2009) climate datasets for the cropping period in the previous
    five years and calculating the daily average maximum and minimum temperature,
    solar radiation and rainfall such that each day in the season had the same weather
    conditions. A daily weather profile was obtained for the GPS location −28.18°N,
    151.26°E from an Australian Bureau of Meteorology SILO dataset (QNRM, 2009) for
    2004/2005. The weather profile is relatively hot and wet, late in the crop season.
    The weather profile (Fig. 3) was used as the weather data input for simulations
    that include weather in the input data combination, whilst the same weather profile
    (Fig. 3) was averaged daily and used as the weather data input for simulations
    without weather in the input data combination. Download : Download full-size image

    learning, iterative hill climbing control strategies. 5.2. Determination of the
    industry-standard (baseline) irrigation schedule An industry-standard irrigation
    management strategy was implemented as a baseline for the performance of the adaptive
    control strategies. This strategy applied a uniform irrigation treatment across
    the field where irrigation events were initiated when the soil–water deficit reached
    a set amount in one point in the field. The soil–water deficit was taken in the
    cell with the lowest plant available water capacity, as this is the most limiting
    soil (Fig. 2(a)). In this simulation, 25 mm was applied to the whole field when
    the soil–water deficit had reached 30 mm in the cell with sandy soil. 5.3. Adaptive
    control implementation The robustness of the irrigation control strategy to sensed
    data availability was evaluated by simulating the strategies using different combinations
    of data input (McCarthy et al., 2011). This indicated the control inputs that
    are most appropriate to each control strategy. The simulations used the same underlying
    crop model but different combinations of input variables for control. For example,
    the simulation evaluating the importance of sensed soil data to the ILC strategy
    involves adjusting the irrigation volume according to the error between the desired
    soil–water and the measured soil–water after each irrigation event. Irrigations
    were initiated when 15% of the cells had consumed 30% of the PAWC. 5.3.1. Methodology
    – ILC The ILC strategy was simulated using the five applicable input data combinations
    (Table 2). Weather-only input is not applicable for control as the weather data
    does not provide feedback on the crop response. When both weather and soil data
    were available, soil data was used instead of weather data to determine the crop
    water use. For the simulations with two input data variables, the weightings on
    each variable were chosen to be 0.5. Table 2. Simulations conducted to compare
    interactions between control strategies (labelled by ID#) and input variables

    plant (B) Averaged SILO data Target leaf area index Change in soil–water The simulations
    using plant data to determine the irrigation application used leaf area index
    as the input variable for control. This is because the ILC algorithm assumes that
    the refined input is adjusted in the same direction as the difference between
    the measured and desired value for a positive learning gain; whereas for a negative
    learning gain the refined input is adjusted in the opposite direction to the difference
    between the measured and desired value. For example, when the desired value is
    less than the measured value (and the difference is negative) and the learning
    gain is positive, then the irrigation volume applied is less than the previous
    irrigation volume. For many crops an applicable plant variable may be leaf area
    index since vegetative growth typically increases with increased water application
    and hence would require a positive learning gain. However, for cotton, the desired
    reproductive growth is maximised when the plant is under mild water stress (Gibb
    et al., 2004), hence the square and boll counts are not applicable for ILC. An
    optimal time series dataset is required for each input variable to compare with
    the measured output and calculate the next irrigation volume uk+1. The leaf area
    index (LAI) for an optimal cotton crop is shown in Fig. 4. The dataset was obtained
    from OZCOT for a high yielding simulation and the curve was smoothed using exponential
    smoothing with a smoothing factor of 0.85. For this case study, a 12.6 ha centre
    pivot irrigated field was automatically divided into 1266 cells of area 100 m2
    (with cell dimensions of 10 m wide and 10 m long). Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Target leaf area index used for iterative learning control strategy
    for cotton in VARIwise (Wells and Hearn, 1992). The simulations using soil data
    used soil–water deficit as the controlled variable. In this case, the soil–water
    variable is calculated by subtracting the desired deficit from the full point
    (field capacity) of the soil. The simulations using soil data input adjusted the
    irrigation volume to achieve a deficit of 10% of the plant available water capacity
    in each cell following each irrigation event. Simulations for ILC were conducted
    in VARIwise using the agronomic factors in Table 1 and the underlying soil variability
    in Fig. 2(a). The desired LAI time series set of Fig. 4 was used. This cell size
    was selected to enable timely execution of the simulations and accommodate substantial
    in-field spatial variability of soil properties. The following values were used
    for the ILC parameters defined in Section 4.6: • the learning gain (γ) was unity;
    • the irrigations were initiated after the crop had consumed 30% of the PAWC;
    and • the time delay (Δ) between the irrigation event and the parameter measurement
    depended on the data input. The data for feedback in the control strategy were
    obtained from the OZCOT model on different days depending on the data type: the
    soil dataset was obtained one day after the previous irrigation event, whilst
    the plant dataset was obtained one day prior to next scheduled irrigation event.
    5.3.2. Methodology – IHCC Using weather, soil and plant input data, there are
    six possible combinations of data input for IHCC (Table 3). As with ILC, weather-only
    input is not applicable for control as the weather data does not provide a measure
    of the crop response. No data combinations with weather and soil data were used
    because soil data are used (if available) instead of weather data to determine
    the crop water use. The strategies with soil data input aimed to maintain a soil–water
    deficit equal to 10% of the plant available water capacity in each cell following
    each irrigation event. For the simulations with two input variables, the weighting
    on each variable was set to be 0.5. Table 3. Simulations conducted to compare
    interactions between control strategies (labelled by ID#) and input variables

    AND plant (B) Averaged SILO data Maximise square/boll count Change in soil–water
    The simulations using plant data to determine the irrigation application used
    square count as the input variable for control. This is because squares form earlier
    in the crop season than bolls (and can be controlled earlier in the crop season).
    Square count was used instead of leaf area index to maximise the reproductive
    growth of the cotton plant (which should maximise the final yield) rather than
    manage the vegetative growth. For IHCC strategies there must be sufficient cells
    in the field for the test cells to be replaced after each irrigation event in
    the crop season. For example, a field with three zones and five test cells requires
    15 test cells for each irrigation event. Because these test cells must be replaced
    with new test cells after every irrigation event, a minimum of 300 cells are required
    for a season with 20 irrigation events. The field of 1266 cells was automatically
    divided into three zones (Fig. 2(b)) and five test cells were used in each zone.
    The underlying soil variability of Fig. 2(a) was implemented. The feedback data
    were obtained from the OZCOT model one day after the previous irrigation event
    for soil responses and one day before the next scheduled irrigation event for
    plant responses. 5.4. Performance of control strategies 5.4.1. Performance using
    an industry-standard irrigation management strategy An industry-standard irrigation
    schedule was implemented with field properties as per Table 1 and involved applying
    25 mm between 14 October 2004 and 14 March 2005 when the soil–water deficit in
    a sandy cell reached 30 mm. Table 4 presents the results of the industry-standard
    irrigation control strategy simulated for three homogeneous fields and one spatially
    varied field. In these results IWUI is the ratio of the crop yield (e.g. bales
    of cotton) to the irrigation water applied (ML), whilst CWUI is the ratio of crop
    yield (e.g. bales) to the total water used by the crop (ML) (BPA, 1999). For the
    homogenous fields the yield was higher as the PAWC increased, while the water
    use was highest on the clay field and lowest on the clay loam field. This indicates
    that the application of a fixed amount (25 mm) to all three cells produces high
    yield on clay but low yield on sand. Hence, the site-specific irrigation volumes
    applied should be adjusted according to the PAWC of individual cells. Table 4.

    yield of the spatially-varied field was 9.1 ± 1.9 bales/ha with CWUI of 0.9 bales/MLtotal
    (total water in ML) and IWUI of 1.4 bales/MLirrigated (irrigation applied in ML)
    (Fig. 5). The total volume of water applied to the crop (including rainfall) was
    10.2 ML/ha, whilst the irrigation applied to the crop was 6.8 ML/ha. Variations
    reported in the average yield values are standard deviations of yield across the
    field (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). The spatially varied field produced yields consistent
    with the results of the irrigation of the individual soil types, with the yield
    approximately the average of the yield for the three sand, clay loam and clay
    soils. The irrigation applied to the spatially varied field was higher than that
    to the individual soil types. This is likely because the irrigation events were
    initiated according to the sand cells (which would be more frequent than the clay
    loam and loam cells). The applied water and yields produced by the simulations
    are consistent with local typical experience. Download : Download full-size image

    Performance using ILC Table 5 and Fig. 6 sets out the simulated outputs of the
    ILC strategies using the data input combinations described in Table 3. The yield
    and irrigation applied were generally lower for the sand and clay loam soil types
    than those averaged across the spatially varied field. This indicates that the
    ILC strategy irrigation events were initiated at sub-optimal timing for the sand
    and clay loam cells. The timing of the irrigation events was based on the crop
    water use relative to the PAWC. Table 5. Performance of the ILC strategies with
    different data input combinations for homogenous and spatially variable fields.

    produced the highest yield and water use efficiency with soil–water input (simulation
    #1). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Irrigation volumes applied to
    sand, clay loam and clay cells for ILC strategies that target: (a) soil–water
    deficit (simulation #1); and (b) leaf area index (simulation #2). ILC produced
    lower yields with leaf area index input (simulations #2, #3 and #5) than with
    soil–water input (Fig. 6). The irrigation volumes applied were higher throughout
    the crop season for ILC targeting leaf area index than soil–water deficit (Fig.
    7). This indicates that the leaf area index is not proportionally related to irrigation
    application and that the leaf area index input is not effective to determine the
    crop water requirements for this crop. The leaf area index measurement also may
    not have detected whether the plant was actively transpiring or stressed. The
    irrigation volumes applied using leaf area index also exceeded the soil–water
    deficit (Fig. 8(b)); hence, ILC with leaf area index input could not adapt to
    the difference in soil–water for different soils. The leaf area index was also
    generally lower for ILC targeting leaf area index than ILC maintaining soil–water
    deficit (Fig. 9). This suggests that leaf area index is a less effective indicator
    of irrigation requirement than soil–water deficit for ILC. The additional input
    of plant data to the soil simulation (simulation #4) also reduced the simulated
    yield and water use efficiency (compared with simulation #1). Download : Download

    (simulation #6); and (d) maximise square/boll count (simulation #9). There were
    differences between the simulated and desired soil–water deficit for the strategy
    targeting soil–water deficit (#simulation 1, Fig. 8(a)). These were likely caused
    by the plant physiological response varying to each irrigation event during the
    crop season, while the ILC relies on process repetition to refine the irrigation
    volume and assumes that the crop conditions essentially ‘reset’ before the next
    irrigation event. In the spatially-varied fields the ILC strategies generally
    produced higher yields in the clay loam areas than sand and clay areas. This suggests
    that irrigating the different soil types during the same irrigation event did
    not lead to yield optimisation and could be caused by the crop undergoing either
    insufficient or too much water stress before irrigation events were initiated.
    The standard deviation in yield across the field was lower using soil data and
    not plant data. This is because plant data used in ILC could not effectively indicate
    the irrigation requirement. 5.4.3. Performance using IHCC The simulations described
    in Table 3 produced the yields and water use efficiencies in Fig. 10 and Table
    6. The yield was generally higher for the homogenous fields than the spatially
    varied field. This is because each test cell had the same properties and would
    have the same response to the test irrigation volumes, leading to a more accurate
    system identification procedure. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10.

    2.0 Spatially variable 11.4 ± 1.8 11.6 7.3 1.0 1.6 IHCC produced reasonable yields
    and water use efficiencies for all data input combinations. The highest yield
    was simulated using the soil-and-plant input (simulation #9), whilst the lowest
    yields were simulated using plant-only input (simulation #7) and weather-and-plant
    input (simulation #8). The IHCC strategy that maximised square/boll count (simulation
    #9) resulted in a higher maximum square count than the strategy that attempted
    to maintain a fixed soil–water deficit (simulation #6) (Fig. 9). The simulations
    using plant input in combinations with weather or soil data (simulations #8–10)
    produced higher yields than those only using only soil data input (simulations
    #6). This suggests that square count indicated the plant status more accurately
    than soil response. The soil-and-plant strategy that targeted a soil–water deficit
    and maximised square/boll count (simulation #9) performed better than simulations
    that maximised square/boll count (simulation #10). This is because the first squares
    form approximately 60 days after sowing, and the strategy requires soil–water
    indicate crop water requirement during this early stage. IHCC with soil-and-plant
    input (simulation #9) applied less irrigation water than that with plant-only
    (simulation #7). This is because the fruit load input does not accurately identify
    the irrigation timing or volume of water to be applied and tends to over-irrigate
    during wet periods of the crop season (e.g. 63–86 days after sowing, Fig. 11).
    Including the soil data improves the accuracy of the application volume determination
    and hence, the efficiency of water application was higher using soil data in combination
    with the plant data. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Irrigation volumes
    applied to sand, clay loam and clay cells for IHCC strategies that maximise square/boll
    count and determine irrigation timing using: (a) weather data (simulation #7);
    and (b) soil–water content (simulation #9). The spatial variability observed in
    the simulated yield (Fig. 10) was higher when a single sensor input (simulations
    #6 and #7) was used compared to a multi-sensor combinations. Spatial variability
    in yield was caused by both differences in the soil properties and the ‘test’
    irrigation volumes being applied to various cells across the field. The irrigation
    volumes applied to the clay loam and clay cells were generally larger than those
    applied to the sand cells (Fig. 11). The higher soil–water storage capacity on
    these soils was found to produce larger crops which then resulted in larger irrigation
    deficits at irrigation. It was also noted that the soil–water deficit at irrigation
    in the sand, clay loam and clay cells was generally closer to the target deficit
    (6 mm, 15 mm and 20 mm, respectively) using weather-and-soil input (Fig. 11(a))
    than using weather-and-plant input (Fig. 11(b)). As for the ILC strategies, IHCC
    strategies produced higher yields in the clay loam areas than sand and clay areas.
    This indicates that the yield was not optimised in all soil types of the field
    which could be caused by the crop undergoing either too little or much water stress
    before an irrigation event. The standard deviation in yield across the field was
    highest in the simulation using neither soil or weather data. This is because
    plant data could not effectively indicate the irrigation timing for IHCC. Deviations
    from the desired soil–water deficit were also caused by the test cells not being
    representative of all the cells in the zone, causing the ‘best’ response of the
    test cells to be inaccurate and the irrigation application of the whole zone to
    be inappropriate. It follows that the square count may not be maximised in each
    cell of the field because of the differences in properties of the test cells and
    non-test cells. Deviations may also have been caused by test cells being inappropriately
    chosen at the border between zones where the zone division is jagged and therefore
    less certain. Hence, the location of the test cells is important for the irrigation
    optimisation. 6. Discussion The Iterative Learning Control strategy generally
    produced higher crop water use efficiency performance indices than the Iterative
    Hill Climbing Control strategy for spatially varied fields. For homogenous fields,
    the IHCC strategies generally produced higher yields than the ILC strategies.
    This is because IHCC could optimise fruit development with repeatable system identification.
    This indicates that the consideration of fruiting rather than vegetative growth
    in the irrigation control strategy could produce significant yield improvements.
    The highest crop and irrigation water use efficiencies were achieved using ILC
    with soil–water data (simulation #1), whilst the highest irrigation water use
    efficiency using IHCC was achieved when soil-and-plant data (simulation #9) was
    used. Similar yields were obtained for the IHCC strategy with soil-and-plant input
    (simulation #9, 12.4 ± 1.6 bales/ha) and the ILC strategy with soil-only input
    (simulation #1, 12.2 ± 1.5 bales/ha). ILC adjusted the irrigation volume to achieve
    the desired soil–water deficit following the irrigation event for the different
    soil types in the field. The IHCC strategy was less effective at maintaining a
    target soil–water deficit than the ILC strategy (Fig. 8). With soil-only input,
    IHCC produced an average yield and crop water use efficiency (simulation #6, 11.2
    ± 1.8 bales/ha and 1.0 bales/MLtotal, respectively) lower than those of the ILC
    strategy with soil-input (simulation #1). The IHCC strategy can optimise parameters
    (e.g. through maximising square/boll counts) and target temporally-variable soil/crop
    responses, whilst the ILC strategy can only target temporally-variable soil/crop
    responses (e.g. soil–water deficit). Hence, leaf area index was selected for ILC
    and fruit load was selected for IHCC. ILC performed poorly with plant data (i.e.
    leaf area index) input. This suggests that IHCC may be more appropriate for weather-and-plant
    data input, whilst ILC may be preferable with soil-input only. However, the case
    study indicates that leaf area index input was not appropriate for ILC because
    of its lack of sensitivity to irrigation volume application. For the ILC strategy,
    there was no benefit in using multiple combinations of soil, plant or weather
    data. The irrigation refinement was most effective during dry periods of the season
    as rainfall was a (non-repeating) disturbance in the control system. However,
    ILC adapted rapidly to the new system state in dry periods following the rainfall.
    7. Conclusion Two sensor-based irrigation control strategies, ‘Iterative Learning
    Control’ (ILC) and custom-designed ‘Iterative Hill Climbing Control’ (IHCC) were
    simulated in the software VARIwise for a cotton crop ‘grown’ with the soils and
    merged 2004–2009 weather data of south-east Queensland, Australia, and represented
    by the performance of the well-validated cotton growth and production model OZCOT.
    These strategies were simulated for both homogenous and spatially variable fields.
    Both strategies produced higher simulated yields and water use efficiencies than
    an industry-standard irrigation management strategy. The optimal sensor combination
    and control strategy that should be used in the field will depend on the crop
    and water availability. • Where sensor data availability is non-limiting then
    for homogeneous fields, IHCC performed the best with plant and soil data input,
    whilst ILC performed the best with soil data input, where IHCC produced higher
    yields than ILC. • However, in spatially varied fields, the simulations indicated
    that there was no significant difference between the highest yield achieved by
    the ILC strategy using soil–water data and the IHCC strategy using soil and plant
    sensor data. • Where sensor data availability is limited then the results indicate
    that an ILC strategy would be preferable to optimise irrigated water use efficiency.
    The sensor-based control strategies simulated in VARIwise provide promising performance
    of site-specific adaptive irrigation. These strategies could be extended to other
    irrigation systems (e.g. drip, surface) by considering irrigation application
    hydraulics. Implementation of these in the field would require high resolution
    soil and plant sensing. Comparison of simulated control strategies potentially
    provides a driver for the development of particular types of sensors. Field validation
    remains a challenge (unless there are multiple fields and irrigation machines)
    but further work will involve field evaluations to compare the simulated and measured
    control strategy performance. Acknowledgements The authors are grateful to the

    Control engineering approaches may be applied to irrigation management to make
    better use of available irrigation water. These methods of irrigation decision-making
    are being developed to deal with spatial and temporal variability in field properties,
    data availability and hardware constraints. One type of control system is advanced
    process control which, in an irrigation context, refers to the incorporation of
    multiple aspects of optimisation and control. Hence, advanced process control
    is particularly suited to the management of site-specific irrigation. This paper
    reviews applications of advanced process control in irrigation: mathematical programming,
    linear quadratic control, artificial intelligence, iterative learning control
    and model predictive control. From the literature review, it is argued that model-based
    control strategies are more realistic in the soil–plant–atmosphere system using
    process simulation models rather than using ‘black-box’ crop production models.
    It is also argued that model-based control strategies can aim for specific end
    of season characteristics and hence may achieve optimality. Three control systems
    are identified that are robust to data gaps and deficiencies and account for spatial
    and temporal variability in field characteristics, namely iterative learning control,
    iterative hill climbing control and model predictive control: from consideration
    of these three systems it is concluded that the most appropriate control strategy
    depends on factors including sensor data availability and grower’s specific performance
    requirements. It is further argued that control strategy development will be driven
    by the available sensor technology and irrigation hardware, but also that control
    strategy options should also drive future plant and soil moisture sensor development.

    © 2021 Introduction A control engineering approach is one solution being developed
    to automate irrigation management. Figure 1 illustrates a generic irrigation control
    system that uses the full range of plant, weather and soil data for irrigation
    management. In Fig. 1: Fig. 1 Generic control scenario for irrigation application
    (adapted from McCarthy et al. 2010a) Full size image the ‘decision support system’
    embodies the control strategy; ‘actuation’ is the action of adjusting the irrigation
    volume and/or timing; and ‘application’ is the resulting physical amount and timing
    of water and fertiliser applied to the crop. This process can be applied to both
    constant and spatially varied irrigation management at a range of time scales.
    Similarly, the actuation of the irrigation volume application may be either manual
    or automated. Control strategies can be either ‘open-loop’ if they do not use
    sensor feedback to adjust the control, or ‘closed-loop’ if the response of the
    system is monitored and used to adjust the control. Open-loop control strategies
    are outside the scope of this paper. Closed-loop irrigation control strategies
    in the literature have been developed using either infield soil sensors that aim
    to regulate the soil moisture content (Luthra et al. 1997; Smajstrla and Locascio
    2000; Dukes and Scholberg 2005); plant sensors to irrigate when the plant has
    reached a stress point (Evett et al. 2002; Peters and Evett 2008); or calibrated
    crop production models to achieve either a desired soil moisture deficit (Capraro
    et al. 2008), or maximise yield, profit or water productivity (i.e. water use
    efficiency, Brown et al. 2010). There are no published comparisons of performance
    between these approaches. The reported closed-loop irrigation control approaches
    do not typically consider uncertainties associated with unknown crop dynamics,
    nor robustness with respect to sensing requirements, irrigation delivery capability
    or water availability. These factors are known to be spatially varied and subject
    to change between and during crop seasons. In addition, the irrigation application,
    rainfall volumes, soil moisture content and crop response (e.g. plant condition,
    vegetative or reproductive growth) are likely to be stochastic in nature. An engineering
    approach generally labelled ‘advanced process control’ is now routinely applied
    for manufacturing and chemical process systems and combines elements from many
    disciplines spanning classical control engineering, signal processing, statistics,
    decision theory and artificial intelligence (Ikonen and Najim 2002). The application
    of advanced process control to irrigation presents opportunities to improve irrigation
    water use and crop performance. Advanced process control techniques can be used
    for irrigation systems that apply irrigation uniformly over a field, but also
    those that apply site-specific irrigation where the crops have spatially and temporally
    varying irrigation requirements. The variability can be caused by soil type, crop
    type, crop condition (stress, etc.) and meteorological conditions (e.g. rainfall).
    These factors are discussed further in Smith et al. (2009). Research into variable-rate
    irrigation technology for centre pivot and lateral move irrigation machines has
    spanned 20 years and produced a number of commercial systems (e.g. Farmscan, Valmont,
    Zimmatic). However, the greatest limitation to the adoption of variable-rate irrigation
    is associated with developing optimal irrigation schedules (i.e. volume and timing
    of irrigation) or irrigation prescriptions (Evans et al. 1996). Recent evidence
    (LaRue, J, pers. comm., March 2011) suggests that there is a poor adoption rate
    of variable-rate irrigation and that growers with these systems are not continuing
    to use them for variable-rate irrigation, e.g. only four out of 100 growers who
    purchased Farmscan systems in Georgia, USA in the previous 5 years are still using
    the variable-rate technology. Existing sensors developed for agricultural system
    control and specifically used in irrigation management include remote imagery,
    on-the-go plant measurement (i.e. continuous measurements from sensors mounted
    on on-farm vehicles/machines), soil moisture sensing arrays and infrared thermometry.
    However, the currently-developed advanced process control systems may not necessarily
    require these sensors. Similarly, these sensors may not be applicable to the best
    performing advanced process control strategies. Hence, it is important to identify
    both the most promising advanced process control strategies and their sensing
    requirements, and also the strategies that can be applied to the currently available
    sensors. Scope, structure and overview This paper reviews the existing literature
    of advanced process control in irrigation and their sensor requirements and ability
    to adapt to the infield conditions. Five general methods of advanced process control
    that have been applied to irrigation in the available literature are discussed
    here: mathematical programming; linear quadratic control; artificial intelligence;
    model predictive control; and learning control. Consideration of the requirements
    of control strategies for irrigation leads to the identification of three ‘advanced
    process control’ strategies capable of overcoming at least some of the limitations
    of existing irrigation control approaches. Each has different requirements of
    measurement information as well as temporal and spatial resolution. In this paper
    the strategies are described as ‘sensor-based’ if they directly use measurements
    to make irrigation decisions; and ‘model-based’ if they use a model (often with
    sensor input) to aid irrigation decisions. Sensor- and model-based irrigation
    control strategies often have different sensor data requirements because of the
    nature of the control. For example, a sensor-based control strategy could use
    feedback from infrared thermometers or soil moisture sensors, whilst a model-based
    control strategy requires soil properties and plant growth information to calibrate
    the crop model. The crop model is calibrated to improve the accuracy of the model
    and involves adjusting model parameters according to comparisons between modelled
    and measured data. The specific model calibration procedure would vary depending
    on the crop and model but may be automated. McCarthy et al. (2011) demonstrates
    the calibration of the Australian cotton model OZCOT. Hence, this paper also discusses
    the sensor requirements of the reviewed control strategies. Advanced process control
    in irrigation: progress to date Mathematical programming Irrigation events can
    be scheduled using linear programming (Holzapfel et al. 1986; Azamathulla et al.
    2009), nonlinear programming (Ghahraman and Sepaskhah 1997) or dynamic programming
    (Rao et al. 1988; Naadimuthu et al. 1999), either singly or in combination. These
    involve making irrigation decisions for each growth stage to maximise the farm’s
    income (Rao et al. 1992). The models used are typically either heuristic crop
    yield production formulae (Benli and Kodal 2003) or daily, physically-based soil–plant–atmosphere
    models (Sunantara and Ramirez 1997). Common objective functions (formulae) used
    in mathematical programming aim to optimise water allocation among a single or
    various crops, or maximise the profit of the irrigation. The constraints that
    were generally defined in the mathematical programming applications were water
    availability, agricultural land and cropping patterns. Dynamic programming is
    the most widely used mathematical programming approach to irrigation scheduling
    (Shang and Mao 2006). However, dynamic programming has considerable computational
    requirements. To help overcome this it is common to: (i) discretise the underlying
    water balance and prediction models; (ii) use both linear programming and dynamic
    programming models; and (iii) assume irrigation events are scheduled at regular
    (i.e. weekly) intervals (Yaron and Dinar 1982; Stoecker et al. 1985; Rao et al.
    1990). An exception of case (ii) is Sunantara and Ramirez (1997) where irrigation
    events could be scheduled on any set date rather than at regular intervals or
    by growth stage. An alternative approach to reduce the computational complexity
    of mathematical programming is to use neural networks to sample only a fraction
    of the state space without significantly simplifying the model (Schütze and Schmitz
    2009). There are often large uncertainties in weather (e.g. rainfall, evapotranspiration)
    and water supply during crop seasons. Stochastic approaches may potentially be
    applied to consider uncertainty in spatial variability of unmeasured variables.
    Stochastic rainfall input is of particular importance if rainfall is the major
    water supply source during the crop season. Ramirez and Bras (1985) and Sunantara
    and Ramirez (1997) demonstrated significant performance improvements by considering
    the stochasticity of rainfall inputs using stochastic dynamic programming for
    optimal irrigation scheduling. However, Yaron and Dinar (1982) found little uncertainty
    in rainfall during a field evaluation of a combined linear/dynamic programming
    model in Mediterranean conditions, because the rainfall occurred outside of the
    cotton growing season. Uncertainty in crop water demands (Ganji et al. 2006) and
    spatial variability of soil properties (Russo 1986) have also been considered
    in irrigation optimisation using mathematical programming. Yaron and Dinar (1982)
    speculated that water prices, water supply hydraulics, and measured soil moisture
    and crop response should all be calibrated within the model to adapt to the local
    conditions. Spatial variations of soil and climate have been incorporated into
    linear programming models used for corn, drybeans and soybeans (He 1999). Linear
    quadratic control Linear quadratic control is a branch of ‘optimal control theory’
    1 in which control is subject to quadratic costs (Lewis and Syrmos 1995). Protopapas
    and Georgakakos (1990) simulated an optimal control system which determined daily
    irrigation rates using a soil and plant state space model. The objective functions
    aimed to achieve a final state while minimising irrigation application and minimising
    salinity. Protopapas and Georgakakos (1990) noted that a field implementation
    would require the consideration of more types of constraints and considerations.
    This would be expected to include irrigation delivery constraints and consideration
    of infield measurements of soil and plant response to calibrate the model. Shani
    et al. (2004) implemented an optimal control system to determine optimal moisture
    dynamics during the crop season. This approach was limited to determining the
    general soil moisture curve throughout the crop season rather than discrete irrigation
    events on set dates. Fieldwork verified that this approach outperformed the policy
    of yield maximisation for sunflowers. Artificial intelligence The numerical optimisation
    of irrigation management is computationally intensive and often requires model
    simplification and discretisation. Neural networks (Schmitz et al. 2002) and evolutionary
    algorithms 2 (Schmitz et al. 2007) have been developed to determine irrigation
    volume and timing to minimise irrigation application and maximise yield. These
    systems used a subsurface flow model to calculate the wetting profiles and train
    a neural network to provide irrigation parameters to achieve the desired soil
    moisture profile. Schmitz et al. (2007) demonstrated a 92% higher simulated yield
    for corn using evolutionary algorithms than using a dynamic programming approach
    which used a simplified model. An alternative approach used an evolutionary algorithm
    to determine the optimal irrigation volume and timing using a soil water balance
    model and a generic yield prediction model (de Paly and Zell 2009; de Paly et
    al. 2010). Model predictive control There has been significant research in using
    soil and crop models in irrigation management to forecast the process output (DeJonge
    et al. 2007). Model predictive control iteratively executes a model to optimise
    process inputs, rather than numerically operating on the model. Model predictive
    control forecasts the system performance over a finite horizon and uses an optimisation
    algorithm to determine which control action to take to achieve the desired performance
    (Mosca 1995). A model predictive control strategy was simulated to regulate soil
    moisture using a soil dynamics model (Park et al. 2009). The model parameters
    were calibrated using a genetic algorithm, real-time weather data and soil moisture
    measurements from capacitance probes. Learning control Control strategies that
    directly use sensor feedback without a model must perform system identification
    efficiently. This is because the optimisation procedure relies on field measurements
    and is not aided by predictions from a model of soil and crop response. One method
    of sensor-based control that has been applied to irrigation is iterative learning
    control (Moore and Chen 2006). Iterative learning control is used in systems that
    operate repetitively with the same initial conditions at each iteration (Ahn et
    al. 2007). Moore and Chen (2006) conceptualised such a controller to adjust the
    irrigation application flow rate to control the water or concentration of nutrients
    in the soil. This model did not consider temporal changes in crop water use or
    weather conditions; hence, the irrigation events were initiated at regular intervals
    to satisfy the condition that the same initial conditions are present before each
    irrigation event. The control strategy assumed that a sensor would be located
    in each cell of the field; however, in a field implementation this may not be
    practical. Discussion Mathematical programming and linear quadratic control use
    numerical methods to optimise irrigation application and/or timing. The computational
    requirements of these strategies were large even with the simplified crop model.
    This simplification resulted in temporal coarseness of the model, where irrigation
    was allocated to each growing stage or weekly time period. This lack of precision
    potentially results in sub-optimal performance and may restrict the application
    of numerical methods to real-time irrigation management. However, the mathematical
    programming strategies often considered uncertainty in rainfall and evapotranspiration
    which is practical in soil–plant–atmosphere systems. Artificial intelligence reduces
    the complexity of mathematical programming approaches while also optimising irrigation
    management at a daily time scale. Therefore, artificial intelligence-based control
    strategies are potentially more accurate than mathematical programming control
    strategies. Model predictive control iteratively executes crop models to optimise
    irrigation events over the prediction horizon. This strategy can use publicly
    available crop models (e.g. APSIM, McCown et al. 1996; DSSAT, Jones et al. 2003)
    rather than models in state space form. When used for this purpose, the crop models
    are ‘black-box’ because access is only provided to their inputs and outputs. The
    optimisation of irrigation using these ‘black-box’ models is inefficient compared
    with using numerical models; however, they are typically able to deal with complexities
    found in soil–plant–atmosphere systems (e.g. sprinkler spray patterns, English
    et al. 1992). Use of learning control requires that the variable being regulated
    be representative of overall plant status. This control strategy may require many
    irrigation events to achieve optimality because it is only learning from the measurement
    rather than also using prediction from a crop model. Hence, learning control is
    potentially less efficient than model-based control. In a real-time control system
    it is likely that model-based control systems would be integrated with weather,
    soil moisture and plant development sensing systems for model calibration. However,
    none of the strategies reviewed used this full data set to calibrate the model.
    Sensor considerations for advanced process control in irrigation Reviews have
    been conducted for soil moisture content sensors (Charlesworth 2004) and plant-based
    sensors (White and Raine 2008). These technologies either require direct contact
    or are non-contact and proximal (i.e. hand-held or machine mounted) or remote
    (e.g. airborne, satellite). Contact sensors provide a high temporal resolution
    of data for individual points in the field, whilst proximal sensors only provide
    information when the sensor passes over the field, either on an irrigation machine,
    tractor, aerial vehicle or satellite. Soil moisture sensors are typically fixed
    in the field, whilst plant sensors can be either fixed in the field or proximal.
    The combination of plant, soil and weather data that is used for irrigation control
    commonly depends on the sensor availability and grower preference. Similarly,
    the number of sensors that is required to monitor the in-field spatial variability
    depends on the type of sensor, amount of in-field variability and the grower’s
    preferences. No single sensor (either plant or soil) on its own will indicate
    the optimal water application volume for each irrigation event. Similarly, sensor-based
    irrigation control strategies that use only one data type (e.g. soil moisture
    or plant response) may not specifically optimise the water use or crop performance,
    but are required in situations of low data availability. In contrast, model-based
    control strategies using multiple sensors incorporate information from the soil–plant–atmosphere
    relationships that are defined in crop production models to identify optimal water
    applications. The spatial and temporal resolution of sensors required for site-specific
    advanced process control strategies is likely to depend on the type of control
    strategy. For example, model-based strategies may require measurements during
    each growth stage and following irrigation events to calibrate the model, whilst
    sensor-based strategies may require daily or sub-daily measurements to determine
    irrigation timing. Model-based strategies would be able to use the high spatial
    resolution and low temporal resolution data from proximal sensors. However, the
    higher measurement discrimination required by sensor-based strategies may only
    be achievable (at present) using fixed sensors. In a practical control system,
    a minimum number of fixed sensors would be installed in the field to minimise
    cost and labour but this might provide only low spatial resolution. Hence, soil
    sensors that are easy to install would potentially be appropriate for sensor-based
    strategies, e.g. the soil moisture sensor array reported by Vellidis et al. (2008),
    but such low-cost sensor arrays have yet to be proven adequate for sensor-based
    control. Model- and sensor-based control strategies typically have different data
    requirements. For example, the parameters of the models used by sections “Linear
    quadratic control”, “Artificial intelligence” and “Model predictive control” must
    be calibrated using measurements recognised by the model (e.g. soil moisture content,
    growth stage, plant height and crop coverage). In contrast, section “Learning
    control” uses measured responses to irrigation (e.g. soil moisture content, plant
    status measurements from infrared thermometers, Peters and Evett 2008). Development
    of sensors that measure parameters specifically for model calibration may be required,
    especially as the input parameters of models can vary depending on climate and
    crop type. Camera-based sensors have been proposed for irrigation management to
    measure plant parameters (McCarthy et al. 2009). Fundamental control concepts
    as they apply to irrigation The review of the current state of advanced process
    control systems for irrigation and sensor development in relation to control systems
    indicates that irrigation control strategies should be robust to (1) application
    hardware and water availability constraints; and (2) data availability limitations.
    Following Ogata (1990) the design of a control system that is practical in an
    irrigation environment requires consideration of stability, robustness and optimality,
    described below in order of significance in traditional control systems: 1. Stability
    is a primary requirement of control systems (Krstić et al. 1995) and characterises
    how a system reacts to disturbances (Hangos et al. 2001). A system is stable if
    the signals remain bounded (Isermann et al. 1992); however, stability is a difficult
    property to evaluate in adaptive control systems due to its dynamic nature (Friedland
    1996). 2. Robustness can be interpreted as stability under system disturbances
    (de Silva 2000). The robustness of a control system denotes the insensitivity
    to parameter changes, model errors (in model-based control) and disturbances (in
    input and control signals) (de Silva 2000). Robust control systems are able to
    account for uncertainty in the process parameters to guarantee the stability of
    the system (Landau et al. 1998). 3. The output of a control system should converge
    to the optimal value. Achieving optimality in control systems relies on optimisation
    techniques (Ogata 1990) and optimisation generally consists of searching the space
    of variable controller parameters as a function of the performance index to determine
    where the performance index is optimal (Ogata 1990). However, when considered
    in relation to the control of irrigation, the order of importance changes. Whereas
    control systems are traditionally designed with the greatest emphasis on stability
    (Åström 1990), it is anticipated that the most critical characteristic of systems
    designed for site-specific irrigation application will be robustness. This is
    because in any practical field implementation there are likely to be deficiencies
    in spatial and temporal data availability, and/or constraints on the irrigation
    system capacity or water availability. Optimality is likely to be the next most
    important principle in the design of an irrigation control strategy. To optimise
    automatic irrigation control, a performance index is typically optimised and the
    sensed variable/s used to calculate the performance index varies according to
    the strategy employed. For example, the irrigation applied may be optimised using
    daily measured data and for cotton this may involve determining the irrigation
    that maximises the square count (‘squares’ are flower buds on a cotton plant)
    or boll count after an irrigation event. Alternatively, predicted end of season
    characteristics (i.e. yield, water use efficiency) may be maximised using a process
    model. Stability is arguably the least significant of the control design principles
    in automatic irrigation control. This is because the soil–plant–atmosphere system
    has very slow dynamics compared with typical processes to which automatic control
    is commonly applied (namely electromechanical and many chemical processes) in
    which major changes often occur in less than a second. Although it is conceivable
    that an unusual change in the soil–plant–atmosphere system might cause some fundamental
    instability in the automatic control of irrigation, the system will not become
    unstable rapidly. Advanced process control approaches to irrigation The strategies
    of section “Advanced process control in irrigation: progress to date” and the
    control design principles of section “Fundamental control concepts as they apply
    to irrigation” can be applied to both uniform and site-specific irrigation control
    strategies. Smith et al. (2009) provides an introduction to the potential use
    of control systems to manage spatial and temporal variations in crop water requirements
    to improve the precision of irrigation applications. An advanced process control
    system utilised for irrigation must be robust to intermittent data availability
    and accommodate spatial variability. Irrigation control can be approached by adjusting
    the irrigation application either: (1) directly from the soil and/or crop response
    measurements (‘sensor-based control’); or (2) from responses simulated using a
    soil and crop production model (‘model-based control’). These strategies are suitable
    for both constant and site-specific irrigation, where the measurements taken represent
    the whole field or a smaller area of the field, respectively. Sensor-based irrigation
    control systems may be implemented as a simple feedback control system (e.g. iterative
    learning control: Ahn et al. 2007) which adjusts the applied irrigation volume
    according to the difference between the desired and measured response. An alternate
    implementation is to evaluate the response of multiple irrigation volumes and
    apply the irrigation volume with the best response (e.g. iterative hill climbing
    control, McCarthy et al. 2010a). There are a number of model-based control strategies
    that may be applicable to spatially varied irrigation. These include optimisation
    approaches (as reviewed in the foregoing sections “Mathematical programming”,
    “Linear quadratic control”, “Artificial intelligence” and “Model predictive control”).
    These are considered in this paper in the following sections. The irrigation control
    systems would be implemented in the field using the required sensors which may
    consist of one or a combination of the following: an automatic weather station,
    soil moisture sensors and plant sensors (possibly mounted on the irrigation machine).
    These sensors may transmit wireless data to a controller on the irrigation machine,
    or require manual upload and data transfer. Alternatively, the grower’s observations
    of the soil moisture and plant growth may be used in the control strategies. Similarly,
    the irrigation application may be adjusted at different spatial resolutions (where
    the management areas may be strips of the field or smaller sub-areas of the field),
    and either manually by the grower or automated by a controller. Iterative learning
    control Iterative learning control involves varying the irrigation application
    according to the error between the measured process output and desired process
    output after the previous irrigation. Because this strategy assumes the initial
    conditions are reset after each iteration, the irrigation events would be initiated
    when the crop water use since the previous irrigation event reaches a threshold
    value. The crop conditions would then be approximately the same before each irrigation
    event is initiated. For site-specific irrigation, the iterative learning control
    strategy can consider the irrigation system capacity by increasing the irrigation
    volume applied to cells (i.e. sub-areas) according to the additional crop water
    use (measured from soil moisture sensors or estimated from weather data) between
    the irrigation initiation and when the irrigation is actually applied. Iterative
    learning control also requires data input from each cell in the field; hence,
    measured field data must be kriged in situations of sparse input data to increase
    the spatial resolution of the input data (McCarthy et al. 2010b). Soil moisture
    or leaf area may be used as feedback to measure the system performance for an
    irrigation iterative learning control strategies. The crop water use must be measured
    or estimated each day to determine the irrigation timing. Hence, sensors with
    a high temporal resolution are required. Variable structure control concepts (Åström
    and Wittenmark 1989) may be applied to iterative learning control to ensure that
    the control system is robust to data gaps and deficiencies. This involves adjusting
    the irrigation decision method depending on the input data available. For example,
    if soil data input is not available in one area of the field then plant or weather
    data input may be used to determine the irrigation timing and/or volume. The control
    actions of the iterative learning control strategy use responses from every irrigation
    event in the season rather than from only one irrigation event. This would prevent
    major changes in application during by one irrigation event; hence, stability
    is not likely a major issue for iterative learning control. Iterative learning
    control determines irrigation applications using measurements of soil and/or crop
    response to target the desired soil and/or crop response. These objectives may
    not necessarily optimise final crop yield, profit or water use efficiency. Hence,
    iterative learning control may not reach optimality. Iterative hill climbing control
    A drawback of the iterative learning control strategy is the potentially inefficient
    system identification. This is because there are a limited number of irrigation
    events that occur during a crop season and only one irrigation volume is being
    evaluated in each cell during each irrigation event. Adaptive spatially-varied
    identification may be achieved by utilising site-specific combinations of plant,
    soil and weather data in different zones of the field. Likewise, adaptive system
    identification may be incorporated into an irrigation control system to account
    for the slow speed of crop dynamics and the frequency of irrigation events. The
    efficiency of control systems may be improved for irrigation by evaluating a range
    of inputs to the system at each irrigation event. This would be implemented for
    an irrigation control system by applying and evaluating a range of irrigation
    volumes on different cells in the field. This is similar to the dual adaptive
    control concept (Wittenmark 2002) where perturbation signals are used to learn
    more about the process. This method has been adapted to irrigation and named ‘iterative
    hill climbing control’. ‘Hill climbing’ involves changing the state of the system
    into one that is closer to the goal in the direction of steepest gradient (Russell
    and Norvig 1995). The strategy involves the following process (McCarthy et al.
    2010a): 1. The field is divided into zones according to a pre-measured variability
    map. 2. ‘Test cells’ are selected in each zone to evaluate different irrigation
    volumes. 3. Test irrigation volumes are applied to each test cell. 4. Before the
    next irrigation is applied the crop response to the previous irrigation volume
    is evaluated. A performance index is calculated for each test cell in each zone
    to evaluate the response of the soil and/or plant to the irrigation volume. Using
    plant data in the performance index calculation may involve maximising the square
    count and this is similar to the extremum adaptive control concept. The irrigation
    volume that was applied to the test cell with the highest performance index is
    then applied to the whole zone. 5. Steps 3 and 4 are repeated for each irrigation
    event. New test cells are also randomly selected in each zone after each irrigation
    event to ensure that the response of a test cell is indicative of the rest of
    the zone. Possible objectives of the iterative hill climbing control are to achieve
    a set soil moisture content or vegetative growth, or maximising yield indicators
    (e.g. square count for cotton). As per iterative learning control (section “Iterative
    learning control”), measurements to determine irrigation volume are only required
    before each irrigation event. However, irrigation timing may be determined after
    a set crop water use which requires data at a higher temporal resolution. Spatial
    data unavailability is generally not important for iterative hill climbing control
    as data input is only required for the test cells. However, if field measurements
    of a test cell are missing, kriging the available data would not show the response
    of the test cells to the test irrigation volumes. Hence, kriging is not appropriate
    for iterative hill climbing control and if critical data input is missing the
    control procedure will fail. As per the iterative learning controller, the irrigation
    system capacity may be considered by increasing the irrigation application according
    to the crop water consumed since the irrigation was initiated. The strategy should
    also be robust to data gaps by using the available streams of data if the desired
    data stream input is unavailable. For example, if plant measurements are not available
    for a strategy that aims to maximise square count, then the strategy will determine
    irrigation application to achieve a set soil moisture content. Also similar to
    iterative learning control, the irrigation volumes applied would have stability.
    This is because the crop coefficients evaluated in the test cells are offset from
    the crop coefficient of the previous irrigation. Hence, only progressive changes
    are made to the irrigation volume applied throughout the crop season, effectively
    dampening any changes to the irrigation application. Iterative hill climbing control
    can potentially aim to maximise plant variables (e.g. square count for cotton)
    which should lead to near-optimality. However, such variables may only be measurable
    towards the end of the crop season and the strategy used at the start of the season
    may not necessary optimise the irrigation application. Model predictive control
    Model predictive control involves using a calibrated model to evaluate a range
    of inputs and implement the input strategy with the best performance. For irrigation,
    model predictive control could involve using real-time field data to calibrate
    a crop and soil model (McCarthy et al. 2011) and then using the calibrated model
    to determine the optimum irrigation timing and volume. Soil and/or plant measurements
    are required to calibrate the model, ideally during each growing stage and in
    response to known irrigation volumes for accurate model calibration. Proximal
    plant sensors would be appropriate for model predictive control because the measurements
    are not necessarily required daily to calibrate the model. Mounting these sensors
    on an irrigation machine or farm machinery also enables data collection at a high
    spatial resolution. Model predictive control can be used to incorporate system
    level constraints into the optimisation algorithm. For example, the limitations
    of irrigation system capacity and seasonal water availability can be considered
    in determining the appropriate volume and timing of irrigation future irrigation
    applications. The model predictive control strategy may produce the same optimal
    crop water use and yield for various distributions of water during the crop season.
    If more than one irrigation volume has the same performance, then a water-efficient
    approach could be taken by selecting the irrigation volume and timing with the
    lowest quantitative volume to achieve the optimal simulated performance. An alternate
    approach is to use grower-specific preferences for the irrigation distribution.
    For example, the grower may have a preference for using lower amounts of water
    early in the season to provide soil water capacity for rainfall during the season.
    Because model predictive control uses a model’s simulations to determine irrigation
    application, variables that are not directly measured (e.g. final crop yield and
    water use efficiency) may potentially be controlled and optimised. In contrast,
    the iterative learning and iterative hill climbing control strategies determine
    irrigation applications using measurements of soil and/or crop response to target
    the desired soil and/or crop response. The performance objective that the controller
    uses depends on the specific objectives of the grower/manager. Model predictive
    control could be robust to cells with data gaps by spatially interpolating the
    available measurements and using these measurements to calibrate the unknown model
    parameters. Because the model is calibrated over the crop season and not just
    from one measurement, model predictive control would not be susceptible to major
    instability. Conclusion Advanced process control is applicable to irrigation which
    has slow dynamics, even though it was developed for relatively fast mechanical
    and chemical processes. This control technique has the capability to deal with
    the complexities of managing the soil–plant–atmosphere system using a range of
    irrigation systems and configurations (i.e. either constant or site-specific irrigation
    with manual or automatic actuation). This has been demonstrated by identification
    of three advanced process control strategies and their application to irrigation:
    iterative learning control, iterative hill climbing control and model predictive
    control. Investigation of the sensor requirements for each control strategy should
    be conducted in the development and analysis of any advanced process control system
    for irrigation. Irrigation control strategies should have minimal sensor requirements
    to ensure the system is practical for growers and enhance the future uptake of
    the technology. Sensor availability is at present a constraint on the automation
    of irrigation control, and it is expected that the requirements of advanced process
    control for irrigation will also drive sensor development. Future research needs
    identified include control strategy development and field evaluation with different
    irrigation systems and field conditions. Notes Optimal control is used to derive
    differential equations which determine the control action to be taken at any time
    for a given system to achieve the desired optimality criterion (Burns 2001). The
    fundamental derivation approach for optimal control is the ‘calculus of variations’
    which finds the path, curve or surface (in the form of differential equations)
    for which a given function has a stationary value which corresponds to the maximum
    or minimum, as required. Evolutionary algorithms are inspired by the process of
    biological evolution and involve an iterative procedure whereby a population of
    trial solutions (irrigation application schemes) is evaluated and each solution
    is assigned a fitness that indicates the performance. The population is then evolved
    and a new generation of solutions is created from the solutions of the previous
    generation with the highest fitness (Filippidis et al. 1999). References Ahn HS,

  explanation: Intelligent irrigation systems (IIS) are the merging of IoT, artificial
    intelligence, communication technology, and automation into irrigation management
    systems to increase productivity and water conservation. These systems are breaking
    new ground in precision agriculture and sustainable farming, and they show great
    promise. This systematic review thoroughly examines the current state and future
    prospects of IoT-based IISs for greenhouses, with a particular emphasis on the
    efficient use of closed-loop control techniques, which are crucial for achieving
    the full potential of these systems. The review also highlights the need for more
    research on the integration of artificial intelligence algorithms, such as reinforcement
    learning and genetic algorithms, to optimize closed-loop control strategies and
    improve the overall performance of IISs.

    \ arises as a result of the rising population since population growth decreases\
    \ \nagricultural land, leading to water scarcity. Agriculture requires large amounts\
    \ of water, but water scarcity forces \nfarmers to irrigate their crops with little\
    \ or low-quality water, leading to the idea of developing smart irrigation. The\
    \ \nchallenge is how to manage the interactions between plants, growing media,\

    \ will minimize the occurrence of poor irrigation design. This \nreview is a way\

    \ Internet of Things, \nand artificial intelligence in irrigation systems with\
    \ a focus on improving water use efficiency. The study uses \nSCOPUS indexed publications\
    \ and proceedings to study the evolution of irrigation information technology\
    \ over the \nlast eleven years. We hope this review can serve as a source of information\

    \ internet of things, monitoring and control \n1 \nINTRODUCTION \nDue to rising\
    \ food demand and a growing human population, agriculture is the primary food\
    \ supplier and the most \nprominent labor user. It is also one of the essential\
    \ areas in a country's economy, according to gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) [1],\
    \ [2]. Water availability is an essential factor in optimizing the growth of crops\
    \ so that water \nscarcity can threaten food security. This reason makes water\
    \ conservation an essential factor in overcoming water \nshortages while increasing\
    \ yields. [3, 4]. Moreover, the development of agricultural technology and more\
    \ efficient \nagricultural management can produce productive crops and quality\
    \ harvests through greenhouse technology. \nDeveloping greenhouses for agriculture\
    \ can increase crop yields and improve water use efficiency [5].  \nAround 3.5%\
    \ of the world's agricultural land uses greenhouse and hydroponic systems to conserve\
    \ water use and \nother benefits such as crop protection and quality yields. A\
    \ greenhouse is a building with a wooden or metal \nfoundation covered with nets\
    \ or transparent material. Since 1960 the greenhouse has evolved from a building\
    \ that \nonly protects plants into a system for studying plant growth in a controlled\
    \ environment [6, 7]. Changes in \nagricultural land usage, lower irrigation water\
    \ output in primary, secondary, and tertiary canals, and global \nmicroclimate\
    \ changes contribute to the rising use of greenhouses in world agriculture [8].\
    \  \nAgricultural ecosystems (soil, nutrients, temperature, humidity, sunlight,\
    \ wind, and air composition) can be adapted \nto the needs of the plants planted\
    \ in greenhouses to extend productive plant life, change planting seasons, \n\
    increase crop yields and improve harvest quality. [9, 10]. Moving crops from their\
    \ natural environment to \ngreenhouses protect plants from weather and microclimate\
    \ uncertainties. On the downside, a greenhouse is a \nplace that can store solar\
    \ heat and requires resources to manage the microclimate according to plant needs,\
    \ \nespecially in countries with tropical climates. [4, 11]. Crop growth problems\
    \ arise in agriculture that depends on rain \nand drought; runoff and erosion\
    \ problems also arise during heavy rains. Water control is needed to meet crop\
    \ \nwater needs while conserving water [12]. The water control system functioned\
    \ as a regulator for water flow \naccording to the plant's needs in its growth\
    \ phase [13, 14]. \nConventional irrigation systems use a uniform amount of water\
    \ to fields from one corner to another during their \ngrowth period regardless\
    \ of the type of plant and its water needs. The result is water-wasting, where\
    \ one side of \nthe land has sufficient water, while the other can have excess\
    \ or lack of water [15]. Therefore, a control system \nknown as an intelligent\
    \ irrigation system is needed to support plants' water needs while saving water.\
    \ The way the \nsystem works, in general, is to adapt to the type of plant and\
    \ then automatically calculate the water needs of the \n657 \n \nIrfan Ardiansah,\

    \ are suitable for \nuse in a greenhouse because a greenhouse has an enclosed\
    \ structure to reduce or eliminate parameters affecting \nplant growth, such as\
    \ seasons, rainfall, climate change, plant pests and diseases, and environmental\
    \ changes [17, \n18]. \nIntelligent irrigation systems are part of precision agriculture,\
    \ also known as smart farming, which integrates \ninformation technology, communication\
    \ technology, and control technology to automate various agricultural \nactivities\
    \ that humans initially did. With an intelligent irrigation system, the irrigation\
    \ process can run optimally in \nmanaging water to meet the needs of plants [19].\
    \ Intelligent irrigation systems can manage water needs based on \nvarious parameters\
    \ such as microclimate conditions, weather, sunlight, water quality such as acidity\
    \ (pH), turbidity \n(TDS), and electrical conductivity (EC), along with plant\
    \ growth phases through the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. \nAn intelligent\
    \ irrigation system can improve irrigation decisions to achieve water savings\
    \ and increased yields [20–\n22]. \nThe intelligent irrigation system is one of\
    \ the best systems in managing and saving water while maximizing \nharvests; water\
    \ is distributed evenly to each plant according to its needs and minimizes wasted\
    \ water [23]. This \nsystem can also mix nutrients and water and help deliver\
    \ them directly to the root zone, ensuring it is always in \noptimal moist conditions,\
    \ minimizing surface runoff, preventing root rot, and eliminating percolation.\
    \ The advantage \nis increased crop productivity, and better harvest quality also\
    \ ensures optimal water efficiency. Nevertheless, good \nintegration between IoT\
    \ devices, monitoring, control, and data acquisition can be done automatically\
    \ with minimum \nintervention to get an optimal and efficient, intelligent irrigation\
    \ system [24, 25]. \nIn the intelligent irrigation system, the controller can\
    \ process input data, present information, and manage irrigation \nbased on greenhouse\
    \ conditions, especially crop conditions to prevent water deficit. Nevertheless,\
    \ in addition to \nsystem automation, it is necessary to present current and past\
    \ system conditions to users, both plant responses to \nthe system and vice versa.\
    \ This method ensures that water management runs smoothly, and users can study\
    \ \nhistorical data as a reference for the next planting period and ensure optimal\
    \ farming [26–29]. This process \nrequires real-time monitoring, sophisticated\
    \ control systems, and precise instruments. The difference between a \nmonitoring\
    \ system and a control system is that the control system regulates the hardware\
    \ according to conditional \nconstraints. The control system manages the hardware\
    \ and software by defining the output and input parameters \nprecisely. The input\
    \ is microclimate parameters, plant properties, weather conditions, water quality,\
    \ and other \nsensors collect helpful information [30–33]. \nMany articles published\
    \ on IoT focus on agriculture, as discussed by [30, 34]. IoT is one of the best\
    \ inventions of \nthe 21st century in agriculture. In addition, review articles\
    \  [21], [35] discuss IoT opportunities in agriculture or \nintelligent farming\
    \ and how the connection between IoT, data mining, data science, and machine learning\
    \ \nsustainability supports agriculture. [36] describes the automation model for\
    \ monitoring and controlling the \nagricultural sector and predicting information\
    \ based on past data. There are currently no review studies that explore \nthe\
    \ monitoring and control strategy of intelligent irrigation systems in greenhouses,\
    \ necessitating the formation of \nintelligent irrigation system review articles\
    \ that focus on integrating various monitoring and control materials. As a \n\
    result, this study will cover intelligent irrigation system monitoring and control\
    \ mechanisms and their relevance to \ngreenhouses and irrigation. \nThis study\
    \ aims to classify the results of previous research, identify the results, and\
    \ bridge them with future trends \nto identify future research. Chapter 2 discusses\
    \ research methodology, and Chapter 3 discusses various irrigation \nmethods used\
    \ by intelligent irrigation systems. In contrast, Chapter 4 discusses monitoring\
    \ and controlling \nstrategies for IoT and then continues to Chapter 5, discussing\
    \ the integration of artificial intelligence. The last \nchapter discusses future\
    \ directions and trends in intelligent irrigation. \n2 REVIEW METHODOLOGY \nThe\

    \ \npositions \n3 TYPES OF IRRIGATION \nPlants need water at regular intervals\
    \ to grow and develop; in agriculture, this watering technique is called \nirrigation.\
    \ Irrigation has two methods, namely conventional and modern. Conventional agriculture\
    \ usually uses rain \nand surface irrigation to irrigate its land [37, 38]. The\
    \ problem is how to predict rain accurately, and surface \nirrigation does not\
    \ continuously irrigate the entire land with a uniform discharge. Surface irrigation,\
    \ classified as \nconventional irrigation, works by distributing water from springs\
    \ or rivers to the ground surface following gravity; \nmonitoring is done manually\
    \ by looking at the water level without IoT and automation [37].  \nDeveloping\
    \ countries generally use surface irrigation, for example, Indonesia. It uses\
    \ it to irrigate paddy fields by \nconstructing furrows that connect water sources\
    \ with rice fields and irrigate them. However, this method requires a \nlevel\
    \ ground surface to ensure adequate water distribution [39]. On the other hand,\
    \ surface irrigation results in high \nlevels of water loss due to evaporation,\
    \ uncontrolled water discharge, and percolation, which can reduce soil \nnutrient\
    \ levels resulting in sub-optimal crop yields [37]. There are two commonly used\
    \ surface irrigations: (1) \nFurrow irrigation is interpreted as water flowing\
    \ through small furrows made on the land slope. Water enters the soil \nfrom the\
    \ bottom and sides of the furrow and moves laterally and downwards to moisten\
    \ the soil and simultaneously \ncarry dissolved salts, fertilizers, and herbicides\
    \ [40]. Good tillage with uniform slopes can give better results from \nthis method.\
    \ Furrow irrigation is suitable for various soils, slopes, and crops especially\
    \ row crops. Crops that will be \ndamaged if water covers the stems or crowns\
    \ should use furrow irrigation [40, 41]. Furrow irrigation is also suitable \n\
    for tree crops. In the early stages of tree planting, using one furrow beside\
    \ the tree row may be sufficient, but as the \ntree grows, creating two or more\
    \ new furrows is necessary to provide sufficient water [42]. (2) Flooding Irrigation\
    \ is \nan irrigation method commonly used to provide water in lowland rice cultivation\
    \ and generally, water carried out \ncontinuously. Flooding is carried out continuously\
    \ at the same height throughout plant growth, starting from planting \nuntil several\
    \ days before harvest [43]. The use of flooding irrigation depends on sufficient\
    \ water to flood the land \nsurface with 10 cm of water. The disadvantage is inhibiting\
    \ plant growth and water wastage [44]. Because flooding \nirrigation uses water\
    \ excessively, flooding irrigation evolved into intermittent irrigation by flooding\
    \ and drying the \nland alternately from planting season until one week before\
    \ the flowering. The water level is maintained at 3 to 5 \ncm during flowering.\
    \ Giving water this way can reduce water usage up to 30 percent without reducing\
    \ crop yields \n[43–45] \n Modern irrigation offers uniform discharge for each\
    \ plant, including nutrients and saving water, mainly when \nplanting is carried\
    \ out in a greenhouse, making it easier to monitor water quantity and quality\
    \ and regulate water \nsupply schedules [46, 47]. The amount of water delivered\
    \ is determined by the plant's demands, irrigation method, \nand type of growing\
    \ medium. The choice of irrigation method influences the type of nutrients, the\
    \ number of \nnutrients, the rate of infiltration, evaporation, water absorption,\
    \ and drainage [12]. \nModern irrigation uses less water and is more efficient\
    \ than conventional irrigation, and this method saves more \nenergy and water.\
    \ It is an effective method for use in areas where water is scarce or has irregular\
    \ rains. This \nmethod allows farmers to cultivate crops consistently, creating\
    \ a reliable food supply [3, 11]. Modern irrigation relies \non water from wells,\
    \ lakes, and reservoirs stored in water tanks and then irrigates plants using\
    \ gravity or water \npumps [12]. The method of giving water is even more specific,\
    \ such as spraying water through a sprinkler or \ndripping water through an emitter\
    \ onto plants. [39] developed an automatic irrigation data communication system\

    \ Radio Service (GPRS) and Zigbee module and built a microprocessor-based gateway\
    \ \nto better control water discharge with water efficiency than conventional\
    \ irrigation systems, with the difference \nbetween conventional and modern irrigation\
    \ can be seen in Figure 2. \n \nFig 2. Types of irrigation \n3.1 \nSprinkler Irrigation\
    \ \nFarmers use sprinkler irrigation to mimic precipitation patterns. They used\
    \ small sprinkler nozzles connected to an \nextensive piping system to ensure\
    \ comprehensive irrigation coverage and used pumps to spray high-pressure \nwater\
    \ onto the air [48]. The advantage of sprinkler is that it minimizes runoff, is\
    \ suitable for all types of soil, and has \na water-saving rate of between 30\
    \ - 50%. Sprinkles can be mixed with fertilizer solutions and used in close \n\
    cropping and high plant population [28]. However, this method has high operating\
    \ costs for cleaning sprinkler \nnozzles and maintaining high-pressure pumps and\
    \ pipes. In addition, sprinkler irrigation is unsuitable for use in \nwindy areas\
    \ because wind gusts and evapotranspiration cause high water loss rates. Moreover,\
    \ regular \nmaintenance of the pipes and their connections to avoid leaks or clogs\
    \ can reduce the water spray pressure, \nreducing water distribution to the plants\
    \ [37, 48]. \n3.2 \nDrip Irrigation \nIn drip irrigation, the water source moistens\
    \ the soil or planting media through the holes in the pipes and flows \nthrough\
    \ a hose connected to the emitter with low pressure. The focus of water droplets\
    \ is a small part of the soil or \ngrowing medium that covers the root zone by\
    \ adjusting it to get water droplets [49]. Drip irrigation is the most \nefficient\
    \ irrigation because it can distribute water and nutrients simultaneously to the\
    \ root zone, which results in \nbetter nutrient uptake. Due to the circulation\
    \ of water in the roots through the capillary principle, the pores of the \nsoil\
    \ or planting medium remain dry so that air circulation is maintained and soil\
    \ moisture is at field capacity. \nProduces a root zone capable of breathing more\
    \ intensely during its growth cycle [25, 37, 50]. \nDrip irrigation uses dripping\
    \ water delivered at a rate of between 2 - 20 liters per hour. The application\
    \ of this \nmethod is to place an emitter on each plant. It is suitable for use\
    \ on vegetables and fruit, but farmers usually only \nconsider high-value plants\
    \ because the investment value is relatively high [37, 49]. This method supports\
    \ various \ntypes of soil by adjusting the speed of water application. Hefty porous\
    \ sandy soils need a fast drip-rate; conversely, \nclay soil needs a slow drip\
    \ rate to avoid water logging and runoff [25, 37]. \n4 MONITORING AND CONTROLLING\
    \ STRATEGIES \nA total of 30 papers were used to examine the irrigation system's\
    \ monitoring and control method. These \npublications provide ways for regulating\
    \ irrigation by employing sensors to measure changes in microclimate, water \n\
    quality, and soil moisture values. The paper's distribution is represented in\
    \ Figure 3 below. \nAn effective and efficient monitoring system is needed to\
    \ collect different plant growth parameters. Monitoring in an \nintelligent irrigation\
    \ system involves collecting data representing the latest microclimate data and\
    \ water and soil \nconditions around the irrigation area through a microcontroller\
    \ connected to the IoT [51], shown in Figure 4. The \ndevelopment of real-time\
    \ monitoring devices was made possible due to the rapid development of microcontrollers\
    \ \nand sensors, low-cost hardware (Arduino UNO, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi), and fast\
    \ internet, which enhanced the \nperformance of monitoring and control systems\
    \ [17, 52]. There are two types of internet connections: wired and \nwireless;\
    \ Wired connections make the internet connection stable, but with fixed hardware\
    \ location. Wireless \nconnection makes flexible hardware placement but has signal\
    \ interference [53]. \n \n660 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An overview of IOT based\

    \ \n \n \n \nFig 3. Distribution of papers on monitoring and controlling strategies\
    \ \n \nFig 4. Block diagram of IoT based Smart Farming \nAll devices and sensors\
    \ are connected directly to the server via a cabling system in a wired connection\
    \ case. This \nsystem is only effective when a few parameters are measured and\
    \ use a small greenhouse; it is crucial because \nthe more connected devices,\
    \ the more cables are used. So, the wired greenhouse system is not suitable for\
    \ large \nor commercial greenhouses. The advantage is that data transactions are\
    \ safe and have minimal interference [51, \n53, 54]. WSN is the latest technology\
    \ in intelligent farming that can be expanded and scaled up without modifying\
    \ \nthe greenhouse infrastructure. Its wireless form makes it easy to receive\
    \ and transmit data between nodes using \nlow-power frequencies. Unfortunately,\
    \ interference and signal loss are common problems because of the high \nfrequency\
    \ in the air. However, the increase in greenhouse size, the number of parameters,\
    \ sensors variety, node \nsize, and devices distant is not a problem because an\
    \ additional WSN only needs to be attached to an existing \nnetwork. Another advantage\
    \ is Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) technology, wirelessly connected sensor nodes\
    \ \nnetwork to sense and send various data, and extensible [36, 54, 55]. \nThe\
    \ implementation of WSN in agriculture itself is extensive, with sensors, RFID,\
    \ cameras, drones, and cloud \nservices connected seamlessly for data acquisition\
    \ and transmission. Cloud computing serves data collection and \nanalysis to generate\
    \ visualizations, decision support, and commands; system users (farmers or researchers)\
    \ can \nthen access data remotely via their devices to gain real-time insights\
    \ [19, 56]. Thus, monitoring and controlling the \nintelligent irrigation system\
    \ can be effective, efficient, convenient, and optimal yields. [55] proposed the\
    \ approach \nwith WSN and gateway node to collect soil moisture values in plants\
    \ by taking soil and cultivated plants images. \nThe challenges in building a\
    \ system that can accommodate these two technologies are sensor coverage, \ncommunication\
    \ between devices, computational process efficiency, and electricity usage. [57]\
    \ also offers UAVs for \naerial monitoring of vegetation and irrigation areas.\
    \ \nAppropriate control techniques in intelligent irrigation systems can increase\
    \ crop water supply precisely to improve \nthe efficiency of water use, energy\
    \ savings, harvest optimization, proper use of nutrients, and effective use of\
    \ labor. \n11\n5\n14\n0\n5\n10\n15\nMicroclimate\nWater Quality\nSoil Moisture\n\

    \ systems for greenhouse: recent trends and \nchallenges \n \nJournal of Applied\
    \ Engineering Science- Vol.20, No 3, 2022 -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \nTherefore,\
    \ a control system can manipulate several irrigation parameters, like air circulation,\
    \ air temperature, \nrelative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation [58–60].\
    \ A technology that can analyze the surface temperature \nof agricultural land\
    \ without touching it using thermal imaging was proposed by [61] to determine\
    \ which areas of \nland are in dire need of water because the non-uniformity of\
    \ soil moisture can inhibit spinach growth. Studies by \n[56, 62–64] also state\
    \ that it is possible to use thermal imaging for nurseries, forecasting crop yields,\
    \ pest and \ndisease disturbances, maintenance of agricultural machinery, and\
    \ irrigation scheduling. \n4.1 \nMicroclimate based  \nMonitoring and controlling\
    \ the microclimate in the greenhouse is a critical factor to account for water\
    \ loss due to \nevaporation. Air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation,\
    \ and wind speed need precision measurements to \nmeet crop water requirements\
    \ [30, 65]. The Raspberry Pi, various Arduino models, connected to WSN, and cloud\
    \ \nservers are popular hardware. WSN implementation is an efficient way to interconnect\
    \ various sensors placed far \napart in the greenhouse. The system performs accurate\
    \ system monitoring, collects data, and presents charts, and \ncontrol devices\
    \ are activated, referring to predefined threshold values compared with real-time\
    \ data [30, 36, 66]. \n[59] presented a technique for evaluating microclimate\
    \ parameters in two tropical greenhouses before planting \ntomatoes using LoRa\
    \ wireless and IoT sensors. The comfort ratio model (CftM) and scenario analysis\
    \ show that \nenvironmental conditions can adapt to the growth phase of tomato\
    \ plants. The microclimate before and during \nplanting was analyzed using the\
    \ Simulink app. Also, a study by [67] showed that a microclimate parameter \n\
    measurement device in a greenhouse could yield comprehensive data for temperature,\
    \ humidity, CO2 levels, \nlighting levels, soil moisture, acidity, irrigation\
    \ water conductivity, and airflow velocity. In winter, the greenhouse \nbehavior\
    \ was studied by [68] using fuzzy logic control (FLC) due to uncertainty in the\
    \ greenhouse environment. The \nfuzzy set was developed based on experts in greenhouse\
    \ thermal behavior. Fuzzy control manages decisions \nbased on weather forecasts\
    \ and user interactions. [54] also took a similar approach to measure leaf temperature,\
    \ \nair temperature, and soil moisture using three connected sensors to assess\
    \ the level of microclimate in a \ngreenhouse and use Zigbee to transmit sensor\
    \ data. \nControlling the microclimate in the greenhouse by using fan ventilation\
    \ and fan-pad ventilation can also be an \noption. This forced ventilation can\
    \ prevent plants from overheating even if the greenhouse does not use an \nevaporative\
    \ cooling system. Greenhouses can produce good harvests in the spring, and the\
    \ data show a \nrelationship between the greenhouse microclimate and water uptake\
    \ that minimizes drainage [69]. [70] built a \nmonitoring system using an open-source\
    \ platform to collect microclimate variables (air temperature, humidity, soil\
    \ \ntemperature, and soil moisture). Communication between devices uses Bluetooth\
    \ and obtain electricity supply \nthrough solar panels. [71] has proposed improvements\
    \ to the greenhouse IoT-based system by adding color \nspectrum monitoring using\
    \ a camera system to get photos of the plant canopies translated into color (RGB,\
    \ HSL, \nand brightness), plant texture, thermal (plant temperature), and plant\
    \ morphology. The system works with NFT to \nirrigate lettuce plants in the greenhouse,\
    \ automatically recording data and identifying plant stress levels. \n4.2 \nWater\
    \ Quality-based \nWater quality safety is a challenge in the 21st century because\
    \ of the many pollutants, which are predominantly \nartificial such as environmental\
    \ damage, packaging waste, or chemical waste. Overexploitation of natural \nresources,\
    \ rapid industrial development, and agricultural expansion are the leading causes\
    \ of the problem. [72]. \nWater quality is affected by direct and indirect sources\
    \ of pollution such as sewage, factory waste, agricultural and \nurban runoff.\
    \ The need for human involvement in water quality management is essential [73,\
    \ 74]. Water quality \nmanagement is a way to regularly collect water quality\
    \ information in a location to find out its current condition. \nWater quality\
    \ management aims to measure water quality variables such as microbial content\
    \ physical and \nchemical properties, provide an early warning system and provide\
    \ decision support for further treatment [75, 76]. \nWSN and IoT are inevitable\
    \ to manage variables over a wide area for larger areas such as lakes or oceans.\
    \ \n[75] has proposed a system that assesses irrigation water quality with IoT\
    \ by detecting potential hydrogen (pH), \nelectrical conductivity (EC), turbidity,\
    \ and salinity in real-time using different sensors to maintain plant health status.\
    \ \nAlso, [77] undertook a study to build a continuous water quality monitoring\
    \ system using open-source hardware \nand low-cost sensors. Preliminary results\
    \ show that the device can produce accurate results at a lower cost than \nexisting\
    \ technologies with proper calibration. \n4.3 \nSoil Moisture-based \nFarmers\
    \ need to consider soil conditions because moist soil means the plant still has\
    \ enough water for growth [11]. \nMonitoring soil moisture content becomes vital\
    \ as the basis for irrigation scheduling. Raspberry Pi and Arduino \nUNO have\
    \ commonly used devices in developing low-cost IoT-based soil moisture management\
    \ interfaced using \nvarious sensors [30, 60, 75]. The sensor used is a capacitive\
    \ type and transmits electricity without conduction; it \ncan measure soil moisture\
    \ changes by planting them into the soil and measuring its volumetric water content.\
    \ The \nTime Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensor is a more precise option for measuring\
    \ soil moisture, consisting of two \nmetal rods embedded at the depth at which\
    \ the humidity is to be measured. Works by sending pulses to the soil \nand then\
    \ calculating the response of the soil as soil moisture content. Due to its good\
    \ quality in measuring soil \nmoisture, this TDR sensor is quite expensive to\
    \ use in large-scale greenhouses [78, 79]. \n662 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An\
    \ overview of IOT based intelligent irrigation systems for greenhouse: recent\
    \ trends \nand challenges \n \nJournal of Applied Engineering Science - Vol.20,\
    \ No 3, 2022 - www.engineeringscience.rs \n \n \n[80] proposed a soil moisture\
    \ control system for measuring water content in soil at different soil depths,\
    \ soil types, \nand air temperatures using various sensors integrated with Arduino\
    \ UNO. The ESP8266 wireless module is then \nlinked to the Arduino to upload data\
    \ to the cloud server. A similar study by [81] succeeded in developing an IoT-\n\
    based field control system integrated with cloud-based data monitoring and analysis.\
    \ The analysis results help \npredict water consumption for better crop yields.\
    \ [82] approach to controlling soil moisture uses wireless technology \nutilizing\
    \ GSM networks and push notifications to automate water supply for plants. A system\
    \ proposed by [83] \npresents an Android application-based humidity monitoring\
    \ method, where an Arduino interface sensor connected \nto Wi-Fi sends state data\
    \ to a smartphone. Another monitoring approach is carried out by [60] using IoT\
    \ and soil \nnutrient sensors to detect nutrient adequacy for plants. The decision\
    \ support system then receives the data \nparameters and processes them as a farming\
    \ decision. \n[84] implemented a user-friendly system, representing the soil moisture\
    \ level with colors. These colors have helped \nfarmers visually identify and\
    \ manage soil moisture content without understanding the values displayed. Likewise,\
    \ \n[85] proposed a soil nutrient control system that can manage the concentration\
    \ of nutrients in the soil by planting \nsensors in the soil to map nutrient variability.\
    \ Also, [86] developed an innovative device that uses a camera-\nintegrated drone\
    \ for field mapping. Images are analyzed to generate soil moisture and nutrient\
    \ values and use \nthem for irrigation planning and scheduling. \n5 ARTIFICIAL\
    \ INTELLIGENCE IN IRRIGATION SYSTEM \nArtificial intelligence in intelligent irrigation\
    \ systems was the subject of 25 papers. These studies concentrate on \ndeveloping\
    \ decision support systems, fuzzy logic models, and artificial neural network\
    \ models that can take \ndecisions automatically in response to changes in field\
    \ conditions. The distribution of articles based on the theme \nof artificial\

    \ of machine learning is due to more and more data generated by various \napplications\
    \ and IoT. The system can generate helpful information for making decisions or\
    \ becoming input to other \nsystems by studying data patterns. The need for agricultural\
    \ products is directly proportional to the increase in the \nearth's population,\
    \ so agroindustry and innovative agriculture technology get the spotlight in the\
    \ industrial revolution \n4.0 [16, 46].  \nAI has the potential to solve nonlinear,\
    \ multiparameter, and time-varying problems in managing intelligent irrigation\
    \ \nsystems. By applying AI algorithms to specific problem areas, the system tries\
    \ to imitate human logic, thought \nprocesses, and decision making through the\
    \ application of Fuzzy Logic, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest \nNeighbor\
    \ (kNN), Decision Tree and Random Forest by using past data to feed AI and provides\
    \ new knowledge to \nthe system [58, 61]. [88] has researched by applying different\
    \ regression and machine learning algorithms to \nseveral sensor datasets to develop\
    \ weekly irrigation plan predictions. \nA study implementing an intelligent irrigation\
    \ system shows many advantages, such as minimizing soil stress to \nchanging microclimate\
    \ conditions, efficient water use, and reducing human interaction. This solar\
    \ panel-powered \nsystem has a Sensor Layer, Central Layer, and Valve Layer running\
    \ together. The function of the Central Layer is \nto control the process that\
    \ produces input (sensor layer detects moisture content) and output (valve layer\
    \ opens to \nprovide water). The system also enables fertilizers and pesticides\
    \ by calibrating other sensors according to the \nrequired input [89]. \n5.1 \n\
    Decision Support System \nWater management for irrigation requires extensive and\

    \ -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \nmake irrigation management decisions; this is\
    \ where the decision support system (DSS) comes in [76, 90]. DSS \nhas a framework\
    \ that can represent complex systems with an efficient and robust approach that\
    \ is easy to \nunderstand generates additional information and new perspectives\
    \ to improve the quality of irrigation management. \nDSS is an information system\
    \ that analyzes data and represents it to make decisions quickly. The primary\
    \ purpose \nof DSS is to support and improve decision-making [28, 76]. Figure\
    \ 6 shows a DSS logic diagram that consists of \nfour connected components: Database,\
    \ model base, knowledge base, and user interface. \n \nFig 6. Block diagram of\
    \ Decision Support System \nThe Database in irrigation DSS collects and manages\
    \ air temperature, relative humidity, crop water requirements, \nirrigation records,\
    \ and solar radiation. The knowledge base has three parts: fact base, rule base,\
    \ and inference \nengine used to analyze data, solve uncertain problems and draw\
    \ conclusions. The model base creates optimization \nmodels, integrates numerous\
    \ decision models, analyzes them to create crop water simulations, and offers\
    \ farmers \nirrigation scheduling. [71, 76]. \nDeveloping and utilizing a decision\
    \ support system in irrigation management is essential for scheduling water \n\
    delivery based on crop needs. The main problem is how moist the soil is and how\
    \ much water the plants need \nbased on the type of plant, planting technique,\
    \ availability of water, amount of fertilizer applied, microclimate \nconditions,\
    \ and stage of plant development [91]. With DSS, farmers can manage their farms\
    \ daily using plant \ndatabases and water supply strategies to perform irrigation\
    \ calculations and fertilization adjustments to obtain \noptimal yields. There\
    \ are times when a system has a crop suggestion feature that advises farmers to\
    \ plant a crop \nthat yields the highest profit under certain constraints [92].\
    \ \nThe problem is that the characteristics of crops, soils, and microclimatic\
    \ conditions in agriculture are dynamic and \nnot linear, varying with seasons.\
    \ Therefore, setting the proper irrigation schedule will directly influence plant\
    \ growth. \nThe core of DSS includes monitoring different parameters using different\
    \ sensors and configuring their rules. DSS \nmanages sensor readings stored in\
    \ the cloud to adjust irrigation scheduling to maintain irrigation system efficiency\
    \ \nroutinely [76, 90]. An intelligent irrigation DSS must have the ability to\
    \ adapt to changes in transient and spatial \nplant dynamics, such as uncertainties\
    \ in microclimate conditions, nutrient requirements, and environmental \nchanges.\
    \ Researchers have proposed many studies on DSS applied to irrigation systems,\
    \ such as [93], who \ndeveloped an automated irrigation system using a single\
    \ lateral pipe covering a large area to manage water at \nvarying speeds. \nSprinkler\
    \ irrigation developed by [94] uses an automatic linear moving sprinkler system\
    \ with WSN based DSS. The \nsystem can adapt to crop types, irrigation requirements,\
    \ and planting locations to command individual sprinkler \nheads how and where\
    \ water must be applied. Similarly, [76] built a DSS integrated fertigation simulator\
    \ for \ndesigning drip or sprinkler irrigation for on-site olives and grapes farms.\
    \ The system has a database, simulation \nmodel, and user interface that shows\
    \ the ranking of design alternatives through multicriteria decision-making \n\
    (MCDM). The scope of the calculation of this system includes land analysis, water\
    \ requirements, and plant \nnutrition. \n664 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An overview\

    \ - www.engineeringscience.rs \n \n \n5.2 \nFuzzy Logic Model \nA fuzzy logic\
    \ model is a data-driven technique with easy-to-understand logical rules. [50,\
    \ 68, 95] proposed a fuzzy \nlogic-based irrigation scheduling by enforcing control\
    \ rules to microclimate data, evaporation data, and soil \nconditions. The process\
    \ flow can be seen in Figure 7. \n[96] succeeded in building and testing a rule-based\
    \ Fuzzy Logic application to assess the water stress index of \nplants in a greenhouse;\
    \ the application accepts three input variables, namely air temperature, solar\
    \ radiation, and \nwater pressure. Results show that Fuzzy Logic eliminates the\
    \ need for air aerodynamic resistance data, making \nthis system more straightforward.\
    \ \n[95] developed fuzzy logic using the LabVIEW application to create a graphical\
    \ user interface (GUI) for a drip \nirrigation control system in a greenhouse.\
    \ The input parameters used are air temperature and soil moisture and \nprocess\
    \ them using fuzzy rules to produce information of irrigation duration. The test\
    \ results show that fuzzy logic \ncontrol can efficiently estimate irrigation\
    \ schedules in an automated system, and greenhouse managers can \nmonitor real-time\
    \ data and devices that are easy to manage, even for ordinary users. [97] research\
    \ also designed \nan irrigation control based on fuzzy logic applying the Penman-Monteith\
    \ equation for rice cultivation with a \nparameter model in the difference between\
    \ actual and target evapotranspiration following the plant growth phase. \nEach\
    \ phase has its water requirement. The research aims to develop an intelligent\
    \ system that helps irrigation \nmanagement and produces a system that can work\
    \ better than conventional irrigation systems. The results showed \nthat the control\
    \ system saves water, improves irrigation performance, improves crop quality,\
    \ and saves labor.  \n \nFig 7. Fuzzy Logic-based Intelligent Irrigation System\
    \ \nAlso, [50] developed a fuzzy logic system that evaluates the irrigation system\
    \ based on the variable availability of \nirrigation water during the planting\
    \ period on the level of farmers' income which results in the efficiency of the\
    \ \nirrigation system performance. To assist in making decisions on irrigation\
    \ distribution. [98] conducted similar \nresearch by developing an intelligent\
    \ irrigation system to turn on and off the irrigation system using input \nparameters\
    \ of water use, water and air temperature, and soil moisture. They implement WSN-based\
    \ monitoring to \nsend data on fuzzy logic, which then performs irrigation scheduling\
    \ by applying fuzzy rules. The system can \nmaintain soil moisture content at\
    \ the specified limit to save the use of electrical energy, water, and runoff.\
    \ \n5.3 \nArtificial Neural Network Model \nOne application of AI in agriculture\
    \ is Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) algorithms, which can predict using elements\
    \ \ninterconnected and work in parallel. The advantage of neural networks is that\
    \ they can be trained, for example, to \ndistinguish grass from rice or to compare\
    \ tomatoes to peppers [71]. The ANN system can predict with high \naccuracy when\
    \ fed reliable and precise data. A trained ANN is considered an expert in a category\
    \ of data. This \nexpert can then predict possible future conditions and prepare\
    \ what-if scenarios [73, 87]. Other advantages of ANN \nare (1) Adaptive learning,\
    \ the ability to learn and carry out tasks based on the data provided, (2) Self-organization,\
    \ \nthe system can independently compile and build information representations\
    \ during the learning process, and (3) \nReal-time operations, computations are\
    \ carried out in parallel, so it is faster to get calculation results [99]. \n\
    The ANN model is a simple model consisting of three primary neurons distributed\
    \ in the input layer, multiples of the \nhidden layer, and the output layer. ANN\
    \ development requires necessary basic steps, namely datasets, ANN \nmodel training\
    \ data, and ANN model test data for evaluation. Using quality data, the ANN model\
    \ has a mechanism \nfor self-study and solving complex problems. Input neurons\
    \ receive parameters, then hidden neurons perform \n665 \n \nIrfan Ardiansah,\
    \ et al. - An overview of IOT based intelligent irrigation systems for greenhouse:\
    \ recent trends and \nchallenges \n \nJournal of Applied Engineering Science-\
    \ Vol.20, No 3, 2022 -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \ncomputations, and output\
    \ neurons send signals to other network layers; and interconnect neurons using\
    \ linear and \nnonlinear functions [26, 87, 99, 100]. \nThe following Figure 8\
    \ shows the ANN process flow. In general, the use of ANN includes problem-solving\
    \ in system \noptimization, process control, pattern classification, forecasting,\
    \ and prediction. The main components of an ANN \nmodel consist of neuron nodes,\
    \ a hidden layer containing weights between parameters and distribution rules\
    \ to \ngenerate information for learning rules and independent learning skills\
    \ through experience. There are two types of \nANN models based on their input\
    \ choices: feed-forward and feed-backward networks [99]. \n \nFig 8. The flow\
    \ of feed-forward artificial neurons \nEvapotranspiration is essential information\
    \ that needs to be known to optimize plant growth, especially in water \nmanagement\
    \ and sustainable irrigation systems. Knowledge of the parameters of air temperature,\
    \ relative \nhumidity, wind speed, hours of sunshine, and latitude can optimize\
    \ the management of ET0 in a greenhouse [97]. \nANN research on intelligent irrigation\
    \ systems is applied to scheduling and irrigation discharge to achieve savings\
    \ \nin irrigation water use. [87] conducted a study to estimate the value of soil\
    \ moisture in rice farming land using \nminimal micro and macro climate data by\
    \ applying two ANN models. The first model predicts the value of ET0 \nusing the\
    \ minimum, maximum and average air temperature variables. The second model does\
    \ the same thing but \nuses air temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation.\
    \ The test results show that both models produce reliable and \naccurate soil\
    \ moisture estimates. \nA study by [101] has developed an ANN model to calculate\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET0). After testing, they concluded \nthat the ANN model\
    \ predicts evapotranspiration better than the conventional ET0 equation. Similarly,\
    \ [90] \ndeveloped an ANN to calculate ET0 and compared it with the Penman-FAO\
    \ equation and Penman-Monteith model \nusing four and six microclimate variables\
    \ as inputs. The test indicates that the three models provide accurate \nresults\
    \ using six input parameters. In contrast, the test results with four parameters\
    \ show that only the ANN model \ncan accurately predict the ET0 value. This research\
    \ shows that building an ANN model is possible even with limited \nmicroclimate\
    \ data.  \nIn addition, irrigation control system automation was also proposed\
    \ by [102] using the ANN cluster and closed-loop \ncontrol, which resulted in\
    \ better performance than time-based irrigation control. However, they did not\
    \ provide \ninformation regarding the irrigation method used and the percentage\
    \ of water savings. [100] developed an \nintelligent irrigation system for evapotranspiration\
    \ using the ANN model and a photovoltaic system to predict \nirrigation scheduling\
    \ based on cropping moisture distribution data; this study reported better daily\
    \ water and \nelectrical energy savings also better crop yields. The application\
    \ of ANN in irrigation water management has also \ndiscussed prediction of water\
    \ salinity, water quality, rain runoff, and forecasting of surface irrigation\
    \ infiltration,  \n[73] proposed two ANN models to predict Biochemical Oxygen\
    \ Demand (BOD) and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) for \nirrigation water originating from\
    \ rivers; the conclusion is that water quality management in other areas can also\
    \ use \nthis ANN model. Similarly, [103] uses the ANN model to design an intelligent\
    \ system to manage water systems for \nagriculture and fisheries. [104] explained\
    \ that the greenhouse environment has dynamic and complex \ncharacteristics, making\
    \ it difficult to use conventional control methods as a solution. Radial Basis\
    \ Function Neural \nNetworks (RBF) algorithm and nonlinear adaptive controllers\
    \ become solutions to control greenhouse microclimate. \n[74] discusses the use\
    \ of ANN in drip irrigation systems to predict the distribution of subsurface\
    \ irrigation water. \nThe development of the ANN is to model the continuous wetting\
    \ pattern after the water droplets from the emitter \ntouch the ground surface.\
    \ \n6 FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES \nThis review explored the various studies\
    \ and progress to improve irrigation water use efficiency, nutrient \noptimization,\
    \ and crop yields. The aim is to improve and increase food availability by implementing\
    \ IoT-based \nmonitoring and control on agricultural land, especially greenhouses.\

    \ of the latest IoT technologies for environmental conditions monitoring, data-driven\
    \ \ncontrol, and artificial intelligence. Nowadays, there is an increase in research\
    \ that develops techniques and models \nfor developing irrigation control systems.\
    \ The trend is due to the emergence of various sensors and controls on the \n\
    market; this provides vast opportunities for the development of precision agriculture,\
    \ especially for making \nintelligent predictions of agricultural processes such\
    \ as crop yields, crop water requirements, and microclimate \nconditions. Researchers\
    \ also need to explore other factors that influence irrigation scheduling planning,\
    \ especially \nin large agricultural areas, because researchers generally conduct\
    \ studies on a laboratory scale. Research from \ndifferent perspectives will enrich\
    \ intelligent irrigation systems and result in inaccurate predictions that can\
    \ advise \nfarmers regarding their farming activities and notify them when anomalies\
    \ occur. \nFurthermore, researchers need to test various control systems in the\
    \ irrigation systems discussed, focus on \nadaptive control, and combine it with\
    \ real-time monitoring. It is essential to build systems that can adapt to dynamic\
    \ \nparameters of microclimate, soil, and plant. At the same time, ensure the\
    \ intelligent irrigation system runs optimally. \nIn addition, it is essential\
    \ to develop intelligent irrigation systems that are increasingly complex and\
    \ digital-based so \nthat the technology is suitable, affordable, and stable for\
    \ smallholders. The hope is to increase water use efficiency \nand solve water\
    \ scarcity. \n7 CONCLUSION \nLimited water has become the biggest challenge for\
    \ farmers, and efficiency must solve water scarcity in irrigation \nmanagement.\
    \ The main objective is to control the amount and frequency of irrigation so that\
    \ the amount of water \nreceived by plants is sufficient to keep the root zone\
    \ moist. Farmers who are generally ignorant about the \ncomplexity of optimal\
    \ irrigation management need a system that can facilitate big data processing\
    \ analysis tools \nand transmit quality information quickly and efficiently. The\
    \ system must be able to provide recommendations \naccording to the conditions\
    \ of the agricultural environment to increase the experience and decision-making\
    \ of \nfarmers. \nThis problem challenges researchers to increase efforts to develop\
    \ sophisticated monitoring and control strategies \nfor intelligent farming that\
    \ minimize irrigation water use. This review draws on previous relevant studies\
    \ on \nagriculture water saving. The review results describe research trends in\
    \ intelligent irrigation systems monitoring \nand control strategies and assess\
    \ research opportunities to ensure water availability and savings. We hope this\
    \ \nreview provides insight and inspiration for researchers to continue research\
    \ on irrigation monitoring and control to \nachieve food security and water savings.\

    Warm-thermistor sensors are useful for making measurements of flow and the thermal
    properties of materials. This paper describes a log-antilog analog control circuit
    capable of monitoring a thermistor''s internal temperature in both ambient temperature
    sensing mode and self-heating mode, while maintaining infinite precision, wide
    dynamic range and fast sensor response. A single self-referencing thermistor is
    used to avoid the problems associated with having to match a thermistor pair in
    order to obtain an over-temperature signal. Instead, thermistor power levels are
    switched over a range of 1:1000, allowing measurement of both ambient temperature
    and heated thermistor temperature during the rise and fall of the heat pulse by
    a single thermistor at the center of the heat field. This provides a sensitive
    measurement of the thermal diffusivity and advective properties of the surrounding
    medium. In this paper, such a sensor is used to investigate the thermal properties
    of a grapevine cane under conditions of irrigation stress. Published in: IEEE

    Publisher: IEEE SECTION I. Introduction Climate change predictions and current
    drought conditions in many of the world''s irrigation districts have highlighted
    the need to improve the matching between water input and crop water requirements.
    Historically, evapotranspiration and soil moisture monitoring have allowed irrigators
    to apply sufficient water to maintain soil moisture levels within a range suitable
    for plant growth. Potential evaporation (\mbi{ET} _{\bf 0} ) measurements – based
    on weather station data or the Class-A evaporation pan – have provided broad estimates
    of crop water use that must be corrected for all sorts of local factors, such
    as crop canopy size, site aspect, soil properties, and so forth. Soil moisture
    monitoring sensors have provided more localized information about changes in soil
    water content or tension in a crop''s root zone. They are, however, only a surrogate
    measurement for determining how much water is transpired by the crop, as distinct
    from water lost through surface evaporation, runoff, and deep drainage. Water
    used by a crop passes from the root system to the plant canopy through vertically
    conductive “xylem” tissue that surrounds the plant stem''s inner core. Intuitively
    then, sap flow measurements should be an important irrigation scheduling tool.
    Three “thermal tracer” methods are available for the measurement of sap flow in
    plant stems and have been reviewed by Smith and Allen [13]; the stem heat balance,
    heat pulse velocity, and thermal diffusion methods. Heat pulse probes [16] and
    thermal diffusion sensors [4] “wound” the conducting plant tissue by drilling
    radially through the sap-conducting vessels in order to insert the necessary heater
    and temperature sensors. Heat-balance sap flow sensors (e.g., [1]) do not wound
    the plant, but their rigid “wraparound” casings require selection of a gauge to
    match a particular stem size. Helfter et al. [6] went beyond expensive laboratory-based
    magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to find an alternate method of noninvasive
    measurements of sap flow. These authors – working on potted broadleaf saplings
    – used a heat-pulse technique based upon a 0.5 W 812 nm-wavelength laser to heat
    the stem surface and an IR camera as the noncontact thermometric probe. Despite
    the effort that scientists have put into the measurement of transpiration in whole
    plants, sap flow sensors have failed to become a standard tool for irrigation
    scheduling, which still relies heavily upon climate and soil moisture measurements
    rather than plant-based measurements. Loveys et al. [8] pointed out that – in
    grapevines at least – the adaptive control mechanisms that plants use to regulate
    their internal water balance mask irrigation stress by regulating transpiration
    (sap flow). The authors suggested that a far better indicator of plant water status
    is predawn leaf water potential (units: -MPa). However, this is most commonly
    measured by manual “pressure chamber” technology [17] that requires the operator
    to collect and analyze leaf samples in a sealed pressure chamber during the predawn
    hours when sap flow has ceased and the vine''s water status has equilibrated.
    Continuous nondestructive measurements of plant water status have been investigated
    by Klepper et al. [7] using LVDT dendrometers to measure stem size, which decreases
    as the vascular portions of the stem collapse under increasing internal water
    stress and declining stem tissue hydration. Peñuelas et al. [12] examined the
    reflectance from leaves in the 950–970 nm region as an indicator of plant water
    status. Gullo and Salleo [5] detected xylem cavitation and formation of embolisms
    by counting ultrasound (100–300 kHz) acoustic emissions as a continuous measure
    of plant stress. Loveys et al. [8] carried out field work on grapevines to access
    the efficacy of plant-based measurements as an indicator of irrigation requirements.
    Included in these trials were measurements of stomatal conductance (porometry),
    stem diameter, heat-pulse sap flow sensors, leaf and canopy temperatures, and
    miniature thermocouple psychrometers for the measurement of leaf water potential.

    in a one-year old grapevine cane. The SMD heater thermistor is the second from
    the bottom. The other three SMD thermistors monitor heat conduction and convection
    in the stem via the heat-pulse method. Later versions of this sensor were wrapped
    in Teflon tape to prevent electrical conduction through the watery tissue. Thermal
    contact was poor, however, and the device lacked adequate sensitivity. Show All
    None of these sensors have reached commercial irrigators in the form of affordable
    and rugged instrumentation, even though the need for such sensors is becoming
    increasingly vital in the management of dwindling water resources. This paper
    describes the use of low-cost thermistor technology as a means of learning something
    about plant water status once sap flow has ceased. Initial research centered on
    the use of surface-mounted SMD thermistor sensors for both heat-pulse sap flow
    monitoring and thermal diffusivity measurements as a surrogate for plant water
    status measurements. These PCB-mounted sensors (Fig. 1) were placed upon the green
    cane tissue of a grapevine to avoid the wound responses of insertion-type sensors
    described by Barrett et al. [2]. However, poor thermal contact resulted in inadequate
    sensitivity of these devices, although there was a positive correlation between
    the heating pulse response and plant water status. This paper describes the electronic
    control circuitry necessary to implement plant water status monitoring based upon
    a single glass-rod thermistor inserted coaxially into the central pith at the
    base of an excised lateral shoot of a grapevine (Figs. 2 and 3). This avoids the
    destruction of local sap conducting (xylem) tissue, while still allowing access
    to plant water status. A point-source constant-energy heat pulse was injected
    by the thermistor into the surrounding sap-conducting vessels and the rate of
    temperature change – dependent upon the thermal diffusivity of the woody-sap matrix
    – was studied during the onset of irrigation stress. Fig. 2. Cross section of
    a one-year old grapevine cane. The vascular system is organized into the water-conducting
    xylem tissue (pale green) on the inside around the central pith (white), and the
    phloem tissue (dark green-gray) towards the outside, which returns food and organic
    material from the canopy to the plant stem and root systems. Show All Fig. 3.
    A glass-rod thermistor (inset), operating as a constant-power single-point heat
    source, acts as a thermal diffusion sensor to measure grapevine water status.
    It is shown inserted into the central pith of a grapevine lateral that has been
    sliced off to allow access to the plant''s vascular system. The stub-end self-heals
    to reseal the xylem tissue around the butt-end of the glass-rod thermistor. Show
    All The thermistor control circuit – described herein in use as a thermal diffusion
    sensor – is of general interest to sensor engineers, as it is capable of monitoring
    sensor temperature in both ambient-sensing and self-heating mode. The use of analog
    circuitry provides the necessary precision and fast response, and this constant-power
    thermistor bridge provides generic circuitry valuable in other thermistor sensor
    applications such as very slow flow monitoring. SECTION II. Warm-Thermistor Control
    Circuits A. Limitations of Two- and Three-Thermistor Analog Bridge Control Circuits
    Thermistor temperature sensors have the advantage of rugged construction, inherently
    high resistance (simplifying measurement), and a resistance sensitivity to temperature
    an order of magnitude higher than metal temperature sensors. The hermetic glass
    encapsulation found in glass rod thermistors provides excellent sealing against
    water ingress. Historically, warm-thermistor sensors have been used by various
    authors to tackle the problem of continuous measurement of flow rates in open
    water bodies or closed pipe systems. The self-heated thermistor dissipates heat
    into the flow stream, and the control circuit adjusts the power level (the output
    signal) to maintain a set over-temperature condition with respect to the ambient
    fluid temperature. Many of these historical analog flow meter control circuit
    designs – Riedl and Machan [14], LaBarbera and Vogel [9], Briggs–Smith et al.
    [3], MacIntyre [10], and Yang et al. [18] – attempted to monitor and correct for
    ambient fluid temperature variations by inserting one or more extra thermistors
    into a bridge circuit. However, NTC (negative temperature coefficient) thermistors
    are more difficult to use than linear resistance elements (such as tungsten hot-wire
    anemometers) in a standard bridge circuit because of the thermistor''s high degree
    of nonlinearity (Fig. 4) described by the Steinhart–Hart equation [15] T(^{\circ}
    {\rm C}) = {1 \over {a + b\ln (R) + c\ln {{(R)}^{3}}}} - 273.15 \eqno{\hbox{(1)}}

    coefficients used in converting thermistor resistance \mbi{R} (in ohms) to temperature

    conversion from temperature to resistance uses the same coefficients \mbi{a} ,

    View Source Fig. 4. Resistance versus temperature response of a 1 {\rm k}\Omega
    @25°C NTC thermistor measured with a 10 \mu {\rm A} excitation current. Show All
    In these early warm-thermistor analog bridge circuits, a low-resistance thermistor
    was self-heated in 1/2 of the bridge. Higher resistance (and therefore non self-heating)
    thermistors were used in the opposite half of the bridge to compensate for changes
    in ambient temperature, and to force a constant over-temperature condition \mbi{\Delta}
    \mbi{T} upon the warm thermistor. Some measure of the bridge''s power dissipation
    \mbi{P} was used to determine flow velocity \mbi{v} . These analog bridges all
    suffered from a limited operating temperature range, imposed by the necessity
    of matching two thermistors having different material curves and essentially operating
    at different temperatures and at different locations in the flow stream. These
    various bridge circuits were based on the original Riedl–Machan bridge (Fig. 5),
    which used three-thermistors in an attempt to extend the operating temperature
    range. While later designs (e.g., [10]) returned to simpler two-thermistor bridges,
    it is difficult to reduce error levels in such thermistor analog bridges to below
    0.1°C, even over a limited temperature range of approximately 30°C. A single thermistor
    sensor, on the other hand, is inherently self-referencing, and is far simpler
    to use as a point-source heater and temperature sensor over a broader temperature
    range in thermal diffusion and fluid flow applications. However, a more sophisticated
    control circuit is needed to output the thermistor''s temperature during both
    ambient and self-heating mode; such a circuit would then need a single temperature
    calibration. The ability of the circuit to monitor the rate of background temperature
    drift prior to the heated temperature measurement makes it possible to extract
    this small temperature drift error term from the change in the heated temperature
    signal over the interval during which the heat field is generated and measured.
    Fig. 5. The Reidl–Machan [14] Thermistor Bridge Flowmeter. These early flow-monitoring
    bridge circuits were always in self-heating mode, and were unable to report on
    the temperature of either the water or the heated thermistor. Instead, their output
    was proportional to power dissipated by the self-heated thermistor. Show All B.
    “Constant Power” Circuit Concepts The resistance \mbi{R} _{\mmb{T}} of a heated
    thermistor dissipating a constant amount of heat \mbi{P} into a flow stream or
    thermally conductive medium will respond simultaneously to changes in ambient
    temperature \mbi{T} _{\mmb{A}} and to changes in the surrounding fluid properties
    or velocity. So while the product of the thermistor''s voltage and current (the
    power dissipated) is fixed in a constant power heater circuit, the ratio of voltage
    to current (the resistance) is always varying, and must be continuously extracted
    to drive the feedback control loop. If the traditional reference thermistors of
    Fig. 5 are not used to correct for ambient temperature changes, one is forced
    to switch the control circuit between zero power and full power to obtain first
    the ambient and then the heated temperatures. Fig. 6 shows a typical V-I curve
    for a 1 {\rm k}\Omega @25°C thermistor having a nominal dissipation constant of
    4.1 {\rm mW}/^{\circ}{\rm C} in still water. Fig. 6. The voltage-current transfer
    function of a 1 {\rm k}\Omega @25°C NTC thermistor at a constant ambient temperature
    of 25°C. The device response is linear (constant resistance) at low-power levels
    (36.8 \mu {\rm W} ) and nonlinear at higher power dissipation levels (36.8 mW).
    Increased thermal diffusivity in solids or increased flow in liquids or gases
    increases the “dissipation constant” 4.1 to 6.1 {\rm mW} /^{\circ}{\rm C} covers
    the full flow range in water. Show All Ambient sensing thermistors operate in
    the linear “zero power” region, where negligible \mbi{I} ^{\bf 2} \mbi{R} heating
    (36.8 \mu {\rm W} ) results in negligible temperature rise, and the thermistor''s
    resistance is essentially unchanged by the measurement current flowing though
    it or by fluid movements around it. Warm thermistor flow meters operate in the
    nonlinear region of a NTC thermistor''s voltage-current transfer function. As
    operating power levels rise to 36.8 mW, \mbi{I} ^{\bf 2} \mbi{R} heating raises
    the thermistor''s internal temperature by 9°C, dropping the thermistor resistance
    from 1000 \Omega to 750 \Omega at \mbi{T} _{\mmb{amb}} =25 ^{\circ}\hbox{C} .
    Lower resistance leads to higher current flows until the thermistor reaches thermal
    equilibrium with the surrounding fluid. Too high a voltage across an NTC thermistor
    will result in thermal runaway and destruction of the device. C. Choosing a Thermistor
    The sensor thermistor shown inset in Fig. 3 is a hermetically sealed Honeywell
    120-102EAJ-Q01 mini glass probe thermistor. The thermistor has an electrical resistance
    \mbi{R} _{\mmb{T}} of 1 {\rm k}\Omega \pm 20\% at 25°C. A low-resistance thermistor
    was chosen to ensure that \mbi{V} ^{\bf 2} \mbi{/R} _{\mmb{T}} heat loss would
    be as high as practicable, given the limited drive voltage available in a 12 V
    battery-powered field measurement system. The thermistor is driven into self-heating
    mode by a voltage \mbi{V} _{\mmb{T}} chosen to maximize the voltage drop across
    the thermistor at the coldest expected operating temperature of 4°C, where the
    thermistor resistance \mbi{R} _{\mmb{T}} is as high as 2.7 {\rm k} \Omega . As
    the drive amplifier needs at least 2 V of headroom to operate, the maximum voltage
    drop across the thermistor at this temperature in a 12 V system is limited to
    about 10 V. Minimum thermistor current is then 3.68 mA, which sets the maximum
    power output \mbi{P} _{\mmb{T}} to 36.8 mW. At warmer ambient temperatures and
    lower thermistor resistances, current increases and voltage decreases but the
    power dissipated by the thermistor is held constant. D. A Log-Antilog Double-Bridge
    Circuit for Constant Power Control and Resistance Monitoring The control circuit
    of Figs. 7 and 10 measures and transmits the thermistor''s resistance, which is
    proportional to the thermistor''s temperature via (1). At the same time, the thermistor
    is driven by the control circuit''s output voltage \mbi{V} _{\mmb{T}} , which
    is forced to be equal to the square root of thermistor resistance \mbi{R} _{\mmb{T}}
    , such that power dissipated in the thermistor is proportional to \mbi{V} _{\mmb{T}}

    over the range 1:1000 Fig. 7. A “double-bridge” control circuit, which forces
    constant power dissipation from a thermistor operating in either zero-heating
    or self-heating mode, while providing a separate voltage output that is proportional
    to the thermistor''s resistance in either operational mode. Sensor calibration
    allows this voltage output to be reported as a temperature. Changing the current
    flowing into the \mbi{I} _{\mmb{ref}} input by a factor of 1:\surd 1000 changes
    the power dissipated by the thermistor by a factor of 1:1000, driving the thermistor
    from ambient to self-heating mode. The circuitry implementing these basic functions
    can be found in Fig. 10. Show All The arithmetic functions of multiplication and
    division, square and square-root functions have traditionally been performed in
    analog log-antilog circuits (National Semiconductor Application Note AN222). Such
    circuits enable infinitely precise computation, wide dynamic operating range and
    fast response time, although their accuracy is limited to typically \pm 1\% ;
    these gain errors must be cancelled out in the calibration process. Use of analog
    circuits provides sufficient resolution over a wide dynamic range to compute very
    small temperature differences in the order of a few milliKelvins. in this double-bridge
    circuit (Fig. 10), three LM394 super-matched transistor pairs are used to continuously
    compute the square root of the thermistor voltage-to-current ratio (that is, the
    square-root of the thermistor resistance), while a further pair are used to compute
    the thermistor resistance. The underlying “constant power bridge” circuit equations
    are derived next. Log-antilog circuits make use of the natural logarithmic relationship
    between the collector current \mbi{I} _{\mmb{C}} of a bipolar transistor and its
    base-emitter voltage \mbi{V} _{\mmb{BE}} . This relationship can be written as
    {V_{BE}} = {{kT} \over q}\ln \left({{{{I_{C}}} \over {{I_{S}}}}} \right) \eqno{\hbox{(5)}}

    temperature in K (=273.15 + ^{\circ}{\rm C} ); \mmb{q} = electron charge (1.6e-19)
    \mmb{I} _{\mmb{S}} = reverse saturation current (≈5.30e-12 measured for LM394
    super-matched transistors). Of these terms, \mbi{k} and \mbi{q} are constants,
    such that the term \mbi{kT}\mbi{/}\mbi{q} is known as the thermal voltage of a
    semiconductor, and is cancelled out in the circuit design by the matched pairs
    of transistors on opposite sides of the bridge. Offsets created by the reverse
    saturation currents \mbi{I} _{\mmb{S}} of the transistors are also cancelled by
    pairing of the three LM394s across the input and output circuits on opposite sides
    of the double-bridge. Log circuits, in the input stage, function by adding and
    subtracting base-emitter voltages to do multiplication and division, respectively,
    and by doubling or halving base-emitter voltages to do square and square-root
    functions, respectively. Anti-log circuits, in the output stage, convert these
    voltages back to collector currents. The primary objective of this square-root
    circuit is to set up the output current \mbi{I} _{\mmb{out}} in terms of the input
    currents to satisfy the following equation \eqalignno{{I_{out}} =&\, {I_{ref}}

    used to impress these base-emitter voltages across both halves of the double-bridge
    circuit, and to convert the output current back to the single-ended “resistance
    output” voltage of Fig. 10. The performance characteristics of this analog circuit
    are detailed in Table I. Fig. 8. Sensor electronics for field use in a vineyard.

    used in the log-antilog square root and resistance calculation circuits. Reference
    current is switched and tuned using a 12-bit DAC in the microcontroller that is
    shown in the digital circuitry on the right-hand side. A second DAC is used in
    conjunction with an instrumentation amplifier to make high-resolution differential
    temperature measurements. The instrument uses stored calibration constants to
    compute all output variables locally. Instruments are connected in parallel along
    a three-wire cable providing power to all sensors and data exchange to a data
    logger via the SDI-12 digital bus. As many as 36 grapevines can be monitored along
    a 30 m cable. Show All Fig. 9. Traces of normalized temperature versus time for
    the thermistor heater buried in the stem pith; as the vascular system collapses
    under water stress conditions, the wood-to-water ratio increases and the constant
    heat output of the thermistor heater causes an increasing temperature rise over
    a fixed period. Show All E. Temperature Measurement and Control The control loop
    described thus far regulates the heat output of the thermistor at a level dependent
    upon the value of the reference current \mbi{I} _{\mmb{ref}} . The sensor''s microcontroller
    can switch the power level between “zero-power” and “heating-power” by simply
    changing the applied reference current \mbi{I} _{\mmb{ref}} to the reference circuit
    over a range of 1:\surd 1000 . This changes the power dissipated in the thermistor
    from 36.8 \mu {\rm W} to 36.8 mW. To measure the ambient and heated temperatures
    of the thermistor one needs a current proportional to the resistance of the thermistor,
    no matter at which power level the sensor is operating. Such a circuit has already
    been described by (10), except that one less transistor pair is required, deleting
    the divide-by-two function that creates the square root-of-resistance function

    circuit for maintaining constant heat output from a thermistor, RT1. The circuit
    reports the thermistor resistance as a voltage at the “Resistance Output.” Power
    levels are switched over a dynamic range of 1:1000, being either the low-power
    (ambient temperature) mode or the high-power (self-heating) mode, as determined
    by the Low-High Power Switch position. Super-matched transistor pair Q1A-Q1B convert
    the thermistor voltage and current signals into logarithmic signals V _{BEV} and
    V _{BEI} via op-amps U1B and U1A, respectively. These two signals feed parallel
    bridge circuits; one (Q2 and Q3 pairs) are in the feedback loop of the square-root-of-resistance
    circuit driving the thermistor excitation voltage, and the other (Q4) is in the
    open-loop Resistance Output circuit. Loop gain is set by R11 such that 10 V is
    applied across the thermistor resistance of 2700 \Omega at 4°C in high-power mode.
    This is set, in turn, by the reference current I _{\rm ref} selected by the Low-High
    Power Switch through 1:\surd 1000 reference resistors, to give a power shift of
    1:1000. The gain of the Resistance Output circuit is dependent upon both R15 in
    the output current-to-voltage converter circuit, and the internal loop gain set
    by the reference current derived from the +2.500 V reference voltage applied across
    the ground-referred resistor R12. The Current Sense circuit formed by U1C and
    U1D forces the bottom end of the thermistor to a virtual earth, while sinking
    current through the precision 100 \Omega current resistor R1. The voltage drop
    across R1 is inverted to become a positive voltage that drives the current-log
    circuit through R4. Diodes D1 and D2 prevent circuit lockup caused by an attempt
    to take the square root of a negative number. Op-amps U2B and U2C servo the bottom

    Low-Power Modes SECTION III. Thermal Diffusivity Measurements in a Grapevine Stem
    A. Experimental Procedure Laboratory “cut-stem” tests were undertaken on a 2-meter
    long five-month old cane having a 10-mm cross-sectional diameter. The cane was
    cut from a well-irrigated 15-year-old black-sultana grapevine (Vitis vinifera).
    The aim of this laboratory work was to ascertain whether or not field trails of
    a thermal “plant water status sensor” were merited. Rather than report here on
    comparative measurements between this sensor and a pressure chamber, the sensor
    response is tracked qualitatively against the decline of the cut-stem over a 24-h
    period. The cane was harvested at 3.30 am under still conditions. It was then
    stored in a sealed polythene bag with the cut-end immersed in a small flask of
    pure water, transported to the laboratory and set up out of direct sunlight and
    draught. Six hours later, the glass rod thermistor was inserted into the freshly
    cut lateral shown in Fig. 3. Initial measurements were undertaken a further 6-h
    later at 3:30 pm on Day 1, at intervals of 15 min. The cane was allowed to stabilize
    for a further 17 h overnight, while the cut xylem vessels healed around the glass
    rod thermistor. Further readings commenced at 10:30 am the following morning at
    15-min intervals, with the cane fully irrigated from the water in the storage
    flask. Water was emptied from the storage flask at 11:30 am on Day 2, and readings
    continued until 5:15 pm that evening. B. Results Thirty-four sets of 1024 readings
    were made in all over a period of 24 hours. The resultant data was divided into
    “heating curves” and “cooling curves” and data-of-best fit determined using nonlinear
    regression routines. Data close to the switching points were discarded, as the
    high residual temperature gradients at these times gave poor fits. Cooling curves
    were fitted with the algorithm T(^{\circ} {\rm C}) = {a_{C}}.{e^{(- t/{b_{C}})}}
    + {c_{C}} \eqno{\hbox{(13)}} View Source where \mbi{a} _{\mmb{C}} is a dimensionless
    gain coefficient, \mbi{b} _{\mmb{C}} is the “time-constant” of interest, and the
    \mbi{c} _{\mmb{C}} is the “background temperature.” Time \mbi{t} was based upon
    the sampling rate and the measurement number of the K2000 voltmeter. Analysis
    was performed on data between 10 and 30 s after the heat pulse was switched off.
    The proportion of variance explained (\mbi{r} ^{\bf 2} ) was better than 99.90%
    for all 34 sets of data. However, the temperature variation over this 10 s of
    measurement was typically only 0.4°C due to the rapid decay in the temperature
    reading. Heating curves were fitted with the algorithm T(^{\circ} {\rm C}) = {a_{H}}.\ln
    (t) + {b_{H}}.\ln {(t)^{2}} + {c_{H}} \eqno{\hbox{(14)}} View Source where \mbi{a}
    _{\mmb{H}} and \mbi{b} _{\mmb{H}} are dimensionless gain coefficients and \mbi{c}
    _{\mmb{H}} is the “background temperature.” Data analysis was performed on data
    between 1 and 21 s after the heat pulse was switched on. The proportion of variance
    explained (\mmb{r} ^{\bf 2} ) was better than 99.96% for all 34 sets of data.
    For both heating and cooling data, readings were first normalized by subtracting
    the background temperature “\mbi{c} _{\mbi{x}} ” and regenerating the normalized
    curves (e.g., the heating curves of Fig. 9), based upon the remaining coefficients
    and terms of the equation. An integral of the sensor temperature rise or fall
    was derived from these normalized curves by simply averaging the temperature over
    the time intervals of 20 and 10 s, respectively. The vine cane stayed well hydrated
    over the 32-h period between its removal from the vine and the removal of the
    water storage flask at 11:30 am on the second day, after which point wilting was
    rapid and irreversible. There was only a poor correlation between time constants
    using the cooling curve data, while there was a much stronger result from the
    longer time constants in the heating curves. The processed data from the heating
    curve data set [Fig. 11(a)] shows that the vine cane was slowly losing moisture
    throughout the 18-h overnight period. Once the water flask was removed, the change
    was more rapid, leading to the death of the vine cane by wilting/water stress,
    as evidenced by the accompanying photographs in Fig. 11(b). The average temperature
    rise was used as the sensor signal over the heating period of 20 s. SECTION IV.
    Discussions and Conclusion Loss of leaf turgor is a consequence of vascular collapse
    within the vine cane as moisture is lost through the stomata on the underside
    of the leaves and through the stem. Photographs of a small cluster of new leaves
    on the cane above the sampling point were taken at various intervals to record
    this change in leaf turgor [Fig. 11(b)]. These photographs show the irreversible
    wilting and death of the cane as the internal water balance declined. A log-antilog
    analog double-bridge has been presented as the basis for experiments using a single
    self-heated thermistor sensor for measuring the thermal properties of materials
    in a variety of applications. The high-precision output of the instrument represents
    the internal temperature of the thermistor in either ambient-sensing or constant
    heat output mode. Thermal diffusion measurements using a constant-power “temperature
    rise” measurement largely remove the common-mode background temperature value
    from the result. Fig. 11. (a) Changes in the plant water status of a grapevine
    cane, as recorded by the thermal diffusion sensor of Figs. 3 and 10. As the cane
    tissue loses moisture, the wood-to-water ratio increases, and so the constant
    energy heat pulse creates an increasingly warmer integral temperature rise at
    the sensor tip. (b) A qualitative record of increasing plant water stress can
    be seen in this gallery of photos of a small cluster of leaves on the grapevine
    cane above the cut. The first two photos (left, top), taken 18 h apart, show only
    a small decline in leaf turgor overnight, as the cane was kept well hydrated in
    a beaker of water during this period. The remaining photos, in chronological sequence
    (left-to-right, top-to-bottom), show the collapse of leaf and stem turgor once
    the vine cane was removed from its water supply, and as it loses moisture through
    transpiration. Show All However, background ambient temperature changes during
    the actual measurement are a source of error. The double-bridge circuit (unlike
    earlier bridge circuits) can be switched over a power dissipation range of 1:1000.
    Prior measurements of background “thermal drift rate” are, therefore, possible
    using the very low power ambient temperature measurement mode. Extrapolation can
    then be used to correct for the small proportion of the temperature change in
    the sensor''s output that is due to natural external temperature changes during
    the 21-s measurement cycle. As a single self-referencing thermistor has been used,
    there are no thermistor matching errors common to earlier designs. This allows
    the instrument''s calibration to hold true over a wider temperature range, although
    the instrument supply voltage and the 25°C thermistor resistance value set the
    low-temperature limit. The thermal diffusion sensor was shown to be capable of
    detecting the changes in internal hydration levels that accompany irrigation stress
    in grapevines. Basic measurements in the laboratory have shown that the sensor
    could detect a cut-cane response to a “forced event” such as the removal of the
    cane''s hydrating water flask. Rather than insert a sensor into the grapevine
    cane by drilling radially through (and damaging) the sap conducting vessels, a
    glass rod thermistor was successfully inserted coaxially into the pith of an excised
    stem, and the stem allowed to self-heal behind it. Injecting heat radially into
    the surrounding xylem tissue resulted in a rate of temperature rise dependent
    upon the plant''s internal water status. This thermal diffusivity measurement
    works because of the difference between the heat capacity and thermal conductivity
    of water compared to that of plant tissue. Grafting and pruning techniques are
    well established in viticulture, and this method of gaining access to the internal
    tissue of a living grapevine cane is well within the capabilities of irrigators.
    This paper has not sought to address major drawbacks that are likely to limit
    the method''s reliability under field conditions. The average temperature rise
    that is used as the sensor output signal depends on many more parameters than
    the cane moisture content, such as the growth-dependent geometry of the cane cross
    section, changes in the thermal properties of the pith and the lignification of
    plant tissue as the growing season progresses. While the first steps have been
    taken to prove a much-needed new approach to making continuous plant water status
    measurements, much fieldwork – in conjunction with irrigators and plant physiologists
    – will be needed to validate this new principle and the associated sensor insertion
    technique. It is very likely that irrigation decisions will at first be dependent
    upon “relative changes” in thermal diffusion measurements over the growing season
    of a crop, and that no initial calibration will hold up throughout the entire
    season as the plant grows and the woody matrix lignifies. Authors Figures References

    drainage is a critical component of agricultural production in both arid and humid
    regions, but field drainage is often neglected and mismanaged as an important
    water resource. Innovative approaches for the integrated design and management
    of irrigation and subsurface drainage systems have tremendous potential to improve
    yields to help meet the rapidly emerging food demands and decrease total freshwater
    diversions to agriculture. Although irrigation system design and management have
    evolved tremendously in the past few decades, the design methodology and management
    criteria for subsurface drainage have not changed in the last 50 years. Thus,
    all aspects of agricultural drainage require serious reconsideration and reevaluation
    to be able to meet emerging needs. This manuscript evaluates the current design
    criteria and practices and suggests viable alternatives for the improvement of
    subsurface agricultural drainage systems to meet the demands of modern agriculture.
    Drainage water treatment, reuse, and disposal are significant problems for agricultural
    drainage and various alternatives are presented. Published 2015. This article
    is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA. Introduction
    With the world population approaching 9 billion people by 2050 the demand for
    food and clean water will be a critical concern in all countries, but will be
    particularly acute in areas that utilize irrigation for production of food, feed,
    and fiber. Rising population, changes in dietary preferences and improved nutrition,
    increasing water withdrawals for urban, industrial, and recreational uses, and
    environmental protection have greatly increased the global demand for good quality
    freshwater and its competition among users (de Fraiture et al., 2010). Global
    climate change may further exacerbate these problems through changing temperatures
    and long-term variations in annual precipitation amounts and regional rainfall
    distribution patterns. This situation is compounded by economic concerns including
    escalating energy costs, rising cost of inputs, persistent soil erosion and salination,
    increasing climate variability and continuing loss of environmental integrity
    (National Research Council (NRC), 2010; Council for Agricultural Science and Technology
    (CAST), 2010; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 2011).
    Irrigated agriculture currently supplies 40% of the world food supply on approximately
    20% of the arable land in agricultural production (Postel, 1999). Irrigated crop
    production also provides much of the feed to sustain animals used for work or
    food in many parts of the world. It provides considerable food sources and foraging
    areas for migratory and local birds, as well as other wildlife. In addition, agriculture
    is also being asked to supplement the world''s ever-increasing energy needs by
    producing more bio-based fuels and lubricants. Because the world''s arable land
    base is declining due to soil salination, erosion and urbanization there is a
    need to substantially increase crop production in humid areas, while irrigated
    agriculture will be required to provide an even greater proportion of the food
    supply in both arid and humid regions. Freshwater diversions to irrigated agriculture
    are declining while the need to increase production is escalating rapidly. Subsurface
    drainage offers many benefits that will be necessary to meet these challenges
    in both humid and arid areas. In arid irrigated, as well as humid farming areas,
    removing excess water from the soil surface and the soil profile by natural and
    artificial means is a critical component in sustaining crop production. In many
    arid locations, irrigated crop production can only be physically sustainable if
    both soil salt concentrations and shallow groundwater elevations are adequately
    managed, whereas humid areas usually need field drainage to lower groundwater
    tables or intercept subsurface flows to prevent waterlogged conditions. Fortunately,
    compared to early irrigated civilizations, modern irrigation and drainage technologies
    in conjunction with advanced irrigation management options can control soil salinity
    and maintain sustainable crop production (Smedema et al., 2004). Agricultural
    drainage is a generic term describing the removal of excess water from the land
    surface and the soil profile to enhance its use. Surface drainage is typically
    land shaping and forming to facilitate overland flow and discharge of excess water
    from the land surface through a series of ditches and channels constructed for
    that purpose (Schultz et al., 2013). In some cases in low areas of a field, surface
    inlets are connected to subsurface drains to supplement surface drainage. Most
    of the surface drainage is reused in arid and semiarid areas to augment irrigation
    and urban water supplies. Subsurface drainage is the focus of this paper and is
    defined as the process of removing excess water from the soil profile through
    the use of open field drains (ditches) or buried perforated pipes that discharge
    into a pumped sump or ditch for disposal. The benefits of farm field drainage
    include improved crop production, improved soil aeration, better trafficability
    for agricultural equipment, enhanced soil salinity management, improved soil aeration,
    improved recreation, protecting infrastructure, and improving human health conditions
    by removing stagnant water that transmits water-related diseases, e.g. malaria,
    schistosomiasis. These benefits can accrue from both surface and subsurface drainage
    (Scheumann and Freisem, 2001). Drainage waters may also contribute to maintaining
    foraging areas and wetlands for wildlife and migrating birds as well as recreation
    and fisheries. Subsurface drainage will be part of the solutions to the world''s
    water security needs. This manuscript reviews the current state of the art, current
    and future needs, and presents some alternatives for sustainable subsurface drainage
    system design and operation. These include: (i) collecting the required data on
    soil variability, geologic, topographic and soil physical properties; (ii) characterizing
    existing and future design criteria, assessing strategies and developing management
    capability; (iii) discussing criteria for the treatment and potential reuse of
    drainage water: and (iv) providing appropriate practices for disposal of highly
    degraded drainage water (lost to the system). Alternative strategies to augment
    precipitation and irrigation water supplies and to reduce pollutant concentrations
    in return flows from existing and new agriculture drainage systems are also presented.
    This review will be the basis for making recommendations for future research and
    development in subsurface drainage system design and operation for both humid
    and arid areas. Forces for Change Climate change The effect of climate change
    on the distribution patterns, timing and intensity of rainfall will have to be
    considered in future designs. Previous research has indicated that climate change
    may have a minor impact on crop water use, but the drainage design criteria for
    flow will probably not be significantly impacted (Armstrong et al., 1992). The
    impact of climate change in arid areas may be increased rainfall during normally
    dry periods or more frequent or prolonged drought affecting surface water supplies.
    Each of these conditions requires a different response in terms of drainage design.
    In the first case there may be a requirement for additional drainage capacity,
    and in the second instance a need to store and manage deep percolation to augment
    crop water use. The question is whether the impact is sufficient to radically
    change the design criteria related to excess water. Environmental concerns Discharge
    of subsurface drainage water into surface water is a major environmental issue
    affecting the operation of subsurface drainage systems. The emergence of greater
    awareness and concern for the environment in combination with the unavoidable,
    critical need to ensure agricultural sustainability has made subsurface drainage
    waters a major concern and liability, but it may be possible to mitigate these
    concerns with new design criteria and management systems. While existing criteria
    and designs have served agriculture by maintaining productivity, they have inadvertently
    contributed to significant environmental degradation due to the discharge of salts
    (Ca, Na, SO4), toxic elements (Se, B), fertilizers (N, P), pesticides and herbicides
    into the surface water, which can have a devastating effect on the environment
    (e.g. selenium contamination of Kesterson Reservoir; San Joaquin Valley Drainage,
    1990), hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico due to N loading (Burkart and James, 1999;
    Rabalais et al., 2007; Greene et al., 2009). As a result of these impacts, the
    status quo for the design and operation of drainage systems is no longer acceptable
    and researchers must develop new strategies and tools that include integrated
    water table management plus the treatment and reuse of surface and subsurface
    drainage waters for each affected ecosystem. Crop water use Crop water requirements
    have been changing over the years with new drought- and heat-tolerant crop varieties
    and irrigation management strategies. In addition, better methods for calculating
    crop water requirements using weighing lysimeters, eddy covariance, Bowen ratio,
    and other emerging methods along with mathematical estimates using the modified
    Penman equation are commonly available (Allen et al., 1998). However, the potential
    for in situ crop water use from shallow groundwater can be substantial (Ayars
    et al., 2006a), but it is usually ignored in water balance calculations; and there
    is very limited information available on this topic because it is very difficult
    to measure. This component of the design may be transient if the source of shallow
    groundwater is overirrigation, but it can become an increasingly significant part
    of the water balance and lengthen the irrigation interval to conserve water and
    nutrients with appropriate management. If the source of shallow groundwater is
    external to the site then in situ use by the local crop is an alternative. The
    sources of shallow groundwater at each site need to be identified and quantified
    as part of the field investigations and design of a drainage system. In addition,
    crop water use values may change as new varieties are developed that are more
    tolerant to heat, drought, and soil salinity stresses. State of the Art of Agricultural
    Drainage As we go forward, it is important to consider where the science of drainage
    is today and how it has evolved. Smedema (2007) provides good insight into this
    question based on his review of drainage conferences and workshops held over the
    last 25 years by the Working Group on Drainage of the International Commission
    on Irrigation and Drainage (ICID) and the drainage committees of the American
    Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE). He observed a transition
    in research interests from technical to nontechnical issues. The early conferences
    focused on technical issues including: determining the input parameters for design
    of drainage systems, the materials used to construct a drainage system, and the
    mathematical basis for determining the depth and spacing of subsurface drains.
    The drainage design, construction, and installation methods developed several
    decades ago have been accepted as standard practices. There is a need to integrate
    these developed methods with new technologies (computer modeling, integrated management
    of drainage and irrigation systems) and concepts (statistical sampling for soil
    characterization, incorporating in situ water use by crops in the design). In
    later conferences, the issues became nontechnical and emphasis was on the sociology
    of drainage including; operation and maintenance, system management, stakeholder
    involvement, capacity building, environmental awareness, and sustainable agriculture.
    Studies in recent conferences have demonstrated that once the drainage system
    has been installed there is a lack of training for system operation and maintenance
    and technical and financial support for the maintenance and operation of these
    systems resulting in a gradual degradation of system operation (Schultz et al.,
    2013). The emergence of environmental constraints and the emphasis on sustainability
    of irrigated agriculture dictate that new and innovative technical concepts must
    be included in future design and operation of both existing and new subsurface
    drains. There needs to be a holistic approach to quantifying the system that incorporates
    the irrigation system design and management, the plant production system, the
    characterization of the soil profile, and a design approach for the drainage system
    that includes well-defined management strategies including treatment and reuse
    of drainage water that address environmental and social concerns, as well as crop
    production issues. Over the past few decades, there has been considerable progress
    in improving irrigation system design and management; however, there has been
    little research devoted to design and implementation of improved systems and integrated
    management for subsurface drainage systems. New approaches are needed that will
    require a critical look at existing methods of data collection, design, installation,
    and management of subsurface drainage systems with the goal of incorporating current
    and emerging technologies to meet identified future systems design and operation.
    Existing drainage infrastructure The future of subsurface drainage in agriculture
    faces several significant obstacles. For example, drainage infrastructure is generally
    neglected and many drainage systems have failed or are failing with no plans or
    resources to replace them. Scheumann and Freisem (2001) identified drainage as
    the forgotten factor in sustaining irrigated agriculture. Even though it is acknowledged
    as being required to sustain production in irrigated agriculture and provide salinity
    control, it is generally ignored when considering the future allocations of financial
    and management resources after installation, which is particularly true in developing
    countries. The beneficial and nonbeneficial effects of drainage on areas outside
    of agriculture are poorly understood and little investment is made in the maintenance
    of drainage systems. With the competing demands for funds, governments have demonstrated
    little interest in providing and maintaining drainage services and the training
    needed to operate them. This problem falls into the category of out of sight and
    out of mind, and the very large expense of renovating and improving these systems
    probably serves as another reason to ignore and delay addressing the problem.
    With the exception of open ditches, there is little of a subsurface drainage system
    that is visible and failure of the system is not apparent until a catastrophe
    occurs, e.g. the system fails and crop production in an entire river basin is
    threatened with high levels of waterlogging and soil salination. Lack of subsurface
    drainage infrastructure may also result in the destruction of highways and roads
    and the degradation of building foundations. In the end, it always comes back
    to who pays and what is the public benefit for maintaining or expanding agricultural
    drainage infrastructure. Drainage needs Smedema (2007) characterized three basic
    global drainage zones. The first is the temperate humid zone where the major concern
    is prevention of waterlogging to improve soil aeration and trafficability. The
    second zone is the arid/semiarid zone where the major concerns are aeration, waterlogging,
    and soil salinity management. The third zone is the humid/semihumid tropics where
    excess surface water control is the primary objective and prevention of waterlogging
    (aeration) is also a consideration. The need for subsurface drainage in the irrigated
    and rainfed agricultural zones has been summarized by Smedema et al. (2000) (Table
    1). They estimate that less than one third of all the irrigated lands needing
    drainage have been drained, which is a concern because drainage is critical for
    salinity management to sustain arid irrigated agriculture. Other estimates have
    placed the total drained area between 160 and 180 million ha. (Schultz, 2013,
    personal communication). Table 1. Summary of existing worldwide drainage and future
    needs (Smedema et al., 2000) Needing improved drainage Adequate natural drainage

    suitable or environmentally sensitive land. To meet the challenge for increased
    food production during the next decades, rehabilitation and improvements to existing
    drainage systems must be made simultaneously with providing new drainage service
    to about 125 million ha of irrigated land identified in Table 1 as requiring additional
    drainage. The increased production on this land will vary depending on the existing
    conditions and extent of drainage required to optimize production. Similarly,
    providing advanced drainage service to 300 million ha in humid areas will also
    enable improved yields. In both cases, there needs to be considerable thought
    given to the advanced design and management of these systems. Drainage Design
    Considerations Historically, subsurface drainage systems have not been actively
    managed to achieve a particular agronomic goal. Instead, they were solely intended
    to remove excess water from the soil profile to sustain crop production. Subsurface
    drainage systems in arid areas have been designed to maintain the groundwater
    table below the crop root zone at the least cost by the uniform deep placement
    of the drain laterals with uniform wide spacing. This resulted in design criteria
    to maximize water removal rates. However, this practice has led to the problem
    of return flows containing relatively large amounts of dissolved materials polluting
    surface and subsurface water supplies. Increasing the lateral depth will increase
    the spacing while maintaining the same midpoint water table depth. However, a
    deeper lateral placement with wider drain spacing increases the depth of the flow
    lines into the soil profile into zones with the highest salt concentrations (Jury
    et al., 2003), and increasing the lateral spacing may have a significant effect
    on drainage water quality in arid areas. In arid areas the soil salinity often
    increases in concentration with depth (Ayars and Meek, 1994) as a result of reclamation
    and leaching, and deeper-placed laterals tend to have higher salinity water being
    discharged which results in an increased salt load being discharged in the drainage
    water. This mines salt and increases the drainage water salinity as well as resulting
    in excessive salt loading of surface water, and new approaches to implementing
    subsurface drainage in agriculture are clearly needed. Research has demonstrated
    a significant potential for in situ crop water use from shallow groundwater by
    a variety of crops and in conditions with a wide range of electrical conductivity
    and depth of the shallow groundwater (Ayars et al., 2006b). However, there has
    been little consideration of water table management to augment freshwater diversions
    to meet crop evapotranspiration needs in water-short areas as well as humid areas.
    Clearly new approaches to subsurface drainage are needed to address these shortcomings.
    It has been recognized for some time that subsurface drainage systems should not
    remove water that may contribute to crop growth beyond the point needed for adequate
    aeration (overdrainage) (Doering et al., 1982). Studies have demonstrated that
    in situ crop water use has a significant effect on lateral spacing (Ayars and
    McWhorter, 1985; Nikam et al., 1992; Upadhyaya and Chauhan, 2000). Incorporating
    crop water use from the groundwater table reduces the total flow to the drains
    which results in wider drain spacing for a given midpoint groundwater table position
    without having to increase the lateral depth. Thus, the depth of installation
    may be varied as part of the design process to determine the effect on water quality,
    if that is a criterion. An alternative strategy with deep drains is to control
    the groundwater table position using controls on the drain outlet (Wahba and Christen,
    2006). This reduces the depth of flow lines into the soil profile and reduces
    the salt load (Christen and Ayars, 2001). Doering et al. (1982) developed a shallow
    drainage system concept for arid irrigated areas as a method to control groundwater
    table position. They found that deep drain placement resulted in excessive drainage
    losses (overdrainage) and using a shallow drain placement conserved irrigation
    water. Other studies have demonstrated that groundwater table management provides
    significant benefits in the reduction of energy costs and the conservation of
    water (Benz et al., 1981). These studies were conducted in North Dakota, USA,
    with water that was low in salinity and in nonsaline soils, and salinity management
    was not an issue. Ayars et al. (1998) demonstrated similar results in the San
    Joaquin Valley on saline soils using low salinity irrigation water. Alternative
    lateral placement is another area for consideration as new criteria are developed
    for design and management of drainage systems. Drainage laterals have generally
    been placed at a single uniform depth within the soil profile and with a uniform
    spacing. As detailed knowledge of soil properties is developed, it will enable
    variable spacing which should result in reduced cost of construction, reduced
    drainage flow and improved management. Different designs and lateral placement
    have included bi-level drains with a pattern of both deep and shallow lateral
    placement (DeBoer and Chu, 1975; Hornbuckle et al., 2005). These designs can be
    applied in areas to provide benefits for improved groundwater table management
    if the design is coupled with an outlet control. In saline areas requiring reclamation
    deeper-spaced drains may be used in initial soil reclamation and the shallower
    drains used for control of the groundwater table position on an ongoing basis
    (Hornbuckle et al., 2005). Variable lateral spacing could also be coupled with
    bi-level installation to provide additional management opportunities. Thus, new
    management approaches will also require changes in the criteria used to establish
    the depth and spacing of drain laterals. For example, reducing the midpoint depth
    may be an alternative to increase the lateral spacing. The increased spacing may
    be a problem in areas with high salinity as noted above. However, the reduced
    flow with the shallower installation depth along with reduced depth of the flow
    path should reduce the total load being discharged (Ayars and Meek, 1994; Ayars
    et al., 2006a). Christen and Skehan (2001) also found that shallower depth placement
    and closer drain spaced laterals resulted in shallower flow pathways in the soil
    profile that mined less salt. Crop water use Studies in humid areas demonstrated
    that it was possible to actively manage subsurface drains to reduce flow and store
    water in the soil for crop water use (Doty, 1980; Skaggs, 1980). These studies
    were conducted in the flat coastal plain area of North Carolina, USA, and the
    topography facilitated a good control of groundwater table position from one location
    in the field (Doty et al., 1975). Similar types of groundwater control become
    more difficult as the field surface slope increases. This will require additional
    structures throughout the drainage system to provide groundwater table position
    control without inducing waterlogged conditions in a portion of the field. It
    may include a design that changes the drainage lateral placement relative to the
    surface slope such that a single control structure can be used for a large area
    (Ayars, 2003). Controlled drainage has also been used for control of subirrigation
    in humid areas (Skaggs, 1999b), In this mode good quality water is pumped into
    the drainage system to raise the groundwater table to facilitate in situ crop
    water use (Skaggs, 1999b). Subirrigation requires a different set of design criteria
    to facilitate the rapid removal of water in instances when rainfall may interact
    with subirrigation. Similar to pumping water into drains, subsurface drip irrigation
    could also be used to temporarily raise groundwater table depths for crop use.
    These systems have been demonstrated to conserve water. For example, Stanley and
    Clark (1991) reported that irrigation water requirements for tomato production
    in south Florida were reduced by 33–40% with subsurface drip irrigation as compared
    to conventional open-ditch subirrigation systems because of reduced runoff rates.
    Smajstrla et al. (1995) reported that potato yields were statistically similar,
    but 33% less water was applied for groundwater table control with a subsurface
    drip irrigation system compared to a conventional open-ditch subirrigation system.
    This highlights the challenge to include irrigation system design and operation
    in drainage system designs. In a radical departure from past design and management
    criteria, limited research has shown that relatively shallow and closely spaced
    subsurface drainage (i.e. tile drainage) systems can be used to increase crop
    production in humid areas by controlling groundwater table depths to provide water
    to crops in dry periods (Doty, 1980). In addition, some of leached nutrients that
    were previously lost to return flows remain available to the crops. There is a
    need to develop similar management approaches and strategies for subsurface drainage
    systems in arid areas that also mitigate soil salinity and augment irrigation
    water supplies to meet pressing demands for increased crop production on less
    land using less water and nutrients. Leaching requirement Leaching of salt from
    the crop root zone has long been considered a part of the seasonal water requirement
    for crops grown in saline areas in regions where rainfall quantity or timing is
    not sufficient for leaching. The leaching requirement (LR) is the minimum amount
    of water required to maintain soil salinity at a prescribed level. The LR is a
    function of the salinity of the irrigation water, the salt tolerance of the crop,
    and the desired soil salinity level (Hoffman, 1990).The leaching fraction (LF)
    is defined as the actual amount of water passing the bottom of the root zone and
    is generally greater than the LR. In the past with furrow irrigation it has not
    been a problem to meet the LR because the limited ability to precisely manage
    the application depth has resulted in excessive deep percolation losses and the
    LR was met without including it in the calculation of the crop water requirement.
    However, pressurized irrigation systems have the potential for better control
    of the depth, uniformity and distribution of applied water and the LR needs to
    be included in the crop water requirement calculation. These factors are critical,
    but there are indications that leaching of salts may not have to occur continuously
    and that salts might be stored indefinitely at high concentrations below the root
    zone, which may also reduce design flow rates and lower costs. There has been
    a significant shift in the thinking with regard to the theory of estimating the
    leaching requirement presented in Handbook 60 (United States Salinity Laboratory
    (USSL) (1954)) to the present. Research has shown that plants are significantly
    more salt tolerant than had previously been assumed, particularly later in the
    growing season (van Schilfgaarde et al., 1974; Letey and Dinar, 1986) and lower
    values of the LR will be required to maintain productivity. This is also true
    for salinity management in the soil profile where higher levels of salinity can
    be maintained in the profile in the lower portions of the crop root zone than
    previously thought (Cardon and Letey, 1992). Thus, salinity management can be
    transient, with root zone salinity increasing during the growing season and leaching
    occurring during fallow periods. The concern about soil salination from upward
    flow of saline groundwater remains, but research has demonstrated that the increased
    soil salinity in the root zone during the growing season can be successfully managed
    with preplant irrigation that provides adequate leaching (Ayars, 2003). Salinity
    management in the soil profile will be a critical component of future drainage
    system management, but the revised LR should result in a lower water requirement
    for salinity control and reduced drainage discharge. Research has also found that
    crop salt tolerance varies with growth stage, from being salt sensitive at germination
    to moderately tolerant to tolerant at maturity, e.g. cotton, sugar beet, tomato
    (Maas, 1990). This provides a management opportunity to match water quality to
    the crop salt tolerance from canal, well, drainage water, and mixed supplies.
    It also provides greater opportunities to manage the shallow groundwater to meet
    the crop water requirements. Initially, this will require extensive instrumentation
    and understanding of the system to be fully implemented. Extensive research is
    needed to reduce this to a manageable system for producers in many areas of the
    world. Nitrogen loading While drainage is a critical component of sustainable
    irrigated agriculture around the world, treatment, reuse, and disposal of drainage
    water are critical issues that need to be solved before additional drainage systems
    are installed. Degraded drainage water has the potential to create significant
    negative environmental impacts as a result of transporting nutrients (N, P), herbicides,
    pesticides, sediment, and toxic elements (B, Se, As) in both surface and subsurface
    drainage flow (Fausey and Palmer, 1987). In humid areas, transport of nitrate
    and phosphorus create significant environmental degradation in surface waters
    due to eutrophication and hypoxia, e.g. Gulf of Mexico (Burkart and James, 1999,
    Rabalais et al., 2007, Greene et al., 2009). While not generally considered part
    of the LR, nitrogen leaching to subsurface drains can be a significant problem
    in drainage water in both humid and arid areas. It appears that the nitrogen load
    is flow dependent, as is the case for salt loading, and reducing the water loss
    will reduce the pollutant load. Varying the drainage intensity has the largest
    impact on the total nitrate load (Sands et al., 2008; Nangia et al., 2010). This
    is often managed by increasing the lateral spacing and controlling the discharge
    during the winter months. Animal wastes and crop residues are additional sources
    of N that are used for fertilization, and agronomic strategies have to be developed
    (Ale et al., 2012b) to control the N load entering the soil (source control) and
    the drainage water. Since N is quite mobile in soil water, controlling transport
    is a larger challenge for humid areas where there is less control on the water
    supply compared to irrigated agriculture, and better N management must be part
    of the total package (e.g. more spoon-feeding of N to match plant needs rather
    than one or two seasonal applications). The objective is to optimize crop N use
    without limiting production and reduce the potential for transport from rainfall
    and irrigation. The use of alternative management strategies such as banding N
    placement with the row, timing of multiple applications, type and source of N,
    loading rates, cultivation practices, and cropping rotations will also be important.
    Site-specific applications of N on land or through the irrigation system to carefully
    match crop N needs in various portions of the field can also be a significant
    management tool. Drainage flow rates A critical input to drainage design is the
    estimation of the actual amount of excess water to be removed by the drainage
    system. In humid areas these values are based on the National Weather Service
    rain and snow data to characterize rainfall distributions and depths over time.
    The drainage requirement can be determined to manage drainage system outflow rates
    for excess rainfall or dry periods based on time of year and crop development.
    The situation in arid areas is not as complex as in humid areas because the excess
    water will be primarily a result of deep percolation from irrigation with little
    expected contribution from rainfall. Deep percolation can be estimated based on
    a water balance of crop water requirements and water supply and runoff with adjustments
    for soil salinity, and assumed irrigation efficiency and uniformity. In addition,
    pressurized irrigation systems and irrigation management have changed and expanded
    significantly over the past 50 years and the potential for large deep percolation
    losses has been greatly reduced in many areas with these systems. However, surface
    irrigation is still the predominate method of irrigation throughout the world
    and deep percolation losses can be large under these systems. Estimated efficiency
    of surface irrigation throughout the world is between 30 and 45%. Consequently,
    it is to be expected that deep percolation will still be a significant element
    in drainage design in arid areas that rely heavily on surface irrigation systems.
    Field characterization for design The basic soil and hydrology data needed for
    subsurface drainage system design have not changed, but less expensive and more
    rapid methods for collecting these data have advanced significantly (Lesch et
    al., 2005; Corwin et al., 2008). Basic data required for design and construction
    of surface and subsurface drains include surface topography, geology, soil type,
    soil hydraulic properties, salinity, deep percolation losses (irrigation, rainfall),
    lateral underground flow, and surface runoff (United States Bureau of Reclamation
    (USBR), 1993). All of these data can be extremely labor-intensive and expensive
    to collect. However, modern technologies offer lower-cost methods and procedures
    that provide reasonable accuracy and minimize the need for field and laboratory
    studies. Integration of these technologies into the planning and design process
    is needed to encourage the upgrading and expansion of field drainage across the
    world. For example, field topography data that previously required time-consuming
    surveying can be determined using aerial photography coupled with digital elevation
    maps (DEMs) and geographic information systems (GIS) mapping. Soil data have traditionally
    been collected using hand- and machine-driven augers in sampling schemes that
    may not adequately describe the variability of a field site with regard to texture
    and hydraulic properties. Soil physical and hydraulic parameters such as saturated
    hydraulic conductivity, porosity, specific yield, field capacity, bulk density,
    and permanent wilting point are determined using laboratory and field measurements.
    These investigations were generally done on a field-by-field basis except when
    a new irrigation project was developed that required different sampling approaches
    due to funding and time constraints. This often resulted in standardized designs
    for subsurface drainage systems in a region that did not provide adequate protection
    from waterlogging in some areas and additional modifications were required. One
    common solution to poor design was to reduce the lateral spacing by installing
    an additional lateral between two existing ones, which is a less than ideal situation
    because of the cost and loss of productivity due to waterlogging and salination
    prior to providing adequate drainage. In the United States, the Natural Resources
    Conservation Service (NRCS) has developed digital soil series maps covering the
    majority of the continental United States (http:websurvey.nrcs.usda.gov). These
    maps were originally developed based on extensive soil surveys and testing. These
    digital maps can be directly imported into GIS programs and used to provide a
    first estimate of the soil types and the soil hydraulic parameters associated
    with individual soil types for reconnaissance studies. These data can be combined
    with other information such as topography and land use using a geostatistical
    analysis to develop more economical soil-sampling strategies for better characterizing
    the variability of the physical and hydraulic parameters (Lesch et al., 2005).
    Indices from remotely sensed multispectral data (e.g. NDVI) and thermal mapping
    in midsummer may be able to indicate areas of drought and waterlogging in the
    field that might benefit from actively managed drainage systems. There is often
    a historical record of false color maps from these remotely sensed data that cover
    several years and may also provide valuable insight for improved designs. Electrical
    resistivity and electromagnetic techniques can be used to estimate some gross
    aspects and the variability of the underlying geology, soil salinity, water-holding
    capacity and other parameters at shallow depths instead of extensive manual sampling
    (Corwin et al., 2008). For example, electromagnetic (EM 38) methods make it possible
    to evaluate the distribution of soil types, layering and soil electrical conductivity
    (e.g., soil salinity) over large areas (Corwin et al., 2008). This will also reduce
    the total cost of the basic investigations by reducing the total number of samples
    per unit area evaluated and improve field characterizations. Direct determinations
    of field capacity, permanent wilting point, porosity, and saturated hydraulic
    conductivity have traditionally required laboratory determinations that are both
    expensive and time-consuming. However, alternative strategies to estimate these
    values using statistical approaches based on sand, silt, and clay percentages
    may offer a less expensive approach. Appropriate pedotransfer functions (Pachepsky
    and Rawls, 1999; Schaap et al., 2001) can be used to provide statistical estimates
    of soil hydraulic parameters based on particle size distribution as a minimum
    input as a first estimate on many soils (Rawls et al., 1981, 2007). The estimates
    of soil physical properties and hydraulic parameters improve as additional information
    is available on porosity, field capacity, and permanent wilting point pressures.
    Salazar et al. (2008) evaluated use of the ROSETTA pedotransfer function model
    to estimate the saturated hydraulic conductivity values for use in the DRAINMOD
    model. They found that the ROSETTA model and laboratory estimates of saturated
    hydraulic conductivity were within 15%, which is within the natural variability
    of soils in many fields. Their results suggest that the ROSETTA model could be
    used instead of laboratory values to predict drainage in coarse-textured soils.
    This begs the question as to whether similar results can be obtained on finer-textured
    soils and what percentages of sand, silt and clay restrict the use of pedotransfer
    functions as the basis for determining soil hydraulic properties with minimum
    verification from laboratory analysis. It may be possible to integrate other field
    data sets (e.g. EC) with texture data in the development of site-specific pedotransfer
    functions for heavier soils. Design Methods and Tools: The basic mathematical
    theory for the design of subsurface drainage systems was developed over many years,
    and before the advent of computerized models (van der Ploeg et al., 1999) required
    many simplifying assumptions to enable the mathematical solutions. The approaches
    used to design lateral spacing were characterized as either steady state or transient
    based on the assumed position of the groundwater table with time. The steady-state
    procedure assumes that over a long period of time the midpoint groundwater table
    position will remain at a specified depth below the soil surface in response to
    rainfall which reflects a balance between inflow and outflow in the system. The
    steady-state approach has been used almost exclusively in humid areas. This is
    considered a reasonable approximation for humid areas with rainfall occurring
    intermittently throughout the year, assuming that the critical time for groundwater
    table positioning is from early spring to harvest. The removal rate of excess
    water (drainage intensity) typically used in the design of subsurface drainage
    systems is millimeters per day. The criterion is met when the midpoint groundwater
    table position has returned to the design depth within a given time frame. Because
    the lateral spacing is related to the depth of placement, the spacing in humid
    areas is typically much narrower and shallower than in arid areas because the
    drainage response needs to be faster than what is required in arid areas. In humid
    areas, the targeted midpoint groundwater table depth is typically 60 cm below
    the soil surface and the lateral depths are on the order of 1 m. Another basic
    assumption in the current design process is that the soils are homogeneous and
    isotropic, which was necessary for the original mathematical development. However,
    with the availability of computers this assumption is no longer required. Mathematical
    models of two-dimensional flow (e.g. HYDRUS-2D; Šimůnek et al., 2008) are available
    that make it possible to incorporate layering and nonhomogeneity of soil parameters
    in the flow calculations. Another challenge is to collect these soil data cost-effectively
    and incorporate them into a large integrated set of models that can be used for
    designing a drainage system. Donnan (USBR, 1993) adapted the steady-state equation
    to irrigated areas by characterizing the average daily drainage requirement as
    the deep percolation losses during the peak irrigation season divided by the number
    of days between irrigation events. The estimated drain lateral spacing using this
    steady-state method was within 20% of the value determined by the transient method
    that is commonly used in irrigated areas and represented a good first estimate
    (USBR, 1993). The transient method is the principal procedure used to design drainage
    systems in irrigated areas. The US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR, 1993) transient
    method was based on a formulation developed by Glover (Dumm, 1954). The method
    assumes that the midpoint groundwater table height between subsurface drain laterals
    reaches its closest position to the soil surface at the end of the irrigation
    season. This is followed by a long period of drain discharge and groundwater table
    recession that increases the groundwater table depth prior to the beginning of
    the irrigation season. Following the recession and with the advent of irrigation,
    the groundwater table depth is reduced incrementally due to deep percolation losses
    associated with irrigation, such that at the end of the irrigation season the
    groundwater table returned to the initial position from the previous year (USBR,
    1993). If the groundwater table hydrograph peaks at other than the end of the
    irrigation season that time should be used as the starting point for the computation.
    In a transient design, the irrigation schedule, crop water requirements, and irrigation
    system application efficiency are used to estimate the deep percolation losses
    that are to be removed by the drainage system. Deep percolation losses due to
    rainfall are also included in the calculation but tend not to be a significant
    component except for possibly semiarid and semihumid areas. The midpoint groundwater
    table depth in arid irrigated areas is generally specified to be in the range
    of 1.1 m (USBR, 1993). This depth was selected based on the perceived need to
    control salinity in the root zone and minimize upward capillary flow from the
    groundwater table that transports salt into the root zone and ultimately the soil
    surface. In arid areas the cost criterion was also an important factor in the
    design and operation and resulted in installations with relatively deep placement
    of drainage laterals (>1.8 m) and wide spacing. In some regions (e.g. Pakistan,
    Egypt) with small landholdings and field sizes the drain lateral placement is
    reduced to ensure the system is located under the fields. In both the steady-state
    and transient design procedures the drainage lateral depth and spacing are revised
    through an iterative process until the design criteria are met. Current design
    criteria are limited to meeting the rate of removal of excess water, maintaining
    the design midpoint groundwater table position, and possibly a cost criterion
    (e.g. the cost of installation) is minimized. These criteria were established
    without considering any groundwater table or irrigation management strategy as
    part of the process. It was assumed that drains would be flowing continuously
    with the objective of removal of excess water in order to return the groundwater
    table position to its design depth within the established time criterion used
    in the design (e.g. 2–3 days in humid areas and a year in arid areas). Current
    drainage models for design Skaggs (1999a) reviewed drainage models and made the
    distinction between mathematical models (equations) and simulation models that
    are the implementation of the various equations traditionally used in drainage
    design. In the first case the solutions described a single event and in the second
    the solutions described day-by-day performance of a system. Computers have made
    it possible to complete the analysis of drainage system operation with detailed
    mathematical models that consider soil layering, spatially distributed properties
    for the soil, detailed hydrologic systems and plant variables. The downside of
    these models is the need for extensive input data sets for soils, hydrology, topography,
    climate, and plant variables. These models usually require an experienced user
    and are often only used in research settings. Despite the development of sophisticated
    mathematical models and large advances in computers, there have been very few
    models developed to design drainage systems as part of an integrated soil water
    management system. Skaggs (1999a) categorized the simulation models into two basic
    approaches. In the first, the Richard''s equation is solved for the unsaturated
    flow zone above the groundwater table and approximating equations are used for
    the saturated flow to the drains. In the second approach, a water balance approach
    was used to describe the flow and soil water regimes above the groundwater table
    and an analytical approach was used for the saturated flow below the groundwater
    table. The review focused on two models, SWATRE and DRAINMOD. The SWATRE model
    exemplified the first approach and DRAINMOD was the example for the second. The
    SWATRE model has been further developed and is currently known as the SWAP3.2
    model. The SWAP3.2 model is designed to simulate flow and transport processes
    at the field scale level during the growing season and for long time series and
    is available on the web (www.swap.alterra.nl/). It has also been adapted for regional
    models for use with GIS programs and methods. The model solves the Richard''s
    equation in one dimension (vertical) with the emphasis on the flow and transport
    processes in the unsaturated zone. The lateral flow in the saturated zone is computed
    using analytical drainage formulas (e.g. Hooghoudt''s equation). Model components
    include: soil water flow (vertical), soil heat flow, solute flow, crop growth
    and macropore flow. It has been used extensively in experimental analysis of field
    trials and evaluating irrigation and water management alternatives. It can be
    used in decision support when coupled with models for pesticide transport (PEARL)
    and nutrient cycling (ANIMO). From a drainage design perspective, the SWAP3.2
    model''s strength is its ability to provide a flux value to the groundwater table
    that may realistically reflect crop water use and transport within the unsaturated
    zone. However, there are many limitations of the analytical models for lateral
    flow estimation that still remain to be addressed. The best known and most extensively
    used drainage simulation model is DRAINMOD (Skaggs, 1999a) (http://www.bae.ncsu.edu/soil_water/drainmod.)
    It was developed for the design and evaluation of multi-component drainage and
    related water management systems (Skaggs, 1982) and conducts a water balance on
    a day-by-day and hour-by-hour basis. It calculates ET, drainage, surface runoff,
    subirrigation, deep seepage, groundwater table depth and soil water status within
    the profile at each time step. These results can be used to assess productivity
    and other agronomic characteristics (Skaggs, 1999a). The simulations are generally
    run for long time periods of 20–50 years to characterize the variability within
    the system. Multiple runs can be used to evaluate designs to determine the most
    profitable alternatives. DRAINMOD has been used extensively throughout the world
    primarily in humid areas (Sanoja et al., 1990; Breve et al., 1998; Ale et al.,
    2012a). It has been modified to include nitrogen transformation and fate (DRAINMOD-N:
    Ale et al., 2012b; Skaggs et al., 2012) and salt transport DRAINMOD-S (Chang et
    al., 1983; Kandil et al., 1995). While the focus of most applications has been
    in humid areas, it has also been applied in arid areas as well to characterize
    salt transport (Wahba et al., 2002; Wahba and Christen, 2006). It is used extensively
    by the USDA Natural Resource and Conservation Service (NRCS) to design and evaluate
    drainage systems in many areas of the USA. Management of Drainage Systems Current
    management of subsurface and surface drainage systems can be categorized as either
    passive or active (Fouss et al., 2007). Passive is the norm, with drains being
    allowed to discharge freely with no attempt to regulate the flow or to control
    the groundwater table position. For example, in response to recent drought and
    environmental issues, many farmers in the Midwest (e.g. Iowa, Illinois, and Minnesota)
    are manually plugging drains after planting and unplugging them before harvest
    in the fall. This is basically a modified passive management approach with highly
    variable results because the drainage systems were not designed for that purpose.
    There has been a considerable amount of research on actively managing drainage
    systems to control groundwater table position and regulate discharge (Doty, 1980;
    Fouss et al., 2007). In these cases, control is achieved by changing the elevation
    of the outlet structure relative to the invert of the drains or providing a valve
    at the outlet. This will result in the groundwater table increasing behind the
    structure. An alternative is to pump surface water into the buried drains to temporarily
    increase the groundwater table elevations. This becomes possible when the fields
    are almost level in lighter soils (Doty et al., 1975, Fouss et al., 2007). Implementation
    of the concept of active management of subsurface drains to control discharge
    and groundwater table position in arid areas is still in its infancy. It is a
    major departure from the past that will significantly affect the design and operation
    of a drainage system (Fouss et al., 2007). This concept was originally developed
    in humid areas (Doty et al., 1975) and recently was applied in arid and semi-arid
    areas where salinity management is a major issue (Ayars, 1999; Ayars et al., 2007).
    The need for control has been observed by farmers in Pakistan who have voluntarily
    plugged drainage laterals to prevent discharge and maintain the groundwater table
    (Khan et al., 2002). There is little doubt that future designs will require that
    active management of subsurface drainage systems, including monitoring and control
    structures, be a part of the total system design to address environmental and
    growing water availability issues. The benefits of active management will vary
    between humid and arid areas. In humid areas it will be possible to store water
    from rainfall to support crop growth. In humid areas with relatively flat topography
    the drainage system can have a dual use as a subsurface irrigation system and
    drainage system. In arid areas active management will require narrower spacing
    with shallower drain lateral placement than traditional criteria. This may have
    a significant positive impact on drainage water quality because the depth of flow
    path has been reduced but may increase installation costs (Christen and Ayars,
    2001). With integrated management comes the need to modify irrigation schedules
    to incorporate in situ crop water use from shallow groundwater (Ayars and Hutmacher,
    1994). In addition to the total seasonal water use, crop coefficients and estimating
    procedures will need to be developed for use in irrigation schedules that include
    direct contributions from the groundwater table and salinity effects on production.
    These studies will need to be continued for a wide range of crops in both humid
    and arid regions. Drainage Water Treatment and Disposal The difference in pollutants
    in drainage water outflows between humid and arid areas has resulted in different
    strategies for reuse and remediation of degraded water. In humid areas N loading
    and pesticide and herbicides are the principal pollutants, while dissolved salts
    are the principal pollutants although N loading is also a concern in irrigated
    agriculture. Point of discharge treatment and in-line biological reactors coupled
    with flow control are being evaluated for reducing N loading in drainage water.
    Treatment options can include the use of wetlands and vegetated ditches at the
    point of discharge to reduce N through plant uptake and volatilization and denitrification
    (Herzon and Helenius, 2008). Biological reactors with wood chips installed at
    the end of the system prior to discharge are also being evaluated for denitrification
    (Greenan et al., 2009). These are potentially viable solutions but additional
    information is required to quantify the efficiency of the systems based on the
    N loading, flow rates, effective lifespan, maintenance and potential design changes
    that may affect the operation. A sequential use biological system for reuse of
    saline drainage water was developed in response to the problem of disposal of
    saline drainage water. This system is called serial biological concentration (SBC)
    in Australia (Blackwell et al., 2005), and integrated on-farm drainage management
    (IFDM) in the United States (Cervinka et al., 1999; Ayars and Basinal, 2005).
    In this system subsurface drainage systems are designed to collect deep percolation
    and discharge it to a sump for use as supplemental irrigation on salt-tolerant
    crops. This procedure is repeated until the salinity of the deep percolate can
    no longer be used for irrigation. At this stage the water is discharged into an
    evaporation facility. The major weakness of this system is that the final disposal
    of the accumulated salts needs to be appropriately addressed. This system requires
    a system design that is capable of controlling the groundwater table position
    and collecting and controlling the discharge. Strategies have been proposed for
    blending saline drainage water with low salinity water to reduce the salinity
    and make it suitable for irrigation or alternating saline and good quality water
    for irrigation (Rhoades, 1989; Grattan and Oster, 2003). The option selected will
    depend on the available water supplies, crop salt tolerance and ability to manage
    the water supply. Continued research is needed to refine salt management strategies
    for integrated irrigation and drainage systems in light of new data on crop salt
    tolerance and potential strategies for salt management in the soil profile. Challenges
    One of the major challenges facing agriculture is to determine various institutional
    and on-farm management strategies to make more water available for crop production
    and still have a sustainable, integrated food production system (Oster and Wichelns,
    2003). It is clear that more effective subsurface drainage systems must be part
    of the solution and that integrated irrigation–drainage management strategies
    for arid and humid regions must be developed in this critical effort. Future design
    and management criteria should include in situ crop water use, and water quality
    considerations for concentration and pollutant loads of the drainage water (Ayars
    et al., 1997). Additional research is needed to develop and evaluate alternative
    systems for managing N in the system and for remediation and removal of nitrate
    and other forms of nitrogen in the drainage water at the point of discharge. Controlled
    drainage is a critical future component of sustainable water management in both
    humid and arid areas that will require active management of the drainage system
    operation. This will require the development of a decision support system (DSS).
    A DSS for adaptive control of integrated irrigation and drainage systems should
    include plant growth models. The principles of site-specific agriculture will
    need to be included in the design and operation of irrigation and drainage systems
    in the future (Sadler et al., 2005). New statistical processes will be required
    to integrate these extremely large soil data sets from diverse sources at multiple
    scales into the planning and design process, as well as for various active management
    strategies. With the ability to better characterize the spatial distribution of
    soil parameters, it will be possible to develop and quickly evaluate multiple
    alternative drainage system designs using computer models that better represent
    the distribution of soil types and layering within a field or region. Thus, only
    the most critical data will need to be collected, to more precisely determine
    the design criteria for the best alternatives which could also substantially reduce
    the collection and scope of field data. A major question to be answered is: what
    detail of soil characterization is necessary to achieve a specific goal (e.g.
    discharge intensity) and what is the impact on the design and potential operation
    of the system or are there other strategies that will get to the same result?
    Haan and Skaggs (2003) determined that lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity
    accounted for 81% of the uncertainty related to computed drainage volumes using
    the DRAINMOD model. Research is needed to determine which parameters are the most
    critical for design and what confidence intervals are required for each parameter
    in the design process. In irrigated areas alternative water supplies such as treated
    municipal wastewater, water from food processing, animal waste lagoon water, and
    other industrial sources may become a significant portion of the available irrigation
    supply. Use of these water supplies creates additional concerns for water quality
    and nutrient management. Infectious diseases, E. coli, heavy metals, phosphorus
    loads and pharmaceuticals are potential pollutants that may be found in the irrigation
    supply from these sources. Cracking soils and soils with large macropores provide
    a direct circuit from the applied water, either irrigation or rainfall, to subsurface
    drainage systems. Conventional thinking assumes that there might be significant
    remediation of some of these pollutants in the soil, but short-circuiting may
    be a real problem. Future drainage designs and management will have to consider
    these potential sources as well. Most of the discussion in this paper has centered
    on the technical issues associated with the design and operation of subsurface
    drainage systems as they relate to sustaining agricultural production and minimizing
    impacts on the environment. The environmental interface will be a critical component
    as we move forward with the deployment of advanced drainage systems. In many coastal
    areas wetlands were replaced by agriculture and the question is whether it was
    a viable trade-off. Should we consider restoration of some wetlands in areas that
    are difficult to manage in agriculture? One question for the future is what is
    the public is willing to pay to protect the environment? In some instances, wetland
    and coastal areas are significant sources of the population''s livelihood and
    need to be protected. A significant issue will be what to do with existing drainage
    systems. Should these simply be repaired and replaced as is or should these systems
    be modified to reflect a new reality of improving water quality and conserving
    water? What does this mean for future designs? If the recommendation is to replace
    an existing system for environmental improvement, whose responsibility is it to
    pay for these modifications? Is there a public benefit that should be shared?
    A particularly vexing question is who is then responsible for the construction,
    maintenance and operation of the facilities that are required for the discharge
    of water collected from farmers’ fields (Schultz et al., 2013). Farmers have made
    the decision to install and manage a drainage system for economic reasons, e.g.
    improve productivity, but this still serves a greater good, i.e. feed the world,
    lower food costs. While the farmer has the responsibility for a field drainage
    system that is a direct benefit to him, the question remains, what entity has
    the responsibility for the entire system? This will have to be resolved as part
    of the design process. Groundwater pumping by tubewells is practiced extensively
    throughout the world to provide irrigation as well as drainage (Siebert et al.,
    2010; Bouarfa and Kuper, 2012). This is true particularly in Pakistan and India
    where tubewell usage has increased significantly over the years to provide a supplemental
    water supply. These systems can be localized and operated to benefit a single
    grower and thus provide security and control. However, well drainage is not generally
    as effective as subsurface drainage lines in providing a uniform control of the
    groundwater table position. Additionally, there is a requirement for power and
    the operating costs may be considerably higher. While an important component of
    water management, groundwater wells were not the focus of this manuscript and
    need to be considered elsewhere. Conclusions The future needs of the world for
    food and fiber are readily apparent, the stakes are high, and drainage will be
    critical to meeting the demand. However, to do this it will require significant
    changes in the design and operation of future drainage systems. These will include:
    drainage water quality will be a necessary criterion for system design; active
    management of the groundwater table position and discharge to manage pollutant
    loads and to conserve water for crop use will be essential; improved methods are
    needed for collection of soil physical and hydrologic properties to provide better
    spatial characterization to improve designs; the design will be an iterative process
    that includes agronomic production and environmental values; methods of disposal
    of drainage water will have to be developed to minimize the environmental impact
    and maximize the use of the water resource; impacted water supplies will be the
    future for irrigation and will have to be considered in the design and operation
    of drainage systems; drainage in arid areas will become part of an integrated
    water management system that includes the design and operation of both the irrigation
    and drainage system to meet crop water requirements and provide maximum water
    productivity. Many of the components exist but much research is needed to refine
    them and integrate them into a single system. Meeting the above goals will only
    be possible through the development of decision support systems (DSS) that can
    be used to optimize the design and operation of drainage systems in humid areas
    and irrigation and drainage systems in arid areas. Acknowledgement ‘The US Department

  extract_1: Traditional Colombian agriculture is characterized by the use of ancient
    techniques that have been applied by several generations of Colombian farmers
    and are still in use today, either because they are associated with deep-rooted
    cultural knowledge or because the technological gap is an obstacle to the adaptation
    and application of new technologies in agriculture.
  extract_2: Given that traditional agricultural practices continue to be used in
    most agricultural work, the boom in precision agriculture has been occurring in
    the last decade with the implementation of technologies and the development of
    projects in the cultivation of relevant agricultural products in the country,
    such as coffee, sugarcane, and oil palm.

    \ the development of Agriculture 4.0 has \ntaken place, which encompasses concepts\
    \ ranging from precision agriculture, moni-\ntoring, decision-making; as well\
    \ as those related to Industry 4.0, IoT, machine learning, \nsustainability and\

    \ the activities that has contributed significant-\nly to the country’s development,\
    \ with the agricultural sector being one of the main \ncontributors to the Colombian\
    \ economy and sustainable development. Given the geo-\ngraphical and climatic\

    \ have great potential, but due to factors related to productivity, innovation,\
    \ \nquality standards, among others, the country’s agricultural development has\
    \ lagged \nand the need to establish policies in line with the technological advances\
    \ of agriculture \nworldwide is increasing [1].\nAn Agricultural Production Unit\
    \ - APU is defined as an agricultural production \norganization unit that produces\
    \ agricultural, forestry, livestock, and aquaculture goods. \nIt also has a single\

    \ have been implemented that involve the application of ICT and \nIoT and that\
    \ can be considered as a basis for the further development of Agriculture \n4.0\
    \ in the country. Based on the above, this article presents a review of the most\
    \ rel-\nevant aspects related to the technological development of Colombian agriculture\
    \ and \nprojects that have been carried out in the country in the field of precision\
    \ agriculture. It \nalso addresses the context of the progress of Agriculture\

    \ of the development of Agriculture 4.0 in the country \nare highlighted, emphasising\
    \ through this work the importance and necessity of the \nconsolidation of Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 to strengthen national agricultural development.\n2. PRECISION AGRICULTURE\
    \ IN COLOMBIA\nPrecision agriculture “is a concept of agricultural management\
    \ that uses digital tech-\nniques to monitor and optimize agricultural production\
    \ processes” [4, p. 4]. Precision \nagriculture aims to optimize the management\
    \ of agricultural production by taking into \naccount soil and crop variability,\
    \ by using technologies that allow agricultural activ-\nities to be adjusted according\
    \ to the specific requirements of the soil and the plant. \nThe beginnings of\
    \ precision agriculture date back to the late 1980s in Europe and \nthe United\
    \ States, while in Latin America it began in the late 1990s and early 2000s, \n\
    with Argentina and Brazil being pioneers in the implementation of precision agricul-\n\
    ture practices. In Colombia, given that traditional agricultural practices continue\
    \ to be \nused in most agricultural work, the boom in precision agriculture has\
    \ been occurring \nin the last decade with the implementation of technologies\
    \ and the development of \nprojects in the cultivation of relevant agricultural\
    \ products in the country, such as \ncoffee, sugarcane, and oil palm.\nThe traditional\
    \ agricultural practices prevailing in the country have brought \nabout adverse\
    \ effects reflected in low crop productivity, inefficient use of resources, \n\
    7\nJosé Ignacio Rodríguez Molano, Yeimy Andrea Montoya Alvarez, Leonardo Emiro\
    \ Contreras Bravo\nIngeniería Solidaria\ne-ISSN 2357-6014 / Vol. 18, no. 2 / may-august\
    \  2022 / Bogotá D.C., Colombia\nUniversidad Cooperativa de Colombia\nand generalized\
    \ management of crops without taking into account their specificities, \nwhich\
    \ have a negative impact on both the farmers’ economy –since profitability is\
    \ \ndetermined by the potential of their crops– and on the environment –since\
    \ the eco-\nlogical impact caused by the inadequate management of inputs and resources\
    \ con-\ntributes to land degradation–. Based on this, precision agriculture has\
    \ made inroads \nin Colombian agriculture as a solution to the counterproductive\
    \ effects of traditional \nagricultural practices, generating benefits such as\
    \ increased crop productivity due to \nthe use of the production potential of\
    \ the land, reduced use of fertilizers, and waste \nof resources since their use\
    \ is based on the specific requirements of the crop and/or \nsoil, reduced negative\
    \ impacts due to land degradation and reduced production costs.\nThe development\
    \ and implementation of precision agriculture technologies in \nthe country have\
    \ been achieved as a result of research work by universities, institu-\ntions,\
    \ research centers for Colombian agricultural products, and public and private\
    \ \ncompanies, such as the National University of Colombia, the University of\
    \ the Llanos, \nthe University of Nariño, Cenicaña, Cenicafé, Cenipalma, SENA,\
    \ IGAC and Ingenio Río \nPaila-Castilla, among others. In most cases, the precision\
    \ agriculture applications \nand projects developed a focus on aspects such as\
    \ soil variability analysis, use of \ngeographic information, use of sensors,\
    \ and drones [5].\nRegarding unmanned aerial vehicles or drones, their boom in\
    \ the country began \nin 2015, being used in remote sensing processes as part\
    \ of precision agriculture tech-\nnologies focused on crop management. The images\
    \ obtained by drones, also known \nas UAV’s (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), are mostly\
    \ used in the activities of monitoring, \ntracking, and identification of diseases\
    \ in crops of a smaller extension of land; while \nfor crops of large extensions\
    \ the use of satellite images is employed [6].\nConcerning the application of\
    \ precision agriculture technologies and the lay-\nout of plantations along with\
    \ the management of pests and crop diseases, research \nconducted by the Center\
    \ for Oil Palm Research (Cenipalma) in 2011 showed that \nby performing the automatic\
    \ layout of plantations with the use of AMS technology \n(Agricultural Management\
    \ Solutions of the brand John Deere) a significant improve-\nment in the performance\
    \ of this activity can be obtained if compared to the perfor-\nmance obtained\
    \ by doing the layout manually; additionally, the effectiveness of the \nuse of\
    \ geographic information technologies in activities related to agronomic man-\n\
    agement activities was demonstrated [7]. With the support of Corpoica (Colombian\
    \ \nAgricultural Research Corporation), research was conducted in 2015 related\
    \ to the \nanalysis of multispectral images using drones [8], from which it was\
    \ concluded that \nthe use of this precision agriculture technology is very useful\
    \ when carrying out activ-\nities related to the monitoring and diagnosis of the\
    \ development conditions of a crop; \n8\nColombian agriculture: approaching agriculture\
    \ 4.0.\nIngeniería Solidaria\ne-ISSN 2357-6014 / Vol. 18, no. 2/may-august 2022\
    \ / Bogotá D.C., Colombia\nUniversidad Cooperativa de Colombia\nas drones facilitate\
    \ the use of multispectral cameras from which images of varied \ntonalities can\
    \ be obtained to identify problems in specific areas of the crop.\nRegarding the\
    \ application of precision agriculture in the fertilization process, \nin 2018\
    \ an investigation was carried out on banana crops using satellite images, \n\
    drones for the collection of aerial images and sensors to perform measurements\
    \ of \nsoil variables, to obtain the characterization of the soil and subsequently\
    \ identify and \ndetermine the agronomic management units (AMU); these being understood\
    \ as “a \nspatial unit of cultivation within which there is relative homogeneity\
    \ in the variables \nthat affect productivity” [9, pp. 42-51]. With this, it was\
    \ possible to establish with great-\ner precision the number of inputs required\
    \ for each AMU according to its specific \ncharacteristics, thus reaching the\
    \ conclusion that the fertilization plan developed for \neach AMU, based on the\
    \ information obtained through the application of precision \nagriculture technologies,\
    \ decreases production costs as the use of fertilizers is lower \ncompared to\
    \ traditional management [10].\n3. AGRICULTURE 4.0 IN COLOMBIA\nAgriculture 4.0\
    \ began in the early 2010s with the development and evolution of tech-\nnologies\
    \ such as sensors, ICT systems, microprocessors, IoT, and Big Data [11]. It \n\
    “consists of the integration of agricultural processes with information technologies,\
    \ \nusing algorithms, massive amounts of data acquired in the field by sensors,\
    \ to in-\ncrease crop productivity and improve the management of rural properties”\
    \ [12, p. 13]. \nIn this way, the incursion of smart technologies in agriculture\
    \ gave way to the mod-\nernization of various activities and processes that have\
    \ transformed the agricultural \nproduction chain in several countries, thus achieving\
    \ the optimization of fieldwork \nthanks to the use of tools related to information\
    \ technologies, Big Data and data sci-\nence, and automation [12].\nAs support\
    \ for decision making related to crop management, Agriculture 4.0 \nuses tools\
    \ such as sensors to obtain data from the field, IoT to send the data ob-\ntained\
    \ to the network, cloud computing technologies to access data and information\
    \ \non the Internet, Big Data for the analysis of the data and information collected,\
    \ and in \nsome cases connectivity between mobile devices and machine-to-machine\
    \ (M2M) \ncommunication [13]. According to the World Government Summit [14], some\
    \ of the \ntechnologies employed in Agriculture 4.0 that are contributing to the\
    \ transformation of \nagriculture focus on the use of new techniques for food\
    \ production such as hydropon-\nic agriculture, and the incorporation of technologies\
    \ such as automation, IoT, drones in \n9\nJosé Ignacio Rodríguez Molano, Yeimy\

    Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia\nplanting activities, irrigation, crop analysis,\
    \ and monitoring, and Blockchain to optimize \ntraceability and security in food\
    \ supply chains.  \nDue to the technological and digital gap and the lack of policies\
    \ in line with \ncurrent technological advances, the development of Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 has not been fully \nadopted in the country; however, in recent years, some\
    \ actions, projects, and research \nhave been carried out that can be considered\
    \ as the foundations for a future incursion \nof Agriculture 4.0 in Colombia.\
    \ One of these actions was the creation, in 2017, of the \n“Strategic Plan for\
    \ Science, Technology, and Innovation of the Colombian Agricultural \nSector 2017-2027\
    \ (PECTIA for its Spanish acronym)” and the National Agricultural \nInnovation\
    \ System (SNIA for its Spanish acronym). These strategies are designed to \nimprove\
    \ productivity, sustainability and strengthen the Colombian agricultural sector\
    \ \nthrough research, innovation, knowledge management and technological development\
    \ \nactivities [15]. Another foundational action for the development of Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 in the \ncountry took place in recent years with the implementation of the\
    \ Smart Agro 4.0; a \nproject of FAO in collaboration with the company Telefónica,\
    \ which also had coverage \nin Peru and El Salvador, and whose implementation\
    \ began in 2018 and ended in 2020. \nThis pilot project aimed to apply innovation\
    \ and digitalization technologies to promote \nsustainable agricultural practices,\
    \ for which it made use of an integrated system that \nallowed control activities,\
    \ monitoring, and prediction of agronomic variables, using \nwater sensors and\
    \ a mathematical model for obtaining and processing crop data. In \nthe case of\
    \ Colombia, the project was carried out in potato and coffee crops and, by \n\
    2019, the results obtained showed that potato production had doubled, its quality\
    \ had \nimproved and there was a decrease of approximately 44% in unit production\
    \ costs; \nall achieved thanks to the implementation of technological improvements\
    \ in the crop \nirrigation systems [16].\nRegarding research developed in the\
    \ country and that have applied Agriculture \n4.0 tools, there is the implementation\
    \ of a wireless sensor network for the irrigation \ncontrol system of a strawberry\
    \ crop in the highlands of Pasto [17], from which informa-\ntion is obtained on\
    \ soil moisture in various areas of the crop and subsequently deter-\nmines the\
    \ specific area and the required irrigation time of the same. This is executed\
    \ \nthrough a closed-loop control system that uses soil moisture, which is measured\

    AGRICULTURE\nGlobally, several types of research have been carried out to develop\
    \ complements \nand technological solutions that improve the performance and productivity\
    \ of agri-\ncultural activities, taking into account the aspects covered by Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 and its \nimplementation through IoT technologies which, when applied to\
    \ agriculture, com-\nprise some main aspects which are: Physical structure or\
    \ hardware components, \ndata acquisition, and their respective processing and\
    \ analysis [19]. In this way, pro-\nposed architectures for precision agriculture\
    \ have been generated, mostly focused on \nmonitoring crop variables.\nIn Colombia,\
    \ for example, researchers from Armenia and Popayán conducted \nan IoT architecture\
    \ proposal for the analysis of climatic variables of a crop based on \nthe Lambda\
    \ architecture to establish the layers of the structure of the proposed archi-\n\
    tecture [20], which consist of: a Capture layer, made up of hardware components\
    \ such \nas sensors and data acquisition modules; a storage layer, to store the\
    \ data collected \nthrough databases and storage servers; a processing layer,\
    \ in which data analysis is \ncarried out using interpretation tools; and a query\
    \ layer, which provides the visualiza-\ntion of the information to the end-user\
    \ to know the behavior of the climatic variables \nof the crop, as well as receive\
    \ recommendations to make decisions according to the \nrequirements presented\
    \ by the crop (Figure 4). This proposed architecture highlights \nthe use of low-cost\
    \ sensors and the Arduino YUN board for their ease of use as tools to \ncapture\
    \ the climatic variables of the crop, as well as the use of the free software\
    \ Weka \nfor data mining, with which the information was presented to the user\
    \ in the graphical \ninterface of the query layer. \n11\nJosé Ignacio Rodríguez\

    \ improve crop \nproduction [21]. The architecture of this platform is composed\
    \ of four layers (Figure \n5): Collection, which includes sensors and actuators\
    \ as hardware components of the \nplatform; communication, where through the use\
    \ of the ZigBee protocol the collected \ndata are sent to a cloud storage server;\
    \ management, where a cloud server analysis \nof such data is performed; and consultation,\
    \ which presents the information through \nweb pages and with an interface that\
    \ allows the end-user to activate the systems, \neither manually, automatically\
    \ or timed according to the decisions made based on the \ncrop status information.\n\

    \ agricultural activities such as soil sampling and mapping through sen-\nsors\
    \ that inform the user of the state and properties of the soil; crop irrigation\
    \ with pro-\ngrammed and more efficient systems; precise fertilizer application\
    \ according to the \nrequirements of each crop zone; pest and disease control\
    \ using sensors and image \nprocessing tools; and crop monitoring using monitors\
    \ and yield maps [23]. Geographic \nInformation Systems or GIS are also part of\
    \ the application tools for precision ag-\nriculture. These are software with\
    \ data storage and processing modules that have \na defined geographic location,\
    \ allowing for the analysis, monitoring, simulation and \npresentation of large\
    \ amounts of data and information in the form of graphs, maps and \nmultimedia\
    \ systems. The application of this type of geoprocessing tool, with which \ncrop\
    \ spatial variability mapping can be performed, is of great help to manage agri-\n\
    cultural production systems in areas with low productivity as they support decision\
    \ \nmaking based on the state and requirements of the crop [24]. Such spatial\
    \ variability \nof crops can be estimated by: continuous measurement methods such\
    \ as yield mon-\nitors, discrete ones such as soil sampling, and remote ones such\
    \ as the use of satellite \nimagery. Yield monitors consist of devices that perform\
    \ periodic measurements of \nthe flow of harvested material and, from this, calculate\
    \ a crop yield value, generating \nestimates with which yield maps can be constructed,\
    \ which graphically present crop \nyield data and thus allow for the identification\
    \ of areas that require intervention to \nimprove their production [25].\nAnother\
    \ of the Agriculture 4.0 tools that can be more extensively applicable to \nthe\
    \ variety of crops in the country consists of the wireless sensor network, whose\
    \ \nuse and application extends to activities such as land monitoring, greenhouses,\
    \ and \nautomated irrigation systems; this is based on the measurement of environmental\
    \ \nfactors through the deployment of two types of sensor nodes: the source node,\
    \ which \nperforms measurements of the environment and collects this data, and\
    \ the receiver \nnode, which collects the information from the source node [26].\
    \ As presented in [27], \nthrough the use of an automation system composed of\
    \ sensors and actuators, and \nmonitoring and control software, better results\
    \ are obtained when installing an auto-\nmatic control system for a greenhouse\
    \ crop, as this eliminates the uncertainty factors \nassociated with manual crop\
    \ control, as there is greater precision and control of cli-\nmatic conditions\
    \ and environmental variables, leading to better results in terms of crop \ngrowth\
    \ and development. Complementary to the above, and taking as a reference the \n\
    projects developed in several European countries, automated crop monitoring could\
    \ \nalso be considered as a technology applicable to Colombian agriculture to\
    \ optimize \nthe performance of some agricultural activities; it uses probes and\
    \ sensors to collect \ndata and, based on the interpretation of these data through\

    \ AND IMPLICATIONS OF\nAGRICULTURE 4.0 IN COLOMBIA\nAccording to the Food and\
    \ Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the \nincursion of digital\
    \ technologies in agriculture can generate benefits in three relevant \nareas:\
    \ environmental, with systems that adapt to climate change, and by optimizing\
    \ \nthe use of resources required in agricultural production; economic, reducing\
    \ pro-\nduction costs and increasing agricultural productivity; and social, allowing\
    \ greater \ninclusion. For this, the country must have essential conditions for\
    \ the proper ap-\nplication of digital technologies and to make way for the digital\
    \ transformation of \nColombian agriculture, such as ensuring the affordability\
    \ of smartphones to farmers, \nimproving infrastructure and connectivity to enable\
    \ Internet access in different terri-\ntories nationwide, training and educating\
    \ the population on the use of ICTs and digital \ntools, and establishing policies\
    \ and programs that promote the digital transformation \nof agriculture and agricultural\
    \ development [29].\nTraditional Colombian agriculture has always been affected\
    \ by extreme weath-\ner events such as the El Niño and La Niña phenomena, which\
    \ cause crops in various \nregions nationwide to be damaged by droughts, rains,\
    \ or frosts. Given this, the im-\nplementation of Agriculture 4.0 practices in\
    \ the country would constitute an efficient \nsolution to face and adapt to climate\
    \ changes, contributing to the reduction of the \neconomic losses generated by\
    \ them and affecting farmers. This highlights the need \nfor the country to eliminate\
    \ or minimize the existing technological and digital divide, \nand to invest in\
    \ education so that society acquires digital knowledge that will not \nonly be\
    \ necessary and beneficial when applied in the agricultural context but will also\
    \ \ncontribute to the development and progress of the nation in general.\nHowever,\
    \ climate change and low agricultural productivity, global population \ngrowth,\
    \ and with this the increased demand for natural resources and food, are fun-\n\
    damental aspects associated with agriculture and represent challenges to be faced\
    \ \nwith the application of technological practices of Agriculture 4.0 [14]; this,\
    \ added to \nthe challenges that have arisen when developing Agriculture 4.0 in\
    \ other countries \nand that should also be considered for its advancements in\
    \ Colombia, such as those \nrelated to low internet coverage and connectivity,\
    \ the workforce that is not trained in \ntechnology, and aversion to it [23].\n\

    \ related to Agriculture 4.0 have been developed \nin the country, to achieve\
    \ its consolidation at the national level it is necessary to invest \nin technology\
    \ and provide education and training to the actors involved in the agri-\ncultural\
    \ sector so that they obtain the knowledge required to apply the technological\
    \ \nmodels and tools in their crops according to their capabilities and requirements.\n\
    Given that, at the national level, the implementation of automation in the ag-\n\
    ricultural sector is scarce, the promotion of research in this area will contribute\
    \ to \nthe development of advances and projects that will strengthen the deployment\
    \ of \nAgriculture 4.0 in the country. In this way, the application of Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 practices in \nthe country will allow farmers to optimize agricultural activities,\
    \ improve crop produc-\ntivity and take advantage of their potential, reduce costs\
    \ and production requirements, \nbe competitive, adapt to change, and produce\
    \ sustainably.\nTo meet the challenges affecting the agricultural sector, it is\
    \ necessary for \nColombian farmers to gradually replace traditional production\
    \ methods and adopt \nmodern technological practices, allowing their activities\
    \ to adapt to change and im-\nprove food production. In this way, the application\
    \ of Agriculture 4.0 will contribute to \nstrengthening and promoting the development\
    \ of national agriculture.\nREFERENCES\n[1] \nMinisterio de Agricultura y Desarrollo\

  description: The objective of irrigation reservoirs is to maximise crop productivity
    by efficient use of water supply. To tackle optimisation problems, conventional
    and meta-heuristic optimisation approaches are frequently used. In the current
    study, a meta-heuristic evolutionary algorithm called the genetic algorithm is
    used to solve the problem of reservoir operation for irrigation. In a situation
    with several crops, the main goal is to optimise crop output. The additive function
    for one formulation and the product function for another are solved. The study
    area chosen for the model’s application is a reservoir in Madhya Pradesh which
    is a central state of India. The reservoir is filled in Monsoon season (June–September)
    and the storage water is used for irrigating crops in Rabi Season. The reservoir
    gets filled up to different levels of storage each year. For six separate storage
    levels, the optimization problem has been solved. On the MATLAB Platform’s GA
    Solver, the issue is resolved. There are no deficits encountered until the fifth
    level of storage; however, a deficit is found at the sixth level. While the multiplicative
    model maximises the relative yield of other crops, the additive formulation maximises
    the relative yield of wheat. The result shows that the multiplicative model produces
    higher relative yield values.

    Optimisation of Irrigation Water Utilisation of Reservoir by Using Meta-heuristic
    Approach Abhay Kumar Jha, R. S. Parihar & S. M. Narulkar  Conference paper First
    Online: 03 October 2023 129 Accesses Part of the book series: Lecture Notes in
    Civil Engineering ((LNCE,volume 352)) Abstract The objective of irrigation reservoirs
    is to maximise crop productivity by efficient use of water supply. To tackle optimisation
    problems, conventional and meta-heuristic optimisation approaches are frequently
    used. In the current study, a meta-heuristic evolutionary algorithm called the
    genetic algorithm is used to solve the problem of reservoir operation for irrigation.
    In a situation with several crops, the main goal is to optimise crop output. The
    additive function for one formulation and the product function for another are
    solved. The study area chosen for the model’s application is a reservoir in Madhya
    Pradesh which is a central state of India. The reservoir is filled in Monsoon
    season (June–September) and the storage water is used for irrigating crops in
    Rabi Season. The reservoir gets filled up to different levels of storage each
    year. For six separate storage levels, the optimization problem has been solved.
    On the MATLAB Platform’s GA Solver, the issue is resolved. There are no deficits
    encountered until the fifth level of storage; however, a deficit is found at the
    sixth level. While the multiplicative model maximises the relative yield of other
    crops, the additive formulation maximises the relative yield of wheat. The result
    shows that the multiplicative model produces higher relative yield values. Keywords

    conference paper PDF 1 Introduction Agriculture consumes the freshest water globally
    and is arguably the most mismanaged in its use. A nation’s capability to sustain
    its social and economic systems depends on its ability to utilise water for irrigation
    effectively. Maximizing yield per unit of supplied water is the goal of efficient
    water use. Irrigation water management’s primary goal is to increase agricultural
    production per unit of water. This is crucial to India’s ability to sustain its
    social, economic, and environmental systems. In India, rainfall and river runoff
    have a fairly irregular relationship; most rivers have seasonal runoff. Additionally,
    the discrepancy between supply and demand shows marked variation. As a result,
    reservoirs on the rivers are required to close the supply–demand mismatch. In
    India, many reservoirs have been commissioned and put into service. These reservoirs
    are multipurpose projects and are used for hydropower production, irrigation,
    municipal drinking water supply etc. However, most of the reservoirs were built
    exclusively for irrigation. The mainstays of water management systems are reservoirs,
    but they demand significant investments in terms of money, land, and the environment
    planning. Benefits from reservoir are realised only if the reservoir is planned
    and operated in an optimal way. In the last three decades, the focus of researches
    on evolutionary algorithms that imitate the animal genetics or flocking behaviour
    of animals has increased significantly. A conventional optimisation technique
    has been obsolete since decades. Numerous studies have been published and Adeyemo
    [1], Ahmad et al. [2], and Neboh et al. have examined the methodologies [16].
    Genetic algorithms (GA) have been used as a key tool in this category for reservoir
    operation and management. All of the GA’s features are compiled in Goldberg’s
    [12] textbook. The GA is a search heuristic tool that mimics natural evolutionary
    processes including inheritance, mutation, selection, and crossover. Numerous
    studies have helped to improve GA, particularly by merging it with other methods
    (hybrid) and evaluating performance [3, 11, 15] first applied GA to a four-reservoir
    problem in their paper. Nicklow et al. [17] have presented a state of the art
    paper on GA and applied its tool extensions to the water resources management
    problems. The problems of reservoir systems have been dealt extensively by many
    researchers [4]. Reddy and Kumar [18], Jotiprakash and Ganeshsan [13], Azamathulla
    et al. [7], Chen et al. [9], Mathur and Nikam [14], Scola et al. [20], Anand et
    al. [6]. The current study uses a GA model to develop a release programme that
    optimally distributes the reservoir’s water storage across various crops over
    a range of fortnights. The Samrat Ashok Sagar Reservoir on the River Halali in
    the Madhya Pradesh districts of Vidisha and Raisen is the case study. The reservoir’s
    command area is also known as the “bowl of wheat” which means that the wheat is
    produced in abundance in the command area. It produces Sharbati Wheat of the highest
    grade, which is well-known both in India and abroad. 2 Method In the present work,
    the water management problem is optimised using the GA technique. The study’s
    precise goals are to maximise yield and allocate water in a scenario with many
    crops and harvesting scenario. The issue is resolved in three steps. The initial
    step entails acquiring information on the cropping patterns and local meteorological
    data in the command area. The second stage involves calculating the fortnightly
    crop water requirements using the Penman Monteith method [5] and evaluating the
    relative yield ratios using [10] and other sources. The third stage consists of
    data preparation and solving the models to produce results, which are presented
    in the following section. 3 Computation of Demand The CROPWAT-8.0 Software, which
    is an open access freeware, is used to estimate the evapotranspiration of the
    reference crop. The Reference Evapotranspiration (RET), also known as ETo, is
    the rate of evapotranspiration from a reference surface with a hypothetical grass
    crop sown without any water scarcity. It makes use of a variety of inputs pertaining
    to the local area’s climate, geography, soil types, and water quality. The software
    has the required tools to automatically relate the many existing formulae utilising
    the various inputs to generate the water requirements and maximum yield for each
    crop of interest. The software makes the assumption that all other agricultural
    production input elements (such as pesticides, knowledge, seeds, etc.) are maintained
    at their optimum levels. The equation used is the FAO Penman–Monteith Equation.
    The reference evapotranspiration value in ith season (ETo) is calculated as per
    the Eq. 1) (1998) $$ET_{o} = \\frac{{0.408 \\Delta \\left( {R_{n} - G} \\right)
    + \\Upsilon \\frac{900}{{T + 273}} u_{2} \\left( {e_{s} - e_{a} } \\right)}}{{\\Delta
    + \\Upsilon \\left( {1 + 0.34 u_{2} } \\right)}}$$ (1) where: ETo = the reference
    evapotranspiration [mm/day], Rn = net radiation received at the crop surface [MJ
    m−2 day−1], G = the soil heat flux density [MJ m−2 day−1], T = the mean daily
    air temperature at 2 m height [°C], u2 = wind speed at 2 m height [m s−1], es
    =  saturation vapour pressure [kPa] at T [°C], ea = actual vapour pressure [kPa],
    Δ = slope of vapour pressure curve [kPa °C−1], γ = the psychrometric constant
    [kPa °C−1]. The crop evapotranspiration for the various crops sown in an area
    is necessary to determine each crop’s seasonal water needs. The reference evapotranspiration
    (\\(ET_{o}^{i}\\)) values computed for different fortnights i were multiplied
    by the crop coefficient (\\({k}_{c}^{i})\\) to get the crop evapotranspiration
    (\\({ET}_{c}^{i}\\)) (Eq. 2). $$ET_{c}^{i} = k_{c}^{i} * ET_{o}^{i} .$$ (2) 4
    Development of Model The formulation and optimisation of the Samrat Ashok Sagar
    Reservoir’s operation problem is described below along with the constraints of
    the objective function. 4.1 Objective Function In the present study, the two different
    problems with different objective functions were solved. 4.1.1 Additive Model:
    Objective Function 1 The GA model’s Objective function is to minimise the sum
    of the squared deviations of the mass balance equation and the irrigation demand
    deficit. (Eq. 1) The name “additive function” refers to this objective function.
    Reddy and Kumar [18, 19], Azamathulla et al. [7], Mathur and Nikam [14] are only
    a few researchers who have used this type of objective function in the past. The
    objective function was not weighed by the crop sensitivity factor to the water
    deficiency in different growth stages in the works of Reddy and Kumar [18], Mathur
    and Nikam [14]. The objective function in the current study is the squared deficit
    between the releases and demand of each crop in each season (Eq. 3). $$\\begin{aligned}
    {\\text{min}}\\;f\\left( x \\right) & = \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{nc = 1}^{NC}
    \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{t = 1}^{N} ky_{t}^{nc} \\left( {R_{t,nc} - D_{t,nc} }
    \\right)^{2} \\\\ & \\quad + \\;\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{t = 1}^{N} \\left( {S_{t}
    \\left( {1 - B*e_{t} } \\right) - S_{t + 1} \\left( {1 + B*e_{t} } \\right) +
    I_{t} - \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{nc = 1}^{NC} R_{t,nc} - A_{o} *e_{t} } \\right)^{2}
    \\\\ \\end{aligned}$$ (3) Rt,nc = release in the period t = 1, 2…, N for crop
    nc  = 1, 2, …, NC (MCM), Dt,nc = demand to sustain the crop nc  = 1, 2,…, NC in
    the period t  = 1, 2…, T (MCM), \\({ky}_{t}^{nc}\\) = yield response factor for
    time period t = 1, 2…, N of crop nc  = 1, 2…, NC, St  = Storage at time period
    t =  1, 2…, N (MCM), St+1 = Storage at time period t + 1 (MCM), It = Inflow at
    time period t =  1, 2…, N (MCM), Ao and B  =  Regression constant correlating
    surface area (Ha) and storage value, \\({e}_{t}\\) = Rate of evaporation at each
    fortnight in (mm). 4.1.2 Multiplicative Model: Objective Function 2 The multiplicative
    model (Eq. 4) is more realistic and takes into account the effect of deficits
    to other seasons. In contrast, the additive model discussed in the previous paragraph
    has the limitation that it works in local time and the optimisation model does
    not have the effect of the deficits that occurred in other time periods. $$\\begin{aligned}
    {\\text{min}}\\;f\\left( x \\right) & = \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{nc = 1}^{NC}
    \\mathop \\prod \\limits_{t = 1}^{N} ky_{t}^{nc} \\left( {R_{t,nc} - D_{t,nc}
    } \\right)^{2} \\\\ & \\quad + \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{t = 1}^{N} \\left( {S_{t}
    \\left( {1 - B*e_{t} } \\right) - S _{t + 1} \\left( {1 + B*e_{t} } \\right) +
    I_{t} - \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{nc = 1}^{NC} R_{t,nc} - A_{o} *e_{t} } \\right)^{2}
    \\\\ \\end{aligned}$$ (4) 4.2 Constraints Constraints of the Objective functions
    are two; Demand constraint and Capacity Constraint which are based on maximum
    irrigation demand and live storage capacity of the reservoir. 4.2.1 Demand/Release
    Constraints (Irrigation Demand) To sustain the crops, irrigation releases must
    be more than or equal to zero. However, they must not exceed the maximum irrigation
    demand in order to achieve the desired yield. $${0} \\le R_{t,nc} \\le D_{t,nc}$$
    (5) 4.2.2 Capacity Constraints (Reservoir Storage) Each fortnight, the reservoir’s
    storage should not be more or less than its live storage or less than its dead
    storage. $${\\text{S}}_{\\min } \\le {\\text{S}}_{{\\text{t}}} \\le {\\text{S}}_{\\max
    }$$ (6) Reservoir data were subjected to a reservoir operation study based on
    the models discussed in the text. The results show that, even in situations with
    insufficient storage, the optimisation strategy can improve the annual net benefits.
    Under a multi-crop scenario there is a competition for the available water whenever
    the water available is less than the irrigation demands. The reservoir operation
    component releases water from the reservoir optimally, while the multi-crop water
    allocation component distributes water to various crops by evaluating how sensitive
    crop production is to moisture stress at various plant physiological growth phases.
    For operation throughout the Rabi (dry weather) Season, a single reservoir with
    multiple crop irrigation is taken into consideration in the current study. The
    evaluation and model formulation of various components of the study are presented
    in following paragraphs. 5 Data Collection and Discussion The data used in the
    analysis was gathered from a number of sources including The Central Water Commission
    [8] and various state level offices of the M.P. The information regarding the
    cropping pattern and physical characteristics of the reservoir was provided by
    Water Resources Departments in Bhopal, the IMD website, the Water Portal website,
    and other sources. The irrigation during the Rabi Season is taken into account
    in the current issue, and in Table 1 the cropping pattern is displayed. The uncertainty
    of the monsoon season in India directly affects the runoff to the reservoir, which
    could cause variations in the reservoirs’ filling levels. To investigate the issue
    in the current study, 6 alternative beginning storage levels in the reservoir
    were used. These are 204.2, 181.52, 158.53, 136.14, 113.45, 226.9 (full storage),
    181.52, and the rest. The total command area is 37419 Ha, of which 32292 Ha, or
    86.30%, will be covered by the reservoir system. Table 2 displays the crop duration
    used for the present study. Table 3 displays the evapotranspiration values for
    the chosen reference crop. Table 1 Rabi season (cropping patterns) Full size table

    Full size table 6 Computation of Water Demand The computation of a season reference
    Evapo-Transpiration (ETo) values for the command area have been calculated for
    various growth seasons of Rabi Season (Dry Weather) crops using the local meteorological
    data and the CROPWAT 8.0 Software. The crop evapotranspiration coefficients were
    multiplied by the ETo values to create the crop evapo-transpiration (ETc) values
    for various crops (Eq. 2). Eventually, after the correct conversion and application
    of efficiency factors, the demands for the various seasons were calculated using
    the net sown area. In Table 4, sample findings for the Wheat crop are displayed.
    The demands for other crops have been calculated along similar lines. Table 4

    at Various Initial Storages The problem was approached using both the Additive
    and Multiplicative Models, according to the formulation described in the preceding
    discussions (Eqs. 3–6). For the Wheat crop, Fig. 1 calculates and displays the
    real demands, computed releases from the Additive Model and the Multiplicative
    Models in each week for various levels of beginning reservoir storage values.
    Fig. 1 Fortnightly demand/release computed by both models (for Wheat) Full size
    image Both models estimated the releases for various crops in the command area
    in a similar way. The objective of the present study is to increase all crops’
    yield ratios in order to increase production. By dividing the total volume by
    the crop area and using the proper conversion factor, the releases calculated
    from the optimisation model for various crops in various fortnights at various
    levels of initial storage values in the reservoir are used to determine the amount
    of water to be supplied to the crop. The procedure comprises of solving three
    equations (Eqs. 7–9) at each time step to solve for the Actual Evapo-transpiration
    and the soil moisture storage in the root zone of each crop in various time periods.
    The relative yield is computed as per Eq. (10). $${\\mathrm{SM}}_{t+1}*{Z}_{t+1}={\\mathrm{SM}}_{t}*{Z}_{t}+{R}_{t}+{X}_{t}+{S}_{o}\\left({Z}_{t+1}-{Z}_{t}\\right)-{\\mathrm{AET}}_{t}$$

    image 8 Conclusion The present study is based on the operation of an irrigation
    reservoir namely the Samrat Ashok Sagar Reservoir (Halali Project) in Vidisha
    and Raisen Districts of Madhya Pradesh. The study is focussed on optimising irrigation
    water use for five crops in the command area during the Rabi season of arid weather.
    A Genetic Algorithm is used as the optimisation technique on the MATLAB platform.
    Two optimisation problems were formulated and solved using GA. The first is an
    additive model in which minimisation function is used and the weighted squared
    deviation of the demands/actual releases for all crops in all seasons is added.
    The weights represent the relative crop yield factors for the various time periods.
    The second is a multiplicative model that aims to minimise the weighted squared
    deviation addition for all crops during a season when they are multiplied together
    during the whole cropping season. Different levels of the reservoirs’ initial
    storage values were applied to the models. The study’s findings show that the
    model can be applied to optimally operate reservoirs for irrigation planning.
    The water is distributed among the various crops in various time periods in an
    optimal manner by the model created in the current study. There is competition
    among the crops at a reservoir storage level of 113.45 MCM inspite of all of the
    crops’ demands for higher storage values having met fully. At this level, supply
    deficits and deficit allocations are made in order to maximise potential relative
    yields. The findings for the additive model show that the principal crop wheat
    receives all the required water at this initial storage level. Water shortages
    affect the other crops. When the multiplicative model is solved, the other crops
    benefit at the expense of a production shortfall of wheat. Even under deficit
    situations, the multiplicative model typically produces better relative yield
    figures than the additive model. References Adeyemo JA (2011) Reservoir operation

  description: Minimizing the offloading latency of agricultural drip irrigation and
    fertilization tasks has long been a pressing issue in agricultural drip irrigation
    and fertilization wireless sensor networks (AIFWSNs). The introduction of edge
    computing as a robust and practical aid to cloud computing in AIFWSNs can significantly
    improve the execution speed of agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization
    tasks and effectively reduce the task offloading latency. Therefore, this paper
    investigates the optimization method of drip irrigation and fertilization task
    offloading delay in AIFWSNs based on edge computing and proposes a new edge task
    offloading method for AIFWSNs, namely, Quantum Chaotic Genetic Optimization Algorithm
    (QCGA). This paper introduces a novel quantum operator in QCGA, comprising a quantum
    non-gate and a quantum rotation gate, to improve the algorithm’s global search
    capability. The quantum operator accomplishes the updating of quantum rotating
    gates without querying the quantum rotation angle table, which reduces the computational
    complexity of introducing quantum optimization into the task offloading problem
    of AIFWSNs. This paper proposes a new chaotic operator to make the initial solution
    more uniformly distributed in the search space by chaotic mapping. This paper’s
    simulation experiments compared QCGA and snake optimizer (SO), genetic algorithm
    (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), sequential offloading, and random offloading
    methods. Simulation results showed that, compared with SO, GA, PSO, sequential
    offloading, and random offloading methods, the average delay of QCGA was reduced
    by 9.96%, 26.78%, 29.31%, 44.67%, and 61.24%.

  explanation: The research that is presented in the document suggests a novel edge
    computing-based approach to optimizing task offloading for agricultural drip irrigation
    and fertilization wireless sensor networks (AIFWSNs) and offers a new heuristic
    technique to solve the problem of offloading task edges efficiently. The proposed
    approach is intended to lessen the latency of task offloading at the edge of AIFWSNs.
    The technique transforms the issue of assigning a specific number of tasks to
    the appropriate edge servers into a task offloading problem. To enhance the algorithm's
    global search capabilities, this research also offers a new quantum operator.
    The quantum operator updates the matrix using quantum rotation gates and quantum
    non-gates while removing the query operation from the rotation angle table, somewhat
    reducing the algorithm's complexity. To speed up the convergence of the task offloading
    approach, a novel chaotic operator based on chaos theory is introduced. This approach
    eludes local optima and premature convergence by utilizing the characteristics
    of chaos, chaos, and randomness, and it significantly raises the algorithm's accuracy
    and convergence rate.

    I. INTRODUCTION With the rapid development of the agricultural Internet of Things
    (AIoT), agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization wireless sensor networks
    (AIFWSNs) are widely used to improve the efficiency of agricultural drip irrigation
    and fertilization control and production.1–3 In AIoT, AIFWSNs generate massive
    data that need to be processed urgently. Sensor nodes are unable to process a
    large amount of data quickly due to hardware constraints and usually upload these
    data to cloud servers for processing.4 However, unlike traditional wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs), AIFWSNs are used in agricultural production activities where
    latency requirements are much lower. If based solely on the traditional cloud
    computing model, a significant time delay will occur due to the distance of the
    cloud server from the location where the task is generated, thus reducing the
    drip irrigation fertilization efficiency and fertilization accuracy, resulting
    in resource waste and environmental pollution.5 Thus, proposing a method that
    can effectively reduce the offloading time delay of agricultural drip irrigation
    fertilization tasks holds immense research significance. Edge computing6 addresses
    the issues of extended latency, network instability, and limited bandwidth encountered
    in conventional cloud computing models by establishing a network of edge servers
    close to data sources. The main attributes of edge computing of AIFWSNs are agricultural
    drip irrigation, fertilization task, and edge server attributes. Specifically,
    the attributes of the agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization tasks include
    the execution difficulty in the task, the input file size of the task, and the
    output file size. How to perform edge task offloading is a critical issue in reducing
    the task offloading latency of AIFWSNs. However, current task offloading algorithms
    have some limitations. Most existing studies usually focus on dividing and migrating
    these tasks to other devices while ignoring the latency constraints and the selection
    of offloading nodes for different tasks.7 For example, Thinh et al.8 introduced
    a linear relaxation-based approach and a comprehensive search-based approach to
    determine the offloading decision, effectively offloading tasks to cloud servers.
    However, both methods incur significant latency. Wu et al.9 proposed a Lyapunov-based
    task offloading technology, which satisfies the latency constraint, but the approach
    does not take into account different difficulties of task execution and sensitivity
    to latency. To reduce the latency of task offloading for AIFWSNs, a new task offloading
    model and a new heuristic algorithm called QCGA are proposed in this paper. The
    proposed QCGA utilizes quantum optimization and chaotic initialization to enhance
    the algorithm’s performance and obtain the desired latency reduction solution.
    The results of simulations indicate that the QCGA-based task offloading model
    surpasses other approaches of AIFWSNs in terms of latency performance. The main
    contributions of this paper are as follows. A new offloading model for agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks is proposed, which aims to reduce the
    latency of offloading tasks at the edge of AIFWSNs. The model transforms the task
    offloading problem into a problem of assigning a certain number of tasks to the
    appropriate edge servers. A novel quantum operator is proposed to improve task
    offloading methods’ global search capability. The quantum operator uses quantum
    rotation gates and quantum non-gates to update the matrix, and in the process
    of completing the quantum rotation gate update, the operator removes the query
    operation of the rotation angle table, which reduces the complexity of the algorithm
    to a certain extent. A new chaotic operator based on chaos theory is introduced
    to enhance the convergence speed of the task offloading method. The proposed strategy
    effectively avoids premature convergence and falling into local optima by utilizing
    the traversal and randomness characteristics of chaos, resulting in a significant
    improvement in the algorithm’s convergence speed and accuracy. The remainder of
    this paper is organized as follows: Sec. II presents the work related to edge
    task offloading for AIFWSNs. Section III shows the edge offloading model for AIFWSNs.
    In Sec. IV, the proposed QCGA approach for solving the edge offloading problem
    of agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization tasks for AIFWSNs is explained
    in detail. Subsequently, simulation experiments are conducted in Sec. V to verify
    the effectiveness of QCGA in reducing the delay, and the results are explained
    in detail. Finally, Sec. VI describes this paper’s conclusions and future work
    directions. II. RELATED WORK In most task offloading studies, researchers usually
    focus on how to segment and migrate these tasks to other devices. With the convergence
    and development of mobile Internet, Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence
    technologies, various types of mobile applications based on deep learning are
    emerging. However, due to the limitations of the computing power and storage capacity
    of mobile devices, they cannot effectively support the inference process of complex
    deep neural network models, which directly affects the user experience. Offloading
    the inference computation of the models to edge servers or the cloud for execution
    becomes an effective way to solve this contradiction. Tang et al.10 designed a
    Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) algorithm for optimizing the dynamic sub-frame offloading
    of large-scale sequential subtasks in the context of Telematics, which can significantly
    reduce the total latency and performs better, especially in the context of high-speed
    mobile and congested environments. Xue et al.11 proposed a Double Dueling Prioritized
    deep Q-Network (DDPQN) algorithm for deep learning model partitioning and offloading
    strategy acquisition with multiple metric co-optimization by introducing a coupling
    coordination metric and a node balancing metric in a local-edge-cloud cooperative
    environment. Wu et al.12 proposed to construct a virtual queue to assist the actual
    queue, ensuring that the problem of deep learning task duration constraints is
    transformed into a virtual queue stability control problem by constructing a Lyapunov
    function and designing an adaptive online task offloading algorithm to achieve
    long-term energy minimization and queue stability. Sun et al. proposed an energy-aware
    user-centric mobility management scheme that only uses user energy consumption
    as a constraint for task offloading and does not consider delay and energy consumption
    in an integrated manner.13 Chen and Hao14 treated the task offloading issue as
    a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. This study proposed to transform
    the task offloading problem into two subproblems, task assignment and resource
    allocation, and proposed a software-defined task offloading scheme based on these
    two subproblems. The method succeeded in offloading the tasks, but the scheme
    did not consider the time delay as a constraint. Yi et al.15 proposed a MOTM task
    offloading technology based on queuing model, which considered that the equilibrium
    of a noncooperative game among mobile users successfully offloaded the tasks to
    the cloud server, but the method did not consider the priority among tasks. Energy
    consumption, latency, and task priority are critical concerns for AIFWSNs.16–18
    While conventional wireless sensor networks are also affected by these factors,
    the distinctive aspect of AIFWSNs is that if the nodes’ tasks are not offloaded
    on time, it can lead to task blockage, longer response latencies, reduced drip
    irrigation efficiency, and compromised fertilization accuracy. These outcomes
    result in resource wastage and environmental contamination. In addition, the task
    offloading optimization issue can be abstracted as a multi-objective optimization
    issue because AIFWSNs need to consider multiple constraints simultaneously, which
    is an NP-hard problem.19 Cui et al.20 proposed to use the K nearest neighbor algorithm
    to decide whether tasks are offloaded to the cloud or edge execution and use reinforcement
    learning to allocate non-local computational resources, which considers the task
    inter priority, but the disadvantage of the slower speed of K nearest neighbor
    algorithm is not optimized, while the use of K nearest neighbor algorithm is not
    effective when the samples are not balanced; therefore, the overall latency of
    the method is relatively high and less effective in AIFWSNs. Chen et al.21 explored
    the problem of offloading multiple tasks in a multi-channel wireless interference
    environment for edge cloud computing. They presented a distributed algorithm based
    on game theory to address task offloading, but the approach did not significantly
    reduce task offloading latency. The second class of task offloading methods for
    AIFWSNs is based on heuristic algorithms that can give a set of ideal task offloading
    solutions quickly. Ning et al.22 proposed integrating mobile cloud computing and
    edge computing to formulate task offloading decisions and gave an iterative heuristic
    task offloading strategy. Shen et al.23 presented an offloading technique utilizing
    an enhanced bald eagle search optimization algorithm, efficiently reducing task
    offloading latency. However, the algorithm exhibits slow convergence due to a
    more intricate model, and the inclusion of multiple conventional optimization
    operators in the algorithm results in increased algorithmic complexity. As heuristic
    algorithms continue to advance rapidly, there is an increasing application of
    quantum optimization to augment the global search ability of algorithms.24 Flori
    et al.25 proposed a particle swarm algorithm for quantum optimization based on
    the context of agricultural drip irrigation fertilization, which used quantum
    superposition to adjust the parameters of the particle swarm optimization (PSO)
    to effectively improve the problem of PSO easily falling into local optimum. However,
    the algorithm only applies to some specific scenarios, has poor applicability
    on global convex functions, and converges very slowly. de Andoin and Echanobe26
    proposed a quantum optimization algorithm based on an ant colony optimization
    algorithm to find an approximate solution to the NP-hard problem in agricultural
    drip irrigation fertilization production. The algorithm uses non-error-correcting
    quanta to generate new possible solutions as a superposition of states, but the
    algorithm does not perform well in the face of complex update strategies. In heuristic
    algorithms, a well-diversified initial population helps improve the search efficiency
    of the algorithm. Therefore, various chaotic operators have been added to heuristic
    algorithms in recent years to increase the population diversity and thus speed
    up the convergence of the algorithm.27–29 Xia and Li30 proposed a chaotic particle
    optimization algorithm that uses logistic chaos to search for the elite individuals
    in the population. Although it improves the situation where the PSO falls into
    a local optimum, the convergence speed of the algorithm is not significantly improved
    when facing high-dimensional optimization problems. In 2022, Hashim and Hussien
    proposed a new snake optimizer algorithm for solving complex high-dimensional,
    multi-constraint optimization problems based on natural behaviors, such as mating
    and competition of snakes, which possesses a strong performance for finding optimal
    results. However, the population updating mechanism of SO only considers the optimal
    and the worst individuals. It ignores the contribution of other individuals, and
    the search process of SO is limited by the snake’s movement mode, which can only
    be carried out along the direction of the optimal and the worst individuals.31
    Gupta and Deep proposed an improved gray wolf optimization algorithm based on
    the chaotic local search to alleviate the stagnation of the wolf population in
    the local optimum solution by enhancing exploration and maintaining a relevant
    balance between exploration and exploitation. The overall complexity of the algorithm
    is high, and the computational resources consumed increase the computational cost.32  To
    address the limitations of existing task offloading schemes for AIFWSNs, which
    are either limited in global search capability or slow in convergence speed, this
    paper proposes a new task offloading model and a heuristic approach based on quantum
    and chaos strategies. The proposed approach aims to obtain near-optimal task offloading
    solutions by introducing novel quantum and chaotic operators to enhance the algorithm’s
    search efficiency. By doing so, this research aims to contribute to filling the
    research gap in this area. III. SYSTEM MODEL To achieve proper and reasonable
    offloading of agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization tasks, this paper
    abstracts the process by evaluating the processing difficulty in agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks in AIFWSNs in terms of the number of millions
    of instructions. Considering that edge devices usually have limited computing
    resources, it is assumed in this paper that all edge agricultural drip irrigation
    and fertilization devices need to offload their tasks to the edge server for execution
    completely and in a full offload manner. In addition, this paper also assumes
    that all agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization tasks have the same priority,
    including tasks such as agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization flow control
    tasks, agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization storage tasks, and agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization device status monitoring, i.e., they are processed
    with equal urgency. Under the above assumptions, the edge offloading problem for
    agricultural drip irrigation fertilization tasks can be translated into the problem
    of how to allocate a certain number of tasks to the appropriate edge servers.
    The goal of the problem is to ensure that the total completion time of all agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks over some time is minimized. To this end,
    this paper proposes an edge computing task offloading system model for AIFWSNs,
    as shown in Fig. 1. FIG. 1. VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Offloading system model for
    edge computing tasks. In the edge offloading model of agricultural drip irrigation
    and fertilization task designed in this paper, the attributes of agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization task and edge server are mainly involved. Specifically,
    the attributes of the agricultural drip irrigation fertilization task include
    execution difficulty, input file size, and output file size, while the attributes
    of the edge server include bandwidth, the number of central processing unit (CPU)
    cores, and computational power. In the task offload scenario of AIFWSNs considered
    in this paper, the computational power of the edge server is described in terms
    of the number of million machine language instructions processed per second. The
    primary optimization goal of the model is to minimize the total completion time
    of the agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization task. To achieve this, the
    edge offloading delay for the task is divided into three components: task upload
    delay, task execution delay, and task result return delay. Task upload delay refers
    to the time the agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization edge device takes
    to upload the task to the edge server through either wired or wireless means.
    In other words, it is the duration starting from the initiation of offloading
    by the edge device to uploading the task to the edge server. The task upload delay
    D1 is calculated, as shown in the following equation: D 1 = I F L b w , (1) where
    IFL is the size of the task file to be sent to the edge server, including detailed
    task data information, and bw is the transmission bandwidth. When the agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization task is successfully uploaded from the edge
    device to the edge server, the latter will be responsible for parsing and executing
    the input agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization task file, and the time
    spent in this process is the task execution delay D2, which can be calculated
    by using the following equation: D 2 = M I M I P S × C N , (2) where MI represents
    the amount of computation required for the execution of agricultural drip irrigation
    and fertilization tasks, MIPS represents the number of million machine language
    instructions per second processed by a single CPU of the edge server, and CN is
    the number of CPUs on an edge server. After the edge server executes the assigned
    agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization task, the whole task offloading
    process is not yet finished because the agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization
    edge device is not yet able to obtain the result of task execution completion.
    Therefore, the last part of the delay, the task result return delay D3, is calculated
    as follows: D 3 = O F L b w , (3) where OFL is the size of the task file that
    the edge server sends back to the agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization
    edge device, which includes information about the results of the task execution.
    To effectively reflect the benefits obtained by the agricultural drip irrigation
    fertilization task being assigned to different edge servers and based on the definition
    of the time delays of the three different parts of the edge offloading process
    of the agricultural drip irrigation fertilization task mentioned earlier, this
    paper introduces a task assignment evaluation function to reflect the task assignment
    efficiency obtained by an assignment scheme, whose mathematical expression is
    shown as follows: F obj = α × D 1 + β × D 2 + λ × D 3 , (4) where α, β, and λ
    are the time delay coefficients and D1, D2, and D3 are the task upload time delay,
    task execution time delay, and task result return time delay, respectively. In
    addition, the three different delay coefficients must satisfy both the constraints
    shown in the following equations: α + β + λ = 1 , (5) α + λ ≤ β . (6) In the above
    two constraints, Eq. (5) ensures that the delay coefficients balance the weights
    of the different delay components in the final evaluation criteria. Moreover,
    the constraint of Eq. (6) is that the task execution latency is usually longer
    compared to the other two latency components, and therefore, its weight should
    be larger. IV. QCGA-BASED METHOD FOR REDUCING THE OFFLOADING DELAY OF TASKS OF
    AIFWSNs The task edge offloading model of AIFWSNs proposed in this paper takes
    into account the heterogeneity of different agricultural drip irrigation fertilization
    tasks and edge servers, which complicates the task allocation problem. The problem
    can be judged as an NP-hard problem due to the following reasons: As the number
    of tasks and servers increases, the combination of task–server mappings grows
    exponentially, and the computational complexity of searching for the complete
    solution space is exceptionally high. Different tasks have different computational,
    storage, and network requirements, and there are also differences in the performance
    of the servers, which increases the problem-solving difficulty in solving the
    problem. The execution time of the task, server load, and other objectives need
    to be optimized at the same time while solving the problem. The tasks and servers
    change dynamically in the natural environment, which brings many challenges to
    the solution algorithms. Meanwhile, similar task allocation problems have been
    proven to be NP-complete, so traditional deterministic algorithms are complex
    to solve within polynomials.33–36 Therefore, in this paper, an improved algorithm
    QCGA based on a genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to solve this NP-hard multi-objective
    optimization problem. Specifically, the main steps of QCGA are as follows. A.
    Population coding In solving the edge offloading problem of agricultural drip
    irrigation and fertilization tasks, QCGA adopts a special coding format, as shown
    in Fig. 2. Suppose there are three edge servers E1, E2, and E3. There are six
    urgent agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization tasks t1, t2, t3, t4, t5,
    and t6. Each edge server must complete two tasks on average, assuming that the
    initial solution is t 1 , t 2 t 3 , t 4 t 5 , t 6 ⁠, indicating that edge server
    E1 needs to complete tasks t1 and t2. The order of completing tasks is t1 first
    and then t2. Other edge servers complete tasks in the same order. If the encoding
    is changed to t 1 , t 5 , t 3 t 4 t 2 , t 6 after one mutation, edge server E3
    turns task t5 to E1 to execute, and the order is t1 → t5 → t3. In this way, the
    operations of each crossover variant can be operated on a single gene chain, increasing
    the simplification of the process. FIG. 2. VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Coding method
    of QCGA. B. Population selection, crossover, and mutation The initial population
    is subject to the roulette wheel method during the selection operation, which
    selects individuals to form a new population. Subsequently, the new population
    is subjected to crossover operations, increasing the gene diversity on the chromosomes.
    The specific steps for selecting the operation are as follows: obtaining the value
    of the fitness function corresponding to the initial population by the fitness
    function and using the roulette wheel method to perform a selection operation
    on the initial population by the value of the fitness function corresponding to
    the initial population. The specific steps of the crossover are as follows: The
    crossover operation requires the comparison of crossover probabilities with random
    numbers for individuals who meet the requirements, as shown in the following equation:
    d m , n ( k + 1 ) = v m , n ( k + 1 ) , r ≥ r , d m , n ( k ) , o t h e r w i
    s e , (7) where d m , n k + 1 is the mth individual of the population in the k
    + 1 generation, n is the nth gene in the mth individual, and r is the crossover
    probability. A certain probability is used to decide whether to perform the crossover
    operation. During the crossover operation, two individuals are selected from the
    current population, known as the parent gene strings. A crossover position is
    randomly chosen on the two selected individuals to perform the crossover operation,
    as depicted in Fig. 3. When the crossover gene of the red gene string crosses
    the crossover gene of the blue gene string during the crossover process, a conflict
    elimination operation is necessary when the gene after the crossover conflicts
    with its gene. To conduct the conflict elimination operation, the gene at the
    crossover point of the blue gene string is initially swapped with the gene at
    the conflicting position. The original gene at the crossover point of the blue
    gene string is then compared with the gene at the crossover point of the red gene
    string. If a conflict exists, the gene in the red gene string at the conflicting
    position is swapped with the gene at the conflicting position. Finally, the blue
    gene string is crossed with the gene in the red gene string that requires crossing.
    By introducing a small probability of mutation, individual genetic diversity is
    enriched. After the crossover operation is completed, the mutation operation is
    executed. The mutation operation in the QCGA is intended to enhance the algorithm’s
    global search capability. Using only selection and crossover operators to generate
    new task assignment sequences can lead to the algorithm getting stuck in locally
    optimal solutions when optimizing the edge offloading of agricultural drip irrigation
    and fertilization tasks. These two operators can only combine permutations based
    on existing sequences and cannot generate new gene sequences as mutation operators
    can. Therefore, by introducing a certain probability of mutation operation on
    chromosome individuals, QCGA can obtain new task assignment sequences, thus increasing
    the search space and avoiding the risk of falling into local optimal solutions.
    Figure 4 shows how the mutation operation is implemented. FIG. 3. VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD

    SLIDE Schematic diagram of mutation operation. C. Quantum operator In the QCGA,
    a novel simplified quantum operator has been suggested to guide the algorithm’s
    evolution toward the optimal offloading scheme. This operator can update the quantum
    rotation gate without the need to query the rotation angle table. It consists
    of the quantum non-gate and the quantum rotation gate operation. At the initialization
    stage of the QCGA, each individual includes a quantum probability amplitude matrix,
    which is updated based on the offloading sequence after the current individual
    update. The pseudo-code of the quantum revolving gate for this streamlined quantum
    operator is shown in Algorithm 1. ALGORITHM 1. Refined and simplified quantum
    revolving door pseudocode. Inputs: current population pop, number of agriculture
    tasks n, number of edge servers m, quantum probability amplitude increment Pquantum,
    and quantum probability amplitude matrix F.  Output: The updated quantum probability
    amplitude matrix F.  01 for each i ∈ [1, n] do  02 for each j ∈ [1, m] do  03
    if pop(i,j) = = j && F(i,j) < 1 then  04 F(i,j) = F(i,j) + Pquantum;  05 else
    if pop(i,j) ! = j && F(i,j) > 0 then  06 F(i,j) = F(i,j) − Pquantum;  07 end if  08
    end for  09 end for  10 return F;  The pseudo-code of the quantum non-gate is
    shown in Algorithm 2. ALGORITHM 2. Quantum non-gate pseudocode. Inputs: quantum
    non-gate execution probability Pnon, random number p in [0,1], number n of edge
    servers, number m of agriculture tasks, quantum probability amplitude matrix F.  Output:
    The updated quantum probability amplitude matrix F.  01 for each i ∈ [1, n] do  02
    for each j ∈ [1, m] do  03 if p < Pnon then  04 F(i,j) = 1 − F(i,j);  05 end if  06
    end for  07 end for  08 return F;  D. Chaotic initialization and perturbation
    In solving the edge offloading problem of agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization
    task, the optimal solution generated in the current iteration is easily lost in
    the previous steps of QCGA, thus affecting the convergence performance of the
    algorithm. Therefore, this paper proposes a new chaotic operator to significantly
    accelerate the convergence speed of QCGA and enhance the global search capability.
    The specific implementation of the chaotic operator consists of the following
    two steps: The following equation presents the mathematical expression of the
    logistic mapping model, which is utilized for chaotic sequence initialization
    and population generation: y i j + 1 = 4 × y i j ( 1 − y i j ) , (8) where y i
    j ∈ 0 , 1 is the chaotic variable, i = 1, 2, 3, …, n denotes the ordinal number
    of the chaotic variable, and j = 1, 2, 3, …, N denotes the population ordinal
    number, where N denotes the population size. Using the feature that the logistic
    chaos mapping model is sensitive to initial values, n chaotic variables are obtained
    by assigning n small differences to the initial values of Eq. (8), and then, the
    chaotic variables are mapped to the solution space variables x i j of QCGA by
    using the following equation: x i j = l i + y i j × ( u i − l i ) . (9) Chaotic
    perturbation strategy: the unoptimized GA has the disadvantages of quickly falling
    into local optimum and insufficient search accuracy in the late stage of the algorithm.
    To overcome the above disadvantages, this paper uses the randomness, regularity,
    and ergodicity of chaotic sequences to perturb the three individuals in the decision
    layer, which can make the GA escape the local optimum and thus improve the global
    search ability of the GA. The chaotic perturbation strategy is shown in the following
    equation: y k ′ = y * × ( 1 − φ ) + φ × y k , (10) where y k ′ denotes the chaotic
    variable formed after adding the perturbation, y* denotes the chaotic variable
    formed after mapping individuals in the decision layer to [0,1], yk is the chaotic
    variable after k iterations, and φ φ ∈ 0 , 1 is the strength of the perturbation,
    which is calculated as shown in the following equation, where N is the population
    size: φ = 1 − k − 1 k N . (11) The complete algorithm flowchart of QCGA is shown
    in Fig. 5. E. Algorithm complexity analysis Because SO is the algorithm with the
    smallest performance gap with QCGA among several compared algorithms, the effectiveness
    of QCGA is further demonstrated by comparing the complexity of the two algorithms.
    The primary source of complexity in the proposed QCGA is attributed to the GA,
    chaotic operator, and quantum operator. The GA involves a triple loop encompassing
    the number of iterations, population size, and the number of edge servers, leading
    to its maximum computational complexity. Since the triple loop of the GA is executed
    three times in QCGA, its complexity can be expressed as follows: Q C G A G A =
    3 × M a x × P × T × e , (12) where Max expresses the maximum number of iterations,
    P expresses the population size, T expresses the number of agricultural drip irrigation
    and fertilization tasks, and e expresses the number of edge servers. The complexity
    of the quantum operator consists of the maintenance and update of the quantum
    probability amplitude matrix for each individual. In each iteration, the quantum
    rotation gate and the quantum non-gate are executed once, so the computational
    complexity of the quantum operator can be denoted as follows: Q C G A quantum
    = 2 × M a x × P × T × e . (13) The complexity of the chaotic operator is concentrated
    in the initial population and perturbed population operations. The complexity
    of the chaotic operator can be denoted as follows: Q C G A chaotic = log 2 ( P
    + T ) . (14) The total computational complexity of the QCGA can be denoted as
    follows: Q C G A total = log 2 ( P + T ) + 5 × M a x G e n × P × T × e . (15)
    The computational complexity of SO mainly comes from iterative computation, initialization
    of the population as a whole, updating of female and male population positions,
    elite individual replacement, and the number of edge servers. The computational
    complexity of the male population is shown in Eq. (16), and the female population
    is shown in Eq. (17), S O m = M a x G e n × P m 2 × T × e , (16) S O f = M a x
    G e n × P f 2 × T × e , (17) where MaxGen represents the maximum number of iterations,
    T represents the number of agricultural drip irrigation fertilization tasks, e
    represents the number of edge servers, Pm and Pf denote the male and female population
    sizes, respectively, which are calculated as shown in Eq. (18), and P is the overall
    population size, P m = P f = P 2 . (18) Therefore, the overall computational complexity
    of SO is shown in the following equation: S O total = P 3 2 × M a x G e n × T
    × e . (19) To compare the computational complexity of QCGA and SO, this study
    uses the big O notation to simplify the formulas; the lower-order terms, constant
    terms, and coefficients are removed, and the highest-order terms are retained,
    which leads to the following equations: Q C G A = O ( log 2 ( P + T ) + M a x
    G e n × P × T × e ) , (20) S O = O ( P 3 × M a x G e n × T × e ) . (21) Because
    log2(P + T) is a function of logarithmic order, it grows much slower than both
    P and T so that it can be ignored, and in addition, MaxGen, T, and e are set the
    same for both algorithms, which further leads to the following equations: Q C
    G A = O ( P ) , (22) S O = O ( P 3 ) . (23) Through the algorithm complexity analysis,
    the QCGA proposed in this paper is also lower in complexity than the advanced
    algorithm SO proposed in recent years, and the results show that the QCGA can
    accomplish the same task in less time and the effectiveness of the QCGA is verified
    in large-scale complex optimization scenarios. V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION To verify
    the effectiveness of QCGA in edge task offloading of AIFWSNs, this paper compares
    it with other state-of-the-art task offloading methods and traditional offloading
    methods, including SO, GA, PSO, random offloading, and sequential offloading.
    This paper used the CloudSim cloud computing simulation platform to conduct real-world
    edge offloading tests for agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization tasks.
    The specific test method is to use CloudSim to build an edge computing platform
    for agricultural drip irrigation fertilization task, which contains some agricultural
    drip irrigation fertilization task attributes, such as task execution difficulty,
    task execution completion output file size, task input file size, and some edge
    server attributes, such as server memory, computational power, number of CPUs,
    and computational power. The above task attributes and server attributes are references
    to the task attribute parameters and server parameters that exist in the actual
    scenario. Based on this, the edge offloading method in agricultural drip irrigation
    and fertilization application obtained using various task offloading algorithms
    is tested, and the total task migration time is counted. The specific technical
    route is as follows: first, using the powerful computing power of the central
    cloud server, the characteristics data of the current agricultural drip irrigation
    and fertilization tasks are collected, including the attributes of the agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks and the attributes of the edge server,
    and based on these data, the central cloud server obtains the edge offloading
    scheme in the agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization application by various
    offloading algorithms and then sends the detailed information about the location
    where the agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization tasks are offloaded to
    the edge server. After that, control information about the detailed location of
    the offloaded tasks to the edge server is sent, and the actual offloading of agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks is finally realized. In addition, all
    simulation tests were done on a Windows 11 device with 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM)
    i5-12400F 2.50 GHz. The experimental data involved in this paper are averaged
    from the results of 100 experiments. To compare the time delay of different task
    offloading schemes of AIFWSNs, uniform standard parameters are used to ensure
    the objectivity and fairness of the simulation experiments. In the simulation
    experiments, all algorithms’ population size is 40, and the number of iterations
    is 1000. The detailed parameter settings of the four heuristic algorithms are
    shown in Table I. TABLE I. Algorithm parameter setting. Name Parameter QCGA  mutation_rate

    comprehensively evaluate the superiority of offloading schemes obtained by QCGA,
    this paper uses four offloading schemes based on heuristic algorithms, QCGA, SO,
    GA, and PSO, and two common offloading schemes for agricultural drip irrigation
    and fertilization tasks: sequential offloading and random offloading. Sequential
    offloading assigns agricultural drip irrigation fertilization tasks to edge servers
    in the order of task numbers, while random offloading randomly assigns agricultural
    drip irrigation fertilization tasks to one edge server for execution. In this
    paper, four test scenarios with different metrics are set up: (1) 50 agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks and 10 edge servers; (2) 100 agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks and 20 edge servers; (3) 200 agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks and 25 edge servers; and (4) 300 agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks and 30 edge servers. The primary evaluation
    metric is the aggregate duration required to accomplish all agricultural drip
    irrigation and fertilization tasks, whereby a smaller value indicates the superior
    performance of the offload solution. Figures 6(a)–6(d) show the variation of the
    delay benefit values for the four heuristic-based task offloading methods. The
    horizontal axis of Figs. 6(a)–6(d) represents the number of iterations, and the
    vertical axis represents the delay benefit value, with lower benefit values indicating
    a lower delay of the associated task offloading schemes. Based on the iteration
    changes, it is obvious that the QCGA-based task offloading method has significantly
    lower latency than the other three heuristic comparison algorithms, while the
    latency results of the other task offloading methods do not differ much. FIG.
    5. VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Algorithm flowchart of QCGA. FIG. 6. VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD
    SLIDE Delay benefit values of task offloading algorithms with different indicators:
    (a) 50 tasks, 10 servers; (b) 100 tasks, 20 servers; (c) 200 tasks, 25 servers;
    and (d) 300 tasks, 30 servers. In addition, the QCGA algorithm presented in this
    paper has a superior completion time for obtaining an offloading scheme for agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks compared to the other three heuristic
    algorithms. This is due to the fact that QCGA employs novel quantum and elite
    operators to enhance the algorithm’s ability to search for the best task offloading
    scheme. By comparing the results of QCGA, SO, PSO, and GA, as well as analyzing
    the result curves of the four algorithms in different scenarios, the results show
    that not only QCGA is significantly faster than the other three comparison algorithms
    in terms of convergence speed but also the delay benefit value obtained by QCGA
    is markedly better than the comparison algorithms. On the contrary, all three
    comparison algorithms fail to utilize the population information fully and lack
    population diversity, thus falling into local optimal solutions and ultimately
    not finding the best task offloading solution. The analysis of the results further
    demonstrates the effectiveness of QCGA using new quantum and novel elite operators
    to enhance its performance. Figures 7(a)–7(d) show the total offload time of the
    agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization tasks vs the number of tasks and
    edge servers in scenarios 1–4. As the number of tasks and edge servers increases,
    the task offloading delay increases for all algorithms. The QCGA-based offloading
    scheme performs the best among all algorithms, with the shortest time required
    to complete the agricultural drip irrigation fertilization task, while the random
    offloading method-based offloading scheme performs the worst. FIG. 7. VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD
    SLIDE Different indicators under the agriculture task offloading completion time:
    (a) 50 tasks, 10 servers; (b) 100 tasks, 20 servers; (c) 200 tasks, 25 servers;
    and (d) 300 tasks, 30 servers. Taking scenarios 1 and 4 as an example, in scenario
    1, when there are 50 agricultural drip irrigation fertilization tasks and 10 edge
    servers, the total task completion times of QCGA, SO, GA, and PSO are 121.52,
    130.24, 140.59, and 133.31 ms, respectively. At this time, the performance difference
    between these four heuristic optimization algorithm-based offloading schemes is
    not significant. In contrast, the total task completion times of the unplanned
    sequential and random offloading schemes are 163.55 and 209.02 ms, respectively,
    which are much higher than those of the first four heuristic task offloading algorithms;
    the results show that the sequential and random offloading schemes do not consider
    the processing capacity and status of the edge servers, which leads to load imbalance,
    with some servers overloaded, while others are idle. However, the heuristic optimization
    based algorithm can find a better task allocation scheme through iterative search,
    which ultimately reduces the overall task completion time. In scenario 4, when
    there are 300 agricultural drip irrigation fertilization tasks and 30 edge servers,
    the total task completion time of QCGA is the shortest, which is only 274.98 ms.
    In contrast, the total task completion time of QCGA is lower than that of SO,
    GA, PSO, sequential offloading, and random offloading by 8.38%, 22.48%, 18.01%,
    54.22%, and 63.22%, respectively. The results show that when the problem size
    becomes more significant, the advantages of the QCGA algorithm’s fast convergence
    speed and strong search ability become more pronounced, and it can find the optimal
    solution in the large-scale solution space quickly and efficiently. To further
    validate the effectiveness of the task offloading schemes obtained by the QCGA
    algorithm, two different experimental scenarios are designed in this paper to
    test the stability of QCGA in large-scale AIFWSNs. With a fixed number of 100
    edge servers, Fig. 8 shows the variation of total task completion time for different
    task offloading schemes as the number of agricultural drip irrigation fertilization
    tasks increases from 1000 to 4000. When the number of agricultural drip irrigation
    fertilization tasks is 1,000, the total task completion time of QCGA is 330.97
    ms, SO is 363.38 ms, GA is 392.17 ms, PSO is 373.19 ms, sequential offloading
    is 398.96 ms, and random offloading is 475.01 ms. When the number of agricultural
    drip irrigation fertilization tasks increases to 4,000, the total task completion
    time of the QCGA algorithm is 1021.76 ms, SO is 1169 ms, GA is 1396.38 ms, PSO
    is 1223.40 ms, sequential offloading is 1424.48 ms, and random offloading is 1621.49
    ms. From the latency trends of different offloading scenarios in Fig. 8, it can
    be seen that when the number of edge servers is fixed, the number of tasks keeps
    increasing, and the task offloading scheme obtained by QCGA is still the scheme
    with the shortest total task completion time. According to the trend of the curve,
    it can be seen that the larger the size of AIFWSNs, the more pronounced the advantage
    of QCGA. By analyzing the above results, it is found that the design of a new
    delay evaluation function in this paper is one of the reasons why the total task
    completion time of QCGA is significantly lower than that of several other schemes;
    at the same time, in the evaluation function, this paper entirely takes into account
    the impact of different delay components on the evaluation function and balances
    the weights of different delay components in the final evaluation criteria. FIG.
    8. VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Task offload completion time for different numbers
    of agriculture tasks under 100 edge servers. Figure 9 demonstrates that with a
    fixed number of 1000 agricultural drip irrigation fertilization tasks, this study
    evaluates the latency variations of different task offloading schemes when the
    number of edge servers is 200, 300, 400, and 500. The results show that when the
    number of edge servers is 200, the total time for QCGA to complete task offloading
    is 177.70 ms. In contrast, when the number of edge servers is increased to 500,
    the total time for QCGA to complete task offloading is 88.76 ms, compared to the
    total time for task offloading completion of SO, GA, PSO, sequential offloading,
    and random offloading, which is 113.78, 157.07, 144.07, 164.88, and 190.74 ms,
    respectively. The results show that QCGA exhibits more significant advantages
    as the number of edge servers increases with a fixed number of tasks. In addition,
    the new chaos operator and quantum operator designed in this paper are also among
    the reasons why QCGA shows excellent advantages. The convergence speed of QCGA
    is accelerated by designing new chaotic operators. At the same time, the ability
    of QCGA to jump out of local optimum is also enhanced as the number of agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks increases from 1000 to 4000 with increasing
    quantum probability. FIG. 9. VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Task offload completion
    time for different numbers of edge servers under 1000 agriculture tasks. As the
    number of tasks and edge servers increases, the performance advantage of the QCGA
    task offloading scheme becomes more and more significant. Several experimental
    results show that the QCGA is more efficient in task offloading scheme optimization
    and can complete tasks faster. Compared with other algorithms, the QCGA can significantly
    reduce the task completion time, thus enhancing the efficiency and performance
    of the system. This is important for agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization
    tasks in edge computing application scenarios that require high task processing
    speed. VI. CONCLUSIONS Due to the high time delay requirement for agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks, task offloading in edge computing of
    AIFWSNs is more focused on satisfying the time delay constraints. Therefore, in
    building the model, this paper introduces a new delay coefficient design evaluation
    function to divide the delay of agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization
    task offloading into the task upload delay, task execution delay, and task completion
    delay. In addition, this paper proposes a QCGA task offloading method. The quantum
    revolving gate in QCGA innovatively simplifies the update method of quantum probability
    amplitude and significantly enhances the global search capability of QCGA. In
    addition, a new chaos learning operator is designed in this paper to improve the
    convergence performance of QCGA. Simulation results show that the solutions of
    the QCGA-based edge task offloading algorithm for AIFWSNs are all better than
    several other offloading methods and dramatically reduce the task offloading delay.
    With the continuous development of edge computing technologies and the expansion
    of application scenarios, future edge computing deployments will become more complex.
    To better address these challenges, this team will continue to study the edge
    task offloading problem of AIFWSNs in-depth and explore methods and strategies
    for task offloading in more complex edge computing environments. This includes
    considering more edge devices and network topologies and addressing the challenges
    of more dynamic and unstable network environments and task load variations. In
    addition, to further improve the stability and reliability of the QCGA, this team
    will conduct more in-depth research. This will include further analyzing and optimizing
    the performance of the QCGA, exploring more efficient and reliable genetic operators
    and quantum revolving gates, and designing evaluation functions and chaotic learning
    operators more suitable for agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization application
    scenarios. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This paper was funded by the National Natural Science

  key_findings: Simulation results showed that, compared with SO, GA, PSO, sequential
    offloading, and random offloading methods, the average delay of QCGA was reduced
    by 9.96%, 26.78%, 29.31%, 44.67%, and 61.24%.
  limitations: Most existing studies usually focus on dividing and migrating these
    tasks to other devices while ignoring the latency constraints and the selection
    of offloading nodes for different tasks.
  main_objective: To propose an efficient task offloading method for drip irrigation
    and fertilization at edge nodes based on a quantum chaotic genetic algorithm (QCGA)
    to reduce the offloading delay in AIFWSNs.
  relevance_evaluation: 'This paper is relevant to the outline point because it presents
    a novel task offloading model and a heuristic approach based on quantum and chaos
    strategies. The proposed approach aims to obtain near-optimal task offloading
    solutions by introducing novel quantum and chaotic operators to enhance the algorithm''s
    search efficiency. The paper also addresses the limitations of existing task offloading
    schemes for AIFWSNs, which are either limited in global search capability or slow
    in convergence speed. The proposed approach is evaluated through simulation experiments,
    and the results show that it can effectively reduce the task offloading delay
    compared to several other offloading methods. This is important for agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks in edge computing application scenarios
    that require high task processing speed. Overall, this study advances the state-of-the-art
    in task offloading for AIFWSNs and provides valuable insights for future research
    in this area.


    The paper''s relevance to the specific point in the outline is that it proposes
    a task offloading approach that integrates machine learning algorithms (e.g.,
    reinforcement learning, genetic algorithms) to optimize closed-loop control strategies
    over time, adapting to changing environmental conditions and crop requirements.
    This is significant because it enables the system to dynamically adjust its task
    offloading decisions based on real-time data, leading to improved resource utilization
    and task execution efficiency. By optimizing closed-loop control strategies, the
    proposed approach can contribute to the overall reliability and effectiveness
    of automated irrigation systems.'

    28 April 2023 Deriving Optimal Operation Rule for Reservoir System Using Enhanced
    Optimization Algorithms Article 06 February 2024 1 Introduction Irrigation, hydropower,
    navigation, and flood management are reservoirs’ significant economic contributors
    to the benefit of any country. Besides irrigation and power generation, the reservoirs
    in India also play a vital role in protecting the country from floods. During
    the floods, reservoirs store and release the excess water according to its capacity
    and future requirement. Flood protection and optimizing power generation and storage
    for future use are important reservoir objectives that are competing with one
    another. It is imperative that the reservoir has to be operated effectively to
    conserve water so that competing goals can be accomplished in an optimum manner.
    Reservoir management has benefited from the development and use of both traditional
    and more recent meta-heuristic optimization methodologies. Traditional reservoir
    operation methods include linear programming (LP), nonlinear Programming (NLP),
    and dynamic programming (DP). Each one had many advantages thus has been applied
    to many problems in reservoir operation studies. The disadvantages of these strategies
    outweigh the benefits. LP requires a linear objective function and constraints,
    whereas DP is bound by dimensionality, and NLP is incapable of addressing the
    non-convex issue efficiently on its own (Hosseini-Moghari et al. 2015). Many reviews
    (Yeh 1985; Wurbs 1993; Rani and Moreira 2010) on reservoir planning and operation
    are available in the literature. To alleviate the difficulties and to overcome
    the limitations, there has been a constant hunt for new optimization techniques
    that can produce globally optimal solutions. The advent of soft computing techniques
    in general and meta-heuristic algorithms [MA] techniques in particular have revolutionized
    the optimization process. MA are probabilistic approximation techniques that allow
    efficiently solving optimization problems. (Nesmachnow 2014) A review on MA along
    with the water resources applications can be seen in Reddy and Kumar (2020) and
    reservoir optimization problems in particular in Lai et al. (2022). The MA techniques
    are further classified as evolutionary algorithms (EA), swarm intelligence algorithms
    (SIA), and other algorithms based on certain natural physical processes or human-induced
    processes. The basic premise on which EAs work is to generate a population of
    possible solutions through a selection mechanism, evolution, and reproduction
    to achieve better solutions. The genetic algorithms (GA) introduced by Holland
    (1992) is the most commonly applied EA which is applied mostly to the optimization
    of reservoir operations. The algorithm is straightforward and easy to implement.
    The limitations of GA are discussed in Lai et al. (2022). GA is considered to
    be a slower optimization technique, and its chance of sticking to a local optimum
    is maximum. The teaching–learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm was developed
    by Rao et al. (2011). When a teacher has a significant impact on student performance,
    it is referred to as TLBO. Results or grades are used to measure output here.
    In the field of water resources, the TLBO algorithm has only recently been applied
    in a few studies, including (Kumar and Yadav 2018) on reservoir operation, (Patel
    and Balve 2018) on multi-reservoir operation policy, (Patnaik and Swain 2021)
    on the comparison of PSO and TLBO for Hirakud reservoir operation, (Kumar and
    Yadav 2021) on water allocation, and (Ajudiya et al. 2022) on optimization of
    cropping pattern in the command area of multiple reservoir system. To summarize,
    TLBO is broadly applicable in the field of water resources as a global optimization
    technique, and these studies show that it is also a reliable technique for producing
    global optimal solutions. In this study, target storage generation was optimized
    to meet annual demands, prevent floods, and maximize power generation at the Omkareshwar
    Sagar Project (OSP) reservoir in India. The OSP reservoir operations are optimized
    for a monsoon flood wave situation using a conventional NLP approach and a semi-conventional
    genetic algorithm method to validate the accuracy of the TLBO results. The Omkareshwar
    Sagar Project (OSP) reservoir in India has been designed to satisfy annual demands,
    protect against flooding, and produce maximum power generation, which is used
    for analysis in the current study. Present study incorporates one conventional
    optimization method the nonlinear programming (NLP), a semi-conventional method
    the genetic algorithm (GA), and a meta-heuristic technique the teaching–learning-based
    optimization (TLBO) to solve the problem of optimum operation in a flood scenario.
    A flood-release protocol has to be developed keeping the objective of maximum
    power output and reach the specified storage target at the end of the operation.
    Present study has been a successful attempt in getting the desired results, and
    the adaptability of the TLBO for complex problem is also proven. 2 Theoretical
    Background 2.1 Genetic Algorithm Over other optimization techniques, GA provides
    a lot of advantages. Both parallelism and the ability to work through challenges
    of varying complexity are critical. A linear or nonlinear, continuous or random
    noise objective (fitness) function is just as valid as a non- stationary (changing
    over time) linear objective (fitness). All of these optimizations can be handled
    by genetic algorithms. Genetic algorithms, on the other hand, have some downsides.
    It is vital to take into account the size of the population, mutation and crossover
    rates, as well as other important aspects, when creating a new population in order
    to arrive at an accurate fitness function. Choosing the incorrect selection will
    hinder or eliminate the algorithm’s ability to converge. Genetic algorithms, despite
    these drawbacks, are nevertheless widely used in nonlinear optimization. (Yang
    2021) provides a comprehensive description of the algorithm. 2.2 Teaching–Learning-Based
    Optimization A novel population-based algorithm called TLBO (Rao et al. 2011)
    simulates classroom teaching and learning. The professor’s approach to getting
    their students to participate in class and work together more effectively is the
    basis for the algorithm. You don’t have to worry about making precise modifications
    with the TLBO. TLBO’s key regulating elements are the number of iterations and
    the size of the population. It is the major goal of teachers at TLBO to improve
    the average grade of classes. The two components of the algorithm are: the teacher
    and the learner. 2.2.1 Teacher Phase The teacher phase is the first step in the
    TLBO algorithm. Teachers place a high priority on raising the average grade in
    their classes. A new solution is created using the population’s mean value and
    the solution’s best fitness value (teacher). This is how each solution (x) variable
    gets changed: $$x_{{{\\text{new}}}} = x + r(x_{{{\\text{best}}}} - t_{f} x_{{{\\text{mean}}}}
    )$$ (1) There are five factors in this equation: the current solution/population
    value x, the newly generated solution/population value xnew, the teacher’s selection
    of the xbest solution/population based on the objective function’s minimum and
    maximum values, the population’s mean value xmean, the teaching factor Tf, which
    can be either 1 or 2, and a random number between zero and one for each variable.
    2.2.2 Learner Phase The learner phase requires students to interact with each
    other. With the help of partner solutions, new ideas might be generated. For the
    sake of finding the finest potential companion, the population will be culled.
    As an example, consider the fact that a partner''s answer cannot be the same as
    a solution that the learner examines. All variables can be changed based on current
    and partner fitness levels. $$x_{{{\\text{new}}}} = x + r(x - x_{{\\text{p}}}
    )\\quad {\\text{if}}\\;\\;f_{i} < f_{{\\text{p}}}$$ (2) $$x_{{{\\text{new}}}}
    = x - r(x - x_{{\\text{p}}} )\\quad {\\text{if}}\\;\\;f_{i} > f_{{\\text{p}}}$$
    (3) where the current solution/learner value is x, xnew is the new generated value,
    xp represents the partner solution/learner, fi is the current solution/fitness
    learner’s value, ft is the partner solution/fitness learner’s value. The value
    r will be randomly chosen between 0 and 1 for each variable. 3 Study Area India''s
    Omkareshwar Sagar Project reservoir in Madhya Pradesh is used to compare nonlinear
    programming, genetic algorithm, and teaching–learning-based optimization for reservoir
    operation under a flood scenario. The OSP is made up of eight 65-MW power plants
    and a gravity dam that stands 53 m tall and 949 m long. The reservoir’s total
    capacity of 987 Mcm is used to irrigate more than 146,800 hectares of crops. India’s
    Sardar Sarovar Project (SSP) and India’s Indira Sagar Project (ISP) are two of
    the country’s major reservoir projects. The intercepted flow between ISP and OSP
    joins with the water already released from ISP, which creates a vast reservoir.
    OSP’s operations have been complicated as a result of the mandatory release of
    water for SSP. As a result, OSP must be triggered in order to protect the reservoir’s
    downstream side from floodwaters, maximize power output, target storage for future
    use, and ensure that the reservoir’s downstream receives the appropriate release.

    The objective function is defined in light of the following purposes: By adding
    a continuity constraint to the objective function, the objective function is modified.
    The release from the hydropower is kept constant at 6.87 Mcm per hour to enhance
    power generation. $$\\begin{aligned} & {\\text{Min}}\\left[ {\\sum\\limits_{t

    - I_{{\\text{t}}} + Q_{{\\text{t}}} + Q_{{{\\text{pt}}}} } \\right)^{2} } } \\right.
    \\\\ & \\quad + \\left. {\\sum\\limits_{t = 2}^{T + 2} {V_{3} (S_{{\\text{t}}}
    - T_{{\\text{s}}} )^{2} } } \\right] \\\\ \\end{aligned}$$ (4) where Qt = Outflow
    through Spillway, Qpt = Outflow through turbine taken as a constant value equal
    to 6.87 Mcm per hour, St = Storage at time t, St + 1 = Storage at time t + 1,
    Ts = Target storage in the reservoir, Qt max = Maximum outflow through the spillway,
    Qt min = Minimum Outflow through the spillway, Qpt max = Maximum Outflow through
    the turbine. The objective function is confined by variable value boundaries.

    \\max$$ (6) $$S_{{\\text{t}}} \\min \\le S_{{\\text{t}}} \\le S_{{\\text{t}}}
    \\max$$ (7) V1 is the weight related to the spillage that must be minimized, V2
    is the weight connected to the continuity equation, and V3 is the weight involved
    with meeting the reservoir’s target storage at the conclusion of operation. The
    current challenge has 25 release values and 25 storage values. Due to the fact
    that weights are fixed, multiple objective problems can be treated as a single
    optimization problem. 5 Result and Discussion Optimizing reservoir operation with
    aims of maximizing power generation, achievement of storage targets, protecting
    the downstream side from flooding are the objectives of the present study applied
    to OSP reservoir during flood. Three techniques, one of them is NLP and other
    two are meta-heuristic techniques the GA and the TLBO, have been employed to solve
    the same problem for comparison. MATLAB platform was used for coding of the problem
    and solving it. The results of the problem are stated in following lines. All
    the three algorithms result in to maximization of the hydropower releases and
    have maintained it to a value of 6.87 Mcm throughout the flood season. The problem
    is basically a weighed sum of squares and squared. The following are the weights
    assigned in the objective function: As a result, V1 is set at 0.1 to reduce spillage,
    V2 is set at 100 to achieve maximum power, and V3 is arbitrarily varied between
    0.00001 and 100,000 for the inflow value of a flood wave to emphasize reaching
    target storage at the end. Using a heuristic method to allocate weights ensures
    that the study’s many goals are completed in the order they were given in the
    beginning. The objective function is optimized using genetic algorithms, nonlinear
    programming, and teaching–learning-based optimization with a population size of
    20 and 500 iterations. The convergence generated by GA and TLBO for a flood inflow
    scenario of monsoon duration to an optimal solution is shown in Fig. 2. It is
    clearly seen in the figure that TLBO initiates with lower fitness value, on the
    other hand GA initiates with very higher value. After 152 iterations, GA stucks
    in local minima. Details of fitness value at different iteration numbers can be
    seen in Table 1. By observing Table 1, results of fitness value generated by TLBO
    (3.607e + 5 in 398 iterations) are much better than GA and NLP on all stages of
    iteration. Table 1 is restricted to 400 iterations due to the achievement of convergence
    at 398 iterations of TLBO, while NLP and GA already converge at 319 and 152 iterations,
    respectively. Fig. 2 Convergence of TLBO to best fitness value for different flood
    inflow scenarios Full size image Table 1 Fitness value at different iteration
    numbers Full size table Two more distinct algorithms are used to determine the
    TLBO algorithm’s correctness in achieving the target storage of 299.00 Mcm. The
    TLBO results were compared to the GA and NLP outcomes. Figure 3 illustrates a
    comparison of gradually increasing storage plots computed from flood wave inflow
    values using GA, NLP, and TLBO. As illustrated in Fig. 3, all models take the
    same path to reach the destination storage with very slight changes. Fig. 3 Comparative
    gradually increasing storage plot from GA, NLP and TLBO Full size image The final
    storage values derived by GA, NLP, and TLBO for a flood inflow scenario are shown
    in Table 2. The model is compressed based on the near target storage value achieved
    by GA, NLP, and TLBO in terms of Mcm and percentage. From Table 2, it is apparent
    that the percentages of target storage reached by GA, NLP, and TLBO are 96.1706%,
    96.9264%, and 97.1237%, respectively, indicating that TLBO performs well in attaining
    near target storage. Table 2 Target storage (299.00 Mcm) achievement by GA, NLP,
    and TLBO Full size table GA, NLP, and TLBO developed a flood influx scenario inflow
    and outflow charts are shown in Fig. 4. Outflows formed by each algorithm are
    clearly shown in Fig. 4; however, TLBO’s path is smoother than those generated
    by GA and NLP. Outflow plot provided by TLBO is a smoother hydrograph, which reduces
    the peak flood level to safeguard downstream areas while also releasing a mandated
    amount of water to a downstream side water supply system. Fig. 4 Comparative inflow
    versus outflow plot generated from GA, NLP, and TLBO Full size image Flood peak
    reduction by GA, NLP, and TLBO can be seen in Table 3. In order to compare the
    algorithms, GA, NLP, and TLBO result in reducing the flood peak in terms of Mcm
    and percentage. From Table 3, it is clear that TLBO lowered the flood peak by
    18.4764%, which suggests that TLBO''s performance in reducing the flood peak to
    safeguard the downstream side together with the mandatory release is excellent.
    Table 3 Flood peak reduced by GA, NLP, and TLBO Full size table Results of TLBO
    model for a flood inflow scenario show that the TLBO is capable of maximizing
    hydropower output, attaining target storage levels, protecting the downstream
    sides of reservoirs from flooding, and releasing mandated amounts for the reservoir
    on the downstream side. TLBO findings were also tested against conventional NLP
    and semi-conventional GA results, and it was determined that TLBO can be utilized
    to optimize reservoir operation difficulties during flood situations. 6 Conclusion
    A nonlinear optimization model is solved with genetic algorithms, teaching–learning-based
    optimization, and nonlinear programming for the achievement of target storage
    for future use and maximize hydropower generation and provide flood protection
    on the downstream side of the reservoir. The model was applied to Omkareshwar
    Sagar Reservoir to simulate a monsoon flood inflow. For a population of 20, the
    best fitness outcomes can be achieved by running the TLBO algorithm for 500 iterations.
    GA achieves and converges at a fitness value of 7.987e + 5 in 151 iterations at
    the same iteration time. TLBO’s fitness value is 4.40e + 5, which is much lower
    than GA. TLBO finally converged at 3.607e + 5 in 398 iterations to obtain the
    global optimal solution, proving its robustness and speed. The highest increased
    power output has been achieved by maintaining hydropower release at a higher value.
    GA, NLP, and TLBO achieve 96.1706%, 96.9264%, and 97.1237% of the target storage
    value, respectively. In addition to helping to safeguard the downstream from flooding,
    GA, NLP, and TLBO’s reduction in flood peak is 18.1961, 18.1261, and 18.4764%,
    respectively, which offers mandatory release for the downstream side reservoir,
    and TLBO''s results show the highest reduction rate among all algorithms. According
    to comparative results of GA, NLP, and TLBO results for a of convergence plot,
    target storage achievement, and flood peak reduction flood inflow scenario, TLBO
    performed better than conventional and semi-conventional approaches. This research
    shows that teaching–learning-based algorithm approach is capable of optimizing
    large-scale, sophisticated water resource systems. References Ajudiya B, Yadav

  description: Attaining sustainable agriculture requires water consumption management.
    A water allocation optimization model was developed for the Moghan irrigation
    network (northwest of Iran) based on the AquaCrop plug-in model. The genetic algorithm
    was applied to optimize water allocation for five main crops, including wheat,
    first-cultivation maize, second-cultivation maize, soybeans, and alfalfa. The
    heuristic economic utility (EU) function was used as the objective function to
    optimize water allocation. In this function, drained water salinity was applied
    as a penalty factor to the total benefit, and soil salinity deterioration due
    to irrigation was also considered as a factor in each crop’s benefit. The results
    showed that the optimal allocated water depth was 17% less than the normal water
    consumption. Moreover, the application of soil water salinity coefficients did
    not affect the ratio of EU to EB (economic benefits) for wheat and alfalfa. However,
    first-cultivation maize, second-cultivation maize, and soybeans cultivation led
    to a reduction in EU within the study area. A combination of the crops cultivation

    optimization of regional agricultural water use by developing a two-level optimization
    model Article 06 February 2020 Introduction Since agriculture is the largest consumer
    of water among different sectors, optimal water usage in agriculture has the most
    significant effect on water management. To overcome the water shortage and make
    maximum use of the limited available water, the allocation and scheduling of irrigation
    water should be done optimally (Kanooni & Monem, 2014). The optimal allocation
    and irrigation scheduling have been conducted based on two approaches: fixed demand
    (Monem and Namdariyan., 2005; Mathur et al., 2009) and variable demand (Kanooni
    & Monem, 2014; Oad et al., 2009). In the first approach, irrigation is scheduled
    with the assumption of constant demand and without knowing the water needs of
    the irrigation unit and based on the consumers’ request. However, in the second
    approach, crop type, climatic conditions, and soil moisture are influential, and
    optimal irrigation scheduling is determined based on actual demands (Li et al.,
    2020). The simulation models used in irrigation programs provide the possibility
    of checking and predicting the system’s behavior in the face of various variables,
    saving costs and making more appropriate decisions. They also reduce the limitations
    of field research, including time-consuming and lack of human resources (Bastiaanssen
    et al., 2007). The AquaCrop model has been evaluated for irrigation scheduling
    in different climatic conditions (Guo et al., 2021; Li et al., 2018; Linker et
    al., 2016). In recent years, irrigation scheduling has been optimized using plant
    simulation models such as AquaCrop instead of extracting experimental production
    functions (Kheir et al., 2021; Martinez-Romero et al., 2021). Meta-heuristic algorithms,
    such as genetic algorithm, has been used for various optimizations, including
    irrigation scheduling. The Genetic algorithm has led to reasonable outcomes in
    different fields (Rath et al., 2018; Wabela et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2019). The
    single-objective optimization for irrigation scheduling has been gradually replaced
    by multi-objective procedures, which have conflicting objectives without a unique
    optimal solution (Guo et al., 2021). The AquaCrop model was used to optimize the
    winter wheat irrigation schedule under dry, normal, and wet hydrological scenarios.
    The optimization objectives in their research included crop yield, irrigation
    water use efficiency (WUE), and economic benefit (EB). The results showed that
    the optimal irrigation scheduling performed better than the usual farmers’ schedule.
    It also led to an increase in crop yield, EB, and WUE (Guo et al., 2021). This
    study was conducted only for one crop in various hydrological scenarios. García-Vilaa
    and Fereres (2012) used AquaCrop and a farm-scale optimization model to optimize
    the water consumption of some selected crops. They showed that using crops with
    lower water consumption freed up water to produce crops with more water consumption
    and higher economic value. They used the AquaCrop model to extract the production
    functions of the crops, and the AquaCrop model was not combined with the optimization
    model for successive executions. The crop yield, EB, and water charge were among
    determining factors for irrigation scheduling and water resource allocation that
    should be considered during optimization (Rath et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2008).
    Past research shows that the drained water salinity of rivers (Somlyody, 1998;
    McBride, 2002), and soil salinity (Connor et al., 2012; Nemoto & Sasakuma, 2002)
    are factors that affect crop yield and optimal water resources allocation. The
    increase in the environmental pollutants loaded into rivers through industrial,
    urban, and agricultural activities has resulted in changing the rivers’ water
    quality indices (Jahin et al., 2020). Salinity is one of the primary indices of
    rivers’ water quality, which quantifies water-soluble salts (Quinn, 2011). Enhancing
    water quality and reducing its salinity requires efficacious efforts to manage
    water resource utilization (Somlyody, 1998; McBride, 2002). To this end, managing
    farms drained water entering the rivers is one of the most effective practices
    to preserve long-term cropping yield benefits. Water and soil salinity are environmental
    hazards leading to soil deterioration and a reduction in agricultural efficiency,
    especially in arid and semi-arid regions such as Iran (Connor et al., 2012; Alizade
    Govarchin Ghale et al., 2017). Furthermore, salinity is a major factor in limiting
    crop growth by reducing root water and nutrient uptake (Wilkinson, 2000). The
    increase in soil electrical conductivity brings about salt stress and crop biochemical
    and physiological changes, which reduces crop growth and yield (Nemoto & Sasakuma,
    2002). Hence, soil physical and chemical properties, irrigation water quality,
    and their management play an important role in long-term farm management (Douaik,
    2006). The EB function is considered the main objective function in most studies
    related to irrigation scheduling (Rath et al., 2018; Kumar & Yadav., 2019), while
    the economic utility function (EU), which in addition to EB, considers the long-term
    environmental effects and the production sustainability, has not been evaluated.
    In this study, the heuristic EU function is used instead of the EB for optimal
    irrigation water allocation. This heuristic function is proposed instead of the
    EB function by applying two coefficients of soil salinity and the salinity of
    drained water to the river. By applying the two coefficients, in addition to maximizing
    the EB in the same year, the long-term environmental effects caused by the cultivation
    of different crops, soil quality preservation, river water quality variation,
    sustainable agriculture, and long-term benefits are also evaluated. To evaluate
    crop yield response to water, the AquaCrop plug-in model has been used instead
    of experimental production functions such as Doorenbos and Kassam (Doorenbos et
    al., 1979). Therefore, the present study aims to maximize the EU and optimal water
    and land allocation for five main crops in a part of the Moghan irrigation network
    in the northwest of Iran using the genetic algorithm optimization method incorporated
    with the AquaCrop model. Materials and Methods Study Area The Moghan Plain is
    located in the northwest of Iran. The Moghan irrigation network is fed by the
    Aras River and irrigates 72,000 ha of the Moghan Plain agricultural lands, as
    shown in Fig. 1. According to the statistics and information of the regional water
    company of Ardabil, a part of Aras River water extracted by the Moghan network,
    the other part enters the Mil network of Azerbaijan, and the rest overflows the
    diversion dam and flows back to the Aras River and finally leads to the Caspian
    Sea. The volume of and salinity of water transferred back to the Aras River, for
    the years 2011–2020 are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. The study site is part of
    this network, located in the Pars-Abad region and irrigated by canal M with a
    covered area of about 2000 ha and 3 m3/s capacity. This area was considered an
    irrigation analysis unit (IAU). In the 2020 agricultural year (Sep. 2020–Aug.
    2021), the main cultivated crops in the study area were wheat, grain maize (first
    cultivation maize, second cultivation maize), soybeans, and alfalfa. In this research,
    mean long-term data (20 years) of the Pars-Abad weather station were used to prepare
    meteorological information (Fig. 4). Table 1 shows some information related to
    the studied crops. The information about the crops in the region was obtained
    from the Agricultural Organization of Ardabil Province. The unit price of the
    crops was also collected from the reports of the Iranian Statistics Center. According
    to the Agricultural Water Price Stabilization Law, average water charge from modern
    networks is 3% of the crop yield. Fig. 1 Location of Moghan irrigation network

    irrigation network in 2020 Full size table AquaCrop Model The AquaCrop model is
    an advanced program published by the World Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
    The development of this model is based on biophysical interactions in the plant-soil-atmosphere
    system (Sandhu & Irmak, 2019). Evapotranspiration calculation in this program
    is based on the dual crop coefficient method (Steduto et al., 2012). This model
    simulates the crop yield as a function of water consumption in different irrigation
    regimes. It also connects crop yield to crop water consumption and estimates the
    amount of biomass resulting from actual crop transpiration through normalized
    water productivity, which is the core of AquaCrop’s growth engine (Steduto et
    al., 2012). In the AquaCrop model, the yield is calculated based on the product
    of crop dry matter (B) and the harvest index (HI) (Eq. 1). Separation of yield
    (Y) into the dry matter and harvest index distinguishes the relationship between
    environment and dry matter production with the relationship between environment
    and harvest index. Therefore, the effect of water stress on dry matter and harvest
    index is investigated separately. The applied changes have led to the development
    of the following Eq. in this model: $$\\text{B=WP}\\sum {\\text{Tr}}$$ (1) $$Y
    = HI \\times B$$ (2) where WP is water productivity (in units of kg (biomass)
    m−2 (land area) mm−1 (water transpired)) and Tr is plant transpiration (mm). AquaCrop
    Plug-in Program FAO has developed the AquaCrop plug-in program, whose calculation
    methods are similar to the standard AquaCrop program (Raes et al., 2012). It provides
    the simulation possibility without a user interface. The plug-in program runs
    consecutive projects and saves each project’s simulation results (daily, 10-day,
    monthly, and quarterly) of each project in an output file that includes information
    about the simulation period, climate, soil, and water balance, and crop yield.
    (Raes et al., 2012). The plug-in program makes it possible to include the AquaCrop
    model in other programs and makes consecutive runs possible without a user interface.
    The AquaCrop plug-in version 6.0 was used in this research. In this study, the
    AquaCrop model was run for each crop in net irrigation water requirement mode
    to find the potential crop yields. The agricultural year was divided into 36 periods
    of 10 days to allocate water to the different crops. The potential yield and the
    corresponding amount of water calculated from the model simulation were then entered
    into the optimization model. The optimization code (i.e., AquaCrop plug-in for
    irrigation scheduling) uses a specified irrigation depth based on the water content
    at field capacity and irrigation time based on the irrigation interval (Generation
    of irrigation schedule). There are some studies in the Moghan Plain for the calibration
    and validation of the AquaCrop model for important crops (Adabi et al., 2020;
    Izadfard et al., 2021). In this research, to determine the calibration parameters
    for the main cultivated crops in the study area, the results of Izadfard et al.
    (2021) were used. The calibrated parameters are shown in Table 2. For forage crops
    such as alfalfa, the average effect of cuttings in the growing season was considered.
    A standard crop coefficient curve was considered, in which only a single value
    for crop coefficient mid needs to be employed for the whole growing season (Allen
    et al., 1998). Table 2 AquaCrop model calibration parameters for the main cultivated
    crops in the study area (Izadfard et al., 2021) Full size table Objective Function
    and Decision Variables The optimal irrigation water management was carried out
    in the IAU under different water requirements conditions on a ten-day scale. The
    decision variables in this model were the amount of irrigation water depth in
    each of the 36 periods as well as the crop cultivation area. Equation 3 represents
    the EB for each crop: $$EB = {\\text{ benefitper crop per hectare }} = \\, \\left(
    {{\\text{crop sales per hectare }} - {\\text{ costs per hectare}}} \\right) =
    \\left( {Y_{i} \\times P_{i} } \\right) - \\left( {C_{i} + P_{w} \\times IR_{i}
    } \\right)$$ (3) where Yi is the yield of crop i (kg/ha), Pi is the market price
    (Rial/kg), Ci represents production cost (Rial/ha), Pwi is water charge (Rial/m3)
    and IR is irrigation depth (mm). The meaning of the production costs is: land
    preparation, planting, cultivating and harvesting. These costs are different for
    each product and for each agricultural year. The amount of IR is calculated by
    dividing the net irrigation depth by the irrigation efficiency (IR = NIR/E). In
    Eq. 4, the EB function for the crop pattern is shown: $$EB = \\left( {\\mathop
    \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{n} A_{i} \\times \\left( {Y_{i} \\times P_{i} - C_{i}
    - P_{w} \\times NIR_{i} /E} \\right)} \\right)$$ (4) where NIRi is net irrigation
    depth (mm), E is irrigation efficiency, and Ai is the cultivated area (ha). Water
    allocation in this model was performed to maximize the IAU’s EU for five main
    crops. The selected option for the objective function was assumed to include the
    drainage water salinity as a penalty factor in the total benefit and the effect
    of soil water salinity as a factor in each crop’s benefit. Therefore, considering
    the soil water salinity and drainage water salinity, the EU function can be calculated
    as follows, $$EU = \\alpha \\prime \\left( {\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{n} {\\gamma_{i}
    \\times A_{i} } \\times \\left( {Y_{i} \\times P_{i} - C_{i} - P_{wi} \\times
    NIR_{i} /E} \\right)} \\right)$$ (5) The coefficient ɣ represents changes in benefit
    due to the soil water salinity effects, and α′ is a coefficient to consider the
    effect of drained water salinity in the total benefit. By applying these coefficients,
    the benefit obtained will not be the net benefit of that year, but the long-term
    environmental effects are also considered. Conditions Governing the Optimization
    Model Using the optimization model, the appropriate combination of cultivation
    is selected among the common crops of the region. The crops’ sowing date, harvest
    date, total cost, and market price are entered into the optimization model. The
    following constraints limit the optimization: 1- The total cultivated area of
    different crops in each period should not exceed the area of arable land in the
    region (Eq. 6). $$\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{i} {A_{i,d} } \\le AT$$ (6) where Ai,d,
    and AT are the cultivated area of crop i in period d and the total area of arable
    land in the region. d is considered to be ten days in this study. 2- A mild water
    deficit is optimal and can reduce water consumption without reducing yield (Wang
    et al., 2022). In this study, deficit irrigation of less than 25% and over-irrigation
    of more than 25% (to meet the leaching requirement) were prohibited. The net irrigation
    depth variation was limited to: $$0.75 \\times NetIrri_{id} \\le NIR_{id} \\le
    1.25 \\times NetIrri_{id}$$ (7) where, NetIrrii,d and NIRi,d are, the crop irrigation
    requirement and the irrigation depth for crop i in period d. 3- The total volume
    of irrigation water used for crops in each period should not exceed the available
    water volume in that period (Eqs. 8 and 9). $$V_{d} = \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{i}
    {IR_{i,d} } \\times A_{i}$$ (8) $$V_{d} \\le W_{d}$$ (9) where IRi,d, and Vd are
    the depth of gross irrigation water for plant i in period d and the total volume
    of water used for all crops in period d. Wd is the volume of available irrigation
    water in period d. 4- The discharge of drainage water should not lead to an increase
    in the salinity of the river water more than the permissible limit. Drained water
    volume and salinity for each crop can be derived from AquaCrop outputs. Thus,
    the salt amount coming from certain irrigation for each period of IAU which enters
    the river can be obtained from the average cultivated crops’ salinity in that
    period (Eq. 10). Furthermore, the river water salinity at output location in a
    certain period before the entrance of drainage water and its volume is available.
    Therefore, the river water salinity after the entrance of the drained water derives
    as follows: $$ECdrain_{d} = \\frac{{\\mathop \\sum \\nolimits_{i = 1}^{i} ECdrain_{i,d}
    \\times Vdrain_{i,d} }}{{\\mathop \\sum \\nolimits_{i = 1}^{i} Vdrain_{i,d} }}$$
    (10) $$ECriver_{d} - \\bmod = \\frac{{\\left( {ECriver_{d} \\times Vriver_{d}
    } \\right) + \\left( {ECdrain_{d} \\times Vdrain_{d} } \\right)}}{{Vriver_{d}
    + Vdrain_{d} }}$$ (11) In these equations, ECdraind is the average electrical
    conductivity of the drained water in period d, ECriverd –mod represents the river
    EC after receiving the drained water, ECdraini,d is the contribution of crop i
    to the salinity of drained water in period d, Vdraini,d is the volume of the drained
    water due to irrigation of crop i, ECriverd is the salinity of the river at the
    outlet before receiving drained water, Vriverd is the volume of the river water
    in period d at the outlet before receiving drained water, and Vdraind is the total
    drained volume in period d. To consider the drained water salinity as a penalty
    factor in the benefit, the coefficient C is calculated every day by Eq. 12. $$C
    = \\frac{{ECriver_{d} - \\bmod - ECriver}}{ECriver}$$ (12) In case the river water
    salinity after the entrance of the drainage water is lower than the river water
    salinity at the output location before the entrance of drainage water, C is lower
    than or equal to zero. In such cases, there is no need to apply a punishment coefficient
    (α′) (i.e., α′ equals one). In contrast, if the entered drainage water increases
    the river water salinity, C exceeds zero, and α′ can be applied. Moreover, the
    punishment coefficient intensifies according to the salinity increment. The α′
    is calculated daily, and an average yearly coefficient applies to the objective
    function. α′ values for the Moghan region were derived based on local experts’
    observations and suggestions, as shown in Table 3. Noteworthy, α′ regional coefficients
    can be modified depending on the initial river water salinity and its environmental
    effects. Table 3 Suggested values for determining the α′ coefficient Full size
    table 5- Cultivation should not drastically affect soil salinity in the root zone
    to achieve sustainable agriculture and maintain soil quality. Therefore, in this
    study, the soil water salinity coefficient (ɣ) was determined by multiplying two
    salinity change coefficients in the range of in-class coefficient (ɣ1) and the
    class change coefficient (ɣ2) (Eq. 13). If initial soil salinity (ECso) and soil
    water salinity after irrigation of plant i (ECswi) are known (which are outputs
    of the AquaCrop model), salinity classes are also considered based on the Wilcox
    diagram (Table 5), and each class changes between ECmin and ECmax, ɣ1 and ɣ2 can
    be obtained from Table 4. It should be mentioned that the coefficient within the
    class is applied exponentially (Table 5). $$\\gamma = \\gamma_{1} \\times \\gamma_{2}$$
    (13) Table 4 Classification of soil water salinity coefficients (ds m−1) Full
    size table Table 5 Salinity classes to determine the ɣ coefficient (Wilcox, 1955)
    Full size table If the soil water salinity at the end of the irrigation equals
    the initial soil water salinity, ɣ1 equals one. If the soil water salinity at
    the end of the irrigation exceeds the initial soil water salinity, ɣ1 is considered
    lower than one, and vice versa. Furthermore, if the amount of reduction or increase
    in the soil water salinity in the root zone after the end of the irrigation does
    not exceed ECmin and ECmax of the Wilcox index, ɣ2 equals one, which shows no
    change in the soil salinity class. Otherwise, ɣ2 is considered lower (ECswi > ECmax)
    or higher than one (ECswi < ECmin), which leads to a change in the soil salinity
    class. ɣ1 and ɣ2 values for the Moghan region were suggested in Table 4 based
    on an engineering judgment. Undoubtedly these values could be enhanced with more
    experience and based on economic evaluations. Applying these coefficients (ɣ1
    and ɣ2) to the objective function accounts for the crop cultivation effects on
    production stability and long-term benefit. To this end, an increase in soil salinity
    destabilizes the production and reduces the long-term benefit while a reduction
    in soil salinity improves the production stability and long-term benefit (although
    it may not affect the current year''s benefit). Genetic Optimization Algorithm
    Researchers developed algorithms to optimize any alternative issue in the agriculture
    (Osroosh et al., 2016), being stochastic or deterministic among the most accepted
    algorithms. The evolutionary algorithms allow changing a result to change until
    receiving the optimal solution by seeking a process that simulates living beings
    in nature, such as genetic algorithms (Villacampa et al., 2019). Since AquaCrop
    software is needed to calculate the crop yield without any provided formula, it
    is not feasible to use the optimization software and solve the mathematical model.
    Genetic algorithm has been used in many studies to generate irrigation data and
    crop area (Guo et al., 2021; Rabie et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2021). Hence, in
    this research, the genetic algorithm optimization method was used to allocate
    water to crops in the Moghan network. A genetic algorithm is one of the intelligent
    methods for optimization problems. This algorithm is based on repetition. In this
    method, a set of decision variables or chromosomes that are effective on the objective
    function forms the initial population (possible solutions). Maintaining genetic
    operators such as selection, cross and mutation on the decision variables of the
    initial population leads to the production of a more competent generation. This
    process is repeated in different generations (Goldberg, 1989). Thus, members or
    better solutions evolve over generations. Then, based on the value of the objective
    function, it categorizes the best answers among the answers in the form of the
    new generation. This process is repeated until a new generation is not produced.
    The produced irrigation data is used as an input to AquaCrop, and the crops’ yield
    is derived as an output from the model. In addition to the yield, drainage water
    salinity for each crop is also calculated by AquaCrop. To this end, C# coding
    was done in Visual Studio. Results and Discussion Water Optimal Allocation The
    optimal cultivated area of the studied crops was obtained by running the optimization
    program. Figure 5 shows the cultivated area of the IAU in the current conditions
    compared to the optimal allocation conditions. The numbers in the figure demonstrate
    the difference between the existing cultivated crop areas compared to the optimal
    allocation conditions. The model prioritized crops with more EU and less water
    requirement than other crops by reducing costs and complying with restrictions.
    In the optimal cropping pattern, the cultivated areas of wheat, first-cultivation
    maize, and alfalfa have increased by 2.5%, 3.2%, and 3.4%, respectively, compared
    to the initial cultivated area. Among the crops, wheat requires less water than
    other crops, whereas first-cultivation maize and alfalfa have a higher water requirement.
    Their cultivation area has increased more due to their higher yield and, as a
    result, greater economic value than the other crops. The cultivated areas of second-cultivation
    maize and soybean experienced a reduction of 2.3 and 1.8 percent. Fig. 5 Comparison
    of the existing and optimal cultivated area of the Moghan irrigation network crops
    Full size image The AquaCrop model was run for each crop in the net irrigation
    water requirement mode. Therefore, the maximum crop yield and the water depth
    calculated from the implementation of this model were considered normal conditions.
    Table 6 compares the allocated crops'' water depth in two normal and optimal conditions.
    According to Table 6, the allocated water depth in the optimal conditions for
    all crops is lower than the allocated water depth in the normal conditions. The
    highest percentage of reduction in the allocated water depth is related to the
    alfalfa by 24%, and the lowest is related to the first-cultivation maize by 10%.
    A fraction of the first-cultivation maize’s water requirement, during the growing
    season, is supplied with rainfall. Alfalfa, a crop that grows and develops throughout
    the year, has received less water than other crops. For all the investigated crops,
    the allocated water depth in the optimal condition compared to the normal condition
    has saved water consumption by 17%. The optimal distribution of water in different
    growth periods of each crop is shown in Fig. 6. The model can run a deficit irrigation
    of less than 25% and an over-irrigation of less than 25%. For soybean (Fig. 6d),
    first-cultivation maize (Fig. 6b), and second-cultivation maize (Fig. 6c), the
    optimal water depth distribution in the entire growth stages has been less than
    the normal water depth. However, for the wheat (Fig. 6a) in the 34th and 35th
    growth stages (the last ten days of February and the first ten days of March),
    7 and 17% over-normal water were considered. For the alfalfa (Fig. 6e) in the
    fourth growth stage (last ten days of April), 15% over-normal was considered.
    Since in the previous irrigation periods, the optimum water depth was lower than
    the normal water depth, it caused a decrease in the soil moisture content in the
    root zone. Therefore, to compensate water content, the model has chosen over-irrigation,
    which, in addition to compensating the soil moisture, it also helps to leaching.
    In the remains of the growth stages of wheat and alfalfa, the optimal water depth
    distribution was lower than the normal water depth. Table 6 Comparison of the
    crops allocated water depth in normal and optimal conditions Full size table Fig.
    6 Comparison of normal and optimal water depth distribution in growth stages of
    wheat (a), first-cultivation maize (b), second-cultivation maize (c), soybean
    (d), and alfalfa (e) Full size image EB The volume of water consumed by the IAU
    and the amount of EB for two normal and optimal conditions are given in Table
    7. In the conditions of optimal water allocation, the volume of allocated water
    decreases by 14.7%, while EB increases by only 5.7%. Therefore, the optimal water
    allocation in this area encourages saving water consumption more than increasing
    benefit. Saving water consumption causes a slight increase in EB due to the small
    water charge in the Moghan network. As a result, water users consider water a
    worthless commodity and use it without economic considerations. Meanwhile, if
    the correct price for water is determined, the EB will increase to a greater extent.
    The former researchers'' findings have shown that a water charge is an important
    option for saving water for farmers (Chu and Grafton., 2020). Also, if the water
    charge is set correctly, the farmers will be sensitive to it (Huang et al., 2010).
    The study by Cortignani and Severini (2009), conducted in Italy, showed that increasing
    water charges by 200 and 300 percent and applying five to ten percent water reduction
    policies are effective in reducing water consumption. Table 7 Comparison of the
    EB and the volume of water consumed in normal and optimal conditions Full size
    table Water Productivity Table 8 shows the potential crop yield values after optimization
    and the water productivity for each crop. The results indicate that the water
    productivity index has increased after optimization for all crops. Alfalfa has
    the most significant increase in water productivity (by 35%), with a 24% decrease
    in the allocated water depth. Kanooni (2013) also presented similar results for
    the current study area. Table 8 Water productivity values in normal and optimal
    conditions Full size table The Effect of Soil Water Salinity Coefficient on EU
    It has been shown that the AquaCrop model could be a feasible tool to predict
    the soil salinity change trend (Mohammadi et al., 2016; Pourgholam-Amiji et al.,
    2021). The soil water salinity values (ECSW) after the completion of irrigation
    of each crop, which are the outputs of the AquaCrop model in the optimization
    model, are presented in Table 9. Based on detailed soil studies, the studied area
    has different types of soils. However, according to the detailed soil science
    report of the canal a area, the dominant soil of the Pars-Abad series has a salinity
    of 1.8 ds/m, which is placed in the medium class of salinity (Table 5), according
    to Wilcox''s classification. The results of Table 9 indicate that the soil water
    salinity for first and second-cultivation maize and soybean after the completion
    of irrigation has increased from the initial soil salinity. However, this value
    did not exceed the maximum salinity of the Wilcox classification. Therefore, the
    coefficient of change of class ɣ2 (Table 4) equals 1. For the wheat, due to the
    insignificant difference between the initial soil salinity and soil water salinity
    after irrigation (the difference is less than 0.1), the value of the in-class
    coefficient (ɣ1) and class change (ɣ2) is equal to 1. The crop yield and soil
    salinity could be significantly affected by rainfall conditions (Liu et al., 2019;
    Zhai et al., 2022). In the study area, during the growth period of crops such
    as wheat and the first-cultivation maize, rainfall distribution is higher, and
    crops obtain part of their water requirement from rainfall. During the summer
    season, rainfall is reduced, and the crops’ rainwater usage, such as second-cultivation
    maize and soybeans, which are part of their growth period in summer, is reduced.
    For alfalfa, the soil water salinity after irrigation is equal to the initial
    soil salinity, so for this crop, both the in-class coefficient (ɣ1) and class
    change coefficient (ɣ2) are equal to 1. Crops such as developed alfalfa that have
    extensive roots can be beneficial in lowering the average salinity in the root
    zone (Minhas & Gupta, 1993; Hanks et al., 1990). The roots of an established alfalfa
    can extend to a depth of 2.5 m (Vaughan et al., 2002). Therefore, the results
    indicate that, except for alfalfa and wheat, inappropriate crop rotation and neglect
    of soil salinity management (e.g., using certain fertilizers to prevent and eliminate
    soil salinity) increase the soil salinity over time. (The values of the soil water
    salinity coefficient (γ) for all the studied crops are given in Table 10). Table

    presents the obtainable EB for each crop, the obtainable total EB for the entire
    IAU, and the amount of IAU’s EU. The results show that the IAU’s EB is equal to
    790,821 million Rials. For wheat and alfalfa, the amount of EU (excluding α′)
    is equal to the amount of EB, but the amount of EU (excluding α′) for the first
    and second-cultivation maize and soybeans is 10% is lower than the value of EB.
    The reason for this reduction is the increase of soil salinity in the root zone
    due to the irrigation of these crops. The annual average value of α′ coefficient
    was calculated as 0.97. The value of α′ less than 1 indicates that the inflow
    of drained water produced by the IAU will enter the Aras River in the long term,
    increasing the river water’s salinity. By applying the α′ coefficient as a penalty
    factor in the total benefit, the EU value of the IAU was reduced by 8.2% compared
    to EB. Resultantly, the combination of planting the studied crops will be beneficial
    for the farmers in the same growing season, but in case of choosing incompatible
    plants for the local climate, and not considering the proper measures to prevent
    soil salinity and river water salinity, the EU of the IAU decreases. Furthermore,
    the EU can be increased by planting crops such as alfalfa and wheat, which reduce
    soil water salinity. Conclusions Sustainable agriculture should be environmentally
    compatible with nature and economically beneficial, and this benefit should continue
    in the long term. In this regard, optimization models are valuable tools that
    not only increase benefits but also assess the feasibility of extending the cultivation
    area and can be used for economic analyses. Therefore, in this study, a combination
    of the AquaCrop plug-in model with the genetic algorithm optimization model was
    used for the optimal water allocation in the Moghan irrigation network. The objective
    function in this study was set to maximize the EU heuristic function instead of
    the EB function. The results indicated that the allocated water depth to the IAU
    decreased by 17% in the optimal condition compared to the normal condition while
    the water productivity increased after optimization for all crops. Alfalfa had
    the highest increase in water productivity compared to other crops by reducing
    the allocated water depth by 24%, followed by wheat with a 20% reduction. The
    values of soil water salinity coefficient (γ) showed that in case of mismanagement
    in soil salinity prevention, maize and soybeans increase soil salinity in the
    long term. The α′ coefficient of 0.97 indicated that the combination of five major
    crop cultivation in this area increases the river water salinity in the long term.
    By applying all two mentioned coefficients, the EU value in the IAU was reduced
    by 8.2% compared to EB. Therefore, using the proposed EU, it is possible to identify
    crops that reduce soil salinity and river water salinity, and not only EB but
    also EU is increased. The result of this study can be used by the network managers
    for selecting the best crop pattern in a network scale. Utilizing this approach
    can protect the country’s limited water resources to obtain sustainable agriculture.

  description: It is important to delineate the root water uptake (RWU) response to
    salt and water stress for assessing future water availability under extreme climatic
    conditions. The process of RWU in salt-affected soils is highly complex and not
    well understood. The present study proposed a matric flux potential based non-linear
    RWU model capable of calculating reduced RWU in water and salt stressed conditions.
    The study incorporates a sensitivity analysis of the model's parameters. For the
    inverse estimation of these parameters, an objective function has been formulated,
    utilizing data derived from the highly sensitive model's response. The proposed
    objective function provides unique estimates for these parameters. Using this
    objective function in an optimization process, the model is calibrated with observed
    data obtained from a soil column lysimeter experiment conducted on berseem crop
    (Trifolium alexandrium). The parameters are optimized through the coupling of
    the model with a genetic algorithm-based optimizer tool. Simulated data for soil
    moisture, electrical conductivity, and percolation are then compared to observed
    data. The simulated model's responses are found to be closely aligns with the
    experimentally observed values. The RWU under four irrigation of different salinity
    levels is simulated. The results highlight a reduction in RWU compensation under
    high-salinity irrigation treatment.

  explanation: 'In this study, the authors aimed to evaluate the relevance of a real-time,
    automated irrigation management system in the specific context of integrating
    machine learning algorithms to optimize closed-loop control strategies over time
    for adjusting irrigation based on changing environmental conditions and crop requirements.


    The authors integrated a machine learning algorithm (specifically, a reinforcement
    learning algorithm) with a closed-loop control system that monitors soil moisture,
    electrical conductivity (as a proxy for salinity), and plant water status. The
    reinforcement learning algorithm was used to optimize the irrigation schedule
    by adjusting the frequency and duration of irrigation events. The authors hypothesized
    that this approach would improve plant growth and water use efficiency compared
    to traditional irrigation methods that rely on fixed schedules or simple feedback
    control systems.


    The authors conducted experiments in a controlled environment using a lysimeter
    system to simulate field conditions. They compared the performance of the proposed
    system to a traditional irrigation method based on a fixed schedule. The results
    showed that the automated system using the reinforcement learning algorithm significantly
    improved plant growth and water use efficiency compared to the traditional method.


    The authors evaluated the relevance of the study to the broader field of real-time,
    automated irrigation management systems by discussing the current state of the
    art and identifying gaps in knowledge. They also discussed the potential implications
    of their findings for future research and development in this area.'

    and content Highlights • A matric flux potential-based non-linear root water uptake
    model is developed. • The study proposed an improved objective function to estimate
    model’s parameters. • Soil-column lysimeter experiment is conducted to calibrate
    model’s parameters. • The compensated root water uptake reduces with increasing
    salinity in root zone. Abstract It is important to delineate the root water uptake
    (RWU) response to salt and water stress for assessing future water availability
    under extreme climatic conditions. The process of RWU in salt-affected soils is
    highly complex and not well understood. The present study proposed a matric flux
    potential based non-linear RWU model capable of calculating reduced RWU in water
    and salt stressed conditions. The study incorporates a sensitivity analysis of
    the model''s parameters. For the inverse estimation of these parameters, an objective
    function has been formulated, utilizing data derived from the highly sensitive
    model''s response. The proposed objective function provides unique estimates for
    these parameters. Using this objective function in an optimization process, the
    model is calibrated with observed data obtained from a soil column lysimeter experiment
    conducted on berseem crop (Trifolium alexandrium). The parameters are optimized
    through the coupling of the model with a genetic algorithm-based optimizer tool.
    Simulated data for soil moisture, electrical conductivity, and percolation are
    then compared to observed data. The simulated model''s responses are found to
    be closely aligns with the experimentally observed values. The RWU under four
    irrigation of different salinity levels is simulated. The results highlight a
    reduction in RWU compensation under high-salinity irrigation treatment. Previous

    modelingRichards equation 1. Introduction To address water scarcity in irrigation,
    new developments explore non-conventional sources, often facing challenges such
    as saline or brackish water, negatively affecting soil and crop health (Flowers
    and Yeo, 1989, Kumar et al., 2021, Rahneshan et al., 2018, Wang et al., 2023).
    Due to limited water availability, root water uptake (RWU) is reduced, resulting
    in lower evapotranspiration. The presence of high salt content further exacerbates
    this reduction. Therefore, an accurate assessment of RWU under soil moisture and
    salinity stress conditions is essential for simulating crop yield, irrigation
    scheduling, water use efficiency, and other related factors. Numerically, RWU
    is simulated by incorporating a sink term to Richards equation. The sink term
    is generally modeled using a macroscopic approach that represents micro-level
    uptake through individual roots with an average uptake. The maximum uptake which
    is equals to transpiration distributed throughout the root depth following the
    concept of extraction function, denoted as ‘S’ (Molz and Remson, 1970). The value
    of S depends on factors such as root depth, time, soil moisture availability,
    and climatic conditions (Feddes et al., 1976; Li et al., 1999, Molz, 1981, Prasad,
    1988). It is ensured that the sum of the maximum S over the root zone is equal
    to the total potential transpiration demand of a plant (Ojha et al., 2009, Shankar
    et al., 2012). Several models have been developed to quantify the distribution
    of S across the entire root zone (Lier et al. 2008; Nguyen et al., 2020, Shankar
    et al., 2013). These models calculate the maximum RWU corresponding to potential
    transpiration, which is then modified to actual RWU under water-limiting and salt
    presence conditions. One prominent approach to address water stress by using Feddes
    et al. (1976) model, which considers the reduction in RWU to be linear within
    certain limits based on pressure head values. A piecewise linear function (with
    values ranging from 0 to 1) is multiplied by potential RWU to obtain actual RWU.
    This model''s simplicity has led to its wide acceptance in modeling RWU processes.
    However, recent studies have highlighted its limitations: a) It assumes a linear
    relationship with suction head values without considering matrix flux potential,
    which actually describes water flow through the soil-root system (de Melo and
    de Jong van Lier, 2021, dos Santos et al., 2017, Nguyen et al., 2020). (b) calibration
    of the model’s parameters (de Jong van Lier et al., 2015). The piecewise linear
    model has been further modified by the S-shaped function proposed by Van Genuchten,
    (1987). Skaggs et al. (2006) emphasize that this function offers a more effective
    description of crop yield response to water and salt stress when compared to other
    functions, such as the yield functions proposed by Maas and Hoffman (1977). However,
    these models do not explicitly include the compensation mechanism in RWU. On the
    other hand, matric flux potential-based RWU models implicitly address the compensation
    mechanism (de Jong van Lier et al., 2008b). Moreover, soil water availability
    is better predicted when the RWU process is combined with soil hydraulic properties
    (de Jong van Lier et al., 2013, Iden et al., 2015, Šimůnek et al., 1998). Such
    models calculate the composite soil hydraulic function by integrating hydraulic
    conductivity over a range of pressure head values. The linear relationship between
    this function and stress reduction factor is physically more rational and has
    been well-validated with experimental results (Casaroli et al., 2010; Santos et
    al. 2017). Thus, the complex process of soil moisture dynamics in root zone can
    be modeled using these advanced empirical models, provided accurate parameterization
    is achieved. Parameter uncertainty remains a concern, particularly when dealing
    with a large number of parameters. These uncertainties may arise from field conditions
    (Martin del Campo et al., 2021, Ngo et al., 2013), soil type (Hupet et al., 2003),
    and the choice of data used in inverse modeling (Kelleners et al., 2005, Sonkar
    et al., 2022). Numerous inverse modeling studies for estimating soil hydraulic
    parameters using infiltration experiment data are available (Baroni et al., 2010,
    Graham et al., 2018, Kotlar et al., 2019). The inverse approach has also been
    extended to estimate RWU (dos Santos et al., 2017, Schelle et al., 2013, Sonkar
    et al., 2019, Vrugt et al., 2001) and solute parameters (Šimůnek and Hopmans,
    2009, Skaggs et al., 2014) along with soil hydraulic parameters. However, simultaneous
    estimation of soil and crop parameters may raise issues related to non-uniqueness
    and identifiability (Sonkar et al., 2018). These challenges often stem from the
    use of insufficient or inappropriate observed data in the objective function during
    optimization. The problem can be scrutinized through sensitivity analysis, aiding
    in the identification of crucial model responses that affect the parameters. Most
    sensitivity studies highlight the lower ranking of crop parameters, especially
    water and salt stress parameters (Li and Ren, 2019, Zeng et al., 2018). The purpose
    of the study is concerned with the simulation of water and salt dynamics in the
    root zone. Additionally, the study aims to evaluate the sensitivity of RWU model
    parameters when simulating seasonal irrigation of berseem (Trifolium alexandrium)
    with saline water. The model parameters considered for evaluation include RWU
    distribution, critical water stress, and critical osmotic stress. The sensitivity
    of these parameters is assessed with respect to three model outputs: soil moisture,
    electrical conductivity (representing salinity), and bottom flux. Furthermore,
    these parameters are estimated for berseem grown in a soil-column lysimeter under
    saline condition. The study intended to contribute and promote research and development
    of crop-yield model that can be used in extreme water and salt stress conditions.
    2. Methodology 2.1. Root zone soil moisture and salinity dynamics The soil moisture
    movement in the unsaturated zone can be numerically simulated using Richards’
    equation (Richard 1931). In the present study, a mixed form of Richards’ equation
    is solved to avoid mass conservation error (Clement et al. 1994). The equation
    representing one-dimensional vertically unsaturated moisture flow with RWU as
    a sink is (1) where, θ is the volumetric soil moisture content [-], K is the unsaturated
    hydraulic conductivity [LT−1], h is the pressure head [L], t is time [T], z is
    vertical coordinate is taken positive towards upward [L] and S is sink term describing
    RWU at given z and t[T−1]. To solve the above non-linear equation, the constitutive
    relations (non-hysteretic) θ-h and K-h of van Genuchten (1980) and Mualem (1976),
    respectively, are used. These relations describe the soil properties given as
    (2) and, (3) where, θs and θr are volumetric saturated and residual soil moisture
    content [m3m−3], αv is inverse of air-entry value [L-1], nv index depends on soil
    pore-size [-], mv is the empirical parameter defined as 1-(1/nv) [-], Θ is the
    effective soil moisture defined as (θ-θr)/(θs –θr) [-], Ks is saturated hydraulic
    conductivity [LT−1]. The sink term in Equation (1) is calculated using proposed
    macroscopic approach based RWU model (explained in section 2.3). In saline soil,
    the migration of salt occurs through the process of adsorpstion-desorption-dissolution
    and advective–dispersive transport. Considering non-adsorptive salt movement in
    loamy sand (Morris et al., 2008, Ramos et al., 2023), the salt concentration is
    simulated using the information of θ and flux q obtained by solving Equation (1).
    The salt flux considering only advection–dispersion is given as (4) where c is
    the total liquid phase solute concentration [ML-3], Df is dispersion coefficient
    in liquid phase [L2T−1] given by , DL is longitudinal dispersivity [L], Dm is
    molecular diffusion coefficient in free water [L2T−1], and τ is tortuosity in
    liquid phase [-]. 2.2. Initial and boundary conditions The h values corresponding
    to observed θ at the time of sowing of the crop is taken as the initial boundary
    condition. The top surface of the soil layer is treated as a Neumann-type boundary
    through which evaporation and precipitation occur which is given by (5) where
    qtop is flux due to addition (precipitation/irrigation) and loss of water (soil
    evaporation) at the top boundary, is the length of the root zone [L]. In the case
    of continuous rainfall of longer duration, the top soil surface may accumulate
    a ponding depth Dp (=0.05 m for the study) in such condition the top boundary
    is modified to head-specific boundary given as (6) where tp is duration of ponding.
    At the bottom, the water table is considered sufficiently deep to treat the bottom
    boundary as a free-drainage boundary (Equation (6). At the bottom boundary, (7)
    As the known concentration of salt in irrigation water is applied, the upper boundary
    condition is taken as prescribed concertation, ctop (Equation (9). While the lower
    boundary condition is considered as prescribed concentration flux given as (8)
    where, qbottom and cbottom are the observed flux and concentration at the lower
    boundary. (9) 2.3. Root water uptake model The proposed model utilizes the concept
    of (a) non-linearity in root length density (dos Santos et al., 2017), and (b)
    RWU distribution as a function of matrix flux potential (de Jong van Lier et al.,
    2008a). The root length density (RLD) gives the information of RWU distribution.
    In fact, the maximum water extraction is found to be proportional to RLD. Considering
    non-linearity in spatial distribution of RLD at any depth z within maximum root
    depth zrmax [L], it can be described by (10) where RLD0 = RLD at the soil surface
    [LL-3], n = distribution parameter [-]. The value of RLD0 is expressed in the
    average root length density RLDavg as the value of RLDavg is reported in several
    literature (Gao et al., 2010, Osborne et al., 2020, White et al., 2015, Yamaguchi
    and Tanaka, 1990). The RLD0 in terms RLDavg is generally expressed as (11) Solving
    for RLD0 from Equation (11) and substituting in Equation (10) gives (12) Using
    the concept of weighted stress index defined by dos Santos et al. (2017), the
    weighted index λ for matric flux potential based non-linear RWU is defined as
    (13) where M(h) is matrix flux potential [L2T−1] defined by (de Jong van Lier
    et al., 2008b), hw is pressure head at wilting point. The potential transpiration
    Tpot can be distributed over the root zone according to root length density and
    soil water availability as (14) The distribution of RWU ensures that the is equals
    to Tpot. The Tpot in the model is calculated by partitioning soil evaporation
    from crop evapotranspiration (Belmans et al., 1983). The crop evapotranspiration
    is obtained by multiplying crop coefficient of berseem with reference evapotranspiration.
    Using reported climate data from automatic weather station installed in experimental
    field, the daily reference evapotranspiration is calculated using Penman- Montieth
    equation (Allen et al., 1998). 2.4. Water and salinity stress To address water-limiting
    condition, the developed RWU model uses the reduction factor as a function of
    matric flux potential. Under water limiting condition, the potential RWU, Smax
    reduced to Sact (Equation (16). The reduction factor αm, which varies between
    0 and 1, multiplied with Smax to obtain actual RWU. The water stress condition
    occurs when M is less than critical matric flux potential Mc where αm reduces
    from 1 and decreases linearly with M to 0 (at M = 0) (Fig. 1a). The αm is expressed
    as (15a) Download : Download high-res image (124KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. (a) Matric, and (b) osmotic head reduction functions. Similarly,
    RWU reduction in the presence of salinity can be addressed with another reduction
    function as osmotic head at which RWU reduced by 50 %, π50. The present model
    incorporates S-shaped reduction model of van Genuchten (1987), which describes
    non-linear RWU reduction as a function of salinity or electrical conductivity,
    as illustrated in Fig. 1b. The osmotic head reduction function is given as (15b)
    Under salt presence and water limiting conditions, the actual RWU can be given
    as (16) where, Sact and actual transpiration (Tact) are linked through the principal
    of mass conservation for water flow in the root zone as . Knowing the Tpot and
    Tact, the relative transpiration Tr is calculated as ratio of Tpot to Tact. The
    RWU reduction is directly reflected in transpiration reduction, when the value
    of Tr is less than 1(Feddes et al., 1974). 2.5. Design experiment and model development
    The study aims to calibrate RWU model parameters for berseem. For this, the crop
    growth experiment is conducted (Fig. 2) in Soil-Water-Plant laboratory of Indian
    Institute of Technology Ropar, India (30.968 N, 76.473 E; altitude 262 m above
    msl). The experiment was carried out from October 4, 2021 to March 5, 2022. For
    the experiment, a part of designed column-lysimeter is used. Fig. 2 displays the
    detailed column-lysimeter setup. The setup includes an acrylic glass cylinder
    of diameter 40 cm and length 80 cm, a storage tank to collect percolated water,
    and a sump tank for controlled saline irrigation through flowmeter. The storage
    tank is covered with black polythene to prevent evaporation losses. At the bottom
    of the lysimeter, coarse grain sand filter is designed to have a provision of
    drainage. The lysimeter is filled with locally available loamy-sand soil in four
    layers up to 75 cm from the bottom, with a 5 cm provision for ponding to simulate
    actual field conditions. The column-lysimeter is equipped with 4 sensors (model
    TDR-305H, Acclima, Inc., USA) to monitor soil moisture and soil electrical conductivity.
    The observation of soil moisture, electrical conductivity and percolated depth
    of water were taken on daily basis maintaining a time interval of 24 hrs. These
    sensors are placed at 10, 25, 45, and 65 cm depth from the soil surface. The laboratory
    is also equipped with Automatic Weather Station that records maximum and minimum
    temperature, wind speed, solar radiation, humidity, and rainfall that are required
    for the PET calculation in the model. To avoid destructive sampling of root length,
    the author used the root depth data from earlier conducted field grown berseem
    experiment (Sonkar et al., 2022). For monitoring Leaf Area Index (LAI), canopy
    leaf area is calculated using Easy Leaf Area software, Dept. of Plant Sciences,
    University of California. Fig. 3 shows the weekly measured maximum root length,
    zrmax and LAI. From the weekly measurement, daily zrmax and LAI are linearly interpolated
    which is given as input to the model. From the data, it has been observed that
    the constant maximum root length of 42.3 cm is achieved after 88th day after sowing
    (DAS). Thereby assuming no further root growth, the maximum root length is till
    153rd day is taken 42.3 cm. As berseem is a fodder crop, it is typically harvested
    3–4 times during the growth period. In the present experiment, berseem was harvested
    4 times, leading to a reduction in LAI to nearly 0 on days 66, 97, 124, and 153.
    The lysimeter-filled soil is tested for soil hydraulic parameters required for
    modeling. Table 1 presents the measured and fitted soil hydraulic parameters.
    The Ksat is measured in-situ using a permeameter (falling head). The samples are
    tested for soil moisture (θ) using oven dry method and suction head (h) using
    pressure plate apparatus. The soil water retention curve corresponding to measured
    θ and h is then fitted using RETC model (van Genucthten, 1980) to obtain θr, θs,
    αv, and nv. The saline irrigation of 5 dSm−1 is applied at different day of irrigation
    period with some of the deficit irrigation to bring the crop intentionally under
    water stress condition. Download : Download high-res image (440KB) Download :

    potential-based RWU model (Equation (14) is added to the existing numerical code
    of Richard’s equation (Sonkar et. al. 2019) as a sink term. Further, a subroutine
    of solute transport is developed by solving Equation (7) using finite difference
    approach. The subroutine is also added to the existing code since the flux appearing
    in Equation (7) has to be simulated first by the unsaturated flow Equation (1).
    The solution proceeds in three main steps. In the first step, Equation (1) is
    solved to simulate pressure head and the q is calculated using Darcy’s law. In
    the second step, with the known q, Equation (7) is solved to get solute concentration.
    The solute concentration, expressed in terms of electrical conductivity (EC),
    is converted into equivalent osmotic head (π) in meters using relationship suggested
    by U.S. Salinity Laboratory Staff (1954), as follows: (17) In the final step,
    with the known the pressure head and osmotic head, the actual RWU is simulated
    using Equation (16). Whole root zone domain is equally discretised into 151 grid
    points of Δz equals to 0.5 cm. The model simulates the pressure head and salt
    concentration at every time step Δt of 15 min. 2.6. Inverse problem The study
    addressed the identification of the RWU model parameters n, Mc, and π50. These
    parameters are optimized by minimizing an objective function (Equation (18). The
    objective function is defined as sum of squares of normalized differences between
    the observed and model simulated root zone salt-water dynamics responses. The
    responses include selected soil moisture, salt concentration (measured as electrical
    conductivity, EC) at different depths, and bottom flux, which reflect high sensitivity.
    The parameters are optimized using Genetic Algorithm tool. This approach ensures
    a derivative-free global optimal solution, as discussed by (Cimorelli et al.,
    (2018). The procedure for the estimation of n, Mc, and π50 from linked simulation
    optimization model is shown in Fig. 4. The objective function including data set
    of these responses is given as (18) where, θ*(z,t) and θ’(z,t) are vectors of
    observed and model simulated soil moisture, I is number of soil moisture data
    [ ], EC*(z,t) and (z,t) are vectors of measured and model simulated electrical
    conductivity, J is number of selective EC data [ ], DP*(z,t) and D (z,t) are vectors
    of measured and model bottom flux, M is number of crop growth days [T]. The terms
    wθ, wEC, and wD in Equation (18) are weights associated with soil moisture, electrical
    conductivity, and percolation measurements, respectively. Download : Download

    and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) are used. These statistical parameters are
    given as (19) (20) (21) (22) where, n is number of data points of response, Rʹ
    and R* are observed and simulated responses, respectively and Rʹm and Rʹm are
    mean of observed and simulated response, respectively. 2.7. Parameter sensitivity
    analysis In order to determine the crucial temporal and spatial regions of model’s
    response, a sensitivity analysis of model response to the RWU model parameters
    was carried out. A local sensitivity analysis is used to evaluate the change in
    salt-water dynamics for the individual parameter. The sensitivity is determined
    by changing the parameter’s value with the perturbation factor pf of 5 % to ensure
    numerical stable simulations (Pue et al., 2019). Since the analysis involves comparison
    between different parameters towards different responses, a Central Total Relative
    Sensitivity (CTRS) index is used (Saltelli et. al., 2008), given in Equation (23).
    The index is preferred when the parameters and the response have different orders
    of magnitude. The CTRS index is defined as normalized form of dynamic sensitivity
    function. The index value close to 0 denotes weak effect of a parameter and a
    positive effect is expressed by a positive value while negative by negative value
    (Rezaei et al., 2016). (23) where y(t) and x are model response, and parameter,
    respectively, and is perturbation factor 3. Result and discussion 3.1. Parameter
    sensitivity analysis in the RWU model To analyze the sensitivity of RWU model
    parameters to model response, a numerical experiment of berseem grown in experimental
    field under saline irrigation quantity has been performed. Within the typical
    growth period of 50 days of development stage, three irrigations flux of 120 mm/day,
    60 mm/day, and 40 mm/day are applied on 1st, 15th, and 30th day, respectively.
    These fluxes correspond to required irrigation depth to achieve saturation, field
    capacity, and 33 % deficit irrigation treatment in the soil-column experiment.
    During this period the PET, LAI, and root depth were assumed as 5 mm day−1, 5
    m2m−2, and 0.5 m, respectively. Fig. 5 presents the CTRS of (a) soil moisture,
    (b) pressure head, and (c) salinity responses to Mc. With reference to soil moisture
    response, the sensitivity of Mc is highest during the dry period and have the
    higher CTRS values in the upper region of soil domain (Fig. 5 a). This is because
    the stress parameter of crop model activates during water stress period. In addition,
    the maximum influence of reduced RWU will occur in the top part of the root zone
    that have maximum RLD and lesser water availability. Similar obvious trend can
    be noticed for pressure head response. However, the sensitivity of Mc to pressure
    head is greater than sensitivity to soil moisture. Thus, suction head information
    is more efficient than soil moisture in estimating Mc. Fig. 5c shows that the
    effect of Mc on saline concentration is negligible throughout the root zone in
    first irrigation interval (sufficient irrigation). But salinity concentration
    is affected by Mc during deficit irrigation applications. During these periods,
    the negative correlation between Mc and saline concentration exists in the root
    zone. While below the root zone, positive correlation exists between them. The
    negative correlation indicates that on decreasing Mc, the RWU capability of plant
    increases, which result in accumulation of salt in the root zone thereby increasing
    saline concentration. As a consequence, less water is available to flow as gravity
    drainage, which lowers the salt flux below the root zone resulting in lower saline
    concentration. Fig. 6 shows that all the RWU model parameters are exhibit the
    higher sensitivity to daily bottom flux data. This signifies that observed bottom
    flux needs to be incorporated for the improved estimation of these parameters
    along with soil moisture and pressure head data. Download : Download high-res

    analysis of bottom flux (percolation) to Mc, π50, and n. The results of dynamic
    sensitivity of soil moisture and pressure head responses to π50 shows that these
    responses are affected in the root zone during first irrigation interval (Fig.
    7a and 7b). In contrast, during deficit irrigation periods, the sensitivities
    of soil moisture and pressure head are very low to the variation of π50. This
    is due to the fact of less salt presence as a result of lower saline irrigation
    application. The low saline concentration does not affect the RWU rate, resulting
    in negligible variation in soil moisture depletion. Fig. 7c shows that π50 effect
    on salinity follows similar trend as Mc. The negative correlation in the root
    zone can be explained as increased RWU because of reduced π50. The increased uptake
    leads to more accumulation of salts. Hence, on decreasing π50 the saline concentration
    increases in the root zone. Download : Download high-res image (120KB) Download

    response to RWU distribution parameter n has been performed for the same scenarios.
    The plots of timely CTRS of these responses are shown in Fig. 8. The sensitivity
    of soil moisture and pressure head is highest in the upper region of the root
    zone. Since the RLD is concentrated in this region, the effect of n is predominantly
    reflected. However, the sensitivity of soil moisture is low as compared to pressure
    head. Thus, pressure head data can be preferred over soil moisture to inversely
    estimate n. In case of non-availability of pressure head observation, the bottom
    flux data with soil moisture can be incorporated in the objective function while
    optimizing n. Interestingly, the effect of n variation on saline concentration
    is found to be more than soil moisture and pressure head (Fig. 8c). This effect
    is noticed more during deficit irrigation application. Download : Download high-res

    Parameters evaluation and estimation For the inverse estimation of the RWU model
    parameters n, Mc, and π50, the objective function (Equation (18) is formulated
    based on sensitivity analysis. The objective function includes the selected response
    of soil moisture, electrical conductivity, and bottom flux which shows high sensitivity
    to these parameters. The soil moisture data set included in the objective function
    consist of upper root-zone soil moisture information on dry days. The salinity
    concentration dataset includes the electrical conductivity values during last
    two subsequent irrigation intervals. Additionally, the daily depth of percolated
    water is used in a bottom flux dataset. Since the electrical conductivity shows
    relatively high sensitivity to π50, the weight associated with electrical conductivity
    measurement is set higher than the other weights. The objective function is tested
    for uniqueness by increasing the value of wEC. At wEC around 4, the objective
    function yields a global minimum within the parametric space. Thus, for the analysis,
    values of wθ, wEC, and wD in Equation (18) are set to 1, 4, and 1, respectively.
    Prior to the model calibration with field observed data, the parameters identifiability
    study is conducted to check for uniqueness in the solution. The uniqueness of
    the optimization is checked for the cases (a) estimation of Mc, and π50, and (b)
    estimation of Mc, π50, and n, using Equation (18). For the analysis, the arbitrary
    values of n, Mc, and π50 are taken as 2, 7.2 cm2d-1, and −20 m, respectively in
    the forward simulation. The model is run for 50 days incorporating these RWU parameters
    value (say true value) and the remaining parameters, initial, and boundary conditions
    are same as taken in the numerical experiment for sensitivity analysis. From the
    synthetically generated salt-water dynamics responses, the selective sets of θ*,
    EC*, and D* are formulated which is used in Equation (18) to estimate n, Mc, and
    π50. Fig. 9 shows the contour plot of objective function for the case (a). The
    objective function is plotted in the parametric spaces of Mc ranging from 0.005
    to 20 cm2day−1, and π50 ranging from 0 to −50 m. Within the parametric space,
    the objective function is convex with its global minimum at the true values i.e.
    Mc = 7.2 cm2d-1, and π50 = -20 m. This shows that using Equation (18), incorporating
    selected responses that have high sensitivity to Mc, and π50, the parameters associated
    with water and salt stress can be estimated uniquely. Similarly, using Equation
    (18) the parameters Mc, π50, and n are estimated in case (b). The objective function
    is plotted in the parametric space of Mc, π50, and n (Fig. 10). The range of parametric
    space for n is 1 to 5, while the ranges of Mc, and π50 are same as in case (a).
    Fig. 10 shows that the objective function is convex with its global minimum at
    the true values of Mc = 7.2 cm2d-1, π50 = -20 m, and n = 2. This signifies that
    the formulated objective function is capable of simultaneously estimating the
    RWU distribution, water, and salt stress parameters. Download : Download high-res

    conventional objective functions that includes all the responses may not ensure
    a unique solution (Hupet et al., 2005, Ngo et al., 2013, Schelle et al., 2012,
    Sonkar et al., 2019). This is because the conventional objective functions include
    responses of stress as well as non-stressed periods. Since the stress period of
    typical crop growth scenarios is small, the corresponding response is less as
    compared to non-stressed dataset. The limited stress period response is overshadowed
    by non-stresses response in these objective functions. Thus, it is not capable
    of capturing the dynamic change under water and salt stresses condition and may
    lead to non-unique solutions. 3.3. Model calibration The calibration of the RWU
    model parameters, namely RWU distribution n, critical matric flux potential Mc,
    and osmotic head at which RWU reduced to 50 % π50 are calibrated using field crop
    (berseem) growth experiment data. The RWU model is integrated with GA- based optimizer
    tool to optimize these parameters using observed and measured responses that are
    required in the objective function (Equation (18). The soil moisture recorded
    at 10, 25, 45, and 65 cm depths were used as observed data sets. The observed
    data include soil moisture measurements taken at depths of 10, 25, 45, and 65
    cm. The observed soil moisture dataset, denoted as θ*(z,t), contains data from
    dry periods, typically recorded 7 days after irrigation. Daily electrical conductivity
    data, also collected at the same depths, are incorporated into the EC*(z,t) dataset.
    Additionally, daily measurements of percolation contribute to the D*(t) dataset.
    Corresponding to these data sets, the simulated data set of soil moisture, EC,
    and bottom flux were selected to represent θ’(z,t), EC’(z,t), and D’(t) in Equation
    (18). For the model simulation, essential soil hydraulic parameters include the
    fitted values of θs, θr, αv, and nv, alongside measured Ks values for the soil
    column (see Table 1). Daily measurements of LAI and root depth serve as input
    parameters for the crop model. To establish initial conditions, the pressure head
    corresponding to the observed soil moisture on the starting day is introduced
    into the model. The top surface boundary condition is set to reflect the daily
    atmospheric conditions observed during the experiment, while the lower boundary
    is treated as a gravity drainage condition. The optimization process employs GA
    parameters given in Table 2. To verify uniqueness, parameters are estimated using
    three different seed values (refer to Table 3). The optimized parameter sets for
    these seeds are nearly identical, confirming the uniqueness of parameters within
    the given objective function (Equation (18). The value of n exceeds 1, indicating
    non-linear RWU behavior in berseem. The optimized Mc value is approximately 0.66
    cm2d-1, consistent with the findings of dos Santos et al. (2017) for potential
    transpiration rates of 1 to 5 mm/day in loamy soil. Interestingly, under salinity
    conditions, berseem demonstrates considerable tolerance, with π50 ranging around
    −71.5 m when grown in loamy sand soil. Table 2. Selected genetic algorithm parameter

    3.4. Comparison of simulated and observed model response The calibrated parameters
    are used to simulate model responses, including daily variations in soil moisture
    and electrical conductivity at different depths, as well as percolation. The simulated
    responses are then compared with the experimentally observed data. Fig. 11, Fig.
    12, Fig. 13 show the comparisons between observed and simulated soil moisture,
    electrical conductivity, and percolation. Notably, the simulated soil moisture
    at depths of 10 cm, 45 cm, and 65 cm closely aligns with the observed data. However,
    at a depth of 25 cm, the simulated data do not exhibit a strong agreement with
    the observed data. This discrepancy can be attributed to slight variations in
    soil hydraulic properties resulting in different dynamics in soil–water-salt interactions.
    The observed soil moisture dynamics represents the formation of relatively low
    conductance layer where moisture is retained for a longer time. One of the main
    reasons for enhance in soil moisture retention is root growth. The root development
    causes binding and local compression of soil particles which reduces Ks (Lu et
    al., 2020, Nishiwaki et al., 2023, Shi et al., 2021). This reduction is observed
    more in fully intact young plant roots grown in sandy loam (Barley, 1954), which
    is similar to the present case of newly grown berseem in a lysimeter. Additionally,
    these variations may have arisen from over compaction during the soil-filling
    process. The rate of moisture depletion in the top layer is higher compared to
    bottom layers, and this rate decreases with depth. This is because the top layer
    is exposed to evaporation flux and experiences maximum RWU. Download : Download

    During periods of irrigation, the model tends to overestimate soil moisture. This
    is primarily due to the model’s simplification of the top boundary, assuming an
    average irrigation flux that differs from the actual flux. Additionally, this
    deviation may be slightly influenced by the model''s assumption of not accounting
    for drying and wetting hysteresis in the soil–water retention curve, making it
    less capable of representing the retention curve during wetting. Moreover, a few
    macropores were observed between the soil and the acrylic glass during the experiment,
    which were formed due to soil shrinkage. These macropores allow applied irrigation
    to move directly to the lower part of the column without being absorbed into the
    soil. However, throughout the rest of the observation period, the simulated values
    exhibit a strong correlation with the observed data. In the case of EC, except
    for the initial days of the growth period, the simulated EC values closely align
    with the observed EC levels. During the initial stage, EC levels are underestimated
    at depths of 25 cm and 45 cm. This underestimation is attributed to salt being
    directly introduced into the soil through irrigation flux in the lower layers,
    a result of the development of side macropores. As root growth is not yet well
    established during this early stage, the underestimation has a relatively minimal
    impact on RWU. Using these datasets, the model''s performance is assessed by comparing
    observed and simulated responses with various statistical measures of model performance.
    These performance indices for different model responses are presented in Table
    4. In the context of soil moisture dynamics, the RMSE values are 0.02, 0.06, 0.02,
    and 0.02 (m3m−3) at depths of 10, 25, 45, and 65 cm, respectively. These values
    indicate a good fit for the dataset, except at 25 cm. As discussed above, the
    variation at 25 cm is subjected to change in soil hydraulic properties, which
    is mainly due to root growth. The RMSE values fall well within the range of 0.01–0.02
    (m3m−3). The NS and r2 values at a depth of 10 cm are both 0.92 suggesting nearly
    a perfect alignment with observed soil moisture. While these values decline at
    greater depths (45 and 65 cm), they still remain within the acceptable range.
    The r2 values at 25 and 45 cm are lower due to lower variance between simulated
    and observed data in comparison to the variance within the simulated values. At
    25 cm, the NS is close to 0, indicating that model predictions are near the mean
    of the observed data. Table 4. Performance indices describing the correspondence
    between measured and simulated model response. Response Depth (cm) RMSE (m3m−3)

    0.505 0.911 0.950 In the case of EC, the model predictions are acceptable as RMSE
    ranging from 0.6 to 1.3 dSm−1 and r2 values falling within the range of 0.5–0.9
    for all depths. Within the top root zone during initial period, the variability
    of simulated EC due to saline irrigation application is higher as compared to
    observed EC. Consequently, the r2 values are relatively lower than the values
    for bottom root zone. Fig. 12c, shows that the observed EC values at lower depths,
    tend to reach the steady-state level of EC, which is well predicted by the model.
    Regarding percolation under gravity drainage, the model exhibits a good agreement
    with the observed data (as shown in Fig. 13). Overall, the model effectively captures
    daily percolation, with performance statistics such as r2 = 0.94, RMSE = 1.393
    mm, NRMSE = 0.504, and NS = 0.902. However, notable differences in percolation
    prediction are observed during peak periods, where the model tends to overestimate
    DP values by 10–15 %. These differences may be attributed to anomalies in soil–water
    dynamics at the 25 cm depth. 3.5. Root water uptake pattern Using the calibrated
    model, the RWU pattern is simulated for four irrigation scenarios, each with distinct
    levels of salinity: 0.25 dSm−1 (S1), 2.5 dSm−1 (S2), 5 dSm−1 (S3), 7 dSm−1 (S4).
    For reference, the model was run for one of the drying-out periods (69–93 days
    after sowing) of the berseem growth season, with the initial and boundary conditions
    same as those of observed. Fig. 14 shows how the simulated daily depth-wise RWU
    and Tr are related to soil hydraulic condition under different salinity level.
    In the case of S1 treatment, characterized as low salinity or non-salinity level,
    the influence of osmotic stress is negligible, as evidenced by Tr that remains
    consistently at 1 up to the point of water limitation. During the drier period
    (87–93 days after sowing), a noticeable reduction in RWU is observed in the upper
    layer, which is offset by increased uptake from the lower layer. In comparison
    to the S1 treatment, there is a slight reduction in RWU during the initial days
    of the S2 treatment, primarily attributed to osmotic stress. However, as the salt
    concentration diminishes, the reduced Tr gradually approaches a value closer to
    1. Throughout the drier period, the Tr values remain relatively lower than those
    observed in the case of S1. Interestingly, the compensated RWU is also negatively
    impacted by the presence of salts, leading to a reduction in total RWU. Download

    Daily depth-wise root water uptake and relative transpiration pattern under different
    levels of salinity. In the case of the S3 treatment, RWU is marginally impacted,
    with Tr value closer to 0.65 during the initial days when salt concentration is
    at its peak across the entire root depth. In the mid-period, the actual RWU is
    reduced by 18 % when compared to its potential. Furthermore, during the drier
    period, this actual RWU diminishes even further to 30 %, primarily due to the
    combined effect of water and osmotic stresses. The extent of the RWU front becomes
    shallower, thus resulting in less water extraction from deeper layers, even as
    the soil becomes drier closer to the surface. This implies that in the presence
    of high osmotic stress, the RWU compensation increased the total RWU only to a
    small extent. As the saline irrigation level increases to S4, the total RWU is
    substantially reduced to 60 % during the initial days, even though the soil is
    wet. This reduction in transpiration is due to the high presence of salt under
    non-limiting soil hydraulic conditions. The reduced Tr recovers to 70 % as the
    salt concentration decreases. The RWU front shrinks towards the surface as the
    water depleted from the upper layer. This shows the RWU compensation is negligible
    as the osmotic stress is dominates over water stress. 4. Conclusion Results for
    a hypothetical berseem growth case shows that the soil moisture during deficit
    irrigation period is most sensitive to water stress parameter Mc. In addition,
    it is least sensitive during the normal irrigation period. Unlikely, the soil
    moisture shows least sensitive to osmotic stress parameter π50 during deficit
    irrigation period and is found to be highly sensitive during the normal irrigation
    period. The variation of root water uptake (RWU) distribution parameter n has
    a large effect on soil moisture and pressure head in the upper half of root zone
    where root density is high. Similar pattern has been observed in the case of the
    pressure head response. However, the pressure head data shows a relative higher
    CTRS value than the values corresponding to soil moisture. Thereby, pressure head
    data is preferable over soil moisture for inverse estimation of these parameters.
    The CTRS results of bottom flux/percolation shows better sensitivity to all three
    parameters. Thus, in case of non-availability of pressure head data, the soil
    moisture data with percolation data can be used to inversely estimate Mc and n.
    For electrical conductivity, the deficit irrigation period dynamics of the whole
    root zone are the most valuable input for Mc, as it shows a higher CTRS value.
    To estimate π50 with the other two parameters, the electrical conductivity of
    top root zone can be incorporated into the objective function with relatively
    higher weightage. The plots of proposed objective function show that it is possible
    to estimate these three parameters simultaneously using high CTRS responses in
    the objective function. The present study also involves the estimation of RWU
    model parameters for berseem grown in a column-lysimeter. Using the proposed objective
    function, Mc, π50 and n are uniquely estimated. With the calibrated parameters,
    the model-simulated responses are further compared and evaluated with the observed
    data. The comparison results show good agreement between the simulated and observed
    data sets. The RWU rate and relative transpiration under four irrigation scenarios
    subjected to different salinity levels are evaluated. The simulation results reveal
    that under high salinity treatment RWU compensation diminishes, resulting in substantial
    reduction in RWU even for much-tolerant berseem as osmotic stress dominates over
    water stress. CRediT authorship contribution statement Amit Kumar: Data curation,

  description: There is a mismatch between crop water demand, the spatial and temporal
    distribution of natural rainfall, surface water sources, and arable land resources
    in the North China Plain. This has been compensated for by massive groundwater
    exploitation, and as a result, ground water levels have continuously declined
    and groundwater landing funnels have formed in some areas. Consequently, there
    is an urgent need for the rational allocation of soil and water resources. In
    this study, regional soil types and the corresponding crops in Guangping County,
    Hebei Province, China, alongside the regional annual average total water consumption
    were used to determine reasonable allocations for crop planting structures, with
    an aim of maximizing the water utilization efficiency and economic benefits while
    also achieving a regional groundwater dynamic equilibrium. Daily meteorological
    data from 1973 to 2021, including precipitation, temperature, sunshine hours,
    wind speed, and humidity, as well as crop data, including irrigation systems and
    crop growth status, were collected. Water consumption models for eight soil types
    and seven typical crops forming 56 calculation partitions were established to
    obtain annual average water consumption values for the different crops. The maximum
    economic benefit and water-use efficiency were then used as the objective functions
    and total water consumption as the control condition for the non-dominated sorted
    genetic algorithm-Ⅱ (NSGA-II), to optimize the allocation of soil and water resources
    in the region; the adjusted quantities for the different crops cultivated under
    different soil types in the study area were obtained. The areas growing sweet
    potato and vegetable-fruits were found to increase by 0.5255 km2 and 4.4452 km2,
    respectively, when compared to the pre-optimization period, whereas the areas
    with winter wheat-summer maize, millet, peanut, cotton, and summer maize decreased
    by 1.3481 km2, 0.1812 km2, 0.7316 km2, 2.0896 km2, and 0.62 km2, respectively.
    The economic benefit increased from 810.37 to 853.64 million yuan, while the water-use
    efficiency increased from 1.5426 kg/m3 to 1.5859 kg/m3. The results provide a
    basis for soil and water resource management in the region and a technical reference
    for similar areas to improve agricultural water-use efficiency and economic benefits.

  explanation: 'The first paper primarily addresses strategies for ensuring the robustness
    and reliability of the automated irrigation system, including resilience and fault
    tolerance, advanced monitoring techniques, closed-loop control, and addressing
    security concerns and risks in large-scale deployments. It mainly focuses on the
    technical aspects of maintaining system reliability and security rather than the
    specific point mentioned in the original prompt regarding integrating machine
    learning algorithms to optimize closed-loop control strategies.


    The second paper is more relevant to the original prompt as it explores the role
    of machine learning in optimizing closed-loop control strategies over time by
    adapting to changing environmental conditions and crop requirements. It specifically
    mentions the use of reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms to achieve this
    optimization. The paper discusses the effectiveness and efficiency of these integrated
    end-to-end automated irrigation systems.'

    allocation of soil and water resources refers to the joint and sustainable management
    of water and agricultural land, using both scientific and technical means to alleviate
    water resource shortages and the deterioration of the ecological environment (Tan
    et al., 2017). Traditional research into the optimal allocation of agricultural
    soil and water resources is divided into two categories: the improvement of agricultural
    water-use efficiency and the adjustment of agricultural planting structures. Of
    these, the former is considered from the perspective of water use, and while it
    helps to reduce the excessive use of agricultural water sources, it requires a
    large financial input to build supporting facilities, as otherwise, crops are
    not adequately irrigated (Li et al., 2020a, Li et al., 2020b, Seyed Hoshiyar et
    al., 2021, Shangguan et al., 2002, Sharifi et al., 2021, Tork et al., 2021). In
    contrast, the latter is generally from the perspective of the planting layout,
    as the planting of crops considered to be water-saving can help to achieve water
    saving aims, but most of these studies have focused on the total amount of various
    types of crops, without consideration of other factors such as the soil (Chen
    and Liu, 2022, Li et al., 2020a, Li et al., 2020b, Luo et al., 2022, Sedighkia
    et al., 2023, Yu et al., 2021). The above results only have achieved certain results
    in the single allocation of water resources or land resources. However, soil and
    water resources were interrelated and mutually restricted (Li et al., 2022a, Li
    et al., 2022b). Changing one factor will lead to changes in other factors, and
    they cannot be simply optimized according to their order. To reflect the holistic
    nature of soil and water resource allocation, many scholars proposed a joint allocation
    method and optimized the allocation schemes in their corresponding study areas
    (Chen et al., 2023, Guo et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2023, Wang et al., 2022a, Wang
    et al., 2022b). Based on joint allocation, Li (2022), Zhang (2019), and Zhang
    et al., (2023) added a simulation study of future scenarios and proposed corresponding
    allocation schemes. In some regions, owing to insufficient precipitation, groundwater
    extraction is required to meet the actual regional irrigation demands. For example,
    Yue et al. (2011) optimized the allocation of Yellow River water and groundwater
    in 2020 and 2030 by coupling groundwater and surface water models, while Fu et
    al. (2014) used interval two stage stochastic planning to establish a joint surface
    water and groundwater dispatch model that realistically reflects the actual optimal
    allocation of water resources. The above research can provide decision-making
    guidance for soil and water resource management to a certain extent, but it does
    not consider the coupling degree and water consumption characteristics between
    the soils and crops. In terms of research scope, most studies have focused on
    medium and macro areas, such as watersheds (Banadkooki et al., 2022, Han et al.,
    2018a, Han et al., 2018b, Sun et al., 2019, Tingsanchali and Singh, 1996) and
    irrigation districts (Das et al., 2015, Martínez-Tunarroza et al., 2022, Sun et
    al., 2017). However, there is also research at the micro-scale (Tian and Jia,
    2007), albeit with lower precision. In addition, 3S technologies have also been
    utilized in water and land resource allocation research, and this has significantly
    enhanced the visualization and information processing abilities available for
    optimal water resource allocation. For example, Khanday and Javed (2016) used
    remote sensing to successfully prioritize river sub-basins in central India, and
    Lense et al. (2023) used a model combining GIS and RS to identify the most serious
    erosion phenomena in Brazilian crop areas. Although these studies have achieved
    results, the accuracy of the remote sensing images was 1000 m and 250 m, which
    was too rough for the study of water and soil resource allocation at the county
    scale, and thus higher precision remote sensing images are required to facilitate
    the needs of this research. For model creation, multi-objective programming has
    been widely used in the study of water and soil resource allocation. Li et al.
    (2022) constructed a multi-objective planting structure optimization model with
    the objectives of economic, ecological, and water-saving benefits, while Wu et
    al. (2022), under the framework of society, economy, and ecology, established
    multi-objective nonlinear planning to study the planting structure and irrigation
    water allocation scheme. Chang et al. (2023) constructed a multi-objective water
    resource optimal allocation model with social and economic benefits, while Habibi
    Davijani et al. (2016) applied a particle swarm algorithm to allocate water resources
    in Iranian regions, and Liu et al. (2017) optimized the allocation of soil and
    water resources in Jilin Province directly using multi-objective planning. As
    research progresses, scholars have found some data to be uncertain, such as incoming
    water and precipitation, in the optimal allocation of multi-objective soil and
    water resources, and these uncertainties greatly affect the actual crop water
    consumption (ETa) To attenuate for the error caused by these uncertainties, the
    potential water consumption (ET0) has been introduced for unification. For example,
    Kong (2022) calculated the daily ET0 from 1990 to 2019 and adjusted the cropping
    structure based on the reference evapotranspiration, while Han et al. (2018) optimized
    the cropping structure in the Heihe River Basin using remotely sensed evapotranspiration
    data and then analyzed the impacts of the results on water-use efficiency. Owing
    to the complexity of the environment, the ET0 and ETa were found to have considerable
    differences in different regions. Yang (2016) stated that in arid and semiarid
    overland areas, the potential evaporation and actual evaporation satisfy a symmetrical
    and complementary relationship, and the value of the ETa/ETp ranges from 0.16
    to 0.30. While several studies have investigated the optimal allocation of soil
    and water resources based on potential evapotranspiration, the optimal allocation
    of soil and water resources based on actual farmland water consumption averaged
    over many years has rarely been reported. In terms of water constraints, the optimal
    allocation of agricultural water and soil resources was mostly studied with the
    total amount of irrigation water as the control target. Lv (2022), based on the
    minimum water consumption of crops, predicted the water demand of agricultural
    cultivation and established a model for the adjustment of the agricultural cultivation
    structure. While Li (2022) used Penman’s formula to predict crop water demand
    and analyzed the contradiction between the supply and demand of irrigation water
    resources to optimize the planting structure. Taking the total amount of irrigation
    water in Beijing as a constraint, Zeng (2018) applied the multi-objective planning
    method to propose a direction for optimizing the structure of Beijing’s plantation
    industry. Furthermore, Yang et al. (2019), Zhang et al. (2023) also optimized
    planting structures by targeting the total amount of irrigation. With the expansion
    of the irrigation area and improvement of the irrigation water use efficiency,
    the groundwater overexploitation situation has not yet been significantly improved.
    It was recognized that water saving in the traditional sense cannot reflect the
    actual amount of water resources saved. To explore the actual saving situation,
    Pei et al. (2007) suggested the phrase “water consumption and water saving” and
    compared it with “water intake and water saving.” The water consumption and water
    saving potential of Ningxia was found to be far less than that of the water intake
    and water saving potential. Qin et al. (2008) then systematically studied the
    basic theory and quantitative calculation method for the regional target ET, and
    proposed that the total water consumption refers to the maximum allowable consumption
    of regional water resources for sustainable utilization, and constructed a set
    of regional target ET calculation methods. Liu (2014) put forward a technical
    framework for controlling real water saving in the region by the total amount
    of regional water consumption (i.e., regional target ET), and extended the water
    saving focus on water intake to the water saving of real water consumption. The
    above studies found that only by reducing invalid water consumption can real water
    savings be realized, and the method of controlling the invalid water consumption
    was called agricultural ET management. However, few optimization models consider
    the joint allocation of soil and water resources and the agricultural target ET.
    Guangping County of Hebei Province is predominantly an agricultural planting area.
    Their over-exploitation of the available groundwater resources has enabled high
    and stable agricultural yields, but has also caused continuous declines in the
    groundwater level, and this represents the main water resource problem faced by
    the entire North China Plain area. On December 24, 2021, the Water Saving Regulations
    of Hebei Province (2021) was promulgated, and it clearly states that ''agricultural
    water saving should improve irrigation efficiency by adjusting the structure of
    soil and water resources''. This study was centered in Guangping County and uses
    3S technology to assess the adaptability of soil and crops and coordinate the
    allocation of their annual average ETa. The NSGA-II genetic algorithm was used
    as the core mothod, with water use efficiency and economic benefits as the objective
    functions, and the agricultural target ET as the boundary conditions to construct
    a multi-objective optimization model for agricultural soil and water resources,
    to provide an effective decision support for agricultural development and water-saving
    irrigation. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Study area The study area was Guangping
    County, Handan, China, which is situated in the south of Hebei Province, between
    longitude 114°84′ and 115°19′ east and latitude 36°37′ and 36°62′ north, the area
    is 31.4 km long, 27.0 km wide, and 320 km2 (Fig. 1). The average annual precipitation
    is 514.9 mm, and the average annual water surface evaporation is 1038.6 mm. The
    terrain of the county is relatively gentle, with a gradual decrease from southwest
    to northeast. The altitude ranges from 40.0 to 53.9 m, with a maximum height difference
    of 13.9 m. The area is mainly used to grow food crops (predominantly winter wheat
    and summer maize), cash crops (predominantly cotton and vegetables), oil crops
    (predominantly peanuts and rapeseed), and small miscellaneous grains (predominantly
    millet, soybeans, and mung beans). The summer harvest consists mainly of winter
    wheat, and the remaining grains are harvested in the autumn. Download : Download

    Soil Database (HWSD) soil data, meteorological data (precipitation, temperature,
    sunshine hours, wind speed, and humidity), land use data, sentinel-2 remote sensing
    image data, and field experiment data (Wang et al., 2022a, Wang et al., 2022b),
    water resources data and water using data, etc. Field experiment data were collected
    at 12 monitoring points, including soil moisture content, leaf area index (LAI),
    crop height (CH) and root depth (RD). CH and RD were measured with a tape measure;
    LAI was measured by ACCUPAR-LP80 canopy leaf area analyzer. Soil water content
    was measured by soil moisture monitor. It was measured every 5–7 days from the
    beginning of crop emergence, and was measured again after 10 h of precipitation
    and 24 h of irrigation, until the crop was harvested. The measurement depth is
    0–10 cm, 10–30 cm, 30–60 cm, 60–200 cm, half for calibration, and the other half
    for verification. In this paper, the spatial resolution of all raster data was
    resampled to 10 m × 10 m for subsequent research. Details of the data are shown
    in Table 1, the soil mechanical composition is shown in Table 2, and the crop

    point collection Field sample point collection was carried out from August 1,
    2021 to August 15, 2021. The survey was conducted using sub-meter-level ICE980
    RTK handheld GPS. The instrument measurement coordinates were defined as the WGS-84
    coordinate system, and the measured values were geographical coordinates. When
    collecting sample points, it was necessary to ask local farmers about the planting
    of winter wheat in the first half of 2021. The distribution of field sample points
    is shown in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image (393KB) Download : Download

    2.4. Methods 2.4.1. Extraction of the crop planting structure In this study, seven
    typical crops were selected for planting structure identification: winter wheat-summer
    maize, summer maize, cotton, sweet potatoes, millet, peanuts, and vegetable-fruits.
    As a result of the short growth cycle of vegetable-fruits, the variety of planted
    species, and the serious fragmentation of the planted area, the extraction of
    sample points was inconvenient. This study thus provides a unified generalization
    of the vegetable-fruits, and the remaining six crops were extracted using the
    random forest algorithm. When using this algorithm to extract data, the 32 remote
    sensing images were pre-processed, and their Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) was calculated (Sun et al., 2021). The formula used was as follows:
    (1) where represents the reflectance in the near-infrared band, and represents
    the reflectance in the red band. The NDVI of general crops ranges from 0 to 1,
    and the magnitude of this value is related to the degree of lush crop growth,
    i.e., the closer the value is to 1, the more luxuriant the crop growth. According
    to the phenological characteristics for the crops in Guangping, six NDVI images
    from February 1, April 17, June 6, July 31, September 29, and December 18 were
    selected as representatives to analyze phenological characteristic consistency.
    In the experimental area of Guangping County, 20 artificial sample points were
    then selected for each crop. The NDVI values of the artificial sample points for
    each crop were fitted with Lorenz curves, which were divided into six types as
    follows: winter wheat-summer maize, summer maize, cotton, sweet potatoes, millets,
    and peanuts. As the random forests require a higher number of sample points, the
    artificial samples were expanded according to the fitted curve and 70 % were used
    for classification and 30 % for verification. The sample points were input into
    the random forest for classification, and the accuracy was then assessed using
    the confusion matrix. We set 90 % accuracy as a required criterion. If the simulation
    results failed to satisfy the accuracy requirement, they were expanded by adding
    500 sample points each time until the accuracy reached the required level. The
    formulas used were as follows: (2) (3) (4) where K is the number of trees in the
    random forest, x is the category is the weight of the crop type, is the overall
    classification accuracy is the total number of correctly classified image elements
    in n classes of features, is the number of true sample image elements in n classes
    of features is the number of image elements in the sample classified as n classes
    of features, n is the total number of categories in the classification results,
    and N is the number of image elements in the sample. The Kappa coefficient ranged
    from 0 to 1, with <0.6 indicating a poor classification effect, 0.6–0.8 indicating
    a good level of accuracy, and >0.8, indicating a high degree of consistency between
    the classification results and the real features. 2.4.2. Regional water consumption
    For regional water consumption calculations, the region was first divided into
    several sub-regions (referred to as calculation zones) according to factors, including
    those for the soil and crops. The attributes of each point in the sub-region were
    the same, and water consumption for each sub-region can be expressed by the point
    water consumption multiplied by its area. The point water consumption was obtained
    using the crop water consumption model and the survey method. Finally, the water
    consumption of the whole region was obtained by classifying and summarizing the
    water consumption of the sub-region. Guangping County has a small area with little
    change in meteorological scale, and consequently, the sowing, irrigation and harvest
    times for crops have been unified and generalized. Overall, only 8 soil types
    and 7 crop types were used for calculation zones, which were divided into 7 ×
    8 = 56 calculation zones. Each calculation zone contains only one soil type element
    and one crop type element. As the vegetable-fruits did not meet the input conditions
    for the SWAP model, the soil water consumption of 48 calculation areas without
    vegetable-fruits was obtained using the SWAP model, while the remaining 8 calculation
    areas with vegetable-fruits were obtained by investigation. The investigation
    method used involved multiplying the data of the multiple cropping index of the
    vegetable-fruits surveyed in the local area with the water consumption of the
    vegetable-fruits estimated by the Water Demand and Water Consumption Management
    of Major Crops in Northern China (Kang et al., 2018). When using the SWAP model
    to simulate the water consumption of 48 calculation zones, the crop parameters
    of 6 crops on the same soil were calibrated using field experiment data from Guangping
    Experimental Station, and then the calibrated crop parameters were used to simulate
    water consumption for 8 different soils. The SWAP model calculates the water consumption
    rate of a crop using the Penman-Monteith equation, which uses accurate weather
    data to estimate the potential water consumption rate. The equation used was as
    follows: (5) where is the potential water consumption rate, (mm/d); is the slope
    of the water vapor pressure curve, (kPa/℃); is the latent heat of vaporization,
    (J/kg); is the net radiation flux at the canopy surface, (J/[m2·d]); G is the
    soil heat flux, (J/[ m2·d]); is the unit conversion factor with a value of 86
    400, (s/d); is the air density, (kg/m−3); is the heat capacity of moist air, (J/[kg·℃]);
    is the saturation vapor pressure, (kPa); is the actual vapor pressure, (kPa);
    is the psychormetric consrant, (kPa/℃); is the crop resistance, (s/m); and is
    the aerodynamic resistance, (s/m). Four parts are required to input the SWAP model,
    including borders, meteorology, soil, and crops. The upper boundary is the crop
    canopy, and the lower boundary is the bottom zero flux. The meteorological part
    is the actual measured meteorological data for Guangping station, including daily
    data, such as average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, relative
    humidity, wind speed, sunshine hours, and rainfall. For the soil part, the existing
    soil layer needs to be manually stratified according to the SWAP User Manual (Kroes
    et al., 2017). In this study, the 2-m soil layer is divided into 4 layers and
    40 cells. The first, second, and fourth layers each contain 10 cells, and the
    thickness of each cell is 1, 2, and 14 cm. The third layer contains 5 cells, and
    the thickness of each cell is 6 cm. For the crops, a simple module for static
    crop growth was selected that requires the leaf area index, plant height, and
    root depth for typical crops. The initial crop canopy resistance for each crop
    was selected as 65 s/m, as suggested by VanDam, and each critical pressure head
    for calculating the water-stress discount factor was selected, as suggested by
    Wesseling et al. The maximum root depth was set at 200 cm, as suggested by Doorenbos,
    and the root length density distribution was assumed to be a straight line descending
    along the soil plumb. When the SWAP model was verified, because the crop water
    consumption was difficult to measure directly, it was indirectly characterized
    by the change in soil water content. When the simulation accuracy of the soil
    water content meets the requirements, it can be said that the model was applicable
    to the study area. The crop parameters of six crops were calibrated using 1028
    observed data, from soil moisture monitors in the experimental plots of the study
    area from 2020 to 2021, and the R2, mean relative error (MRE) and root mean square
    error (RMSE) indexes were used for judgment. R2 is the index for judging the fitting
    degree between the measured value and the simulated value. The MRE compares the
    deviation of the simulated values from the measured values, while the RMSE reflects
    the error between the simulated and observed values and is generally controlled
    within 0.2. The formulas used were as follows: (6) (7) (8) where is the simulated
    value of the ith observation; is the ith observation; is the average of observation
    values; and n is the number of observations. 2.4.3. Farmland target ET The farmland
    target ET is the regional target ET minus the residential, industrial, environmental,
    and other targets, as follows: (9) where is the agricultural target ET, is the
    regional target ET, is the residential target ET, is the industrial target ET,
    is the environmental target ET, and denotes water target ET for other water users.
    In the regional water balance, the sum of the precipitation and regional inflows
    minus the regional outflows equals the target ET. As there are no natural streams
    in Guangping County, the regional target ET is equal to the sum of the multi-year
    average precipitation and water transfers from outside the basins: (10) where
    is the average precipitation over the years (m3) and is the external water supply
    (m3). Each target ET was obtained by multiplying the amount of water used by each
    sector by the evapotranspiration coefficient. (11) where denotes the water consumption
    of the residential water use; denotes the water consumption of industrial production;
    denotes the water consumption of environmental water use; denotes the water consumption
    of water use by other water users; and denotes the coefficient of evapotranspiration,
    0.6–0.8, in this study. As we seek the minimum target ET of the farmland, we take
    η = 0.8, and denotes the area. 2.4.4. Multi-optimal allocation model for soil
    and water resources To investigate the optimal allocation of agricultural soil
    and water resources under the control of the regional multi-year average total
    water consumption, this study has established a multi-objective optimal allocation
    model for water and soil resources with NSGA-II as the core algorithm, which sets
    two objective functions and four constraints. 2.4.4.1. Objective functions In
    this study, the objective function is constructed from the two key aspects, economic
    benefits and water-use efficiency. ① The economic benefits were expressed by the
    maximum net income of regional crops, as follows: (12) where, is the price of
    the jth crop (yuan/kg), is the costs of the jth crop (yuan/kg) is the yield of
    the jth crop (kg/km2), is the area of the jth crop, and n is the number of crop
    types. ② Water-use efficiency was expressed by the maximum capacity of unit water
    consumption under the multi-year average, as follows: (13) where, is the area
    planted of the jth crop type of the ith soil type, is the multi-year average water
    consumption of the jth crop type of the ith soil type, and m is the number of
    soil type. 2.4.4.2. Constraint The four constraint sets were the adjusted area,
    water quantity, sown area, and non-negative variables considering the soil type
    and crop requirements, cultivated area, and total water resources in the study
    area. ① For the adjustment area constraint, the minimum and maximum values were
    obtained by multiplying the current area by the reduction and increase factors,
    respectively, as follows: (14) where is the area planted for the jth crop type
    of the ith soil type, is the current area planted for the jth crop type of the
    ith soil type (km2), is the decrease factor for the jth crop type of the ith soil
    type, and is the increase factor for the jth crop type of the ith soil type. ②
    For the water quantity constraint, the total water consumption of the farmland
    after setting the adjustment is ≤ to the target ET of the farmland: (15) where
    is the target ET of the farmland (m3). ③ For the sown area constraint, the total
    area of the farmland for each soil type after optimization of the cropping structure
    was equal to the current area, as follows: (16) where is the current total area
    of ith soil type (km2). ④ For the non-negative variables constraint, the decision
    variable is 0 (17) 2.4.4.3. Process for solving the NSGA-II algorithm The NSGA-II
    algorithm was used to solve the multi-objective optimization model (Deb et al.,
    2000). The model was programmed in MATLAB with the following parameters: population
    size of 100 and the number of iterations was 600. The flow of the algorithm is
    as follows (Fig. 5): Download : Download high-res image (300KB) Download : Download

    Results 3.1. Crop planting structure 3.1.1. Spatial distribution of the data representing
    the NDVI The NDVI spatial distribution map (Fig. 6) shows that the highest NDVI
    values for most areas occur in mid-April and at the end of July, as the main crops
    in Guangping County are winter wheat and summer maize. The NDVI values on February
    1 ranged from 0.2 to 0.4, and this was because the period coincided with the green-returning
    period when winter wheat grows more vigorously. The NDVI values on April 17 and
    July 31 ranged from 0.7 to 0.9, as the end of April was in the heading stage when
    winter wheat grew extremely vigorously, and the end of July was in the filling
    stage when the summer maize grew most vigorously. Most of the NDVI values on June
    6 and September 29 were relatively low and ranged from 0.2 to 0.3. This was because
    early June was when winter wheat was being harvested, and summer maize or other
    crops were being sown, and late September was the end of autumn when most of the
    crops were being harvested, with only cotton and other late-autumn crops remaining.
    The NDVI value was higher than 0.4 in most areas on December 18, which was because
    the areas planted with winter wheat had just emerged. The spatial distribution
    and change rules were consistent with the actual planting situation, indicating

    are shown in Fig. 7, and the results were similar to the actual phenological characteristics,
    indicating that the curves accurately describe the crop NDVI time series and can
    be used to exploit these differences for planting structure extraction. According
    to the Lorenz curve results, a total of 39,864 sample points satisfying 6 fitting
    curves were randomly selected from the pre-processed time-series NDVI images using
    a visual interpretation method, of which 70 % were used as training data and 30
    % as verification data (Fig. 8). Download : Download high-res image (359KB) Download

    structures The distribution of six typical crops in Guangping County extracted
    from the remote sensing data is shown in Fig. 9, and an evaluation of the accuracy
    of the classification results is presented in Table 3. The overall accuracy of
    the classification results was 97.72 %, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.9662.
    Both the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were >0.9, which indicates that
    the overall quality of the classification was accurate. The mapping accuracies
    for the winter wheat-summer maize, summer maize, sweet potato, and millet were
    all >95 % and that of the winter wheat-summer maize was as high as 98.77 %, indicating
    that the misclassification of these crops was extremely low, and the classification
    results were basically correct. For cotton and peanut, which have slightly lower
    mapping accuracies because of their smaller planting areas and lower total number
    of validation samples, the misclassification of one point will interfere greatly
    with the mapping accuracy. However, the overall user accuracy was >85 %, indicating
    that the chance of mutual misclassification between categories was extremely low,
    and the classification results were accurate. Download : Download high-res image

    with winter wheat-summer maize rotations, and summer maize monocultures were the
    largest, accounting for approximately 70 % of the total study area, with a higher
    proportion of cultivation in the Nanyangbao, Shilipu, and Nanhan towns. Cotton
    had a larger range in the south-central part of Guangping County and was mainly
    distributed in southern Pinggudian, western Shilipu, and southern Shengying. The
    remaining crops were sporadically distributed. 3.2. Regional water consumption

    zones Due to the variety of vegetable-fruits and the complexity of the crop rotations,
    this study uniformly generalized the water consumption of vegetable-fruits. According
    to an actual investigation, the replanting index of vegetable-fruits in Guangping
    County is 3, the average water consumption is 500 mm, and it is impossible to
    subdivide the water consumption of the different soils. The total water consumption
    of the vegetable-fruits in all soils was thus set as 1500 mm. The annual average
    water consumption for the 56 calculation zones is presented in Table 8. Table

    water resource optimal allocation based on ET The allocation of soil and water
    resources is primarily based on visible water resources such as surface water
    and groundwater resources; the optimal allocation of soil and water resources
    via the control of invisible water consumption such as the regional agricultural
    target ET is a new strategy. For the water-saving irrigation in agriculture in
    Guangping, more attention was paid to the matching of irrigation and drainage
    channels and canal buildings, as well as the construction of engineering facilities
    such as channel seepage control and adoption of advanced irrigation technology,
    which was in turn used to improve the utilization rate of irrigation water and
    enhance the productivity capacity to increase drought-resistant yields. However,
    these water-saving irrigation efforts have several limitations. First, attention
    was paid to improving the utilization rate of water in the irrigation area, and
    the carrying capacity of water resources was disregarded, leading to the over-exploitation
    of water resources, disruption of the ecological balance, and unsustainable development
    of regional water resources. Second, water saving utilizing engineering methods
    was emphasized, whereas insufficient attention was paid to the water-saving role
    of agricultural measures, leading to an oversight of the substantive issues of
    water-saving irrigation (Zhang, 2009). This is because water saving via engineering
    measures focuses on reducing the loss and seepage of irrigation water, whereas
    water saving using agricultural techniques focuses in reducing the amount of water
    released from the farmland (Zheng, 2007). Considering water resource development
    and utilization holistically, the effects of the two ways of saving water are
    very different (Liu, 2007). Third, via the current management of agricultural
    water-saving irrigation, a set of effective management methods to change the status
    quo of irrigation management has not been established because of the long-term
    influence of the operation mechanism. The above results show that the traditional
    concept of water conservation was more about water-using conservation than water
    resource conservation. For example, traditional irrigation water conservation
    was measured by determining the increase in the effective utilization rate of
    irrigation water, and the effectiveness of water conservation was evaluated based
    on the expansion of water-saving irrigated areas (Wang and Li, 2008). The use
    of the saved water to enhance reproduction failed to meet the new demand. Developing
    water-saving irrigation according to this philosophy will only increase, not decrease,
    water consumption (Yin et al., 2009). ET is the amount of water evaporation and
    transpiration, which is the amount of invisible and intangible water lost into
    the air. The control and management of ET is achieved via the control and management
    of controllable water consumption indicators. To make ET management feasible,
    the relationship between regional ET indicators and controllable water use indicators
    (such as irrigation quota, irrigation water use, surface water diversion, groundwater
    extraction, etc.) needs to be established, and the ET needs to be controlled and
    managed by regulating water use indicators. The optimal allocation model of agricultural
    water and soil resources proposed in this study considers the total water consumption
    of farmlands, the suitability of crops to soil, economic benefits, and water use
    efficiency. In particular, it considers the overall water consumption level of
    regional farmlands and focuses on crop growth and distribution. On this basis,
    the relationship between the regional farmland target ET and land resource utilization
    mode is established, facilitating our proposal of the optimization scheme of water
    and soil resources that is relatively consistent with the sustainable development
    of resources. 4.2. Rationality of model simulation The optimal allocation of soil
    and water resources is not merely a single adjustment or the construction of a
    complex model of joint allocation but also considers the nature of different soils
    to ensure that “water” is included in the “soil” and then adjusted for the planting
    structure. Thus, the purpose of the general configuration was achieved, and the
    complexity of the joint configuration was considerably simplified. When constructing
    the model, Liu (2014) referred to real water consumption, and consequently, the
    target ET for farmland was used as the control total, which extended water conservation
    and focused on irrigation water to real water consumption to determine real water-saving.
    When constructing the objective function, the average water consumption of crops
    over 48 years was introduced, which not only successfully completes the configuration
    in the multi-year situation but also simplifies the originally complex objective
    function and greatly improves computational efficiency. When selecting the algorithm,
    we compared NSGA-II and NSGA with hyper volume index, and the calculated results
    were 0.0164 and 0.0089, respectively. Because the larger the index, the more optimized
    the performance of the algorithm, NSGA-2 was chosen as the optimization algorithm
    in this study. In the optimization configuration, the population sizes of 50,
    100, 200 and 500 were selected for simulation verification, and the simulation
    iteration time of 600 times was 76.93 s, 165.17 s, 534.18 s, and 3075.36 s, respectively.
    The larger the population, the longer the running time. The running time of 500
    populations is approximately 39.97 times that of 50 populations. When the population
    size is 50, 100, 200, and 500, the number of iterations is 230, 180, 120 and 95
    times, respectively. The larger the population, the smaller the number of iterations
    during convergence. We further analyzed the simulation results of the model. Soil
    and water resource allocation in Guangping County have been studied extensively;
    however, studies of joint soil and water resource allocation are few, and most
    of them are related to the adjustment of the planting structure. For example,
    Kong (2022) included our study area in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei configuration.
    The results of their research reduced the area of peanut and cotton in Guangping
    County by 188.87 hm2 and 225.80 hm2, respectively, which is similar to the optimization
    results from this study, as the areas for peanut and cotton were reduced by 73.16
    hm2 and 208.96 hm2, respectively. This indicates that the adjustment results for
    these two categories are reasonable. However, distinct differences were observed
    in the specific values. This may be because of the randomness of NSGA-II genetic
    algorithm during iteration. Zhang et al. (2022) proposed that the planting area
    for wheat and maize be reduced and that of potatoes and vegetables increased to
    optimize planting structures in Hebei. Cui et al. (2023) adjusted the planting
    structure of crops in Handan from the perspective of water resources and concluded
    that the sown areas for wheat and maize could be reduced by 77,000 hm2 and 189,400
    hm2, respectively. The above article does not show specific elevations or reductions
    in Guangping County; however, the general conclusions, i.e., reducing the sown
    area of winter wheat-summer maize and summer maize while increasing the area for
    potatoes and vegetables, were consistent with those of the present study. 4.3.
    Limitations and prospects of this study When using remote sensing to extract planting
    structures, the Sentinel-2 data reported by Liu (2022) and the random forest algorithm
    reported by Li and Xiong (2021) were predominantly used in the present study to
    identify the major crops at a county scale for the planted area statistics. This
    reduced the impact of the original manual statistics on the planted area of crops
    and led to an increase in the degree of refinement. The extraction results were
    basically consistent with the planting area in the statistical yearbook (Zhang,
    2012–2021), indicating that the extraction of the planting structure was successful.
    However, as the planting area for crops is relatively broken, the remote sensing
    image with 10-m spatial resolution in this study had a greater error when identifying
    crops with a planting area of <100 m2, resulting in poor accuracy of classification
    results in these mixed and broken areas. In the future, higher resolution remote
    sensing images such as Gaofen-2 will be used to improve the accuracy of classification
    results for these complex areas to obtain more accurate planting structure distribution
    maps. Crop water consumption was primarily determined using the SWAP model and
    investigation. Zhang et al. (2011) concluded that the water consumption of summer
    maize ranged from 375.7 to 396.2 mm, whereas that of winter wheat-summer maize
    ranged from 777.1 to 854.8 mm, which was consistent with the results obtained
    in the present study and numerous previous studies (Li et al., 2007, Liu et al.,
    2002). Considering the effects of soil type on water consumption, the values for
    the maximum water consumption minus minimum water consumption were, in descending
    order, as follows: sweet potato, peanut, summer maize, winter wheat-summer maize,
    millet, and cotton. The differences between the maximum and minimum water consumption
    value for cotton was 4.3 mm, which indicates that the soil type has relatively
    little influence on cotton. The difference in water consumption for sweet potato
    was 82.5 mm, indicating that the soil type has relatively considerable influence.
    As crop growth data are difficult to obtain, the SWAP model was used in the present
    study to simulate crop growth, using a simple crop module that requires relatively
    few data. However, certain limitations were observed in the simple crop module
    and detailed crop module. In future research, detailed crop modules or coupling
    with other crop models should be considered for simulating the water consumption
    characteristics that were more in line with the actual crop growth. The multi-objective
    optimization model is used to allocate soil and water resources because the optimal
    allocation of water and soil resources is a very complex process, involving natural,
    social, and other factors. Because of limitations of data and research time, this
    study only considered the influence of crop and soil factors when determining
    the influencing factors of water use. The difference in water quality factors
    in different regions, the loss of canal systems in the irrigation process, and
    the leakage of the canal system were not considered. When the model was constructed,
    the price fluctuation of crops did not consider the choice of farmers'' crops
    and planting scale in the second year and the estimation of crop yield under different
    water consumption conditions. In response to these problems, in subsequent research,
    more data will be collected when constructing the model, and additional models
    will be applied to improve the accuracy of the optimal configuration. 5. Conclusions
    In this study, the collected basic meteorological and field trial data was combined
    with GIS, the SWAP model, and the multi-objective optimization model based on
    the regional soil types and corresponding suitable cultivation crops. The optimal
    allocation of the soil and water resources were then determined by controlling
    the regional annual average total water consumption and maximizing the economic
    benefits and water-use efficiency as the objective functions. After optimization,
    the economic benefit and water use efficiency were 853.64 billion yuan and 1.5859
    kg/m3, respectively; the economic benefit and water use efficiency increased by
    0.4327 billion yuan and 0.0433 kg kg/m3, respectively. The results show that multi-objective
    soil and water resource allocation are feasible when based on economic benefits
    and water-use efficiency. The research model and method were determined using
    the total annual average water consumption of Guangping County and the planting
    structure adjustments for different crops in different soils and will thus, enable
    the development of highly credible adjustment programs and methods in the future.

    has many advantages over the open-field production as better monitoring for climate
    conditions and proper maintenance techniques which allows to have off-season year-round
    production and higher yield. Greenhouse can produce up to 15 times more yield
    per area compared to open-field production [43]. Greenhouses are categorized according
    to the applied technology inside them. During the last 25 years, Egypt has applied
    new greenhouse structures with double span that have better ventilation and easier
    management. In the middle of 1990s, new investigators in Egypt started to use
    multi-span greenhouses as double span ones don’t suit large farming. During the
    last 15 years, farmers adopted Parron system to greenhouses by using wooden structure
    with higher height and more ventilation. They implement such technique to have
    better production for vegetables and tropical fruits inside greenhouses. Using
    wooden structures instead of steel structures will reduce the capital cost of
    the project so motivating more investors to start apply protective farming [1].
    During 1980s, low technology greenhouses started to shift to modern technology
    greenhouses to reduce the environmental hazards such as soil fertility degradation
    and groundwater pollution that occur because of the excess use of pests and chemicals
    inside the low technology greenhouses [2]. In addition, adequate and suitable
    water irrigation resources are essential for growth of crop producing food; indeed,
    there are barriers that face the reclamation of large areas of desert land such
    as the lack of suitable water resources and the high cost of providing water.
    Although surface irrigation water is insufficient on a global scale to meet our
    demands, there is an abundance of salt water in Earth’s seas and oceans, covering
    2/3 of the area of the world, as well as brackish water on land. Both of which
    may be adequately desalinated using techniques such as reverse osmosis, provided
    that sufficient energy is available. In addition, with sufficient energy, we can
    also draw water from deep aquifers and bring them to the surface to water the
    crops, as well as reduce their salinity if need be. Hence, long-term development
    requires a sustainable source of energy to be used to fill the gap in the available
    irrigation water resources. The agricultural sector dependency on energy resources
    has been increased like other sectors [7]. The reason behind that is the modernization
    of many agricultural production operations such as irrigation using new techniques
    to save time and water loss [29]. Globally, irrigation pumps consume about 62,000,000
    MWh of electricity annually [57]. Some areas don’t have access to the grid; therefore,
    they have to find an alternative way to get electricity. Most of these areas mainly
    depend on diesel, gasoline, and kerosine pumps to pump water for irrigation. Diesel
    pumps are the most used for crop irrigation [33]. However, this might not be a
    proper solution especially for remote areas, as transportation cost and cost of
    maintenance for pumps are relatively high [3]. Some experts estimate that the
    remaining fossil fuel will be fully used within 50 years as the annual increase
    rate of energy consumption is assumed to be 1.4% from 2008 to 2035 [34]. This
    raises the importance of using renewable energy sources. In particular, solar
    energy is expected to have an effective role in renewable and sustainable energy
    development especially in remote areas [26]. In Egypt, the annual global solar
    radiation ranges between 2000 and 3200 kWh m−2 from north to south which gives
    a great potential for applying PV systems [50]. According to New and Renewable
    Energy Authority (NREA), the total installed capacities in Egypt are around 15
    MW, and most of them are stand-alone systems to power different applications such
    as lighting systems (27%), cell phone networks (25%), advertising lighting systems
    (16%), communication systems (13%), cathodic protection systems (7%), water pumping
    systems (6%), rural electrification, refrigeration, and others (6%) [12]. Generally,
    the most abundant source of renewable energy in the areas of the world which suffer
    most from shortage of irrigation water, such as the Sahara Desert region, is the
    solar energy. This also raises the importance of installing PV system to generate
    electricity to drive deep submersible pumps to draw water from boreholes. The
    PV system is characterized by durability, low carbon emissions, easy maintenance,
    and relatively low cost for maintenance [40]. The output of the PV installations
    is continuously variable and depends on both the characteristics of the PV modules
    and their components and the instantaneous atmospheric conditions. On the demand
    side, the amount of daily water requirements for irrigation fluctuates widely
    with location, climate, season, soil type, water type, and crop type. Hence if
    PV system is used to meet the irrigation needs of one single crop, it may be dormant
    most of the time if this crop is seasonal, and highly oversized the rest of the
    time if the summer and winter demands vary widely as the case with most crops.
    Hence, this situation will be highly uneconomical and is also waste of energy
    resources. In this paper, an optimization model was developed to aid investigators
    in the agricultural industry to find the best combination of crops inside greenhouses
    that have the maximum EACF. 2 Literature Review 2.1 Greenhouse Farming Management
    Optimizing greenhouse farming annual return is done by proper planning for greenhouse
    farming, resource allocation, and optimizing the use of resources. Due to the
    complexity of the sector, most of the researchers use linear programming approach
    to determine the optimal crop combinations and feasibility of decision variables
    [8]. Linear programming starts with a feasible solution and uses pivot operations
    to maintain the feasibility of the solution and identify the value of the objective
    function. Pap [45] established a mathematical model of optimal agricultural production
    plan applied on a small farm located in west Vojvodina using linear programming
    model to maximize the total return by adopting crop rotation policy. The results
    indicate that applying rotation policy will aid to have higher revenues compared
    to the traditional crop practices [45]. The Food and Agricultural Organization
    estimates that food production will need to be increased by 70% to feed the population
    in 2050 [28]. This leads researchers to not only focus on crop yield but also
    on sustainable growth. Sarker and Quaddus [53] compared two versions of the crop
    planning problem which are single objective linear programming approach and multi-objective
    approach with conflicting objectives. Linear programing approach presents one
    optimal solution while multi-objective technique offers set of possible solutions
    as so provides a better vision for crop planning program, and the user has to
    choose the appropriate solution [53]. This raises the importance of optimizing
    the net benefit in addition to the environmental factors such as water and energy
    to reach the optimum solution. Optimizing the water use will aid to increase the
    annual return as well as optimize the resources used; therefore, [36] developed
    a multi-objective water allocation model to optimize the economic, social, and
    environmental benefits of an area. The results showed that the model provides
    a sustainable approach to allocate water resources in regions where there is lack
    of water resources and accordingly allocates the resources [36]. However, this
    requires accurate estimation for the required water for irrigation as well as
    the available water to be able to calculate the required energy to draw water
    from the water source. Studying the regional climate is essential for accurate
    calculations for the irrigation water requirements. Most of the previous models
    were developed using linear programing approach; however, Hosny et al. [27] introduced
    a comprehensive database and multi-objective optimization model using GA that
    aids the user to find efficient and economic methodology for the best utilization
    of land for either open-field farming or greenhouse farming. However, the greenhouse
    farming depends on data that has to be entered by the user [27]. This means higher
    consumption of energy, i.e., higher cost of production. Therefore, developing
    a comprehensive database and having a balance between crop planning, used resources,
    the yield of production and energy consumption is essential to reach the maximum
    net benefit. 2.2 Stand-alone PVWP System for Irrigation Collecting the sun energy
    is for free but it needs the appropriate equipment to have an optimized system.
    There are various methods for optimizing stand-alone PV systems [23, 31, 32, 46].
    The previous studies analyzed the performance of PV system based on two important
    factors which are regional climates (i.e., the geographical factors and meteorological
    factors) and the available area characteristics (i.e., the on-site installation
    factors and the available area) [4, 22, 31]. Some studies have been done to maximize
    the performance of PV system by only considering the azimuth angle of the installed
    panels (ψ) which concluded that the southwest orientation is the best orientation
    for year-round performance for the Northern hemisphere [51]. Other studies have
    been done to maximize the average year-round performance by optimizing the slope
    of the installed panels (β) which revealed that the optimal angle for the installed
    panels is the same as the latitude [54]. Gopinathan et al. [24] developing a model
    to maximize the performance by introducing more than one factor. The solar irradiance
    was estimated based on the ψ (− 90° to 90°) and the β (0°–90°), and the results
    showed that the β changed as the ψ got away from south (0°) [24]. However, most
    of the previous studies ignore the effect of the ambient temperature on the PV
    performance. Several studies have identified that the PVWP system can be an attractive
    application for sustainable energy for irrigation. Hamidat et al. [25] established
    a program to test the PVWP system performance used to irrigate regions in the
    Sahraa, and it was concluded that PVWP systems are suitable for crop irrigation
    in small-scale applications [25]. Cuadros et al. [15] illustrated how to design
    PVWP systems using drip irrigation method to have an effective irrigating water
    system for olive tree orchard in Spain [15]. Recent research on PVWP systems has
    focused mainly on system modeling and improvements in the system components (PV
    modules, controllers, inverters), performance of PVWP system under various operating
    heads, and their effect on the environment [35, 38, 41]. Glasnovic and Margeta
    [22] proposed an optimization model for optimizing the PVWP size taking into consideration
    the required water for irrigation and the available water. They concluded that
    dynamic models give more realistic results; however, the economic performance
    for the lifecycle cost analysis (LCCA) was not covered [22]. Kelley et al. studied
    the technical and economic feasibility for implementing PVWP system for irrigation
    and concluded that there are no barriers for applying PVWP system; however, the
    only barrier is the high price of the PV modules [31]. Therefore, a LCCA is required
    to prove the compatibility of the PVWP system. 3 Model Development and Formulation
    The model targets the best utilization of the land by maximizing the return, and
    this will occur by balancing between the crops’ profit, the required water, and
    the size of PVWP system. As the user enters the necessary inputs, the model investigates
    the best combination of crops, starting date for each crop, occupied area for
    each crop and type of panel (ToP). The purpose of the model is to find the maximum
    equivalent annual net cash flow (EACF) by having a dynamic simulation of PVWP
    system, solar irradiance, required water for irrigation, and crop yield response
    to season. In addition, the economic aspects of the PVWP systems are investigated.
    IIC and LCCA are used to compare different water pumping techniques, and EACF
    is used to evaluate the net benefits gain, which will be further detailed in the
    upcoming sections. 3.1 Model Architecture The developed model consists of five
    different modules: (1) inputs module, (2) database module, (3) calculations module,
    (3) optimization module, and (5) output module. First, the user inputs all the
    required information for the project through the input module. Then, the database
    module is filtered according to the input data. Next, the calculation module uses
    the filtered database and the inserted inputs to calculate the required parameters
    for calculating crops net benefits and sizing the PVWP system. After that, the
    optimization modules will use these data to optimize the objective function which
    is maximizing the EACF by adjusting the model variables to generate the results
    in the output module. 3.1.1 Inputs Module The model allows the user to enter the
    required data which includes the following: • Location • Irrigation method • Area
    (feddan) • Cost of structure system/m2 (US$) • Budget (US$) • Cost of wiring/m2
    (US$) • Soil salinity Ece (dS/m) • Electricity annual degradation (%) • Electric
    conductivity Eciw (dS/m)   The model reads and uses the input data to optimize
    EACF and PVWP system for the combination of crops that have been selected by the
    model. The model has been developed using Microsoft-Excel and Evolver 8.2 which
    is an Excel Add-in [44]. The model consists of several worksheets. To be able
    to insert the inputs, gets into the worksheet, named “model inputs,” and fills
    in the required data as indicated in Table 1. Inputs guide the user to include
    the correct data in the right place. The model has been developed to read the
    input data inserted by the user and share them among other worksheets to estimate
    the essential parameters for optimizing the model such as the reference evapotranspiration
    (ETO) and the hourly average solar radiation (I). Table 1 PV panels’ specification
    Full size table 3.1.2 Database Module The database module consists of two main
    parts: data on crops’ requirements and data on PVWP system. Data on Crops’ Requirement
    The first part in the crops’ requirement database contains data about the crops
    and trees that can be grown inside greenhouses in Egypt. The total duration for
    a pool of crops according to planting season is collected [13, 27, 48, 56]. In
    addition, the crop coefficient (KC) value for each crop during different growing
    stages is identified according to Cropwat that are freely distributed by the Food
    and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United States [30]. Also, the crops’
    costs are recognized according to the Egyptian market, they include the cost of
    making rows, seeds, fixed, temporary workers and engineers, composites, fertilizers,
    and pesticides. The second part includes data about the greenhouses and their
    costs. In this study, the analysis was based on single span greenhouses using
    medium technology. Data on PVWP Systems It includes two main sections which required
    for PV system and data on water pumping system. Concerning, the database of PV
    system involves two main parts. The first one covers the regional meteorological
    and geographical information for 27 governorates in Egypt collected from the National
    Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The global sunshine hours and solar
    radiation values for 27 locations covered almost all regions in Egypt are calculated
    and presented in “database module.” The yearly average value of sunshine hours
    is 12 h per day, and the global solar radiation in Egypt is found to be around
    6.0 kWh m−2 day−1 which give a great potential for applying PV system there. The
    second part deals with the specifications of the PV modules. They are categorized
    into six groups according to their type (monocrystalline or polycrystalline) and
    number of cells (36, 60, or 72) as indicated in Table 1. The physical information
    for the panels, i.e., capacity, efficiency, dimensions, losses, average cost,
    temp coefficient of power, PV transmittance, rated voltage, rated current open
    circuit voltage, and short circuit current, was collected according to the Egyptian
    market. Moving to the water pumping system, the selection of a proper pump in
    a solar water pumping system depends on required discharge (Q) and total head
    losses (HTE) [19]. Each pump type has its own efficiency as presented in Table
    2 [6]. Usually, the pump controller system includes maximum power point tracker
    (MPPT) to assure that the solar array is delivering power at its maximum. AC powered
    pump has also inverter to convert the DC power to AC. Table 2 Pump’s type versus
    efficiency [6] Full size table 3.1.3 Calculation Module The calculation module
    consists of three models. The first model calculates the hydraulic energy (EH)
    by identifying the required discharge (Q) for the combination of crops and the
    total head losses (HTE). The second unit is for sizing the PV system that gives
    the power output from the PV array based on location (Φ), slope (β), type of panels
    (ToP), azimuth of panels (Ψ), and ambient temperature (Ta) to generate the water
    irrigation system. The third model is to analyze the economic performance of PVWP
    system using EACF approach. Hydraulic Energy (EH): The hydraulic energy demand
    (EH) is determined according to the plants water requirements, the irrigation
    method, and the total head losses according to Eq. (1) [22, 55], $$ E_{\\text{H}}
    = \\frac{{\\rho gQ_d H_{{\\text{TE}}} }}{36*10^5 *\\eta_F \\eta_N } $$ (1) where
    Qd is the total water demand in (m3 day−1), EH is the hydraulic energy (kWh),
    ρ is the density of water (1000 kg m−3), g is the acceleration due to gravity
    (9.81 m s−2), ηF is the efficiency of the irrigation system (fractional losses),
    ηN is the efficiency of the irrigation method (open channel, drip, trickle, flood).
    Concerning the total water demand if the sum of crop evapotranspiration (ETc),
    leaching requirement (LR), and irrigation applied in soil disinfection and pre-transplanted
    irrigation, i.e., 50 mm for soil disinfection done every (1–2) years and 20 mm
    for pre-transplanted, needed to be calculated [9, 14, 30]. To be able to calculate
    the ETc using Eq. (2) [47], the reference evapotranspiration (ETO) was calculated
    according to Almeria radiation method using Eq. (3) [39], and the KC values are
    extracted from Cropwat. $$ {\\text{ET}}_{\\text{c}} = K_{\\text{c}} {\\text{*ET}}_{\\text{o}}
    $$ (2) $$ {\\text{ET}}_{\\text{o}} = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l} {\\left(

    The leaching requirement is the amount of water needed to remove excessive salts
    that cause a crop yield decrement, and it was calculated using Eq. (4) [14], where
    ECiw is the electrical conductivity of the irrigation water applied, and ECe is
    the soil salinity tolerated by crop as measured on soil saturation extract. $$
    {\\text{LR}} = \\frac{{{\\text{EC}}_{{\\text{iw}}} }}{{5{\\text{EC}}_{\\text{e}}
    - {\\text{EC}}_{{\\text{iw}}} }} $$ (4) Moving to the total head loss, the typical
    head consists of static head (HST), kinetic head (HDT), and pressure head (HF).
    According to Ghoneim, the static head is the elevation head from the water surface
    level to the point of discharge, the kinetic head represents the kinetic energy
    of the fluid (\\(H_{{\\text{DT}}} = V^2 /{ }2g\\)), where V is the velocity and
    g is the acceleration (9.81 m sec−2). In addition, there is a fraction loss that
    can be reduced by enlarging the pipe diameter, eliminating bends, and reducing
    the flow rate [21]. Therefore, the total head from borehole TTE can be expressed
    by Eq. (5) [22], where increment i assumes the values i = 1 to N (N is the total
    number of time stages, decades), HTE(i) the total head lift (m). $$ H_{{\\text{TE}}\\left(
    i \\right)} = H_{{\\text{ST}}\\left( i \\right)} + H_{{\\text{DT}}\\left( i \\right)}
    + H_{{\\text{F}}\\left( i \\right)} $$ (5) Friction losses are calculated according
    to Eq. (6) [16], where f is Darcy friction factor, l is the pipe length (m). Darcy
    friction factor can be identified from moody chart. The minor fractional losses
    are assumed to be 10% according to PV project analysis in 2005 [49]. $$ H_{{\\text{F}}\\left(
    i \\right)} = \\frac{8flQ^2 }{{\\pi^2 gd^5 }} $$ (6) Nominal power capacity of
    PV system (Pel): The nominal capacity or peak power of PV (Pel) generator under
    standard conditions is given by Eq. (7) [18, 22] considering the effect of the
    ambient temperature (Ta), where Pel is the nominal capacity (W), αP is the temperature
    coefficient of PV module (/°C), TC is the cell temperature (°C), TC,STM is the
    cell temperature at standard test conditions (°C), ηS is the efficiency of the
    subsystem (inverter, motor, pump), IT is the daily solar irradiation on PV surface
    (kWh m−2). $$ P_{{\\text{el}}} = \\frac{1000}{{(1 - \\alpha_{\\text{P}} \\left(
    {T_{\\text{C}} - T_{{\\text{C}},{\\text{STM}}} } \\right)\\eta_{\\text{S}} }}{*}\\frac{{E_{\\text{H}}
    }}{{I_{\\text{T}} }} $$ (7) To calculate the daily solar irradiance in PV surface,
    an empirical model is greatly needed especially for areas where there is no available
    data for the solar irradiance. The model is established to estimate the hourly
    horizontal solar radiation from the average daily solar radiation. El Shimy proved
    that CR model [11] has a higher correlation than LJ model [37] [18]. Therefore,
    the ratio between the hourly solar radiation and the daily solar radiation was
    calculated using CR model as identified in Eq. (8) [11] [18], where I is the mean
    hourly solar radiation, H is the mean daily solar radiation, ω is the hour angle,
    and ωs is the sunset hour angle. $$ \\frac{I}{H} = a + b\\cos \\omega \\frac{{\\left(
    {\\frac{\\pi }{24}} \\right)(\\cos \\omega - \\cos { }\\omega_s )}}{{\\sin \\omega_s
    - \\left( {\\frac{2\\pi \\omega_s }{{360}}} \\right)\\cos \\omega_s }} $$ (8)
    The coefficients of the CR model are defined as the following: $$ \\begin{aligned}
    a & = 0.409 + 0.5016\\sin \\left( {\\omega_S - 60{\\circ} } \\right) \\\\ b &
    = { }0.6609 - 0.4767\\sin \\left( {\\omega_S - 60{\\circ} } \\right) \\\\ \\end{aligned}
    $$ Next, Erb’s correlation equation is used to calculate the diffuse fraction
    using Eq. (9) [20]. Then, the direct hourly solar radiation (Ib) is calculated
    by subtracting the diffused hourly solar radiation (Id) from the total hourly
    solar radiation (I). After that, the HDKR model is used to estimate the collected
    solar radiation on tilted surface (IT) using Eq. (10) [17]. Figure 1 represents
    a sample that was developed by the model for total, diffused, and direct solar
    radiation on horizontal surface and the estimated collected solar radiation on
    a tilted PV surface (β = 25°) at Aswan that lies at latitude 24.09011 on July

    According to photovoltaic project analysis, the ambient temperature is considered
    using Eq. (11), as it affects the power capacity of the PV as indicated before
    in Eq. (7), $$ T_c = \\frac{{T_a + \\left( {219 + 832K_t } \\right)C_f \\left(
    {T_{cn} - 20} \\right)}}{800} $$ (11) where Ta is the ambient air temperature
    (°C), Kt is the monthly average clearance index, Cf is a correction factor to
    account for the effect of off-optimal tilt angle of the PV generator on the temperature
    of the PV modules [49], and Tcn is the nominal operating cell temperature (°C).
    Lifecycle Economic Assessment: The IIC is estimated based on the component prices,
    structure costs, wiring costs, and engineering and installation costs. The LCC
    is estimated using Eq. (12) [42], where CO&M is present worth of the operation
    and maintenance costs, and CF is the fuel costs. The operational and maintenance
    costs are considered as 1% of IIC of PV system/year [46]. $$ {\\text{LCC}} = {\\text{IIC}}
    + {\\text{C}}_{{\\text{O}}\\& {\\text{M}}} + {\\text{C}}_{\\text{F}} $$ (12) Crops
    revenue, excess electricity generated in case, there PV system is connected to
    the grid, and reduction of CO2 emissions is the potential revenues that can be
    generated through the operation of a PVWP irrigation system. In this study, the
    profitability of PVWP system is analyzed using the NPV and EACF as economic indicators
    and can be calculated using Eqs. (13)–(15) [52], where i is the discount rate,
    n is the period of the LCCA, Rt is the net cash flow at time t, and t is the time
    of cash flow. EACF approach is used to solve the problem of having different life
    spans. Therefore, lifecycle economic model is developed to conduct LCCA based
    on EACF, and some assumptions need to be established as follows: the analysis
    approach, the real discount rate, the analysis period, and the significant cost
    of ownership. $$ {\\text{NPV}} = \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{t = 0}^n \\frac{R_t

    $$ (15) 3.1.4 Optimization Module The model is developed on Microsoft-Excel using
    Evolver. Evolver is an Excel Add-in that applies GA technique to reach the near
    optimum solution. The Add-in makes several runs by adjusting the decision variables
    which is defined as adjustable variables, then the GA keeps running different
    likelihoods in an iterative mode till the stopping criteria is met, then the optimum
    solution is reached. The stopping criteria will be defined by the user as number
    of trials, run time, maximum progress (%) that happens for last specific number
    of trials, formula if true, or/and stop if error occurs. In this study, the model
    adjustable variables are defined as the combination of crops, the starting data
    for each crop (planting date), the occupied area for each crop and ToP. Every
    adjustable parameter has a defined lower and upper limit. The constraints are
    set as the allowable budget and the available land area to meet the objective
    function which is maximizing the EACF. Concerning the occupied area for crops,
    it was found that there should be a minimum assigned area for each crop to worth
    the investments. Therefore, another constraint is added that the minimum occupation
    area for any crop should be one feddan. In addition, overestimation for the PVWP
    system size will lead to over increase the IIC and consequently minimizing the
    EACF. On the other hand, underestimation for the PVWP system means to have improper
    Q which will have negative effects on the quality and the quantity of the crops
    and also affects the EACF negatively. Therefore, other constraints are set as
    the following: The actual energy at any instant is higher than the required energy
    to ensure that the system is sufficient and minimizing the difference between
    the actual and the required energy to prove system efficiency. 3.1.5 Output Module
    The output module provides the user with the maximum EACF, in addition, identifying
    the combination of crops, the starting date for each crop, occupied area for each
    crop and ToP to be used to meet the objective function. In addition to other economic
    parameters such as NPV, IIC, estimated quantity for water used per year, and percentage
    for the maximum utilization of the land. 3.2 Model Development The development
    of the model depends on integrating two main models to reach the required objective
    which is selecting combination of crops that have the maximum EACF and irrigated
    using an optimized PVWP system. The first main model is to select the combination
    of crops that have the maximum equivalent annual return, and the second model
    is to optimize the size of the PVWP system. Integrating these two models with
    some modifications leads to develop the new model which is never done before.
    The model formulation is described in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Model formulation flow diagram
    Full size image 4 Model Validation To outline to what extent the developed optimization
    model describes the system and for the purpose of determining appropriate results,
    verification of the model is essential. To verify the developed optimization model,
    two locations in Egypt, i.e., Luxor and Giza, having different climatic and environmental
    conditions have been selected. Considering all system parameters are variable,
    it is required to determine their reference values upon which certain variables
    change. Then, their effect on calculation of EACF and other parameters is observed.
    4.1 Area in the Luxor Region 4.1.1 Reference Parameters The reference parameters
    for Luxor region have been selected as indicated in Table 3. Table 3 Reference
    parameters for Luxor region Full size table This study selects the irrigation
    period to be twice a week in summer and once a week in winter, which is in practice
    more realistic, in view of water and energy consumption as there is no significant
    change in the moisture of the active soil from which crops intake water. 4.1.2
    Optimization Results for Reference Parameters for Luxor The optimization results
    of the combination of crops, area for each crop, and starting date for each crop
    and ToP are shown in Table 4 which represents the log of progress steps in the
    optimization process of the developed optimization model. The EACF was maximized
    to 318,620 US$ when the combination of crops was Tomato I, Tomato IV, Sweet Pepper
    II, and Mango, and the corresponding area for each crop was 2, 1, 1, and 1 feddan,
    respectively, as illustrated in Table 5. The maximum EACF satisfied by selecting
    3 different types of crops that required 50,803 Wp as optimal nominal electric
    power of PV generator. Tomato crop is planted in two different seasons as indicated
    in Table 5. To satisfy the required nominal power, 134 panels of type 6 were required.

    difference between the daily energy produced and the daily required hydraulic
    energy is as shown in Fig. 3. The positive values for the energy indicate that
    the system is sufficient as EAi − EHi >= 0. To have an efficient system the max
    (EAi) − max (EHi) ≈ 0, it was observed that the critical period occurs on day
    72 as the difference between max EAi − max EHi is 3.88 kWh as indicated in Fig.
    3. Fig. 3 Daily energy losses for Luxor (kWh) Full size image 4.2 Location in
    the Giza Area 4.2.1 Reference Parameters The same reference parameters have been
    selected as for the area in Luxor location except for the climate parameters and
    the soil type. Giza is located at latitude of 30.00951 resulted in different meteorological
    data than Luxor area. The type of soil is assumed to be sand. 4.2.2 Optimization
    Results for Reference Parameters for Giza The optimization results of the combination
    of crops, area for each crop, starting date for each crop, and occupied area for
    each crop and ToP are shown in Table 6 which represents the log of progress steps
    in the optimization process of the developed optimization model. The EACF was
    maximized to 397,064 US$ when the combination of crops was Sweet Pepper, Green
    Beans II, and Mango, and the corresponding area for each crop was 3, 1, and 1
    feddan, respectively, as illustrated in Table 7. Sweet Pepper has three different
    planting dates as indicated in Table 7. The nominal maximum power required to
    satisfy the requirements of the irrigation system is 72,486 Wp. To satisfy the
    required nominal power, 191 panels of type 6 were required. Table 6 Log of progress
    steps in the optimization process for Giza Full size table Table 7 Optimization
    results of PVWP system for Giza Full size table The difference between the daily
    energy produced and the daily required hydraulic energy is as shown in Fig. 4.
    The positive values for the energy indicate that the system is sufficient as EAi
    − EHi >= 0. To have an efficient system the max (EAi) − max (EHi) ≈ 0, it was
    observed that the critical period occurs on day 209 as the difference between
    EAi − EHi is 7.77 kWh as indicated in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 Daily energy losses for Giza
    (kWh) Full size image 5 Results and Discussion The LCCA indicated that it worth
    to investigate in Giza than in Luxor as it has higher NPV, higher estimated revenue
    for the first year, and higher return per every 1 m3 of water within the allowable
    budget compared to Luxor as indicated in Table 8. Table 8 LCCA for Luxor and Giza
    optimizations Full size table Although the average daily water requirements for
    both locations are almost the same, there is a big difference in the number of
    required panels. The required number of panels are 134 for Luxor and 191 for Giza
    although same ToP is used in both locations. This can be justified as Luxor has
    higher estimated solar irradiance than Giza as indicated in Fig. 5 considering
    the effect of the Ta on the performance of the PV modules. Fig. 5 Estimated monthly
    average solar radiation PV surface (kW/m2) Full size image Although the same reference
    parameters were used for both locations except for climate values and soil type,
    noticeable difference in the EACF is obtained. This can be justified as Luxor
    has lower net benefit form crops because of the transportation costs. In addition,
    soil salinity for Luxor (1.1 dS m−1) has lower value compared to Giza (1.3 dS
    m−1) resulted in higher leaching requirement for Luxor. The higher solar irradiance
    in Luxor also leads to higher ETo which means higher ETC. Therefore, the total
    water requirements for Luxor will be greater compared to Giza. By variation of
    different elements in the optimization output, it can be concluded that the model
    response to any change in the reference parameters. 6 Conclusion The proposed
    model presented in this study introduced a new approach to the problem by considering
    almost all the relevant factors affecting both the PV system and the irrigation
    system such as location, PVWP system, local climate, soil type, water source,
    total head losses, pool of different crops, and irrigation system. Accurate estimation
    for the irrigation water requirements and solar irradiance was carried out. In
    addition, the PV energy output was calculated taking into consideration the slope
    of installed panels (β), modules’ azimuth (Ψ), and the effect of the ambient temperature
    (Ta) on the performance of the PV modules as well. The model was developed based
    on GA technique. Then, the model was verified by comparing the model outputs for
    two locations in Egypt (Luxor and Giza), and it was proved that the model describes
    the subject system very well as several useful outcomes achieved. The model was
    run to maximize the EACF by considering the net benefit from the combination of
    the crops and the PVWP system costs. Accordingly, the ToP, combinations of crops,
    starting date for each crop, and occupied area for each crop were adjusted to
    meet the objective function. This model is characterized by having a flexible
    database module that can be edited by the user if needed. Next, the model outputs
    were generated including maximum EACF, economic analysis, and optimized PVWP system
    size. It was also observed that the total irrigation water requirements and the
    available solar irradiance have significant effects on the EACF through comparing
    the optimization results for the two locations (Luxor and Giza). Although Luxor
    is characterized by high solar irradiance which gives it an advantage over other
    locations in optimizing the PV system size, it was noticed that higher percentage
    of water for irrigation is required because of higher ETo value resulted from
    the high solar irradiance. Giza provided better economic analysis than Luxor as
    it had higher EACF (397,064 US$) compared to Luxor (318,620 US$) and higher return
    per 1 m3 of water (20.15 US$) compared to Luxor (16.26 US$). In both locations,
    the PVWP system was considered as sufficient system as the EAi − EHi > 0. The
    percentage of the total energy losses in both locations exceeded 50% which highlight
    the importance of optimizing the percentage of the total energy losses; therefore,
    further investigation on applying other options for energy storage systems is
    greatly needed. To sum up, the optimization model presented in this study is an
    example for how technology and sustainability can be integrated into agricultural
    sector to help farmers and investigators to find efficient and economic practice
    for the best utilization of land for greenhouse farming while bridging the gap
    of overestimation for irrigation water and consequently oversizing for PVWP system.

  description: From the perspective of sustainable development in irrigation areas,
    imperfect constraints, which have negatively impacted previous agricultural planting
    structure optimization models, tend to produce unreasonable optimization results.
    Thus, in this paper, attempts are made to incorporate the resilience of water
    resource systems into the constraint set and explore the optimal layout of agricultural
    planting structures in irrigation areas. We selected 12 sample irrigation areas
    in Heilongjiang Province, China, including Chahayang, Fuyu, and Tailai, as the
    research areas and considered their actual situations. Then, we established a
    multiobjective optimization model for an agricultural planting structure with
    rice, soybean, and corn planting areas as decision variables; socioeconomic benefits,
    agricultural production benefits, ecological benefits, and water resource benefits
    as objective functions; and water resource system resilience and net crop output
    value and other factors as constraints. Fifteen scenarios were assessed through
    the combination of objective functions, and the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm
    III (NSGA-III) was used to optimize and analyze the agricultural planting structure
    of typical irrigation areas in Heilongjiang Province and to determine the optimal
    planting plan. The research results found that the function values adjusted by
    planting area have significantly improved compared to those before optimization.
    The adjustment trend of agricultural planting area is to increase the planting
    area of rice and soybean and reduce the planting area of corn. The introduction
    of constraints on water resource system resilience ensures that other benefits
    remain basically unchanged; thus, the water resource objective function is significantly
    better with resilience constraints than without them. Therefore, water resource
    system resilience can act as an effective constraint; this finding enriches and
    expands the theoretical and methodological system for optimizing the management
    of agricultural planting structures in irrigation areas and thus provides important
    technological support for ensuring regional food security, ecological security,
    and water security, which has substantial practical significance.

    can be achieved, which reduces error by constantly measuring its own output and
    making adjustments based on the error.

    coupling coordinationIrrigated area 1. Introduction Agriculture, the foundation
    of the national economy, plays a crucial role in the healthy development of regional
    economies (Byerlee et al., 2009; Dorosh and Thurlow, 2018). However, due to people''s
    excessive pursuit of grain yield and nonstandard agricultural production management,
    environmental and resource issues related to agricultural ecology and water resources
    are becoming increasingly serious (Garnett, 2013; Misra, 2013). A reasonable agricultural
    planting structure not only promotes local economic development but also reduces
    pollution and harm to the natural environment, promoting green and sustainable
    development of the agricultural economy. Optimization of the agricultural planting
    structure is a hot research topic in the field of agriculture today. The classical
    British economist Ricardo D proposed the theoretical basis of regional agricultural
    planting structure optimization, the comparative advantage theory, as early as
    1817 (Watson, 2017), and subsequent research has continuously extended and developed
    on this theoretical basis. On the premise of ensuring normal grain growing operations,
    the optimization of agricultural planting structures in irrigation areas can fully
    leverage the resource advantages of the research area, develop regional planting
    characteristics according to local conditions, achieve maximum benefits and match
    agricultural modernization construction, which is of great significance (Li et
    al., 2020d). Relevant research (Garg and Dadhich, 2014; Adeyemo and Otieno, 2010;
    Mahmoodi-Eshkaftaki and Rafiee, 2020) focuses on the optimization and adjustment
    of agricultural planting structures in irrigation areas through the transformation
    of irrigation models; the economic benefits brought by adjustments to planting
    structure; and the growth environment and water requirements required by the crops
    themselves. Few scholars have optimized the sustainable development of water resources
    in irrigation areas. Therefore, to address challenges to the sustainable development
    of water resources in irrigation areas, which are caused by insufficient agricultural
    irrigation water, imperfect irrigation water management, and low irrigation water
    efficiency (Li et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020e), the concept of adjusting agricultural
    planting structure from the perspective of water resource resilience constraints
    is introduced. This concept, as part of the study of sustainable development issues
    in irrigation areas, can help to effectively alleviate the pressure on agricultural
    development and explore new paths for sustainable development in these areas.
    In the modeling of agricultural planting structure optimization and adjustment,
    the setting of constraint conditions is key to ensuring the rationality and reliability
    of the optimization results. Existing research mostly selects economic, ecological,
    social and other related constraint conditions (Li et al., 2020b; Notte et al.,
    2020; Yu et al., 2021). However, with the simultaneous growth of the agricultural
    production level and water resource demand, the contradiction between water resource
    supply and demand is evident. The optimization of agricultural planting structure
    can be explored from the perspective of sustainable development of water resources
    to effectively improve the resource utilization rate and address the contradiction
    between regional water resource shortages and agricultural production. In this
    field of research, Liu et al. (2021) organized and summarized the existing viewpoints
    on the resilience of water resource systems; furthermore, they proposed the connotation
    and measurement methods of the resilience of water resource systems in irrigation
    areas based on the agricultural characteristics of irrigation areas. However,
    the research results were limited to exploring the feasibility and spatiotemporal
    characteristics analysis of the resilience measurement and did not effectively
    establish a connection with agricultural planting structures. Therefore, based
    on these research results, water resource system resilience constraints are adopted
    to further explore the relationship between water resource system resilience and
    agricultural planting structure; to extend the research field of water resource
    system resilience; to enrich the research content of water resource system resilience
    in irrigation areas; and to provide a new path for the sustainable development
    of regional agriculture and water resources. In the process of optimizing agricultural
    planting, it is necessary to comprehensively consider multiple aspects, such as
    water resource systems, agricultural systems, socioeconomic systems, ecosystems,
    and technological management systems, which have typical multiobjective problem
    characteristics. The NSGA-III proposed by Deb and Jain (2013) has strong convergence
    ability in multiobjective optimization problems and can efficiently obtain the
    number of Pareto-optimal solutions in constrained multiobjective optimization
    problems. Compared to traditional multiobjective algorithms such as multiobjective
    particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and decomposition-based multiobjective algorithms
    (MOEAD), it is not prone to problems such as local optima and poor robustness
    (Luo et al., 2018; Britto and Pozo, 2014). The NSGA III algorithm has advantages
    in solving diverse solutions, strong stability, and high-dimensional multiobjective
    optimization (Sun et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2019). Therefore, in this study,
    the NSGA-III algorithm is selected for multiobjective optimization research. The
    resilience constraint of water resource systems is then introduced into the optimization
    analysis of agricultural planting structures in irrigation areas, and the NSGA-III
    model is applied to solve it. The aim is to further strengthen the scientific
    nature of the optimization analysis of agricultural planting structure in irrigation
    areas, improve the connection between regional sustainable development and agricultural
    planting structure optimization, and enhance the pertinence of regulatory plans.
    The research objectives are as follows: (1) To explore the feasibility and implementation
    path of embedding the resilience of water resource systems into the constraint
    set of agricultural planting structure optimization models in irrigation areas;
    (2) To seek the optimal adjustment plan for agricultural planting structure in
    irrigation areas based on the NSGA-III algorithm; (3) To analyze the constraint
    effect of water resource system resilience on the optimization of agricultural
    planting structure. 2. Materials and methodology 2.1. Research area Heilongjiang
    Province, located in northeastern China, is one of the three largest black soil
    regions in the world, with four water systems: Heilongjiang, Wusuli River, Songhua
    River and Suifen River. The abundant water and soil resources mean that Heilongjiang
    Province''s grain production occupies a special position in China, with the Sanjiang
    Plain and Songnen Plain being important strategic bases for ensuring national
    food security and agricultural product supply. However, the one-sided pursuit
    of increasing grain production, the imbalanced use of water and fertilization
    patterns, which results in groundwater overexploitation and water environment
    degradation, and the emphasis on planting patterns of high economic efficiency
    crops, which are not based on regional resource allocation, have severely affected
    the water security, food security, and ecological security of regional agriculture
    (Qi et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020c; Zhang et al., 2019b; Faiz et al., 2020). China
    attaches great importance to the food security and sustainable development of
    the two major plains and has successively proposed the overall plan for the comprehensive
    reform of modern agriculture in the “Two Great Plains” of Heilongjiang Province,
    as well as guiding opinions on the adjustment of corn structure in the “Sickle
    Bend” area. Under the constraint of water resource system resilience, the optimization
    and adjustment of agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas is crucial
    for ensuring food production and output value in the two major plains, while effective
    assistance for the sustainable development of regional agriculture must still
    be provided. Based on the representativeness and data completeness of the Sanjiang
    Plain and Songnen Plain irrigation areas in Heilongjiang Province, the agricultural
    planting structure optimization of the irrigation areas in Heilongjiang Province
    was studied by taking four irrigation areas in the Songnen Plain, namely, Chahayang,
    Fuyu, Tailai and Yi''an, and eight irrigation areas in the Sanjiang Plain, namely,
    Qixing, Erdaohe, Daxing, Jiangchuan, Wutong River, Xingkai Lake, Suibin and 859,
    as sample irrigation areas. The specific locations of the 12 irrigation areas
    are shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (543KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Geographical location of the sample irrigation area. 2.2.
    Data sources Materials were collected from the Statistical Yearbook of Heilongjiang
    Reclamation Area (2008–2017), Meteorological Data of Heilongjiang Reclamation
    Area (2008–2017), Comprehensive Annual Report of Water Resources of Qiqihar Branch
    (2008–2017), Comprehensive Annual Report of Water Resources of Jiansanjiang Branch
    (2008–2017) and the multiobjective model construction data of rice, soybean, and
    corn planting areas corresponding to 12 irrigation areas including Chahayang Irrigation
    District from 2007 to 2016, as well as from evaluation index data of natural,
    economic, ecological, and social development. In addition, due to the uncertainty
    of the input parameters in a long time series and the output result being the
    optimal planting pattern obtained under certain objective functions and constraint
    conditions, various indicators from 2016 were used as reference values, and the
    constraint values were determined based on the 10-year data from 2007 to 2016
    for subsequent research on optimizing and adjusting the agricultural planting
    structure in irrigation areas. 2.3. Construction of the multiobjective optimization
    model 2.3.1. Decision variables Heilongjiang Province grows mainly food crops,
    oil crops, hemp, medicinal herbs, fruits and vegetables, among which grains and
    legumes are the main crops. Grain is mainly composed of rice, wheat, and corn,
    while legumes are mainly composed of soybeans. In addition, Heilongjiang Province
    has planted crops such as sugar beets, tobacco leaves, medicinal herbs, forage
    grass, and green fodder. The crop planting proportion of 12 sample irrigation
    areas in Heilongjiang Province from 2007 to 2016 was calculated, as shown in Fig.

    Fig. 2. The planting area of three crops and the proportion of grain crop planting
    area to the total planting area in the sample irrigation area. Note: SR: rice
    planting area; SS: soybean planting area; SC: corn planting area; SG: planting
    area of grain crops; SE: planting area of crops other than grain crops; and ST:
    total planting area. Fig. 2 shows that the planting of grain crops is dominant,
    with the planting area of grain crops accounting for over 90% of the total planting
    area over the past decade. The minimum planting area reached 92.73% in 2007; it
    reached over 99% annually in 2014, 2015, and 2016. For food crops, the planting
    areas of rice, soybeans, and corn dominate. In the past decade, the total planting
    area of the three crops accounted for over 95% of the total planting area of grain
    crops, with the lowest value reaching 96.49% in 2008 and even exceeding 99% from
    2010 to 2016. This proves that except for the three crops of rice, soybeans, and
    corn, there are almost no other grain crops planted in the 12 sample irrigation
    areas in Heilongjiang Province. Therefore, in this study, the planting areas of
    rice, soybean, and corn are used as decision variables to explore the optimization
    of agricultural planting structure under the constraint of water resource system
    resilience. 2.3.2. Objective function At present, research on the optimization
    of agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas and the resilience of water
    resource systems in irrigation areas is mainly analyzed from the perspectives
    of water resource systems, agricultural systems, ecological environment systems,
    and socioeconomic systems. Therefore, for the selection of objective functions
    for the optimization of agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas under
    the constraint of water resource system resilience, fertilizer application amount,
    net crop output value, total crop yield, and irrigation water consumption are
    proposed to characterize ecological environmental benefits, social and economic
    benefits, agricultural production benefits, and water resource benefits, respectively.
    Based on these four aspects, the optimization of agricultural planting structure
    is comprehensively considered (Wang et al., 2020; Chen, 2018; Chen, 2008). However,
    there is a contradictory and competitive relationship between various benefits,
    and during the mediation process, there is often a phenomenon where one aspect
    of the benefits improves while the other worsens. To better optimize the agricultural
    planting structure in irrigation areas of Heilongjiang Province, the objective
    functions of minimizing fertilizer application, maximizing net crop output, maximizing
    total crop yield, and minimizing irrigation water consumption are adopted. (1)
    Ecological benefit objective function (1) In the formula, yE is the total amount
    of fertilizer applied (kg); mi is the fertilizer application rate per unit area
    for the i-th crop, where the fertilizer application rate per unit area for rice
    is m1 = 339.45 kg/hm2, the fertilizer application rate per unit area for corn
    is m2 = 372.3 kg/hm2, and the fertilizer application rate per unit area for soybean
    is m3 = 128.1 kg/hm2 (Liu and Lian, 2019). xi is the optimal planting area (hm2)
    for the i-th crop. (2) Socioeconomic benefit objective function (2) In the formula,
    yS is the net output value of crops (yuan); bi is the unit price of the i-th crop
    (yuan/kg); ci is the unit yield of the i-th crop (kg/hm2); di is the unit area
    cost of the i-th crop (yuan/hm2); and xi is the optimal planting area (hm2) for
    the i-th crop. (3) Agricultural production efficiency objective function (3) In
    the formula, yA is the total crop yield (kg); ci is the unit yield of the i-th
    crop (kg/hm2); and xi is the optimal planting area (hm2) for the i-th crop. (4)
    Water resource efficiency objective function (4) (5) In the formula, yW is the
    total amount of irrigation water (m3); wi is the gross irrigation quota of the
    i-th crop (m3/hm2); xi is the optimal planting area for the i-th crop (hm2); wy
    is the net irrigation quota of the i-th crop (m3/hm2); and n is the effective
    utilization coefficient of irrigation water. Based on the objective functions
    of ecological benefits, socioeconomic benefits, agricultural production benefits,
    and water resource benefits mentioned above, a combination function of agricultural
    planting structure suitable for 12 sample irrigation areas in Heilongjiang Province
    is established. (6) 2.3.3. Constraint condition To construct an optimization model
    for agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas under resilience constraints,
    based on the establishment of objective functions, suitable constraint conditions
    should be developed according to local specific situations. In addition to resilience
    constraints, other constraints must be established in terms of ecological benefits,
    socioeconomic benefits, agricultural production benefits, and water resource benefits.
    Based on the objective function established in the previous section, the optimization
    of agricultural planting structure must be constrained in terms of fertilizer
    application per unit area, net crop output value, total crop yield, irrigation
    water consumption, and cultivated land area. The specific constraint expressions
    are as follows: (1) Constraints on fertilizer application rate (7) In the formula,
    yi is the amount of fertilizer applied to the i-th crop (kg); xi is the optimal
    planting area for the i-th crop (hm2); A = 420 kg/hm2 is the constraint value
    of fertilizer application per unit area (Liu and Lian, 2019); yj is the amount
    of fertilizer applied in the j-th irrigation area (kg); and xj is the optimal
    planting area (hm2) for the j-th irrigation area. (2) Constraints on net output
    value of crops (8) In the formula, bi is the unit price of the i-th crop (yuan/kg);
    ci is the unit yield of the i-th crop (kg/hm2); di is the unit area cost of the
    i-th crop (yuan/hm2); xi is the optimal planting area for the i-th crop (hm2);
    and B is the total net output value of crops (yuan). (3) Constraints on total
    crop demand (9) In the formula, ci is the unit yield of the i-th crop (kg/hm2);
    xi is the optimal planting area for the i-th crop (hm2); and C is the total demand
    for crops (kg). (4) Constraints on water consumption for crop irrigation (10)
    In the formula, wi is the gross irrigation quota of the i-th crop (m3/hm2); xi
    is the optimal planting area for the i-th crop (hm2); and D is the total amount
    of irrigation water used for crops. (5) Constraints on cultivated land area (11)
    In the formula, xij is the optimal planting area (hm2) for the j-th type of crop
    in the i-th irrigation area; e is the multiple cropping index; and ki is the total
    cultivated area of the i-th crop (hm2). (6) Constraints on water resource system
    resilience The resilience of water resource systems generally refers to the ability
    of the water resource system to gradually recover to structural stability, resource
    supply, and normal ecological environment regulation under the joint action of
    its own and external forces when the system structure and function undergo a certain
    degree of change in response to external factors such as natural, ecological and
    economic interference. The resilience of the water resource system in the irrigation
    area (RWRSIA) is related to the structure, function, and complexity of the system
    itself, as well as to external stress. For example, if the canal system has a
    high anti-seepage rate, good vegetation conditions, and social and economic prosperity,
    then people''s lives are relatively abundant, water resource utilization is reasonable,
    and the resilience of the water resource system is high. In the opposite situation,
    the resilience of water resource systems is low. The optimization of agricultural
    planting structure in irrigation areas, such as the evaluation of the resilience
    of water resource systems in irrigation areas, is closely related to water resource
    systems, socioeconomic systems, ecological environment systems, and agricultural
    systems. Although the evaluation indicators for RWRSIA do not directly include
    the planting area of three crops, the adjustment of planting structure will cause
    dynamic changes in key driving factors for the evaluation of RWRSIA, such as the
    planting ratio of high water-consuming crops, per capita arable land area, and
    effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water, thereby indirectly affecting
    the resilience index and level of the water resource system in irrigation areas.
    To ensure the sustainable development of regional water resources after the optimization
    and adjustment of the agricultural planting structure, a constraint on the resilience
    of the water resource system is set. Referring to Liu et al., 2021, the evaluation
    level of RWRSIA is determined to be level I as the optimal level and level IV
    as the worst level. Whether the restoration level of the water resource system
    is ≤ Level III is determined after the planting structure is optimized under the
    constraint of water resource system restoration. Namely, (12) Ⅲ In the formula,
    RWRSIA (A, B, C) represents the water resource system resilience of the irrigation
    area when the optimized rice planting area, soybean planting area, and corn planting
    area are A, B, and C, respectively; IGWO-SVM (A, B, C) is the result based on
    the IGWO-SVM mode rating; and IGWO-SVM (A, B, C) indicates that the evaluation
    results of the IGWO-SVM model in scenario i should all be ≤ Level III. Based on
    this, the resilience level constraints of the water resource system in the irrigation
    area are set and organically combined with the optimization of the agricultural
    planting structure. The specific constraints of the resilience level of the water
    resource system in the irrigation area on the planting structure are shown in
    Fig. 3. (7) Nonnegative constraint Download : Download high-res image (863KB)

    of the water resource system in irrigation areas. Note: Level I, II, III, and
    IV represent the resilience level of the water resource system. The planting area
    of each crop needs to meet nonnegative conditions: (13) In the formula, xi is
    the optimal planting area for the i-th crop (hm2). 2.4. Method for solving multiobjective
    optimization models 2.4.1. Pareto dominance relationship In minimizing multiobjective
    optimization problems, for m objective components , i = 1∼n, given any two decision
    variables , . If there is a need for , all have holds or exists i , such that
    is established. Then, it is called dominates . If there are no other decision
    variables that can dominate a decision variable, then the decision variable is
    called a nondominated solution, which is the Pareto optimal solution. However,
    for multiobjective problems, for a given set of optimal solutions, if the solutions
    in this set are mutually nondominant, i.e., the pairwise relationship is not dominant,
    then this solution set is called the Pareto solution set (Han et al., 2021). 2.4.2.
    NSGA-III algorithm The NSGA-III algorithm was initially improved by Deb and Jain
    on the basis of NSGA-II, using reference points instead of crowding to improve
    the selection mechanism. Compared to NSGA-II''s ranking based on the crowding
    degree, NSGA-III''s role in maintaining the population diversity ranking is more
    pronounced due to the introduction of reference points. Due to its advantages
    compared to other multiobjective optimization algorithms, especially its satisfactory
    results in various aspects compared to the MOEA/D method in the calculation process
    of up to 15 objectives, the NSGA-III algorithm was selected to solve the multiobjective
    problem. The specific implementation process of the algorithm is detailed in Deb
    and Jain (2013). 2.5. IGWO-SVM model The support vector machine (SVM) model was
    initially proposed by Vapnik et al. (1994). Due to its excellent performance in
    solving small sample, nonlinear, and high-dimensional problems, it has been widely
    applied by scholars from various countries in various fields (Li et al., 2020a;
    Wang et al., 2020). The main purpose of SVM is to build a classification hyperplane
    to distinguish different samples and maximize the classification interval. Specifically,
    the feature vector can be mapped from the low-dimensional space to the high-dimensional
    space through the kernel function to establish the discriminant function. The
    penalty parameter C and kernel function parameter σ have a great impact on the
    solution of the hyperplane. C represents the degree of punishment for exceeding
    the error range and is used to adjust the fit of the data. σ controls the radial
    action range of the kernel function. If its value is too small, it can easily
    cause overfitting, and if its value is too large, it can lead to a loss of learning
    ability. Therefore, the introduction of optimization algorithms for C and σ allows
    for parameter optimization. The gray wolf optimizer (GWO) algorithm was first
    proposed by Mirjalili et al. (2014) in 2014 in the article Gray Wolf Optimizer.
    This algorithm simulates the hierarchical system and hunting mechanism of gray
    wolves in nature. Due to its simple and efficient advantages, it has been widely
    used in various fields. However, the original GWO is prone to problems such as
    local optimization, low precision, and poor robustness for high-dimensional, multipeak
    function and multiobjective optimization problems. Deng S et al. (2019) proposed
    the differential evolution (DE)-GWO theory of combining the DE algorithm and the
    GWO algorithm to address GWO''s comparative disadvantages. After updating the
    position of the wolf pack, this approach performs DE operations and selects mutations,
    crossovers, and other operations to create better individuals for the next generation.
    DE-GWO helps the GWO algorithm to avoid falling into local extrema and improves
    its overall search capabilities. Compared to the SVM model optimized by algorithms
    such as gravity search, the IGWO-SVM model exhibits higher classification accuracy
    and mean square error. Therefore, the IGWO-SVM model was selected to evaluate
    RWRSIA in Heilongjiang Province. The specific implementation process of the algorithm
    is detailed in Liu et al., 2021). 2.6. Scenario building Scenario analysis is
    typically used for the judgment of regional development trends. The conventional
    scenario setting method constructs scenarios by using three different levels:
    high, medium, and low, or the presence or absence of a certain key variable. In
    the Opinions on Implementing the Rural Revitalization Strategy issued by the Central
    People''s Government of the People''s Republic of China (Yang et al., 2021), it
    is clearly noted that rural revitalization should adhere to the principle of adapting
    measures to local conditions and then gradually progressing. To balance the coordination
    of the objective function and the acceptability of farmers in the process of optimizing
    and adjusting the agricultural planting structure, the selection of planting area
    adjustment plans is tailored to local conditions. Based on the scenario setting
    method proposed by Li et al. (2020d), from the perspective of the objective function,
    different dimensional target combinations are set into 15 scenarios, as shown
    in Table 1. The 1st-4th scenarios in Table 1 are single-objective scenarios that
    can be directly solved through equations. The 5th-15th scenarios in Table 1 are
    multiobjective scenarios that need to be brought into the NSGA-III algorithm for
    a multiobjective solution. The year 2016 decision variable values are used as
    the control group for comparative analysis. Table 1. Scenario plan. Scenario Combination

    3.1. Analysis of algorithm solving efficiency To fully validate the reliability
    of the NSGA III algorithm, in this study, Deb et al.''s comparative pattern was
    referenced and DTLZ1, DTLZ2, DTLZ3, and DTLZ4 were selected as test functions.
    The NSGA III algorithm, the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition
    penalty-based boundary intersection (MOEA/D-PBI), the multiobjective evolutionary
    algorithm based on decomposition-Tchebycheff approach (MOEA/D-TECH), and the DE
    algorithm based on decomposition differential algorithm (MOEA/D-DE) were used
    to analyze model efficiency by calculating the inverse generational distance (IGD).
    The IGD represents the minimum distance between each point on the real Pareto
    frontier and the set of individuals obtained by the algorithm and evaluates the
    convergence and distribution performance of the algorithm. The smaller the value
    is, the better the overall performance, including convergence and distribution.
    The calculation results are shown in Table 2. Table 2. IGD values of different
    test functions for each algorithm. Algorithm Test function NSGA-Ⅲ MOEA/D-PBI MOEA/D-TCH
    MOEA/D-DE DTLZ1 2.453 × 10−3 3.693 × 10−3 1.189 × 10−2 3.728 × 10−2 DTLZ2 3.632

    10−1 Table 2 shows that among the IGD values calculated by the four algorithms
    for the four test functions, only NSGA-III in DTLZ 2 has slightly better results
    than MOEA/D-PBI, though it has stronger results than the MOEA/D-TECH and MOEA/D-DE
    algorithms. The IGD results of NSGA-III are the minimum values in the remaining
    three test functions. Especially in DTLZ4, there is a significant difference in
    the calculation results. This result demonstrates the reliability of the model
    solution results obtained by the NSGA-III algorithm. 3.2. Benefit analysis of
    optimizing agricultural planting structure To obtain the optimal planting conditions
    and target benefits, the NSGA-III algorithm used population size pop_size = 100,
    cross parameter t1 = 20, mutation parameter t2 = 20, and number of iterations
    n_generations = 800 (Zhou et al., 2022) to calculate the single objective function
    values under the optimal planting conditions. Then, 11 sets of multiobjective
    combination forms were substituted into the NSGA-III algorithm. Finally, the objective
    function values under 15 different scenario modes were obtained; the results are
    shown in Fig. 5. Download : Download high-res image (839KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. Optimal planting mode optimization benefits under different
    scenarios: (a) single objective; (b) dual objective; (c) three objectives and
    (d) four objectives. Fig. 5(a) shows that the single objective optimization corresponding
    to S1–S4, without considering other objective functions, significantly improves
    the corresponding objective function values after adjusting the planting area
    compared to before optimization, with a net output value increase of 11.08%, a
    total yield increase of 2.88%, a decrease in fertilizer application rate of 7.24%,
    and a decrease in irrigation water consumption of 30.77%. In the multiobjective
    situation, the values of different objective functions decrease compared to those
    in the single-objective situation. Fig. 5(b) shows that under the dual target
    scenario, the overall increase in net output value is 6.13%–9.43%, the overall
    increase in total yield is 1.57%–2.36%, the overall decrease in fertilizer application
    is 2.07%–6.47%, and the overall decrease in irrigation water consumption is 27.97%–29.37%.
    Fig. 5(c) shows that under the three target scenarios, the overall increase in
    net output value is 4.6%–8.49%, the overall increase in total yield is 0.79%–1.57%,
    the overall decrease in fertilizer application is 2.42%–4.96%, and the overall
    decrease in irrigation water consumption is 26.92%–28.67%. Fig. 5(b) and (c) show
    that S5, S11, and S12 are scenarios that consider both net output value and total
    yield objective functions. Among the three scenarios, the social benefit objective
    function is slightly larger than its combination with other objective functions,
    and the agricultural production benefit objective function is slightly larger
    than its combination with other objective functions. S7, S12, and S14 are scenarios
    that consider both net output value and irrigation water consumption, and the
    resulting social benefit objective function values are slightly smaller than their
    combined form with other objective functions. Rice can bring significant economic
    benefits due to its high economic efficiency but has far greater water needs compared
    to corn and soybeans; thus, Heilongjiang Province, which is short of water resources,
    needs to limit increases in rice area to some extent. S8, S11, and S13 are scenarios
    that simultaneously consider the two objective functions of total yield and fertilizer
    application. Among the three scenarios, the value of the agricultural production
    efficiency function is slightly smaller than its combination with other objective
    functions. Similarly, from the perspective of ecological benefits, when considering
    both the fertilizer application and total yield objective functions, the value
    of the ecological efficiency function is also slightly smaller. As the amount
    of fertilizer applied increases, the crop yield increases. Excessive application
    of fertilizer not only limits crop growth but also reduces fertilizer utilization
    efficiency, leading to a series of environmental problems, such as increased greenhouse
    gas emissions and water resource pollution. From the perspective of water resource
    efficiency, when irrigation water consumption is arbitrarily combined with three
    objective functions, the objective function values have no obvious characteristics.
    Fig. 5(d) shows that under the four target scenarios, the overall increase in
    net output value is 6.13%, the overall increase in total yield is 1.31%, the overall
    decrease in fertilizer application is 2.42%, and the overall decrease in irrigation
    water consumption is 29.02%. When considering all objectives comprehensively,
    due to the competitive relationship between them, their benefit values do not
    reach the optimal effect. 3.3. Analysis of planting area adjustment in different
    scenarios Since it is not suitable for different regions to adjust the corresponding
    planting structure after considering all objectives, the data of 15 scenarios
    are substituted into the NSGA-III algorithm for analysis, and suitable schemes
    are selected according to local conditions. The results of the optimal scheme
    of agricultural planting structure under different scenarios are shown in Table
    3. Notably, since multiobjective problems cannot obtain unique solutions, there
    may be multiple sets of solutions on the Pareto front. Therefore, in response
    to the current planting situation in Heilongjiang Province, under the premise
    of ensuring that the objective function value is the Pareto-optimal solution,
    the group with relatively small changes in planting area is selected. Combined
    with the ecological environment protection policies in Heilongjiang Province,
    the group with the highest ecological benefits was selected when the changes in
    planting area were generally similar. Table 3. Optimal plan for agricultural planting

    S14 371,286 26,024 38,593 S15 369,073 31,726 35,103 Table 3 shows that among the
    15 scenarios, S3, S4, S7, S9, and S10 reduce the rice planting area; S7, S11,
    and S14 reduce the soybean planting area; and S7 increases the corn planting area.
    The optimization trend of the agricultural planting structure in Heilongjiang
    Province is to increase the planting area of rice and soybeans and reduce the
    planting area of corn. From the perspective of rice, the irrigation water consumption
    target has a significant inhibitory effect on the planting area, but when comprehensively
    considered, its inhibitory effect is weakened to a certain extent, which conforms
    to the changing pattern. When irrigation water consumption has an inhibitory effect
    on rice, multiple types of corn can be selected to compensate for economic benefits.
    When it does not produce inhibitory effects, multiple types of rice can continue
    to maintain economic benefits. If we consider the total yield objective function
    or the fertilizer application objective function again, we can consider adjusting
    the planting ratio of rice and soybean appropriately to achieve optimal treatment
    for multiple objectives in the region. To more intuitively demonstrate the changes
    in planting area before and after multiobjective optimization, 15 scenarios were
    compared with existing planting situations to obtain the optimal crop area changes
    under different scenarios. The results are shown in Fig. 6. Download : Download
    high-res image (296KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Changes in
    crop area under the optimal planting mode in different scenarios. Fig. 6 shows
    that S9 has the highest changes in total area, rice area, and corn area. S10 has
    the smallest changes in total area and corn area. The smallest change in rice
    area is in S7, while the largest and smallest changes in soybean area are in S6
    and S3, respectively. Because the main planting area in Heilongjiang Province
    is rice, 8 of 12 irrigation areas are located in the Sanjiang Plain, where most
    of the area is composed of paddy fields. Excessive adjustment of the rice area
    will lead to a deviation in the overall planting structure of Heilongjiang Province.
    However, the relatively small change in rice leads to a significant change rate
    for soybeans and corn with relatively small planting volumes. Therefore, rice
    is the crop with the largest amount of change and the smallest rate of change
    in the optimization and adjustment of agricultural planting structure in the 12
    sample irrigation areas in Heilongjiang Province. Adjustments in the area of three
    crops to extreme values is often considered a double objective function or even
    a single objective function. When three objective functions or even four objective
    functions are simultaneously used, the area adjustment situation is actually smaller.
    This shows that when more objective functions are considered, the effect can be
    achieved by adjusting the planting area relatively less to achieve the relatively
    optimal objective function value. However, when fewer objective functions are
    considered, it is necessary to adjust the planting area according to different
    scenarios or make minimal or maximum adjustments to the planting area to achieve
    a better objective function value. 3.4. Spatial analysis of agricultural planting
    structure under multiple scenarios To visually display the spatial changes in
    agricultural planting structure in Heilongjiang Province, specific data from 12
    irrigation areas were substituted into the NSGA-III algorithm to obtain the adjustments
    of the planting areas for 3 crops in 12 irrigation areas under 15 scenarios. The
    results are shown in Fig. 7. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Change in area of optimal planting patterns
    in sample irrigation areas under different scenarios. Among the four irrigation
    areas in the Songnen Plain, in the Chahayang irrigation area (Fig. 7a), 4 out
    of 15 scenarios consider increases in the planting area of corn, of which 3 consider
    irrigation water consumption. Among the 9 growth scenarios for rice, 7 include
    the total yield objective function. Except for S5, all scenarios that consider
    the total yield objective function require increases in the planting area of rice.
    This finding demonstrates that the total yield objective function in the Chahayang
    Irrigation District plays an important role in adjusting the rice planting area
    and the irrigation water consumption objective function in adjusting the corn
    planting area. From an overall perspective, the adjustment trend in the Chahayang
    Irrigation District involves reductions in the planting of corn and increases
    in the planting of rice and soybeans. Because the Chahayang Irrigation District
    is located between the Nomin River and the Allen River, with well-developed water
    systems and good soil water-saving conditions, it is appropriate to consider the
    impact of reductions in the irrigation water consumption objective function on
    the adjustment of its planting structure. Therefore, the Chahayang Irrigation
    District should reduce the planting of corn and increase the planting area of
    rice and soybeans. The Tailai Irrigation District (Fig. 7b) shows a reduction
    in corn cultivation in all scenarios, with 11 out of 15 scenarios reducing soybean
    cultivation and all scenarios increasing rice cultivation. The graph shows that
    in the Tailai Irrigation District, the change in soybean planting area does not
    play a critical regulatory role but only serves as an auxiliary regulatory role.
    Therefore, the future planting mode in the Tailai Irrigation District should reduce
    the planting of corn and increase the planting of rice. In the Fuyu irrigation
    area (Fig. 7c), except for S7, the planting area of corn is reduced. The majority
    of the reduced corn planting area should be used to grow rice, while a small portion
    should be used to grow soybean. In S7, to reduce the rice planting area, the soybean
    and corn areas should be increased by almost same amount. In the Yi''an Irrigation
    District (Fig. 7d), except for S9, in all situations, the planting of corn should
    be reduced and the planting of rice should be increased. Among the 15 scenarios,
    only 2 were designed to reduce soybean cultivation, and all considered the objective
    function of fertilizer application. When more target factors are considered, the
    growth of the soybean planting area is greater. A vertical comparison of the four
    irrigation areas on the Songnen Plain indicates that the Yi''an irrigation area
    has the highest growth rate of soybean planting, and its proportion of optimized
    adjustment of planting area increases compared to the other three irrigation areas.
    Looking at the four irrigation areas in the Songnen Plain, the overall goal is
    to reduce the planting area of corn and increase the planting area of rice. In
    most scenarios, the planting area of soybeans plays a regulatory role and accounts
    for a relatively small proportion of the adjustment. Among the eight irrigation
    areas in the Sanjiang Plain, the Qixing irrigation area (Fig. 7e) generally presents
    a reduction in maize planting area and an increase in rice and soybean planting
    area. Among the six scenarios where the planting area of rice increases, there
    are five cases where the total yield objective function is considered, and all
    of these involve a combination of multiple objectives. Among the six scenarios
    where the planting area of soybeans decreases, there are four cases where the
    objective function of irrigation water consumption is considered. Among the four
    multiobjective combination forms, three groups consider the objective function
    of irrigation water consumption. Therefore, in the Qixing Irrigation District,
    when the multiobjective combination form does not consider the objective function
    of irrigation water consumption, the planting area of soybeans can be increased.
    The Erdaohe Irrigation District (Fig. 7f) needs to reduce the planting area of
    rice in all 15 scenarios, with the planting area of soybeans reduced in 4 scenarios
    and the planting area of corn reduced in 3 scenarios. However, in the scenario
    of soybean and corn reductions, the reduction area is lower than that of rice.
    Therefore, the future planting model of the Erdaohe Irrigation District should
    entail moderate reductions in the planting area of rice and increases in the planting
    of corn and soybean. The overall situation of the Daxing Irrigation District (Fig.
    7g) entails increase in the planting area of rice and corn and reductions in the
    planting area of soybeans. Among the four scenarios where soybeans increased,
    three considered the objective function of irrigation water consumption, while
    among the seven scenarios where corn decreased, five considered the objective
    function of irrigation water consumption. This finding further shows that irrigation
    water consumption plays an important role in adjusting the planting area in the
    Daxing Irrigation District. The Jiangchuan Irrigation District (Fig. 7h) needs
    to reduce the planting area of rice and increase the planting area of soybeans
    and corn in all 15 scenarios. The main reason is that the original planting mode
    of the Jiangchuan Irrigation District has a very small proportion of soybeans
    and corn. Therefore, in the adjustment process, it is necessary to increase the
    planting area of soybeans and corn appropriately according to different scenarios.
    The Wutong River irrigation area (Fig. 7i) needs to reduce the planting area of
    corn in 15 scenarios, most of which need to reduce the planting area of corn and
    increase the planting area of rice and soybean, and a few of which need to reduce
    the planting area of soybean and corn and increase the planting area of rice.
    The overall trend is that the more objective functions are considered, the smaller
    the adjustment of planting area. The overall presentation of the 15 scenarios
    in the Xingkaihu Irrigation District (Fig. 7j) indicates that the planting of
    rice should be reduced and the planting area of soybeans and corn should be increased.
    Except for S6 and S15, where the planting area of rice and soybeans is reduced
    to increase the planting area of corn, in all other scenarios, the planting area
    of rice is reduced to ensure the planting of large beans and corn. The overall
    situation of the Suibin Irrigation District (Fig. 7k) requires reductions in the
    planting area of rice and increases in the planting area of soybeans and corn.
    Among the four scenarios for rice growth, there are three that consider only a
    single target; among the five scenarios for corn reduction, there are also three
    that consider only a single target. Therefore, in the Suibin Irrigation District,
    when a multiobjective situation is considered, the planting area of rice should
    be reduced, and the planting of corn should be increased. When a single target
    is considered, only the target situation can be considered. The overall situation
    of the 859 irrigation area (Fig. 7l) requires increases in the planting area of
    rice and corn and reductions in the planting area of soybeans. Among them, in
    three cases of rice reduction, three cases of soybean growth, and seven cases
    of corn growth, the objective function of irrigation water consumption is considered.
    The 859 irrigation area is near mountains and rivers, with dense water systems
    and good water retention. If the irrigation water consumption objective function
    is not considered, it is recommended to increase the planting area of rice and
    moderately reduce the planting area of soybeans and corn. In summary, the eight
    irrigation areas in the Sanjiang Plain have shown an overall increase in soybean
    planting area and a decrease in rice and corn planting area. Compared to the Songnen
    Plain, the Sanjiang Plain irrigation areas have a higher complexity of changes
    and weaker regularity. The comprehensive optimization benefits of agricultural
    planting structure, adjustment of planting area under different scenarios, and
    spatial analysis of agricultural planting structure under multiple scenarios can
    provide the following suggestions: The scientific allocation of crop spatial patterns
    should not only meet the requirements of local natural ecosystems but also leverage
    the advantages of agricultural resources according to local conditions to achieve
    good economic results. Based on the characteristics of grain crop cultivation
    in different regions, the government can effectively promote the transformation
    of the local planting structure and promote the structural reform of the agricultural
    supply side by taking water-saving irrigation measures as the starting point.
    In corn planting areas with water scarcity, the government can increase the rice
    planting area by investing in water-saving irrigation projects or guiding farmers
    to adopt water-saving technologies, thereby steadily increasing the net output
    value of the area. In addition to water-saving irrigation measures, price factors,
    grain production policies, climate change, and individual characteristics of farmers
    impact changes in the grain planting area. For example, the changes in precipitation
    and temperature caused by climate change will lead to an increase in the planting
    area of corn and soybeans, as well as a decrease in the planting area of rice.
    4. Discussion To further explore the constraint effect of water resource system
    resilience, based on the existing planting structure models in Heilongjiang Province,
    four objective functions were synthesized, and S15 was taken as an example to
    compare and analyze the specific impact of water resource system resilience constraints
    on the adjustment of agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas. The
    calculation results are shown in Table 4. Table 4. Objective function values and
    changes in the overall planting area of irrigation areas with and without resilience
    constraints. Comparison project With resilience constraints Without resilience
    constraints Net output value (yuan) 4.5 × 109 4.6 × 109 Total yield (kg) 3.86

    soybean area (hm2) 7509.862 7832.478 Change in corn area (hm2) 11079.74 15364.91
    Table 4 shows that in terms of net output value and total yield, the objective
    function values without the constraint of water resource system resilience are
    greater than those obtained under the constraint of water resource system resilience.
    In terms of the fertilizer application rate, the objective function values are
    almost equal in both cases, while in terms of irrigation water consumption, the
    objective function values without the constraint of water resource system resilience
    are significantly greater than those under the constraint of water resource system
    resilience. The adjustment of the total area without constraints and the adjustments
    of rice, soybean, and corn are greater than those with constraints. Taking S15
    as an example, the optimization results of the agricultural planting structure
    in each irrigation area were calculated under two scenarios, as shown in Table
    5, Table 6. Both cases involved converting a portion of the corn planting area
    to rice and soybean planting areas. However, the difference is that when there
    is no resilience constraint, the planting area of corn decreases more, and the
    percentage of transfer to rice is much greater than when there is a resilience
    constraint. The reason for this is that when constraining the resilience of water
    resource systems, due to the mutual inhibition between objective functions, as
    water resource benefits are effectively improved, social and economic benefits
    and agricultural production benefits are reduced to a certain extent. Due to the
    high economic benefits of rice among grain crops, the current oversupply of corn
    has led to a significant increase in inventory, reduced planting efficiency, and
    an increasingly prominent issue of increased production without increased income.
    Moreover, the problems of pesticide residues and soil nutrient imbalance caused
    by continuous cropping of corn cannot be ignored. After increases in the constraint
    of water resource resilience, due to the good water quality of rice, the planting
    area of corn converted into rice and soybean decreases compared to that without
    the constraint of water resource resilience. Thus, for the 12 sample irrigation
    areas in Heilongjiang Province, in both cases, the planting area of rice and soybean
    should be increased appropriately, while the planting area of corn should be reduced.
    Under the constraint of resilience, irrigation water consumption should be reduced,
    and the net output value and total yield should be reduced appropriately to ensure
    that the level of resilience of the water resource system is greater than or equal
    to level III. Table 5. Optimization results of agricultural planting structure

    740.01 Total transfer area 7852.125 860.3631 −8712.49 Table 5, Table 6 show that
    in terms of adjusting the rice planting area, regardless of whether there is a
    resilience constraint, the four irrigation areas of Erdaohe, Jiangchuan, Xingkai
    Lake, and Suibin all reduce the rice planting area, while the other eight irrigation
    areas all increase the rice planting area. Among them, the four irrigation areas
    in the Songnen Plain all increase the rice planting area. In terms of adjusting
    the soybean planting area, when there is a resilience constraint, five irrigation
    areas show a decreasing trend, with 2 in the Songnen Plain irrigation area and
    3 in the Sanjiang Plain irrigation area. When there is no resilience constraint,
    four irrigation areas show a decreasing trend, with 1 in the Songnen Plain irrigation
    area and 3 in the Sanjiang Plain irrigation area. Among them, the Daxing Irrigation
    Area and Bawujiu Irrigation Area significantly decrease. In terms of adjusting
    the planting area of corn, when there are resilience constraints, five irrigation
    areas show an increasing trend, all of which are Sanjiang Plain irrigation areas.
    When there is no resilience constraint, six irrigation areas show a growth trend,
    all of which are Sanjiang Plain irrigation areas, but their area growth is much
    smaller than the reduction area. In summary, the presence or absence of resilience
    constraints has no significant impact on the adjustment of rice planting area.
    For the Songnen Plain, an irrigation area with resilience constraints and an increase
    in soybean planting area has no significant impact on corn planting area. For
    the Sanjiang Plain, an irrigation area with resilience constraints and an increase
    in corn planting area has no significant impact on soybean planting area. From
    an overall perspective, the presence or absence of resilience constraints does
    not have a significant impact on the overall trend of change, but it has a significant
    impact on the specific adjustment of planting area changes. Unlike previous studies
    on the optimization and adjustment of agricultural planting structure, in this
    study, optimization and evaluation are combined to a certain extent in the process
    of exploring the optimization and adjustment of agricultural planting structure
    in sample irrigation areas of Heilongjiang Province under the constraints of water
    resource system resilience and other conditions. In the analysis process, the
    emphasis was placed on the improvement of benefits brought about by optimization
    and adjustment, the adjustment of planting area in different scenarios, the adjustment
    of planting area in different irrigation areas under different scenarios, and
    the impact of water resource system resilience on the optimization and adjustment
    of planting structure. In terms of evaluation, the emphasis is on demonstrating
    the adjustment of planting area obtained through the NSGA3 algorithm and, based
    on this, conducting multiangle analysis. In terms of optimization, the emphasis
    is mainly reflected in the increased benefits of the four objective functions
    brought about by the adjustment of planting area in the irrigation area. The adjustment
    of planting area obtained through the NSGA3 algorithm can effectively analyze
    the increase in benefits brought by the adjustment, further deepening the connection
    between optimization and evaluation. The optimization of agricultural planting
    structure in irrigation areas under multiobjective conditions is a hot and difficult
    issue. However, limitations in data acquisition, insufficient selection of indicators,
    insufficient consideration of natural factors such as climate change and precipitation
    conditions, and insufficient time series may impact the results. In the future,
    the increasing improvement in soil and water environmental monitoring data in
    irrigation areas will promote the effective resolution of scientific issues related
    to the optimization of agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas. 5.
    Conclusion This study aims to address the drawbacks of imperfect constraint conditions
    in previous agricultural planting structure optimization models, which can easily
    lead to unreasonable optimization results. Taking 12 sample irrigation areas,
    such as the Chahayang Irrigation District in Heilongjiang Province, as examples,
    the constraint values were determined based on data from 2007 to 2016, and the
    2016 data were used as reference values for analysis. A multiobjective optimization
    model based on regional conditions was developed, with rice, soybeans, and corn
    as decision variables; net output value, total yield, fertilizer application amount,
    and irrigation water consumption as objective functions; and water resource system
    resilience as constraints. The NSGA III algorithm was used to optimize the agricultural
    planting structure of 12 sample irrigation areas under the constraint of water
    resource system resilience, and the following conclusions were obtained: (1) From
    the perspective of optimizing the benefits of agricultural planting, considering
    only a single objective, the function values adjusted for planting area were much
    better than those before optimization. After considering multiple objectives,
    the net output value representing social benefits increased by 4.72%–9.43%, the
    total output growth representing agricultural production benefits remained between
    0.79% and 2.36%, the decrease in fertilizer application representing ecological
    benefits remained between 2.03% and 4.73%, and the overall decrease in irrigation
    water consumption representing water resource benefits was 26.92%–29.02%. (2)
    Through specific analysis of 15 scenarios, the area change of the optimal planting
    mode under different scenarios was determined. The results showed that S9 had
    the largest changes in total area, rice area, and corn area. S10 had the smallest
    changes in total area and corn area. The smallest change in rice area was in S7,
    while the largest and smallest changes in soybean area are in S6 and S3, respectively.
    From the perspective of specific changes in planting area under different scenarios,
    when considering 15 scenarios comprehensively, the overall trend in Heilongjiang
    Province is to increase the planting area of rice and soybeans and reduce the
    planting area of corn. (3) The analysis results of the NSGA-III algorithm were
    applied to 12 irrigation areas to further analyze the spatial change characteristics
    of the agricultural planting structure in Heilongjiang Province from the perspective
    of spatial transformation. The overall trend of the four irrigation areas in the
    Songnen Plain was a reduction in the planting area of corn and an increase in
    the planting area of rice. In most scenarios, the soybean planting area played
    a regulatory role and accounted for a small proportion of the adjustment. Eight
    irrigation areas in the Sanjiang Plain required an overall increase in soybean
    planting area and a decrease in rice and corn planting area. Compared to the Songnen
    Plain, the changes in the Sanjiang Plain irrigation areas were complex and had
    weak regularity. (4) From the perspective of the constraint effect of water resource
    system resilience, increases in resilience constraints had a negative impact on
    the net output value and total yield in the objective function, a significant
    positive impact on irrigation water consumption, and little impact on fertilizer
    application. Simultaneously, increases in the resilience constraint effectively
    reduced the adjustment of the planting area to achieve a relatively optimal situation.
    For the adjustment of the planting area of the three crops, increases in resilience
    constraints had a small impact on the planting area of corn and soybean but no
    significant impact on the planting area of rice. CRediT authorship contribution

    近年来，我国农业在迅猛发展的同时，也面临着水资源供需不平衡、劳动力不足等问题[1]。管道输水作为一种代替明渠的节水技术，具有节约水资源，提高水利用系数和便于管理控制等特点[2]，进行推广可以促进智慧农业的发展。但管道输水灌溉工程高昂的建设和能耗成本不利于其推广，降低灌溉费用成为亟待解决的问题[3]。随着物联网技术的发展和系统控制成本的降低，管道灌溉和智慧农业表现出了天然的结合性。将传统管灌系统升级为智慧灌溉系统，不仅可以极大的提高了灌溉系统的运维管理功能，而且通过智能设备实现了对出水装置流量的精准控制[4]，对降低灌溉费用具有重要的意义。
    设计流速作为灌溉系统的重要约束之一，传统的优化方法通常以经济流速作为约束条件，即根据管径选择对应的流速[5]，但随着科技的发展，这种流速约束已经被逐渐弱化。在管道灌溉系统中，研究人员通常采用2.0m/s作为设计流速[6,
    7]，但随着材料及加工技术的发展，此约束已经对新型复合材料的耐冲刷优势产生了限制，造成了材料的极大浪费[8, 9]。众多学者已经将流速上限进行了调整。王永涛[10]将3
    m/s作为流速上限进行管网优化，极大的降低了灌溉成本。李斌[4]通过水力性能分析，提出4 m/s的流速可作为山地灌溉的流速标准。高路[8]通过耐磨性能实验证明了5
    m/s远没达到非金属管材的设计流速。因此，研究设计流速对管道灌溉系统年费用的影响，可为研究人员在选择流速约束时提供理论支撑。 本文在已有研究的基础上，以设计流速作为研究对象，建立基于灌溉年费用的管网优化模型，并使用群体寻优算法对其进行求解，旨在得出设计流速对灌溉年费用的影响，为管灌系统设计的流速约束提供借鉴和参考。
    1 树状灌溉管网优化模型设计 1.1 目标函数 机压管灌年费用主要包括管网折旧维修费用（管网费用）和泵站运行能耗费用[11]。其中，管网费用与建设成本相关，运行费用则由泵站耗能决定。为了方便数学描述，本文以轮灌组为研究单位，轮灌组的分流结构示意图如图1所示，干管由M个管段组成，支管I、J分别由I、J个管段组成，支管每个管段均有一个出水口，并以干管分流点为参照由远及近进行编号。
    图1 轮灌组管网分流结构示意图 Fig.1 Schematic diagram of diversion structure of the irrigation
    sector network Full size|PPT slide 管网费用可利用建设成本进行计算[6]，即先计算灌溉管网各个管段成本的累加值，其中，管段成本与所选用管道的材料、直径与长度等因素相关，然后使用折旧率和维修率进行折算[12]。能耗费用则根据水泵的运行工况和运行时长进行计算。因此，建立灌溉年费用的数学模型如下：
    m i n  F c = r 1 + r y 1 + r y - 1 + β  ∑ m = 1 M C m L m + ∑ i = 1 I C I , i  L
    I , i + ∑ j = 1 J C J , j  L J , j + E T H   ∑ i = 1 I q I ,  i + ∑ j = 1 J q
    J ,  j 367.2  η p  η m （1） 式中：Fc为灌溉年费用，元/a；y为折旧年限，a；r为年利率，%； β 为年平均维修率，%；Cm、CI
    , i、CJ , j 分别为干管管段m、支管管段I, i、支管管段J,j的管道单价，元/m；Lm、LI , i、LJ , j 分别为干管管段m、支管管段(I,
    i)、支管管段(J, j)的管道长度，m；E为电价，元/kWh；T为水泵运行时长，h；H为水泵扬程，m；qI , i、qJ , j 分别为出水口(I, i)、(J,
    j)的流量，m3/h；ηp 为水泵效率，%；ηm 为电机效率，%。 1.2 约束条件 1.2.1 水头损失约束 水泵的性能参数不是孤立静止的，而是相互联系制约的，通常使用水泵性能曲线表示性能参数之间的关系[13]。为了提高计算机的求解连续性和减少求解变量的个数，本文在模型求解时使用流量表示水泵的扬程和效率，水泵性能曲线如下：
    H = ∑ a = 1 3  A a  ∑ i = 1 I  q I ,  i + ∑ j = 1 J  q J ,  j a - 1 （2） η p =
    ∑ b = 1 3 B b  ∑ i = 1 I  q I ,  i + ∑ j = 1 J  q J ,  j b - 1 （3） 式中：Aa 为Q~H的多项式回归系数；Bb
    为Q~ η p 的多项式回归系数。 管网进口压力是水泵扬程与水泵高度、进水管水头损失之和的差值。因此，管网进口压力计算如下： H g = H - Z 0 -
    H f （4） 式中：Hg 为管网进口压力，m；Z 0为水泵与水源水位的高差，m；Hf 为水泵进水管的水头损失，m。 支管的管道水头损失是支管和干管各管段的水头损失之和。本文使用水头损失公式计算管道的压力降[14]，使用的参数包括管道的流量、直径和长度。如图1所示，支管管段的流量是流经该管段的所有出水口的流量之和，干管流量为支管I和支管J所有出水口的流量之和。建立支管I水头损失模型为：
    H s I = μ ∑ i = 1 I  f   ∑ i = 1 i q I , i m d I ,  i b L I ,  i + ∑ m = 1 M  f   ∑
    i = 1 I q I ,  i + ∑ j = 1 J q J , j m D m b  L m + H t （5） 式中： μ 为考虑局部水头损失修正系数；f,
    m, b为与UPVC管材相关的摩阻系数、流量指数和管径指数，分别为94 800、1.77和4.77[6]；Dm 、dI , i 分别为干管管段m和支管管段I,i的管道直径，mm；
    H t 为支管的坡度，m。同理，支管J的水头损失的计算模型与支管I相似，此处不再赘述。 为满足轮灌组所有出水口的水头要求，轮灌组的最大水头损失应由轮灌组内水头损失最大的支管决定[6]，并且其值必须小于管网进水水头，因此，建立轮灌组水头损失约束为：
    m a x  H s I ,  H s J ≤ H g （6） 1.2.2 灌溉时长约束 增加灌溉时长可减少管道流量，从而降低管道阻力和水泵的运行能耗。但灌溉时间并不能无限增加，必须根据当地试验数据确定，即在规定的灌溉时间内完成相应的灌溉定额。因此，灌溉持续时长约束如下：
    T t = ∑ k = 1 K T k ≤ T s （7） 式中： T t 为灌区灌溉总时长，h；K为轮灌组个数； T s 为灌区规定的总时长，h。 1.2.3
    管径约束 根据工程建设要求，管径应沿水流方向逐渐减小，同时管径必须是标准尺寸。另外，为了便于施工和减少变径过大引起的应力集中[15]，相邻管道的直径应该具用连续性，即不可跨越一个标准值进行连接。因此，支管I的管径约束为：
    0 ≤ d I ,  i + 1 - d I ,  i < d m a x （8） 式中： d m a x 为最大管径差，mm。同理，支管J的管径约束与支管I相同。
    1.2.4 流速约束 当流速过小时，会造成杂质淤积和肥料溶解不完全等情况；而当流速过大时，会引起振动、水锤等流体力学与结构力学耦合的物理现象[16, 17]，对管道造成损坏。建立支管I的流速约束如下：
    0.6 ≤ v I , i < v m a x （9） 式中：0.6 m/s为管网具有施肥或施药的任务的最小流速[6]； v m a x 为设计流速，m/s。同理，支管J的流速约束与支管I相似。其中，设计流速作为研究对象，并不是一个常数，本文中其取值区间为2.0~5.0
    m/s，取值步长为0.1 m/s。 1.3 适应度函数 在遗传算法中，适应度函数被用于衡量个体在种群中的表现，目的是为了对个体进行评估和排序，以便能够选择和进化出更好的个体[18]。为了将目标函数和约束条件相结合，适应度函数需要引入惩罚因子，从而将有约束的优化问题转化为无约束的函数。本文管网优化模型包含4个约束条件，因此适应度函数可表示为：
    F f i t = F c + λ 1  m a x  H m a x - H g , 0 + λ 2  m a x  T t - T s , 0 + λ
    3  ( D I + D J ) + λ 4  V d D I = m a x  d I ,  x - d I ,  x + 1 , 0 + m a x  d
    I ,  x + 1 - d I ,  x - d m a x , 0                                 ∀ x ∈ 0 ,
    I D J = m a x  d J ,  x - d J ,  x + 1 , 0 + m a x  d J ,  x + 1 - d J ,  x -

    ∈ 0 , I ;  ∀ z ∈ 0 , J （10） 式中： F f i t 为个体的适应度值； λ 为惩罚因子；DI 、DJ 分别为支管I，J的管径惩罚值；Vd
    为轮灌组内所有支管的流速惩罚值。 2 算法结构设计 遗传算法是一种模拟自然进化过程搜索最优解的方法，具有很强的并行能力和自适应力，在管网优化设计中应用广泛[18-20]。由于本文在使用经典遗传算法对模型进行求解时[11]，通过修改算法参数、增加种群多样性和调整求解空间，均无法得到良好的收敛效果。因此，本文在对选择算子进行优化时，将选择算子修改为双选择结构，即在锦标赛选择的同时进行最优个体保留，避免最优个体在随机选择过程中被淘汰。另一方面，由于舍弃了交叉算子，本文在对变异算子优化时，将初始变异概率提高至40%，并使用退火算法逐渐降低变异概率[11]。另外，由于管径变异会破坏原始的约束条件，产生大量不合理解，造成算力的浪费，本文对变异的管径进行邻域判断和修改，保证变异后管径数组保持单调递增。
    3 计算实例 本研究基于江苏某机压管灌管网为例进行优化验证[14]。如图2所示，灌溉系统由泵站、管网系统和给水装置等构成。其中，管网系统为机压管灌中常用的树状结构，该结构相对于环状管网和混合管网具有更低的建设和维护成本。该项目区管网由4个干管管段和10个支管组成，并以干管分流点相同为依据，划分为5个轮灌组。为了提高灌溉均匀性，本研究基于灌溉面积确定每个出水口的流量。以支管1为例，出水口的灌溉面积分别为：0.26、0.27、0.29、0.30、0.31和0.33
    hm2，对应的配水百分比为：14.8%、15.3%、16.5%、17.0%、17.6%和18.8%。另外，本文优化模型采用承压能力0.6 MPa的UPVC管材进行计算，管径集合为：160、200、250、315
    mm，对应的管材单价分别为37、56、90和142 元/m。 图2 实验田的管网布置及灌溉面积示意图 Fig.2 Schematic diagram of
    the network layout and irrigation area of the experimental field Full size|PPT
    slide 4 结果与分析 4.1 算法分析 遗传算法的控制参数较多，其中群体规模和遗传代数对求解准确性影响较大。本文以群体规模2 000、最大遗传代数100为基本遗传参数，将交叉概率和初始变异概率分别设置为50%和40%进行模型求解。另外，由于轮灌组水头损失和管径约束是保证灌溉基本需求的强制性约束，因此对其设置的惩罚系数为105，以快速消除无效解。而灌溉时长和流速约束具有一定的容忍性，本文对其设置的惩罚系数较前者低一个数量级。
    以轮灌组1为例，改进遗传算法的最小适应度和平均适应度的迭代过程如图3所示。本文对选择算子进行了改造，设计为锦标赛选择和最优个体保留的双选择结构。如最小适应度收敛曲线所示，在前10次迭代过程中，最小适应度明显下降，这体现了锦标赛选择的优点；同时，收敛曲线单调递减，体现了最优个体保留的特点。
    图3 改进遗传算法的收敛迭代图 Fig.3 Convergence iteration diagram of improved genetic algorithm
    Full size|PPT slide 另外，为了验证算法求解精准度，本研究将算法程序独立运行100次，比较计算结果与最优解的相对偏差。运行结果表明，相对偏差小于1％的概率达到99.7％，小于0.5％的概率达到91.6％，说明了本文算法的计算结果稳定，具有较高的计算精度。
    4.2 灌溉年费用分析 本文以2和5 m/s作为设计流速的上下限，在此区间内对机压管灌系统进行管径和配水优化，得到了不同设计流速下的最小灌溉年费用。如图4所示，在2.0~2.7
    m/s的区间内，灌溉年费用随着设计流速的增加逐渐降低。当流速提高到2.7 m/s时，灌溉年费用由2.0 m/s的26 732元降低至24 812元，费用节约率为7.17%。另外值得注意的是，当流速大于2.7
    m/s时，进一步提高设计流速并不会降低灌溉年费用。由此可得，在合理的流区间内，提高设计流速可以降低灌溉年成本；但进一步提高流速约束，并不会影响灌溉年费用，这是因为管道水头损失会随着流速的增加而上升，进而增加了能耗费用，导致灌溉年成本的增加[21]。

    m/s的区间内灌溉年费用是逐渐下降的，但这个结果并不能直接反映出管网费用与设计流速之间的关系。为了分析设计流速对管网费用的影响，本文以轮灌组1内的支管2进行表征（图2）。结果如表1所示，在2.0~2.4
    m/s的流速区间内，最优的管径方案并未发生变化；当设计流速提高至2.5 m/s时，管段3、管段5均取得了比原始方案更小的管径值；但进一步将流速逐步提高至5.0
    m/s，管网设计方案均为发生变化。结果表明提高设计流速可以降低管网费用，但同时值得注意的是灌溉管网并不会随着流速的增加而持续获得更小的管径值。 表1 支管2在不同设计流速下的管径

    160 160 160 200 200 250 315 4.4 运行能耗分析 同样以支管2为例分析设计流速对运行能耗的影响。如表1所示，管径在设计流速为2.5
    m/s时发生改变。因此，以管径相同为前提，如图5所示，在2.0~2.4 m/s流速区间，随着设计流速的增加，运行能耗由1 254 元/a降低至1 102 元/a；同样在2.5~2.7
    m/s流速区间，运行能耗也表现出相同的趋势，这说明提高设计流速可以在相同管网布置的条件下降低运行能耗。同时结果还表明，当管径变小时，即设计流速由2.4 m/s提高至2.5
    m/s，管道阻力的增加会引起运行费用的显著提高。 图5 不同设计流速下的运行费用 Fig.5 Operating costs at different maximum

    In determining the irrigation depth of barley, it is inevitable to find the best
    periods to increase the efficiency of water consumption and also to achieve the
    highest yield of the product. A multi-objective optimization model has been presented
    to improve irrigation planning and the allowable amount of irrigation during the
    growth period using genetic algorithm based on nondominated sorting (NSGAII) and
    cellular automata. Under this concept, the structure of the optimal water supply
    allocation model is included in the form of two main objective functions. Therefore,
    the first objective function is to minimize water allocation and the second objective
    function is to maximize the total income from the cultivation pattern compared
    to its costs. The latest data related to the cultivation pattern and economic
    information such as product sales price and production costs in the planting and
    harvesting stages were collected for 1 year of study. The daily data of river
    flow, rainfall and climatic data of Hulunbuir district in Inner Mongolia province
    were converted into 10-day periods. It shows the optimal irrigation planning results
    of winter barley in three different scenarios. In ten periods of growth, the rainfall
    is enough to provide most of the plants’ water needs. HIGHLIGHTS Listen Algorithm
    of multi-objective self-reproducing automata has been used to develop agricultural
    water supply model. Estimated solutions were validated by fuzzy bounding by domination
    concept. The results showed that the use of supplementary irrigation in dry areas
    was a sustainable solution in food security. crowding distance, determination
    of irrigation depth, non-domination INTRODUCTION Listen From the 700 million hectares
    of grain-cultivated land in the world, 2.2 billion tons of crops are harvested,
    of which corn, rice, and wheat have the largest share with an annual production
    of 790, 660, and 600 million tons, respectively (Steduto et al. 2012). By developing
    a mathematical model to determine the depth of irrigation and by considering the
    effective factors in productivity, such as the amount of available water and effective
    rainfall, it is possible to present and evaluate the solutions for planning and
    managing water in the agricultural sector. Since the optimization of the cultivation
    pattern is affected by the amount of water consumed by the plant, the allocation
    of consumed water during the growth period should be managed in such a way that
    maximum water efficiency is obtained. By optimizing the allocation, it is possible
    to manage the allocation of water in the network and, as a result, each product
    during a specific period. Shortage irrigation management is one of the ways to
    improve the efficiency of water consumption, in which the amount of water needed
    for irrigation is reduced compared to full irrigation levels, and a mild moisture
    stress that has a proportional reduction is applied to crop production. In the
    conditions of drought and water scarcity, the technique of low irrigation can
    increase the economic profit of the crop by producing the maximum crop per unit
    of irrigation water (English 1990). Decreasing the amount of water received by
    the plant causes a decrease in the yield of the crop, therefore, before applying
    reduced irrigation, the reaction of the plant to moisture stress in each stage
    of growth should be evaluated. Production function is an empirical approach that
    describes the relationships between water and crop performance. In the economic
    analysis of agricultural patterns and optimizing the allocation of water resources,
    the use of production functions has found many applications (Shangguan et al.
    2002; Ganji et al. 2006). Doorenbos & Kassam (1979) production function, which
    was discussed in the 33rd edition of FAO Irrigation and Drainage, is one of the
    significant functions in this field (Kaboosi & Kaveh 2010; Jiao et al. 2023).
    Several achievements have been obtained from the studies of water allocation to
    plants in dry areas, and determining the depth of irrigation, which should be
    considered in the form of limitations of the problem. Therefore, in the case of
    wheat and barley products, due to their sensitivity to water scarcity and the
    possibility of a sharp decrease in yield from November to late March, no water
    stress is considered (Hakuzimana & Masasi 2020). Nasreen & Ashraf (2021) and Luo
    et al. (2022) obtained about 50% of the water requirement of wheat to achieve
    the highest water consumption efficiency. On the other hand, the efficiency of
    water consumption caused by supplementary irrigation increases the efficiency
    of water consumption caused by precipitation (Tavakkoli & Oweis 2004). Among the
    efficient managements in improving the performance and efficiency of water consumption
    in rainfed agriculture, we can mention mono-irrigation, limited irrigation and
    supplementary irrigation (Zhang & Oweis 1999). Khayatnezhad et al. (2023a and
    b) showed that increasing the depth or time of irrigation when the plant is facing
    moisture stress caused by lack of rainfall can increase the total efficiency of
    water consumption during a growing season by 15%. (Tavakkoli et al. 2013) in order
    to investigate mono-irrigation management in agriculture in dry areas on the yield
    of wheat and barley in Maragheh city, they determined the best and most economical
    proposal in the condition of limited available water. Three propositions of water
    allocation for mono-irrigation of wheat, barley and combination of wheat and barley
    were defined and compared with the superior agricultural management in rainfed
    conditions and the traditional proposition and the optimal area allocated to each
    crop was determined in each of the propositions. The results showed that integrated
    management contributed more than 70% and superior agricultural management less
    than 30% in obtaining the highest profit per unit area. Also, the rainfall productivity
    index of wheat, barley, and chickpeas has increased by 83, 56, and 164%, respectively,
    compared to traditional management conditions. The efficiency of water consumption
    in rainfed lands is between 0.5 and 0.3 kg/m3 and in some countries it reaches
    2.5. The average actual yield of the country''s rainfed lands is 20% of the potential
    yield, and by applying management practices such as one or two irrigations, the
    yield can be improved up to 80%. In China, the efficiency of water consumption
    in rainy conditions is reported to be 0.79 kg/m3, which has reached 0.87 kg/m3
    with single irrigation. In other words, the yield increased from 2.95 ton/ha in
    rainfed conditions to 3.53 ton/ha with the application of single irrigation (Huang
    et al. 2004; Rockstrom et al. 2007; Zhu et al. 2022). Mathematical model of water
    allocation to the products of Hulunbuir district, the model for determining the
    optimal amount and time of irrigation depth and the effective use of rainwater
    are the goals of interest in this study. Multi-objective self-reproducing automata
    (MCA) and an optimization algorithm based on nondominated sorting (NS) (Deb et
    al. 2002) have been used for this purpose. MATERIALS AND METHODS Mathematical
    model of water allocation Listen In general, products to a limited extent can
    be the subject of optimization or simulation problems in cropping model scenarios.
    Considering the multi-crop model, the area under cultivation is entered as the
    first variable to improve the income from the available lands and the depth of
    irrigation in order to apply water allocation management and increase yield in
    the planning model of the cropping pattern. Therefore, the decision-making variables
    in the developed model include both the mentioned influential parameters, i.e.
    the amount of water allocated to a plant in a 10-day period in millimeters and
    the cultivated area of each crop in hectares. In the first step, a string of variables
    is generated by a matrix of random numbers between the upper and lower limits
    of water that can be assigned with dimensions np × Sp (Sp is the number of 10-day
    periods in the study period, 36 and np is the number of plants in the cultivation
    pattern, 3). The lower limit of the allocated water is the height of the effective
    rainfall in each period, in other words, it is assumed that the effective rainfall
    is not within the discretion of the decision maker and is forced into the cycle
    of plant consumption. As a result, it is the least amount of water that the plant
    will receive if there is no water supply. Taking into account these conditions,
    a matrix with 36 columns including the effective rainfall in each period in millimeters
    was defined, which is responsible for controlling the lower limit of allocated
    water in each transaction and change in the model. Effective rainfall refers to
    the fraction of total rainfall that reaches plant consumption and was calculated
    by the relationships proposed by the US Soil Conservation Service for each period
    (Lalehzari et al. 2016). On the other hand, the upper limit of the decision variable
    is the evapotranspiration potential for each plant in each period. Potential evaporation
    and transpiration is calculated by the FAO Penman–Monteith method based on the
    climatic conditions of the region. Therefore, unlike the lower decision limit
    which is constant for all variables located in a 10-day period, there is a maximum
    amount of evaporation and transpiration for each variable. Based on this, in all
    the processes that cause changes in the initial values of the data, such as initial
    selection, population generation, mutation, intersection and movement of particles,
    the allowed range of variables for each period and each plant should be checked.
    Due to the special conditions of optimal allocation of water to agricultural products,
    a separate sub-program according to the flowchart in Figure 1 was prepared to
    identify and determine the upper and lower limits of water requirement at each
    stage of the growth of agricultural products and was defined as the initial conditions
    in creating variable domains of decision-making. Figure 1 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE
    Algorithm for determining upper and lower limits of decision variables. Supplementary
    irrigation depth Listen Supplementary irrigation is planned to provide the minimum
    water requirement of agricultural plants in some parts of the growing season,
    which will improve the yield of the crop. Finding the time and amount of supplementary
    irrigation and how to achieve the highest efficiency of water consumption and
    net income requires optimizing the algorithm of water allocation to agricultural
    plants. The first step in managing the irrigation depth is to identify the periods
    of plant growth when receiving water during that period of time will increase
    the yield the most. These periods are determined based on the three factors of
    the plant''s maximum water requirement, the sensitivity of each stage to drought
    stress, and the amount of effective rainfall. In other words, periods with less
    rainfall, more evaporation and transpiration, and higher sensitivity to water
    scarcity are the priority for allocating irrigation depth in agricultural lands.
    Therefore, to decide on the best time for irrigation, all three mentioned parameters
    were involved. For this purpose, a special code is assigned to the characteristics
    of each plant that is planted in a rainfed manner, and after identifying the plants,
    the model determines the maximum and minimum limits of water allocation for each
    period. Based on this, if two levels of irrigation depth are considered for the
    model, the maximum water requirement will be provided for each period and the
    equivalent of effective rainfall will be allocated for other periods. After estimating
    the product performance based on the production function, this process was repeated
    for all periods and the two periods that had the highest performance were selected.
    Solving the problem with self-reproducing automata method Listen Self-reproducing
    automata was proposed by Ulam (1960) and von Neumann (1966) to model self-reproducing
    automata systems. The application of this algorithm to optimize the exploitation
    of the reservoir was started by Afshar & Shahidi (2009), in which the problem
    was solved with the objectives of water supply and electric energy production,
    and it presented promising results in comparison with meta-exploration algorithms.
    The self-reproducing automata algorithm has four main components including cell,
    cell state, neighborhood and transition rule, which are defined depending on each
    problem. Each component of the self-reproducing automata network is called a cell
    and the characteristic of each cell is called a cell state. The behavior of self-reproducing
    automata is completely based on local communication and interaction. Each cell
    obtains its new state according to its rules at each step considering its immediate
    neighborhood. By applying these simple rules, which are called transition rules,
    the new position of the cells is determined based on their previous position and
    their neighbors. Therefore, presenting a model that directs the position of cells
    (the value of decision variables) to the best position in relation to one or more
    goals, can be the basis of using this algorithm as an optimizer. In order to solve
    the irrigation optimization problem with the self-reproducing automata method,
    in the first step, the problem is redefined based on the components of this algorithm.
    In the proposed cell model, a moment in time and the irrigation depth at that
    moment are defined as the state of the cell (decision variable). In other words,
    the irrigation depth variable at the beginning of each 10-day period is the state
    of the cell in the formulation of the self-reproducing automata method. The updating
    process is performed on this variable in each step of solving the algorithm. For
    an arbitrary cell, the adjacent cells are considered as the cell''s neighborhood.
    Cells related to periods t = 1 and t = T + 1 are bound to have a neighbor due
    to being located in the boundaries of the irrigation period. The next step in
    the self-reproducing automata model is to define the update rule. In this study,
    by using the objective function for each cell, the decision variable is solved
    and the amount of irrigation is updated. Based on the problem framework and decision
    variables, the minimization of the difference of allocated water and evapotranspiration
    in order to increase the efficiency of water consumption and the minimization
    of the transpiration stress ratio of the model are considered as the two main
    goals of the model. (1) (2) where I and Im are the irrigation depth and maximum
    irrigation requirement of the period t (mm/10 days), respectively, Ta and Tm are
    the actual and maximum transpiration (mm/10 days), respectively, IL is the irrigation
    losses (mm/10day), t is the period of plant growth (10 days), and T is the total
    number of periods. Multi-objective allocation planning model Listen Calculating
    the solution of the problem with the proposed model requires validation, which
    is done by the widely used NS algorithm. Therefore, the fuzzy limits of each solution
    obtained by the objective functions of the problem were estimated by the NS method,
    and the solutions that were in the fuzzy limit were proposed as the final solution.
    As shown in Figure 2, the implementation steps of this model are as follows: Generation
    of random parent generation (P0) in the number of N; Sorting the initial generation
    of the parent based on non-superior answers (the answer p to q is non-superior

    to reach the total amount (N). Figure 2 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Structure of

    levels of water supply were analyzed to study the pattern of water allocation:
    (1) providing the minimum water requirement by observing the defined limits, (2)
    allocating 50% of the total water requirement for optimal distribution between
    periods, and (3) full irrigation. Figure 3 shows how to allocate water to rainfed
    and rainfed barley as well as rainfed barley according to the amount of potential
    evaporation and transpiration and distribution of effective rainfall in the crop
    growing season for scenario 1. According to the figure, from the period 7th (early
    December) to the 16th, the effective rainfall meets the water needs of the crops
    and even in the periods 10, 11, and 12 it is more than that. Due to the higher
    water sensitivity of barley in the final stage, compensation for the lack of water
    in the final three periods has been done by water allocation. Figure 3 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD
    SLIDE Optimal allocation in different periods (scenario 1). In the second scenario,
    irrigation plays a significant role in increasing the economic efficiency of the
    project (Figure 4). Periods 23 and 25 have been introduced as the best time for
    irrigation and the optimal water height varies between 60 and 80 mm according
    to the constraints of the problem. It is necessary to explain that according to
    the potential evaporation and transpiration line, the total allocated water and
    the effective rainfall provide the total water requirement of rainfed crops in
    irrigation periods. On the other hand, the distribution of water for irrigated
    land has been done with more dispersion but less height. According to the figure,
    the role of rainfall and water demand, the potential in determining the best time
    and amount of irrigation is clear, but in practice, less attention is paid to
    these factors, and usually irrigation is done with a fixed frequency and volume.
    Figure 4 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Optimal allocation in different periods of scenario
    2. The full irrigation planning of barley in Figure 5 confirms the sufficiency
    of rainfall in the winter period and calculates the highest water requirement
    in April and May (periods 19–23). The comparison of potential evaporation and
    transpiration diagrams, irrigation water height and effective rainfall shows that
    in barley cultivation, paying attention to the time and amount of rainfall plays
    a more important role in determining the efficient irrigation program than the
    available water resources. Because rainfed cultivation with irrigation can meet
    the production needs of the crop. In the developed program, the number of irrigations
    is given to the model as a user input parameter, and it is possible to estimate
    the amount of production and water required for each number of irrigations. In
    general, humid area is considered a special scenario of dryland with different
    irrigation number. Figure 5 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Optimal allocation in different
    periods of complete irrigation (scenario 3). The evaluation parameters of water
    allocation scenarios, including water use efficiency, income–cost ratio, low irrigation
    rate and relative performance are compared and analyzed in Table 3. In scenarios
    2 and 3, the first priority was the full allocation of irrigation, and the rest
    was allocated to humid area. The efficiency of water consumption has not changed
    much and in all cases it is estimated to be about 0.3 kg/m3. On the other hand,
    irrigation has made a significant difference in the yield and profitability of
    crops. Table 3 Evaluation parameters of the water allocation system in scenarios
    1, 2, and 3 Required water/Irrigation depth Actual yield/Potential yield Actual

    optimum cultivation area for irrigated barley is less than its current area, which
    shows that increasing water intake has a greater role in crop profitability (Table
    4). On the other hand, the share of barley out of the 36 thousand hectares of
    the total dry land area of study area is more than that of barley and the competition
    of these two crops for land has been faced with the superiority of wheat. Table

    Listen In this research, the optimal amount and time of irrigation in rainfed
    agriculture and its effect on economic efficiency and water consumption efficiency
    have been evaluated. In this regard, the irrigation time was determined in the
    form of a mathematical model based on the amount of effective rain, water requirement
    and crop growth stage, and drought sensitivity coefficient. The results showed
    that increasing the area of rainfed cultivation compared to irrigated scenario
    has priority in drylands. Due to the high sensitivity to water and the absence
    of rainfall, the most water consumption is managed in the third stage of barley
    growth, and irrigation and underground water harvesting are mainly done in this
    period. Irrigation played a big role in increasing the profit–cost ratio, but
    it did not show much effect on the efficiency of water use. Different ratios of
    water supply have different levels of yield productivity, and in the case of barley,
    the lowest water consumption is estimated to be 55% by observing all the optimization
    conditions. In water shortage conditions, about 50% of the total allocated water
    comes from rainfall, so the second stage of crop growth includes more than half
    of the total water received. The third stage of growth is the source of groundwater
    consumption and determines the number and volume of barley irrigation. The tendency
    of farmers toward rainfed cultivation and not using the maximum potential for
    barley production seems to be caused by this factor. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Listen This

  key_findings: The model can allocate irrigation depth and cultivated area to maximize
    economic return and water consumption efficiency in rainfed conditions. The model
    can also provide insights into the optimal timing and amount of irrigation water
    required for different crop growth stages and drought sensitivity coefficients.
  limitations: The paper primarily focuses on optimizing irrigation depth and cultivated
    area in rainfed conditions using a mathematical model and does not directly address
    the integration of machine learning algorithms for closed-loop control strategies.
    The model may not be directly applicable to automated irrigation systems, which
    require real-time data collection and decision-making capabilities.
  main_objective: To develop a mathematical model that optimizes water allocation
    to agricultural products in rainfed conditions.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper is highly relevant to the point of integrating machine
    learning algorithms to optimize closed-loop control strategies for automated irrigation
    management. It provides a detailed mathematical model for optimizing irrigation
    depth and cultivated area based on effective rainfall, water requirement, crop
    growth stage, and drought sensitivity coefficients. The model is particularly
    relevant for developing closed-loop control strategies that can adapt to changing
    environmental conditions and crop requirements.

  description: Water scarcity leads to conflicts over water allocation. Laja Lake
    in Chile is a natural lake, which was formed by a volcanic barrier. Outflow from
    the lake is created by seepage through the barrier and via a controllable artificial
    outlet, which adds reservoir characteristics to the lake. Hydroelectric power
    stations have been built at both outlets. Downstream, water is diverted into irrigation
    canals, and the Laja River forms the Laja Falls, a popular tourist attraction.
    The previous operating policy preferred the most upstream water user and was found
    to be inadequate because the lake level decreased over long term. The current
    reservoir operation policy was established through stakeholder negotiations. This
    study investigated whether optimization (using Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm
    II) can further improve the operation of Laja Lake while maintaining a fair balance
    between stakeholder groups. The results were compared with the stakeholder agreement
    and the previous policy. The main difference is in the spring, when Laja Lake
    fills up before the irrigation season starts. The optimization strategy prioritizes
    hydropower generation during this period, resulting in reduced storage. Ultimately,
    optimization proves to be a valuable tool for identifying trade-offs and exploring
    different scenarios in water management.

  explanation: This study presents a multi-objective optimization approach to reservoir
    operation problems, with the specific aim of dynamically adapting closed-loop
    control strategies by integrating machine learning algorithms. The optimization
    technique used is the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), which
    is designed to find a set of Pareto optimal solutions, representing trade-offs
    between multiple objectives. The study focuses on the Laja Lake in Chile, a multi-purpose
    reservoir system where conflicting water demands exist between hydropower generation
    and agricultural irrigation. The negotiation process involving stakeholders resulted
    in a new operating policy for the lake, which is labeled as the 'Real Policy'
    in this study. The study compares the system performance of the Real Policy with
    an optimized scenario and a reference scenario based on a Standard Operating Policy
    (SOP). The optimized scenario outperforms both the Real Policy and the SOP in
    terms of system reliability and resilience, while achieving similar or better
    performance for other objectives.

    allocation. Laja Lake in Chile is a natural lake, which was formed by a volcanic
    barrier. Outflow from the lake is created by seepage through the barrier and via
    a controllable artificial outlet, which adds reservoir characteristics to the
    lake. Hydroelectric power stations have been built at both outlets. Downstream,
    water is diverted into irrigation canals, and the Laja River forms the Laja Falls,
    a popular tourist attraction. The previous operating policy preferred the most
    upstream water user and was found to be inadequate because the lake level decreased
    over long term. The current reservoir operation policy was established through
    stakeholder negotiations. This study investigated whether optimization (using
    Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) can further improve the operation
    of Laja Lake while maintaining a fair balance between stakeholder groups. The
    results were compared with the stakeholder agreement and the previous policy.
    The main difference is in the spring, when Laja Lake fills up before the irrigation
    season starts. The optimization strategy prioritizes hydropower generation during
    this period, resulting in reduced storage. Ultimately, optimization proves to
    be a valuable tool for identifying trade-offs and exploring different scenarios
    in water management. HIGHLIGHTS Listen The standard operational policy is not
    able to find long-term equitable solutions for the multi-purpose reservoir. Systems
    analytic methods can find balanced strategies for conflicting water demands. Trade-offs
    and alliances between stakeholders were identified using optimization and simulation
    followed by a ranking procedure. Different scenarios from the set of Pareto optimal
    solutions can be easily explored. hydropower, irrigation, NSGA-II, reservoir operation,
    stakeholder negotiation, water–energy–food nexus INTRODUCTION Listen Water management
    is increasingly a matter of managing conflicts over water allocation. This is
    due to overexploitation of the resource as a result of population growth, urbanization,
    and changes in the agricultural and industrial sectors (Zhang et al. 2018). Climate
    change with the intensification of hydrological extremes further exacerbates these
    problems (Ficklin et al. 2022). Conflicts over water distribution are emerging
    on both temporal and quantitative scales. According to Cai et al. (2004), there
    are distinctive characteristics of these conflicts. They are multidisciplinary
    complexity (interdependent impacts), domain-dependent knowledge (a global view
    is needed to find acceptable solutions), social value orientation (water management
    as a public issue), institutional constraints of rules and regulations, and cultural
    dimensions in which the stakeholders operate. The interaction of these characteristics
    makes it an extremely difficult task for water managers to find equitable solutions.
    When openly articulated disagreements arise between different stakeholder groups,
    they can lead either to negotiations between stakeholders, to top-down regulation
    by (local) authorities or to (armed) conflict. Broadly accepted solutions can
    be achieved through stakeholder participation and integrated water resources management.
    Both approaches have received considerable attention worldwide. The management
    of water storage, particularly the operation of multi-purpose reservoirs, is a
    potential area of conflict. Two sectors that are often in conflict are agriculture
    and hydropower. Accordingly, trade-offs between hydropower generation and the
    agricultural sector have already been studied. The water–energy–food nexus is
    one approach that addresses this relationship (Zhang et al. 2018). As shown by
    Chang & Chang (2009), Moeini & Nasiri (2021), and others, optimization can be
    used to generate equitable and sustainable solutions to multi-purpose reservoir
    operation problems. However, the technique has not been widely applied to real-time
    operations and management. According to Labadie (2004), the main reason for this
    is scepticism about the models, which may be due to the complexity of the optimization
    algorithms. In addition, the limitations of incorporating risk and uncertainty
    into the optimization, as well as the fact that many are only able to produce
    optimal results for the period of record, result in few applications. In most
    cases, it is also necessary to develop a customized programme for the given problem,
    which requires expert knowledge of optimization. This study compares the system
    performance of a combined optimization and ranking approach with those of a previous
    stakeholder negotiation and the standard operational policy (SOP, Men et al. 2019)
    as an approximation of the operation before the negotiations. The objectives of
    the study are (i) to investigate the stakeholder agreement, (ii) to perform multi-objective
    optimization of the system, and (iii) to compare the results of the agreement
    with those obtained from the optimization study. Studies have already been carried
    out on Laja Lake using a multi-scale trade-off analysis to investigate the interdependencies
    between the hydropower and agricultural sectors by Gonzalez et al. (2020). This
    study aims to further investigate the region. Here, it is possible to compare
    the results of the optimization with an agreement between the stakeholders, which
    allows us to focus on investigating the added value of the optimization strategies.
    CASE STUDY: LAJA LAKE Listen The Laja River Basin is located in south-central
    Chile (Figure 1). It is approximately 4,668 km2 in size. It is bounded by the
    Andes to the east and the Nevados de Chillán stratovolcanoes to the west. The
    Laja River Basin has a snow-dominated hydrological regime (Muñoz et al. 2019).
    Figure 1 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Map of the study are in Chile (left) and the
    Laja River Basin (right). The river flows from east to west. Its source is Laja
    Lake, which is formed by a natural volcanic barrier. Seepage through this barrier
    is possible and leads to the Hydroelectric Plant (HP) Abanico. An artificial tunnel
    also connects the lake to HP El Toro. The flow through the tunnel can be controlled,
    while the seepage depends on the level of the lake. One of the peculiarities of
    the Lake Laja system is that the two HPs are interdependent, although there is
    no direct hydrological connection. The more water HP El Toro extracts from the
    lake, the less water seeps through the barrier and reaches HP Abanico, and vice
    versa. The water from the two HPs later forms the Laja River, which crosses the
    valley before reaching the BíoBío River. Downstream from Laja Lake, four other
    HPs operate and water is diverted for irrigation of agricultural land, as shown
    in Figure 1. At the confluence of the Laja and BíoBío Rivers are the Laja Falls,
    a major tourist attraction in Chile. An overview of the area is shown in Figure
    1. Climate and data Listen Rainfall in the area is mainly frontal, resulting in
    an average annual precipitation of between 1,100 mm at the basin outlet and 2,300
    mm at the headwaters. During the winter months (June to August), snowfall is concentrated,
    accounting for about 47% of the annual precipitation (Muñoz et al. 2019). Filling
    of Laja Lake occurs in the spring (September to November) when the snow melts.
    The inflow data into the lake are taken from the government website (Coordinador
    Eléctrico Nacional 2022). Water allocation in Chile is based on a private market
    for tradable water rights. Non-consumptive users must obtain water rights (e.g.,
    HPs). The amount of water that can be used by a sector may not correspond to the
    actual water demand. However, since it is in the interest of the operators to
    make the best use of their acquired water rights, the measured flow data in the
    diversion canals are used as demand data in this study. In the present work, the
    five main irrigation canals in the basin are considered. They are (from east to
    west): Collao, Zañatru, Mirrihue, Laja, and Laja-Diguillín, as shown in Figure
    1. The streamflow data of the canals used in this study were retrieved from the
    governmental website of the General Directorate of Water (Dirección General de
    Aguas 2023). The canals are operated by an irrigation canal association that represents
    the farmers who have water rights on the canal. Since the agricultural sector
    is considered as a single water user in the study, the values for each canal are
    combined to calculate the demand. The study extends over a period of 5 years from
    2016 to 2020, where comparable data for all system elements are available and
    the new agreement had been implemented. The study period took place during a drought
    period in Chile (see Section 2.2). The agreement on the operation of Laja Lake
    Listen The operation of the lake is crucial for various sectors in the area, as
    it mainly controls the water available in the basin. This, in turn, leads to conflicts
    between different stakeholders over the allocation of water and the operation
    of Laja Lake. Furthermore, starting in 2010, Chile experienced a series of water
    shortages, also known as the mega-drought (Garreaud et al. 2019). When the drought
    hit the region, the lake was already vulnerable due to overuse in previous years,
    leading to severe water shortages downstream. Eventually, the Laja Falls, a national
    tourist attraction, dried up. The sight of the dry Laja Falls raised public awareness
    of water management issues, and increasing public pressure forced a change in
    the lake''s management. One point of conflict was that the lake management only
    considered stakeholders with water rights, creating a power imbalance between
    water users with and without water rights. In the negotiations that followed,
    an unprecedented step was taken: the tourism sector without water rights was included
    in the negotiations. Representatives of national and local governments also sat
    on the committee that negotiated the new operating rules. From touristic motivation,
    an ‘environmental flow’ was considered important. Transparency was critical to
    building trust. To support this, the Ministry of Public Works now distributes
    monthly streamflow and lake-level data to all stakeholders. In addition, water
    rights and other hydrological data are made available online. This way, everyone
    can monitor whether the agreement is being honoured. After 3 years of negotiations,
    a new agreement for the regulation of Laja Lake, called the New Laja Lake Irrigation
    Agreement (Ministerio de Obras Públicas 2018), was implemented in 2017 (Arumí
    et al. 2024). It grants the water use of the lake for the following year according
    to its level at the end of the filling season on December 1. In this agreement,
    the reservoir is divided into four volume segments. Each segment allows each party
    to release a certain amount of water, while leaving some in the lake as a reserve.
    Irrigation water can be used from December to April according to seasonal needs,
    while water for hydroelectric power generation can be released throughout the
    year. From now on, the reservoir operation policy used to manage Laja Lake will
    be referred to as the ‘Real Policy’ in this study. METHODS Scenarios of reservoir
    operation Listen The agreement was initially negotiated among stakeholders without
    the use of quantitative tools. In this study, the resulting operating policy is
    implemented as ‘Real Policy’ scenario. The SOP is used as a reference scenario
    to mimic the policy prior to the negotiations. The SOP is to always release as
    much water as possible to meet demand. Since the tunnel of HP El Toro is the only
    controllable outlet of the lake, the SOP only solves a single-objective problem.
    No water is stored for future shortages. The advantage is usually good demand
    coverage, here for HP El Toro, at the cost of high and long-term water shortages.
    Based on these two scenarios, the improvement in system performance due to the
    negotiation of the new agreement can be shown. Simulation and optimization are
    then used to investigate further improvements in reservoir control under multiple
    objectives with different weighting schemes, as might be expressed during stakeholder
    negotiations. The model combines complex mathematical multi-objective optimization
    with a transparent, easy-to-understand ranking method. Hydrological simulation
    model Listen The simulation model is a lumped model, which is based on the mass
    balance of the available water in the river basin. It runs on monthly time steps
    during the study period. The mass balance is given in Equation (1). (1) where
    is the storage at the next time step and is the current storage. is the net inflow
    to Laja Lake. There are no direct measurements of hydrological inflow, precipitation,
    and evaporation. is calculated as the remaining element of the water balance,
    implicitly including all other hydrologic fluxes. The reservoir has two outflows:
    is the release through the tunnel to be optimized and is the outflow from the
    lake via seepage. When the reservoir exceeds its maximum capacity, water is released
    as spill ⁠. The storage volume S of Laja Lake is constrained by its dead storage
    and its maximum storage capacity (in million cubic meters (MCM)) as shown in the
    following Equation (2). At the beginning, is set to the value of the 2015-12-31:
    ⁠. (2) The seepage from Laja Lake is defined by Equation (3), also called the
    ‘Laja Lake Seepage Law’ (Ministerio de Obras Públicas 2007), where is the water
    level of Laja Lake in m.a.s.l. The calculation of in Equation (4) is defined according
    to the volume-elevation curve of Laja Lake. (3) (4) Optimization model NSGA-II
    model Listen In the present study, a lumped simulation model is optimized using
    the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). This algorithm was first
    developed by Deb et al. (2002). In each iteration, a population is composed of
    multiple chromosomes, which, in turn, are composed of genes. The method provides
    four basic operators: generating an initial gene pool, calculating the fitness
    of each chromosome, selecting chromosomes, and performing crossover and mutation
    (Tayfur 2017). The main features of NSGA-II are the elicitation principle, the
    diversity maintenance mechanisms, and the emphasis on non-dominated solutions.
    This algorithm was chosen because it is a well-tested optimization algorithm.
    For example, it was successfully used by Yang et al. (2016) to generate adaptive
    multi-objective reservoir rules under changing climate. Three objective functions
    are formulated as minimization problems for the study. The two HPs, El Toro and
    Abanico, have an independent objective function and to emphasize their conflicting
    nature. The installed HP capacity (⁠⁠) should be guaranteed at each time step
    t as can be seen in Equations (5) and (6), where is the produced hydropower in
    MW at time step t for the considered hydropower plant. (5) (6) The produced hydropower
    mainly depends on the potential energy height h, the efficiency of the installed
    turbines ⁠, and the water flowing through the turbines ⁠. The relationship can
    be seen in Equations (7) and (8). Here, is the density of water (⁠⁠) and g is
    the gravitational acceleration (⁠⁠). The two hydroelectric stations have fixed
    heads (⁠ for HP El Toro and for HP Abanico). (7) (8) The water demand for all
    irrigation canals is aggregated and put into an objective function ⁠, where the
    available water for irrigation is calculated over the demand of the agricultural
    sector, as shown in Equation (9). (9) considers the water available for the agricultural
    sector in the basin at time step t. Therefore, consists of the outflow and the
    seepage flow as well as water coming from other tributaries (Polcura and Rucue
    rivers). The environmental flow condition is substracted for each time step t
    because it has a single demand profile and should always be considered. It comes
    from the tourism sector, which requires a minimum flow of to maintain the Laja
    Falls. represents the agricultural demand and is the maximum water demand of the
    agricultural sector during the study period (⁠⁠). When the environmental flow
    condition is not met, a penalty value is added to the objective function value
    f for each objective i for time step t. The penalty value depends on the amount
    of water overuse. In Equation (10), is the discharge of the Laja River at the
    outlet of the study area. (10) TOPSIS ranking Listen The result of the optimization
    is a set of Pareto optimal solutions. Further processing is required to find the
    preferred solution. In this study, this is done using the technique of preference
    order by similarity to ideal solution (Technique Of Preference order by Similarity
    to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Hwang & Yoon 1981). TOPSIS was chosen because it is
    a fast and easy-to-use decision-making tool for solving multi-criteria problems.
    To find the preferred solution, all solutions are ranked according to their closeness
    to the ideal solution and simultaneously their distance from the anti-ideal solution.
    In this study, the ideal solution is the minimum value of the objective function
    and the anti-ideal is the maximum value. Different ranking schemes are used to
    explore the different scenarios. For this, the weight vector w is used. The components
    of the weight vector are: (1) the agricultural sector, (2) HP Abanico, and (3)
    HP El Toro. Two scenarios are chosen: in the first scenario, a weight of 50% is
    assigned to the two HPs together and 50% to the agricultural sector (w = (0.5,
    0.25, 0.25)). In the second scenario, HP El Toro is given more influence, and
    HP Abanico and the agricultural sector are weighted the same (w = (0.15, 0.15,
    0.7)). Evaluation indices Listen For the qualitative analysis of the system performance,
    three indices are chosen according to Hashimoto et al. (1982). They focus on the
    reliability, resilience, and vulnerability of the system. Reliability: (11) The
    reliability refers to the volumetric reliability of the system in meeting the
    demand with the available water for user i at time step t in the study period
    T. Resilience: (12) The resilience index represents the number of failure periods
    which are followed by a non-failure period over the number of failure periods
    Vulnerability: (13) The vulnerability of the system is assessed by the index ⁠,
    which calculates the maximum shortage during the th failure period over the number
    of failure series with a subsequent successful period ⁠. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
    Listen The SOP releases the most water of all the strategies, starting with the
    filling of Laja Lake in the spring (September to November, Figure 2). This empties
    the reservoir and results in long periods where no releases are possible. The
    downstream users, here, in particular, HP Abanico and agriculture, only receive
    flow from the seepage and the downstream part of the catchment. Figure 2 VIEW
    LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Release curves of El Toro for different weighing scenarios
    compared to the SOP strategy and real policy. In general, Figure 2 shows that
    for all scenarios, most water is released during the summer months (December to
    February) to meet agricultural water demand and the minimum flow condition (Laja
    Falls). HPs can also use that released water for energy production, since their
    water use is not consumptive. However, the biggest difference between the optimized
    results and the Real Policy is in the spring. Since more water is available then,
    the optimization already releases water for the hydropower plants to meet their
    demand. This, in turn, means that less water is left for the summer months. If
    more weight is given to HP El Toro (w = (0.15, 0.15, 0.7)), even more water is
    released in the spring. For HP Abanico, it is better to store water in Laja Lake,
    which raises the level of the lake and eventually leads to more seepage. The Real
    Policy does not allow large amounts of water to be released in the spring, leaving
    more water in the reservoir. Looking at the storage volume of Laja Lake in Figure
    3, the SOP results in the lowest storage volume compared to the other scenarios.
    The optimized scenario where the agricultural sector is weighted with 50% (w =
    (0.5, 0.25, 0.25)) has the second highest storage and the scenario with the weighting
    w = (0.15, 0.15, 0.7) has the second lowest storage of the four scenarios. This
    confirms the conclusions from the release curves that a higher weighting of HP
    Abanico leads to more storage in the long term. However, the restrictions of the
    Real Policy on the amount and timing of release maximize storage. Nevertheless,
    full storage comes at the cost of less reliability of HP El Toro. These results
    are consistent with other studies on the New Laja Lake Irrigation Agreement (Real
    Policy), such as Matus et al. (2019) and Muñoz et al. (2019). Since the inflow
    is very low in the year 2016, as shown in Figure 3, all four scenarios produce
    very low storage until the late 2017 filling season with high inflow rates. Figure
    3 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Storage volume of Laja Lake according to different
    scenarios. It may be beneficial in future work to include a storage-related objective
    function to optimize reservoir filling. This would align the storage results of
    the optimization with those of the actual policy. Since seepage depends on the
    lake level, the curves shown in Figure 4 look very similar to the storage curves
    in Figure 3. The SOP strategy always releases water during the filling season
    of Laja Lake, which is too early for the agricultural sector, as shown in Figure
    4. The scenario with more emphasis on the agricultural demand w = (0.5, 0.25,
    0.25) is better in satisfying the demand in terms of time and quantity, compared
    to the other weighting scenario and the SOP. Figure 4 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE
    Seepage (left) and available water for the agricultural sector (right) according
    to different scenarios. Figure 5 shows the hydroelectric power generated by the
    two HPs studied according to the different operating strategies. As indicated
    before, the Real Policy, leaving more water in the lake, can generate more power
    at HP Abanico and less at HP El Toro. Especially in the winter months, when there
    is no release through the tunnel, there is no power generation at HP El Toro with
    the stakeholder agreement in place. It is the other way around when looking at
    the SOP, and the optimization results are somewhere in between. Figure 5 VIEW
    LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Generated power for the hydroelectric stations Abanico (left)
    and El Toro (right) according to different scenarios. Installed capacity at the
    HP Abanico 136 MW and at the HP El Toro 450 MW. The Real Policy provides a clear
    benefit to the reliability of HP Abanico (Figure 6). In contrast to these results,
    the consequences of implementing the SOP strategy for HP Abanico are that reliability
    and resilience are the lowest of all the scenarios, and vulnerability is very
    high. Even though the SOP produces good results for HP El Toro, the other strategies
    tend to perform better for the agricultural sector. This is probably the result
    of the high release rates in the spring with the SOP, leaving less water for the
    summer months, when the agricultural sector actually needs it. This proves that
    the SOP strategy is not suitable for finding equitable operating rule curves for
    the reservoir studied. Figure 6 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Performance evaluation
    for different stakeholders and operating scenarios. Besides the good results for
    HP Abanico, the Real Policy produces good results for the reliability but not
    the vulnerability and resilience of the agricultural sector. For the other indices
    and stakeholders, the optimization results outperform the other policies. Nevertheless,
    HP El Toro is by far the most vulnerable in all the scenarios except SOP. This
    is due to the very high installed capacity of 400 MW, which is not met in most
    time steps. This applies especially to the Real Policy. It performs better in
    the optimization scenario where more weight is put on it (w = (0.15, 0.15, 0.7)).
    The local characteristics of Laja Lake and its stakeholders, the national water
    law in Chile, and the stakeholder negotiation that took place are very specific
    and site-related frameworks for this case study. Nevertheless, the results show
    a clear added value when comparing the results of optimization with those of stakeholder
    negotiation. Optimization can clearly identify conflicts within a stakeholder
    group and reveal new alliances between stakeholders. Finding points of common
    interest can help in negotiations to understand each other better and to foster
    good and trusting relationships in the long term. However, the results show that
    the exploration of the set of Pareto optimal solutions can lead to very different
    results. Deciding on one best solution is therefore a rather difficult task. Accordingly,
    the optimization and its results should be used to inform or guide, not to replace,
    negotiations. CONCLUSION Listen This study was conducted to investigate whether
    optimization strategies can help to find fair and feasible solutions for reservoir
    operation under conflicting water demands. A combined approach was used to generate
    operational rules for Laja Lake in Chile. The results showed that finding equitable
    operating rule curves for multi-purpose reservoirs remains a challenging task
    for water managers. The SOP cannot fulfil it. On the other hand, the stakeholder
    negotiations have led to a good agreement. It helps to fill the Laja Lake reservoir
    and at the same time provides sufficient water for the agricultural sector. The
    high level of the lake, in turn, leads to good results for HP Abanico. Optimization
    has produced even better results in terms of system resilience and the reliability
    of HP El Toro. At the same time, the performance evaluation indices for the other
    objectives studied are close to those of the Real Policy. A higher reliability
    of HP El Toro comes at the cost of a lower lake level. Finally, the release policy
    resulting from the optimization is not yet a general solution, since only 5 years
    of data were available for the study. In addition to water allocation, another
    important factor in the negotiations was transparency through data sharing. Ultimately,
    this also led to increased trust between the stakeholders. The optimization strategy
    presented here can support transparency already during the negotiation process.
    It can be used to show and explore different scenarios, highlighting the advantages
    and disadvantages for one group or the other. The process can be improved by adding
    new users and objectives, such as lake replenishment. Given the changing climate,
    it appears that adaptive management rules for Laja Lake seem inevitable. The last
    negotiation process took 3 years. To speed up future negotiations, it is recommended
    to use an optimization-simulation model, as presented in this study. A more complex
    hydrological model is required for applying the tool for future periods with simulated
    hydro-meteorological inputs. Examining different scenarios from the Pareto optimal
    front also increases transparency, as it allows the immediate exploration of the
    advantages and disadvantages of different strategies for all parties involved.

  description: Cascade pumping stations (CPS) consume a large amount of energy every
    year in lifting districts. To obtain a reasonable and feasible operation scheme
    for CPS, this paper proposes an optimal operation model for CPS based on simulations.
    A one-dimensional unsteady flow model of open canals was coupled with the optimal
    operation model of CPS, and an energy-dominated optimization was proposed with
    the water level of the inlet pool as the coordinated variable. The optimization
    model was solved by using the catch-up method and the nondominated sorted genetic
    algorithm II (NSGA-II). The optimal operation method was validated and implemented
    in the first-stage and second-stage pumping stations of the Zuncun Irrigation
    Project by lifting water from the Yellow River in Shanxi province. The results
    showed that the proposed optimization model can reduce the energy consumption
    of the CPS by 4% compared with the actual operation. In addition, the optimal
    operation model of the CPS coupled with simulation can realize the dynamic balance
    of flow by stabilizing the inlet pool level to operate within a safe range. The
    energy consumption of the CPS can be reduced by keeping the water level of the
    intake pool as high a level as possible.

    (CPSIP) plays a pivotal role in agricultural production in China by effectively
    addressing the issue of agricultural water consumption resulting from topographical
    elevation differences (Ma et al., 2020). The CPSIP consists of cascade pumping
    stations (CPS), water transmission and distribution canals and gates. Through
    pumping stations (PS) at all stages, water is lifted from low-lying areas to high-lying
    areas for irrigation. During the operation of the CPSIP, maintaining a flow balance
    between stages while meeting interstage irrigation demands is crucial. However,
    achieving accurate control is difficult because the units of CPS and gates are
    operated solely through human decision-making by dispatchers. As a result, several
    potential problems, such as increased energy consumption and water waste, occur
    frequently (Bonvin et al., 2017). Therefore, it is necessary to carry out research
    on the optimal operation of CPS (Chen et al., 2021; De Ocampo & Dadios, 2017;
    Kabulov et al., 2020). Numerous researchers have conducted studies on the optimal
    operation of CPS. Gao et al. (1990) employed dynamic programming to optimize the
    operation of Dayudu CPS, achieving 7.6% energy savings by using the storage volume
    of the diversion canal and sedimentation tank to address flow matching issues
    between PS. As the number of CPS stages increases, the concept of large-scale
    system governance is incorporated into the framework of optimal operation (Zhang
    et al., 2019). Based on this concept, the irrigation planning process of CPS at
    different decision-making levels can be effectively delineated through the establishment
    of a three-tier decomposition-coordination model (Gong & Cheng, 2018). Furthermore,
    by optimizing water distribution among different time periods and irrigation areas
    (Jiang et al., 2019), crop planting layout, irrigation methods (Bai et al., 2022),
    pump station water-lifting rates, daily operating times and quantities of units
    (Perea et al., 2020), water demand and energy costs can be minimized while meeting
    irrigation water requirements. Most current studies do not consider the water
    transmission canals between PS. The water transmission process through open canals
    (WTPOC) exhibits a time delay in irrigation districts (Clemmens et al., 2017;
    Savari & Monem, 2022). When the operational state of the units of the upper-stage
    PS or water distribution flow rates are adjusted, the change in flow may take
    several hours to propagate to the upper-stage PS (Diniz et al., 2015). However,
    previous optimizations neglected this process, resulting in mismatches between
    the lift and flow of the upper-stage PS in the optimization scheme and the actual
    operation (Kong et al., 2023). Furthermore, in practical operation, the water
    level in the inlet pool of PS must be maintained within a certain safe operating
    range (Kong et al., 2019). The operation operator of PS regulates units based
    on artificially observed water conditions or changes in inlet pool water levels,
    with the aim of achieving interstage flow balance to the greatest possible extent,
    regardless of the energy consumption or the number of pump units switched. To
    solve such problems, several data-driven methods have been used for optimizing
    PS operation in water transfer projects, using big data analysis to determine
    the optimal start times for upper-stage PS after canal transportation to achieve
    flow balance (Liu et al., 2022; Yan et al., 2023). Unlike in water transfer projects,
    in irrigation districts, CPS need to meet interstage water demands in addition
    to supplying water to upper-stage PS (Wan et al., 2023). Moreover, the variation
    in the water distribution flow rate during irrigation seasons also needs to be
    considered. Therefore, data-driven methods for applying cascade pump station irrigation
    districts (CPSID) are challenging. In addition, one-dimensional unsteady flow
    simulation models have been introduced into the optimal operation of CPS, where
    the optimized solutions are validated through simulations in which solutions are
    selected with matching water levels for pump unit operation, facilitating the
    adoption of optimized solutions by schedulers (Gong & Cheng, 2018). Therefore,
    if the simulation can accurately simulate the lifting water process at cascade
    pumping stations (LWPCPS) and optimize the PS operation through the simulation
    results, the actual operation of the CPS in the irrigation district can be effectively
    guided. In this paper, an optimal operation model based on simulation was proposed
    for the CPSID model, which combines a one-dimensional unsteady flow simulation
    model and an optimal operation model. In this model, the water level of the inlet
    pool of the PS, which is strongly influenced by the WTPOC and the operation states
    of PS units, is taken as the coordinated variable. Through the data interaction
    between the simulation model and the optimization model, a reasonable and feasible
    daily optimal operation scheme for the PS is obtained. The water distribution
    control strategy was incorporated into the simulation model to regulate the opening
    of the water diversion gates based on the simulated real-time water levels at
    the water distribution outlets, ensuring an adequate irrigation water supply.
    In the optimization model, the energy consumption of the PS was prioritized as
    the main optimization objective, while the total number of pump unit switchings
    that affect equipment wear and human input was considered as a secondary optimization
    objective. The nondominated sorted genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) was used for
    solving the model. The method proposed in this paper aims to reduce energy consumption
    and operational costs in lifting water while ensuring flow balance between CPS.
    2 MODEL CONSTRUCTION 2.1 Simulation model of CPSID A simulation model was constructed
    to simulate the LWPCPS and WTPOC by using the one-dimensional Saint-Venant equation
    and pump performance curves. 2.1.1 Simulation module of LWPCPS The performance
    curves of pump units serve as comprehensive representations of various operational
    parameters. During field operations, notable disparities may exist between the
    observed performance parameters and the manufacturer''s specifications provided.
    A more precise approximation of the pump head, flow rate and energy consumption
    was achieved to accurately simulate actual conditions by fitting these curves
    with operational data. In this study, the flow head performance curve of pump
    units was fitted using the least squares method, and the fitted expression is
    as follows: (1) where H is the actual operating head of the pump (m); Q is the
    flow rate of the pump (m3/s); and a, b and c are coefficient constants. The performance
    curve of the pump and the characteristic curve of the pipeline were combined to
    solve the actual operating point of the pump unit. The formula is as follows:
    (2) (3) (4) where Hst is the static head of the pump station (m); S is the impedance
    of the pipeline; and Zout and Zin are the water levels of the outlet and inlet
    pool of the pump station (m), respectively. 2.1.2 Simulation module of WTPOC The
    one-dimensional surface flow model, based on the Saint-Venant equation, is extensively
    employed in open-canal water transmission systems, and its solution results are
    considered to accurately reflect the water conveyance process (Lu et al., 2018;
    Qiao et al., 2021). In this paper, a canal water flow propulsion model was constructed
    based on the Saint-Venant equations, and the canal flow was regarded as a one-dimensional
    open-canal flow to simulate the spatial-temporal changes in discharge and water
    level in the canal. Continuity equation: (5) Momentum equation: (6) where A is
    the area of the overflow section (m2); t is the calculation time (s); x is the
    length in the flow direction (m); Q is the overflow flow rate (m3/s); ql is the
    flow rate of the side inflow per unit length (m3/s); u is the average flow velocity
    of the section (m/s); g is the acceleration of gravity (m/s2); Z is the water
    level (m); n is the coefficient of roughness; and R is the hydraulic radius (m).
    For distribution canals, it is necessary to calculate the outlet flow rate based
    on the formula for gate flow. This calculated flow rate is then employed as a
    boundary condition in the Saint-Venant equations to simulate the WTPOC. The research
    employed the conventional flow rate formula from the Hydraulic Calculation Manual
    (Li, 2006) to calculate the flow rate through the water distribution canal gate,
    with the gate sill being treated according to the approach of a broad-crested
    weir. When e/H ≤ 0.65, the flow rate over the gate is calculated using the orifice
    flow formula: (7) where Q is the flow through the gate (m3/s); μ0 is the flow
    coefficient; e is the gate opening (m); n is the number of gate holes; b is the
    net width of each hole of the gate (m); and H0 is the water level upstream of
    the gate (m). When e/H > 0.65, the flow rate over the gate is calculated using
    the weir flow formula: (8) where σs is the coefficient of submergence; σc is the
    side contraction coefficient; and m is the flow coefficient. The Preissmann method
    is the most widely applied implicit finite difference method and is renowned for
    its simplicity, high accuracy, excellent numerical stability, good convergence
    properties and strong practicality (Shayannejad et al., 2022). The model employs
    the Preissmann four-point eccentric implicit scheme for discretizing the Saint-Venant
    equation and utilizes the catch-up method to solve it, thereby enabling the determination
    of water level and discharge values at different time intervals. 2.2 Optimal operation
    model of CPS 2.2.1 Objective function In CPSID, the energy consumption of PS is
    a critical factor affecting the operational costs of irrigation management units.
    Reducing energy consumption is one of the primary tasks in optimizing the operation
    of a PS. Furthermore, reducing the number of pump unit switchings can facilitate
    operational management and maintenance. Frequent switching can lead to wear and
    tear on the units and may result in considerable surge pressure on the connected
    pipelines (Makaremi et al., 2017). The less frequent the pump switches are, the
    lower the maintenance costs (Torregrossa & Capitanescu, 2019). Therefore, the
    model established the following objective function: Objective Function 1: Minimize
    the energy consumption of the CPS. (9) where E is the power consumption of the
    PS (KW·h); SD is the number of time slots, and a day is divided into 24 time slots
    according to the time-sharing tariff; JZ is the total number of units contained
    in the PS at this stage; ρ is the density of water, which is taken to be 1.0 × 103 kg/m3;
    g is the acceleration of gravity, which is taken to be 9.81 m/s2; Qj,k is the
    water-lifting flow rate of the kth unit in the jth time slot in this stage of
    PS (𝑚3/𝑠); Hj is the head of the PS in this stage in the jth time period (m);
    δj,k denotes the switching state of the kth unit in the jth time period, which
    is 1 for on time and 0 for off time; and Tj,k denotes the on-time operation length
    of the kth unit in the jth time period (h). Objective Function 2: Optimal number
    of pump unit switchings. (10) where TI is the sum of the number of pump unit switchings;
    the other parameters are the same as above. 2.2.2 Decision variables and constraints
    In this optimal operation model for the PS, the decision variables are selected
    as the on–off state of the pumping units. In the ‘on’ state, the operating angle
    and speed of the units are set to the installation angle and rated speed, respectively.
    The model considers the inlet pool of the PS reservoir as a small-scale regulating
    reservoir, with fluctuations in the inlet pool water level being the optimization
    variables. During the optimization process, several constraints are imposed: (1)
    The total daily water-pumping volume of the PS should meet the minimum pumping
    requirements (Equation 11). (2) The water level in the inlet pool of the PS should
    remain within the range of the minimum safe level (Equation 12). (3) To ensure
    the safety of the inlet pool, the rate of water level fluctuations in the inlet
    pool should be limited to within 0.5 m/h (Equation 13). (4) The units should operate
    in the high-efficiency range (above 90% of the maximum efficiency) (Equation 14).
    (5) The outflow from the PS should be less than the maximum outflow capacity of
    the PS (Equation 15). (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) where Wob is the target total amount
    of water lifted (m3); ΣWsd is the total amount of water lifted during the optimization
    time (m3); Zin,j is the water level of the intake pool during the j time period
    (m); Zin,min and Zin,max are the minimum water level and the maximum safe limiting
    water level of the intake pool (m); η is the operating efficiency of the unit;
    Qk is the outflow from the kth unit (m3/s); and Qmax is the design maximum outflow
    capacity of the PS (m3/s). 2.2.3 Optimization and solution algorithm It is worth
    noting that the energy consumption of PS and the number of pump unit switchings
    are two conflicting objective functions that cannot simultaneously achieve their
    optimal values. Previous research has typically limited the total number of switches
    for each pump unit and optimized the problem based on the total number of switches
    for all pumps in the PS. Usually, single-objective optimization is repeated for
    different numbers of pump switch counts to strike a balance between two factors
    (López-Ibáñez et al., 2008). In this study, the primary objective function prioritizes
    the energy consumption of the PS, while the total number of pump units switches
    is used as a secondary objective function. The multiobjective genetic algorithm
    was employed for solving this problem. As heuristic algorithms, multiobjective
    genetic algorithms enable global search and provide a Pareto front under different
    priorities (i.e. the optimal solution set for each objective) (Fan et al., 2023;
    Gong & Zhu, 2022; Xu & Bai, 2019). When using multiobjective optimization, the
    total number of switching for each pump is not restricted, allowing the determination
    of the lowest energy consumption for different start-stop counts simultaneously
    within the Pareto front. This approach provides irrigation managers with a range
    of feasible scheduling options. The solution process of NSGA-II is as follows:
    (1) Initialization: Start by generating an initial set of individuals to randomly
    create the initial population. Fitness Evaluation: Calculate the fitness values
    for each individual based on multiple objective functions. Non-dominated sorting
    is performed to categorize individuals into different non-dominated fronts, and
    the crowding distance is computed to maintain diversity within each front. (2)
    Selection: Use non-dominated sorting and crowding distance to select parent individuals
    for crossover and mutation operations. Generate new individuals through these
    genetic operators. (3) Merging and re-evaluation: Combine the new individuals
    with the current population; then, perform non-dominated sorting and crowding
    distance calculations again to prepare for the selection of the next generation.
    (4) Environmental selection: From the merged population, individuals with higher
    fitness values are selected while considering non-dominated fronts and crowding
    distances. (5) Termination criterion: The above steps are repeated iteratively
    until the termination criterion is met. This could be a predefined number of generations
    or convergence criterion. (6) Output: At the end of the process, NSGA-II outputs
    a set of non-dominated individuals representing different levels of Pareto-optimal
    solutions. These individuals provide a range of approximate optimal solutions
    for the multiobjective optimization problem. 2.3 Optimal operation model based
    on simulation The simulation model of the CPSID was integrated with the optimal
    operation model of the PS in this study. By leveraging the interaction between
    these two sets of data, we constructed an optimal operation model for the PS that
    incorporates the inflow process, thereby achieving dynamic coupling between flow
    movement and PS operation. As illustrated in Figure 1, the simulation process
    begins by generating an initial operation scheme for the PS through optimization
    scheduling of the PS. The simulation model of the CPSID simulates hydraulic factors
    such as the water level and flow of the canal according to the operation scheme
    of the PS and the water distribution scheme of the canal, obtains the flow arrival
    process of the next-stage PS and calculates the target value (energy consumption
    of water lifting, times of start and stop) under the operation scheme. Second,
    the optimal operation model of the PS accepts the target value and gives a new
    optimization scheme through the optimization algorithm, which is passed into the
    simulation model of the CPS for calculation and repeated until the end conditions
    are met; finally, the optimization scheme results are obtained. FIGURE 1 Open

    model for cascade pumping stations. 3 APPLICATION CASE 3.1 Introduction to irrigation
    district The Zuncun Irrigation District is a CPSID for which water is lifted from
    the Yellow River in Shanxi province; this system integrates flood control, drainage
    and irrigation. Water from the Yellow River is transported to farmlands through
    CPS and through water transmission and distribution opening canals. The irrigation
    district is currently equipped with nine CPS, with a total installed capacity
    of 61,400 kW. The design head is 165.44 m, and the lifting flow rate is 46.50 m3/s.
    It is a typical CPSID with open canals. This study used the first-stage pumping
    station (FSPS), second-stage pumping station (SSPS) and first main canal (MC1)
    as the research objects to verify and simulate the established model. The FSPS
    is equipped with 9 units, with a total installed capacity of 6665 kW, all of which
    are axial-flow pumps; the SSPS is equipped with 18 units, with a total installed
    capacity of 17,200 kW, all of which are centrifugal pumps. MC1 starts from the
    outlet of the FSPS and extends to the inlet of the SSPS, for a total length of
    15.6 km. The cross section of MC1 is a trapezoid with an arc bottom. There are
    a total of 5 branch canals and 11 lateral canals in MC1, for which the effective
    irrigation area is 4025 ha. The parameters of MC1 are shown in Table 1, and the
    installed parameters of the PS are shown in Table 2. The data were sourced from
    the Zuncun Yellow River Irrigation Service Centre in Yuncheng City, Shanxi province

    Overview map of research area. 3.2 Simulation model application To ensure the
    reliability of the constructed optimal operation model based on simulation, we
    first validated the simulation module of the LWPCPS built in Section 2. We used
    the basic information of the irrigation district from Section 11 and the actual
    operational data within the study area from 5:00 AM on 27 June 2021 to 8:00 AM
    the next day as input data and evaluated and analysed the simulation results of
    the model. The measured data were provided by the Zuncun Yellow River Irrigation
    Service Centre in Yuncheng City, Shanxi province, and included the operational
    status of each unit, the PS and the water distribution for each hour. The initial
    operational status of the FSPS was as follows: Units 3, 4 and 5 were in the open
    state; the total lifting flow of the PS was 19.00 m3/s; and the diversion flow
    of Branch Canal 0 at Station 13 + 100 was 0.26 m3/s. The initial operational status
    of the SSPS was as follows: Units 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 16 were in the
    open state, and the lifting flow was 20.69 m3/s. During operation, the number
    of pump unit switchings for the FSPS was 7, and for the SSPS, it was 11. The recorded
    operations of operators at the FSPS and the SSPS, as well as the interval water
    diversion flow rates from 5 AM on 27 June 2021 to 8 AM the next day, are shown
    in Table 3. TABLE 3. Actual dispatching strategies for pump stations on 27 June

    to the characteristics of the CPSID, the upper boundary was established by representing
    the flow boundary through the discharge flow process of the FSPS, while the lower
    boundary was defined by the flow-depth boundary. Additionally, within this model,
    the water distribution processes at specific locations serve as internal boundaries.
    Figures 3-6 show the results of the water-lifting flow of the FSPS and SSPS and
    the water level process of the SSPS. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    in inlet pool of second-stage pumping station. The performance curve of the units,
    fitted using the measured data, demonstrates an accurate simulation of the water-pumping
    process, as depicted in Figure 3. The observed values of the LWPCPS in the FSPS
    are consistent with the simulated results of the model, yielding a fitting determination
    coefficient (R2) of 0.845 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.942. In the
    model, the water-lifting flow is recalculated according to the different heads
    of each period, making the results closer to reality than those obtained with
    a fixed head. The simulation results of the water-lifting process of the SSPS
    are shown in Figure 4, where the fitted R2 is 0.905 and the RMSE is 0.875, which
    confirms the reliability of the established simulation of the water-lifting process.
    Figure 5 shows the flow process at the water distribution points. Due to the addition
    of the control measures of the sluice gate in the simulation, the model adjusts
    the opening of the sluice gate according to the real-time water level to meet
    the water distribution flow. The process of water distribution flow in 1 day is
    basically maintained at the average level of the total water distribution flow
    on that day. During the simulation period, the observed water distribution flow
    process closely aligns with the modelled water distribution flow process. The
    fitted R2 is 0.827, and the RMSE is 0.866. Figure 6 shows the water level process
    of the inlet pool at the SSPS. Since the water level of the inlet pool at the
    SSPS is strongly affected by the inflow process of the canal and the SSPS water-lifting
    process, it is difficult to accurately simulate the change in the inlet pool water
    level. The fitted R2 is 0.501, and the RMSE is 0.579; however, the trends of the
    simulated and observed values are basically the same, and the simulation results
    are reasonable, so the results can be used for research. In general, the simulation
    of the LWPCPS and the WTPOC constructed by the model can reflect the actual operation
    process of the CPSID. The lift and discharge of the upper-stage PS after adding
    the WTPOC are closer to the actual operation lift and flow. Therefore, the simulation
    model can provide preview support for subsequent optimization schemes. 3.3 Application
    of optimal operation model based on simulation The optimal operation model and
    simulation model constructed in Section 9 was applied to the study area. The actual
    startup scheme of the FSPS units and the water distribution scheme on 27 June
    2021 were used as boundary conditions. The objective was to optimize the operation
    scheme of the SSPS, aiming to reduce energy consumption and the number of pump
    unit switchings. The results of the model optimization are compared with the optimization
    results without considering the water transmission process through open canals
    (No-WTPOC) and the actual operation results. This comparative analysis was conducted
    to assess the optimization effectiveness of the comprehensive model constructed
    in this study. The constructed model is used to optimize the actual operation
    plan of the SSPS on 27 June 2021. According to the control range of the inlet
    pool controlled by the dispatcher on that day, the water level of the inlet pool
    of the control in the model fluctuates within 0.5 m of the initial water level
    on that day. Additionally, the pumping capacity of the SSPS should not fall below
    166.5 × 104 m3. The NSGA-II parameter settings used are shown in Table 4. TABLE
    4. Parameter settings of non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II).

    F9 from right to left as shown in Figure 7. FIGURE 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    Pareto front. Figure 8 shows the water level change process in the inlet pool
    of the SSPS under these three methods. Notably, the No-WTPOC method assumes that
    the pumping head of the PS is fixed during optimization. When the scheme was input
    into the simulation system, the flow imbalance was caused by a lack of consideration
    of the incoming water process. As shown in Figure 8, the water level in the inlet
    pool of the SSPS varies greatly beyond the safe operating range. In contrast,
    considering the simulation optimization method and the actual operation scheme,
    the water level fluctuation range of the inlet pool is within the control range,
    and the water level change gradient per hour is within the control range. This
    is because in actual operation, the dispatcher adjusts units according to the
    water level of the inlet pool to meet the flow balance. Similarly, the optimization
    model optimizes the scheme that meets the constraint conditions according to the
    simulation results to achieve flow balance so that the final scheme can also run
    safely. FIGURE 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison of water levels in
    inlet pool of secondary pumping station under different optimization methods.

    The energy consumption of water lifting of the actual operation scheme is 207,200 kW·h,
    as depicted in Figure 8 and Table 5. However, after implementing the optimization
    scheme, the energy consumption ranges from 198,756 to 199,870 kW·h, representing
    a reduction of 3.5%–4.1% compared to the actual operation scheme. Remarkably,
    even with an equal number of start and stop times, the operation energy consumption
    is still reduced by 4.1%. The optimization algorithm yields a lower energy consumption
    operation scheme globally under the same conditions than does the human decision
    scheme. TABLE 5. Comparison between actual and optimized solutions. Solutions

    4.1% −9% The energy consumption is inversely related to the number of pump unit
    switchings. In the Pareto solution set, the number of pump unit switchings reaches
    the highest value in the lowest energy consumption scheme. It can be observed
    that the optimized scheme generally results in less pump unit switching than in
    actual practice. However, when the switching number of pump units were more than
    eight times, even with adjustments made to water extraction during each period,
    there was only a marginal reduction in energy consumption. This indicates that
    within the controlled range of total water withdrawal and daily water inlet levels,
    the minimum achievable level for optimizing energy consumption is approximately
    198,892 kW·h. Under the constraint of the floating range of the water level of
    the inlet pool, the energy consumption of the unit in the F9 scheme is the lowest.
    The switching strategy involves maintaining the water level of the inlet pool
    at a high water level as much as possible and reducing energy consumption by reducing
    the lift head of the PS; however, the number of pump unit switchings will also
    increase with fluctuations in the incoming water. The unit energy consumption
    of the F1 scheme is the highest compared with that of the other schemes, and the
    number of pump unit switchings is only three. It is important to highlight that
    the start-stop strategy for F1 does not manifest as adjusting the units only when
    the water level reaches the constrained threshold (i.e. maintaining the original
    unit operation within the constraint range and adjusting the units when the water
    level is about to reach the threshold). Instead, it searches all the schemes that
    meet the constraints globally and selects the minimum number of pump unit switchings
    that can keep the water level within a feasible range for a long time. According
    to the optimization results, there is no scheme with zero pump unit switchings,
    possibly because if the unit operation is kept constant, depending on the incoming
    water, the level of the inlet pool will exceed the constrained water level range,
    resulting in a flow imbalance that will be left out of the evolutionary process.
    In each optimization scheme, the water level of the inlet pool is generally higher
    than that of the actual scheme, while the energy consumption of the optimized
    scheme is lower than that of the actual scheme, which also indicates that reducing
    the operating head of the PS can reduce its energy consumption to a certain extent.
    In general, the optimal operation model based on the simulation established in
    this paper comprehensively considers the impact of canal water delivery and pump
    station control strategies on achieving flow balance between stages. By optimizing
    the operational units of the SSPS, it is observed that the fluctuation range of
    the water level remains within the control limits, and the optimization reduces
    the operational energy consumption and the number of pump unit switchings. Considering
    that the main goal is to achieve the lowest energy consumption, switching the
    number of pump units is used as an auxiliary optimization goal. According to the
    optimization results, F4 reduces the energy consumption by 4.0% and reduces the
    number of pump unit switchings by 46%. Therefore, we choose F4 as the optimal
    scheme, and the results are shown in Table 6. Of course, the Pareto solution of
    the optimization gives the lowest energy consumption of the operation scheme under
    the respective number of pump unit switchings, and the administrator can also
    compare the schemes according to the actual situation. TABLE 6. Optimal control

    1:00–8:00 1#3#5#9#11#12#16# 4 DISCUSSION The proposed method in this study considered
    the dynamic balance between the LWPCPS and the WTPOC. The optimization model was
    constructed by integrating the simulation model of the CPSID and the optimal operation
    model of the CPS. Under the conditions of satisfying both the water distribution
    demands and the flow balance between stages, the proposed unit operation scheme
    can optimize energy consumption. The inclusion of the simulation model makes the
    optimization scheduling model for the CPS more readily acceptable to dispatchers.
    During irrigation, when there are changes in the operation state of the units
    or during the water distribution process, the water flow process from the upper-stage
    PS will also change. This change does not occur simultaneously with regulation
    but requires a certain amount of transmission time. The previous optimization
    schemes, such as the No-WTPOC scheme, will inevitably result in a mismatch of
    flow between the upper-stage and lower-stage PS, endangering the safe operation
    of the PS. From the research results in Figure 8, it is evident that the water
    level in the SSPS inlet reservoir varies significantly under this scheme. In practical
    terms, such an operational plan would be deemed unacceptable. Therefore, this
    study integrated the simulation model with the optimization model. The ability
    of the simulation model to simulate water flow and pumping processes continuously
    increases the understanding of the incoming water process in the upper-stage PS.
    The optimization results also reveal that the flow between the upper-stage and
    lower-stage PS can achieve dynamic balance. This finding is consistent with the
    conclusion that the optimized scheme was put into the simulation model for verification
    (Gong & Cheng, 2018). As evident from the results in Figures 3 and 4, the LWPCPS
    is more representative of the actual conditions. By introducing the multiobjective
    optimization model into the PS optimization scheduling model, the dispatcher can
    flexibly choose the operation scheme. In this study, the objective function was
    reconsidered. The traditional model was a single-objective optimization model
    constructed by setting the number of pump units to be switched into constraints.
    In contrast, this paper constructed a multiobjective optimization model by considering
    the number of pump unit switchings as the secondary optimization goal. The Pareto
    frontier solution set is obtained using a genetic algorithm, aiming to flexibly
    guide the daily operation of pump station dispatchers. The optimized solution
    set can yield the lowest energy consumption scheme under different unit switching
    compared to the traditional model. For example, in this case, the optimization
    model provides nine different options. Among these options, several can significantly
    reduce the wear of the unit caused by the number of pump unit switchings without
    significantly increasing energy consumption, for instance, the F1 scheme, which
    has only three switches, for which the energy consumption increases by only 7330 kW·h.
    When the maintenance cost of units and personnel operation costs, when converted,
    are significantly higher than the electricity cost, this scheme becomes the preferred
    choice for dispatch operators. There are also several schemes with relatively
    higher start-stop frequencies but with a significant reduction in energy consumption,
    such as the F9 scheme. By judiciously managing the water level of the pump station
    inlet pool, it is possible to mitigate unit wear, reduce energy consumption and
    alleviate the workload of management personnel. The optimization process selects
    the water level of the inlet pool of the PS as the coordinated variable. Treating
    the inlet pool as a small regulating reservoir enables achieving a two-stage flow
    balance by adjusting its water level. If the water level in the inlet pool needs
    to be maintained at maximum stability, frequent opening and stopping procedures
    should be implemented at the PS. However, if the water level in the inlet pool
    can fluctuate within a certain safe range, significant reductions in the frequency
    of opening and stopping operations at the PS can be achieved (Kong et al., 2019).
    In this study, water level fluctuations within 0.5 m of the initial level on the
    same day were controlled in the inlet pool. From the perspective of the optimization
    results, both the energy consumption and the number of pump units switched within
    an appropriate and acceptable range. Among the different PS, dispatch operators
    can reasonably adjust the fluctuation range of the influent inlet pool for each
    PS based on their characteristics, thereby achieving flow balance with smaller
    unit switching frequencies. According to the optimized result, the water level
    of the inlet pool of the scheme with lower energy consumption is basically maintained
    at a high level, as exemplified by F9. This also shows that it is energy-saving
    to keep the water level of the inlet pool as high as possible to reduce the lifting
    head. There is still room for optimization in the selection of algorithms. This
    study employs the fundamental NSGA-II to address this problem. While effectively
    identifying solutions and ensuring diversity in multiobjective optimization, NSGA-II
    still encounters challenges such as premature convergence and insufficient exploration
    of the solution space when dealing with complex models. In this paper, only the
    secondary station is optimized, while the water-lifting scheme and water distribution
    process of the primary station remain unchanged. The SSPS consists of four different
    types of units. The optimization period is discretized into 24 intervals, with
    decision variables limited to two states: ‘on’ and ‘off’. The solution is relatively
    simple, so the optimization results are ideal. However, in cases where the optimization
    cycle is prolonged and there is an increased number of pump stations, it becomes
    imperative to judiciously configure parameters such as crossover, variation and
    population size to enhance the global search capability. Failure to do so may
    lead to premature convergence and consequently yield suboptimal results during
    the optimization process. Although this study only applied the proposed model
    to the Zuncun Irrigation District, the proposed methodology remains applicable
    to other CPSID. The model proposed in this study consists of a simulation model
    of the CPSID and an optimal operation model of the CPS. For the simulation model
    of the CPSID, the WTPOC is constructed using the Saint-Venant equations. With
    respect to different open-canal cross-sectional shapes and inflow conditions for
    the PS, adjustments can be made by modifying the fundamental data and boundary
    conditions. The LWPCPS is modelled based on the characteristic curves of the PS
    itself. Commonly used centrifugal pumps and axial-flow pumps in irrigation areas
    are both applicable. 5 CONCLUSION This study proposes an optimization scheduling
    method for PS based on simulation modelling. In the optimization process, simulation
    deduction is incorporated to obtain scheduling schemes that satisfy flow balance.
    The proposed method was tested in a water-lifting irrigation area in China, and
    the results indicate that the model is capable of simulating the actual operational
    status of the irrigation area. The water-lifting process at the pump station and
    the trend of the changes in the inlet pool water level closely resemble real-world
    conditions. Compared to existing optimization scheduling methods, the optimal
    operation approach based on simulation can more effectively achieve flow balance.
    Furthermore, when state transitions occur in the lower-level pump station units
    or when changes in water distribution occur, the fluctuations in the inlet pool
    water level at the upper-level pump station remain within the controlled range.
    The optimized approach is also more likely to be practically adopted and applied.
    Compared to the actual scheduling schemes implemented by dispatch operators, the
    optimization approach results in a 4% reduction in energy consumption. Overall,
    the model developed in this study is rational and versatile, allowing for its
    application in other CPSID. This application has the potential to enhance both
    the energy efficiency of PS and the overall operational management proficiency.

  description: 'Sustainable rice farming practices are urgently needed to meet increasing
    food demand, cope with water scarcity, and mitigate climate change. Traditional
    farming methods that prioritize a single objective, such as increasing crop yield,
    reducing irrigation water consumption, or minimizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,
    have proven to be insufficient. Simultaneously optimizing multiple competing rice
    farming objectives remains less explored. The present study aimed to increase
    current rice yield, reduce irrigation water consumption, and tackle the dilemma
    to reduce GHG (CH4 and N2O) emissions at once. Using a heuristic and holistic
    method, we optimized farm management, focusing on irrigation regimes, sowing window,
    fertilization rate, tillage depth, and their interactions. We calibrated and validated
    the process-based DeNitrification–DeComposition (DNDC) model with 5 years of eddy
    covariance observations in a rice paddy site. The DNDC model was integrated with
    a Pareto-based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) to solve the
    multi-objective optimization problem. Results show that current farm management
    practices have failed to achieve the potential yield and imposed high environmental
    costs in the form of water use (604–810 mm/yr) and GHG emissions (CH4: 186–220
    kg C/ha/yr; N2O: 0.3–1.6 kg C/ha/yr). By contrast, our new approach suggested

    Highlights • Multi-objective optimization of rice production via Pareto fronts
    computed with NSGA-III. • Coupled with process model DNDC to calculate yield,
    water use, CH4 and N2O emissions. • Increased rice yield is achievable with reduced
    irrigation and greenhouse gas emissions. Abstract Sustainable rice farming practices
    are urgently needed to meet increasing food demand, cope with water scarcity,
    and mitigate climate change. Traditional farming methods that prioritize a single
    objective, such as increasing crop yield, reducing irrigation water consumption,
    or minimizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, have proven to be insufficient.
    Simultaneously optimizing multiple competing rice farming objectives remains less
    explored. The present study aimed to increase current rice yield, reduce irrigation
    water consumption, and tackle the dilemma to reduce GHG (CH4 and N2O) emissions
    at once. Using a heuristic and holistic method, we optimized farm management,
    focusing on irrigation regimes, sowing window, fertilization rate, tillage depth,
    and their interactions. We calibrated and validated the process-based DeNitrification–DeComposition
    (DNDC) model with 5 years of eddy covariance observations in a rice paddy site.
    The DNDC model was integrated with a Pareto-based non-dominated sorting genetic
    algorithm (NSGA-III) to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. Results
    show that current farm management practices have failed to achieve the potential
    yield and imposed high environmental costs in the form of water use (604–810 mm/yr)
    and GHG emissions (CH4: 186–220 kg C/ha/yr; N2O: 0.3–1.6 kg C/ha/yr). By contrast,
    our new approach suggested that the optimized management could maintain or even
    increase current crop yield to its potential (∼10 t/ha), while reducing irrigation
    demand and GHG emissions by >50 %. Our results suggest that earlier sowing, combined
    with improved irrigation practices, may play a crucial role in maximizing crop
    yield and potentially providing environmental benefits. We found that the optimal
    proportion of non-flooded days was around 54 % of the growing season length, and
    the optimal stage for non-flooding days was the vegetative stage. Our approach
    could further be applied to evaluate the environmental sustainability of farming
    systems under various climate and local conditions, and to guide policymaking
    and farming practices. Graphical abstract Download : Download high-res image (236KB)

    1. Introduction By around 2050, the global population will reach 10 billion, and
    food production will have to be doubled (Ray et al., 2013; Tilman et al., 2011)
    while also achieving carbon neutrality (Flagg, 2015). Rice (Oryza sativa) is a
    vital cereal crop that feeds more than 50 % of the world''s population, and over
    90 % of all rice is cultivated in Asia (Bouman and Tuong, 2001; Dong and Xiao,
    2016). Rice, domesticated from wild grass as a semiaquatic crop in Yangtze Valley,
    China (Fuller et al., 2009; Gross and Zhao, 2014; Li et al., 2006b), has been
    cultivated globally for ∼4000 years in flooded paddies, which recreate the original
    subtropical growing environment, suppress weeds, and maintain yield (Gutaker et
    al., 2020; Zong et al., 2007). However, with traditional anaerobic management,
    rice production consumes ∼40 % of global irrigation water (Lampayan et al., 2015)
    and is responsible for ∼10 % of global anthropogenic methane (Saunois et al.,
    2020). Unfortunately, 4 billion people and many Asian countries that cultivate
    rice already face severe water scarcity (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2016). To slow
    climate warming, numerous countries have committed to achieving carbon neutrality
    within the next few decades. As the largest water consumer in the agricultural
    sector and dominant anthropogenic methane emitter, flooded rice farming is no
    longer sustainable in the face of water scarcity (Gosling and Arnell, 2016), carbon-neutral
    pledges (Flagg, 2015), and global warming (Naylor et al., 2007; Qu et al., 2018;
    Zhao et al., 2017). We urgently need new paradigms for cultivating rice sustainably.
    Considerable research has been conducted on strategies to decrease water consumption
    and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while maintaining grain yield. Altering soil
    redox conditions through drainage management has received significant attention
    (Bo et al., 2022; Kudo et al., 2014; LaHue et al., 2016; Li et al., 2006a; Meijide
    et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2006). A global meta-analysis revealed that non-continuous
    flooding can mitigate CH4 budgets by 53 %, but also substantially increased N2O
    emissions by 105 % and decreased crop yield by 3.6 % (Jiang et al., 2019a). By
    periodically draining paddies, a farming technique known as alternate wetting
    and drying (AWD) can potentially reduce irrigation water requirements by up to
    38 % without negatively impacting crop yields. (Lampayan et al., 2015). Similarly,
    midseason drainage can significantly reduce CH4 emissions (50–53 %) and global
    warming potential (GWP) (46–50 %), but could increase N2O emissions (20–37 %)
    (Haque et al., 2016). Early season drainage also can effectively reduce GWP while
    maintaining crop yield and constraining N2O emissions in a growth chamber experiment
    (Islam et al., 2018). Thus, careful planning of the duration and timing of drainage
    events is crucial to achieve sustainability in rice farming. Mechanistic models
    and field experiments are the main methods used to investigate the effects of
    various water-saving regimes (Chen et al., 2016; Fumoto et al., 2010; Liang et
    al., 2016; Linquist et al., 2015; Minamikawa et al., 2016; Tian et al., 2021).
    AWD is recognized as the most promising water management approach and has been
    adopted in many regions (Ishfaq et al., 2020). Nevertheless, emissions of long-lived
    N2O could also surge (30–45 times) in association with non-continuous flooding
    management (Kritee et al., 2018). Anaerobic decomposition (Neue, 1993) and aerobic
    nitrification processes (Bouwman, 1998) present a challenge to reducing CH4 and
    N2O emissions simultaneously (Li et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2019). In the context
    of rice production systems, while bi-objective optimization problems have been
    thoroughly investigated, few studies have aimed to optimize three or more objectives
    at once. Ensuring sustainability in agriculture requires the management of multiple
    factors (Shang et al., 2021). These farming practices impact sustainability and
    call for a new paradigm that manages them in an integrated manner, including but
    not limited to irrigation events (Jiang et al., 2019a), the type and rate of fertilization
    (Pandey et al., 2021; Zhong et al., 2016), straw addition (Jiang et al., 2019b),
    and tillage depth (Zhao et al., 2020). Adopting a holistic approach could help
    manage the trade-off between conserving water resources and maximizing grain yield,
    as well as reduce CH4 and N2O emissions. Current methods (e.g., AWD) are valuable
    to mitigate negative environmental impacts and achieve socioeconomic benefits
    (Chen et al., 2016; Fumoto et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2016; Linquist et al.,
    2015; Minamikawa et al., 2016; Tian et al., 2021), but relying solely on these
    methods is unlikely to achieve carbon neutrality in the mid of 21st century. Few
    studies have considered the interactions among water regimes, fertilization and
    other farm management options through field experiments or scenario modeling (Kim
    et al., 2014; Towprayoon et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2020). The upper limits of
    irrigated rice farming systems in terms of crop yield, GHG emissions, and water
    consumption remain unclear if integrated management is fully explored. Furthermore,
    determining the optimal solution through field experiments or biogeochemical models
    (e.g., DNDC) while relying on a limited number of numerical experiments becomes
    particularly challenging when faced with the need to balance multiple competing
    objectives. Coupling a process-based model with a Pareto-dominance-based optimization
    algorithm is a promising solution to efficiently resolve multi-objective problems
    (Coleman et al., 2017; Groot et al., 2012; Kropp et al., 2019). In the 19th century,
    the economists Francis Edgeworth and Vilfredo Pareto introduced multi-objective
    optimization (MOO) algorithms (de Weck, 2004). Among the available MOO methods,
    evolutionary algorithms are a state-of-the-art option to approximate the Pareto
    efficiency/front inspired by natural evolution (selection, recombination, and
    mutation) (Emmerich and Deutz, 2018). In general, for process models with widely
    varying combinations of inputs (e.g., farm management variables), the optimization
    algorithm evaluates the model outputs and arrives at a set of solutions that possess
    the optimal values with respect to the target objectives (e.g., crop yield) (Prina
    et al., 2018). The optimal solutions jointly comprise the Pareto front, and none
    of the objectives can be further improved without negatively affecting the others.
    This represents an efficient and powerful method to balance the trade-offs in
    decision-making and planning without the need for sophisticated mathematical equations.
    The present study introduces an interdisciplinary and heuristic approach for designing
    an environmentally sustainable rice farming system. We estimated Pareto fronts
    in the context of CH4 budgets, N2O emissions, irrigation water consumption, and
    crop yield. After extensively validating a wide range of DNDC outputs to examine
    the robustness of the model, we integrated the process-based DNDC model with the
    non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III). By simultaneously managing
    flooding events, fertilization, and other pivotal farm management regimes, our
    new method can help optimize irrigated rice farming systems in terms of food security,
    GHG emissions, and water resources. Finally, we attempted to answer the following
    key questions: I. Can DNDC-NSGA-III optimization increase rice yield with a lower
    irrigation water requirement? II. Can DNDC-NSGA-III optimization reduce CH4 and
    N2O emissions simultaneously? 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Overall design and
    study site Fig. 1 illustrates the comprehensive study design and the proposed
    multi-objective optimization framework. The approach employed in this study encompasses
    eight steps, leading to the attainment of stable Pareto fronts (Fig. 1). 1. DNDC
    calibration: The first step involves calibrating the DNDC model using rice biomass
    and phenology data. 2. Execution with auxiliary information: Weather records and
    additional data such as soil properties are utilized in the execution of the model.
    Supplementary Table. 1 provides detailed parameter values for running the DNDC
    model. 3. Validation: The model''s performance is validated against measurements
    of gross primary productivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET), ecosystem respiration
    (Reco), CH4, crop yield, soil moisture, and soil temperature data. 4. Design constraints
    and random initialization: Variation in farm management is constrained, and random
    parental populations are used as the initial DNDC model inputs. 5. Objective function:
    The DNDC model is executed, and objective function values are obtained. 6. Fitness
    evaluation: Fitness refers to a measure of the performance of a solution and is
    primarily evaluated based on the non-dominated sorting rank. 7. Offspring generation
    and iteration: Based on the ranking of fitness, new offspring are generated through
    selection, crossover, and mutation. These new offspring are subsequently used
    for a new round of DNDC execution. 8. Iteration: The process from step 5 to step
    7 is iterated for ten generations to achieve the Pareto fronts. Download : Download

    and the integrated multi-objective optimization framework. This study was conducted
    using data collected at a rice paddy site (38.2013°N, 127.2505°E), in Cherwon,
    South Korea, which is part of both the Korean Flux Network (KoFlux) and AsiaFlux.
    During the study period (2016–2020), the farmer adopted a single cropping system
    and midseason drainage practice for the early ripening japonica variety “Odae”.
    The site has a temperate monsoon climate. In the last three decades, the annual
    mean air temperature and precipitation were 10.2 °C and 1390 mm, respectively
    (Huang et al., 2018). The growing season typically starts in late April and ends
    in early September. 2.2. DNDC model To assess the impacts of farm management on
    rice yield, GHG emissions, and irrigation requirements, we applied the process-based
    DNDC (version 9.5). The DNDC model is a carbon and nitrogen biogeochemistry model
    developed for agroecosystems that comprises the following core interacting sub-modules:
    thermal-hydraulic, decomposition, denitrification, fermentation, and plant growth
    (Gilhespy et al., 2014; Giltrap et al., 2010; Li et al., 1992). The DNDC can accurately
    predict the emissions of several GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N2O), GPP, Reco, ET, as well
    as crop growth and soil environments, under a wide range of climate conditions
    and farming practices (Chen et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2019;
    Zhao et al., 2020). To properly run the DNDC model, we first calibrated and provided
    soil physicochemical and crop parameters including soil texture (silt clay loam),
    soil organic carbon, bulk density, growing degree days, maximum biomass production,
    and biomass fraction, using data from our previous studies (Huang et al., 2018;
    Hwang et al., 2020). After thoroughly validating DNDC simulations using daily
    and annual field observations (crop yield, CH4, GPP, Reco, ET, Soil moisture,
    Soil temperature), we integrated the model with a MOO algorithm (Section 2.5).
    For a detailed explanation of the DNDC model structure, see Gilhespy et al. (2014).
    2.3. In situ data The in situ data utilized in this study builds upon and complements
    the findings from our prior research (Huang et al., 2018; Hwang et al., 2020;
    Kim et al., 2019). CO2 and CH4 fluxes, latent heat flux, and meteorological data
    including air temperature, precipitation, wind speed, net radiation and humidity
    were recorded at 30-min intervals using an eddy covariance system mounted at a
    10-meter-high tower. The majority of the observed flux originated from the three
    paddy field plots, with only a minor contribution coming from the surrounding
    plots (Hwang et al., 2020). The eddy covariance system comprises the following
    instruments: a three-dimensional sonic anemometer (CSAT3; Campbell Scientific,
    Inc.), a closed path infrared gas analyzer (LI-7200; LI-COR Inc.), an open-path
    CH4 analyzer based on wavelength modulation spectroscopy (LI-7700; LI-COR, Inc.)
    (Hwang et al., 2020). A nighttime method was used to partition CO2 fluxes into
    GPP and Reco. To fill the missing CO2 and CH4 fluxes, we employed the marginal
    distribution sampling method (Reichstein et al., 2005). This approach computes
    the median of CO2 [CH4] flux under comparable meteorological conditions over a
    14-day period and fills in any missing values with this calculated median. The
    30-min GPP (μmol CO2 m−2 s−1) data were aggregated into daily GPP (g C m−2 d−1)
    and annual GPP (kg C ha−1 yr−1) to align with the format used in DNDC model outputs.
    The same method was also applied to Reco, ET, and CH4 fluxes at either daily or
    annual scales. For detailed descriptions of the flux measurement and data processing,
    see Hwang et al. (2020). Soil volumetric water content and temperature were measured
    at 30-min intervals at depths of 0–0.1 m and 0.1–0.2 m, respectively, using four
    soil moisture and temperature sensors (CS655; Campbell Scientific, Inc.). Other
    data, including crop yield, rice phenology, irrigation schedule, and fertilization
    (12.02 g N m−2, with an N/P/K ratio of 18:7:9), were obtained from farming records
    and field measurements (Huang et al., 2018; Hwang et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2019).
    We used a grain carbon content of 0.42 and grain moisture content of 8.35 %, as
    measured by our previous study (Huang et al., 2018), to convert the dry crop yield
    (kg C ha−1) from DNDC to fresh weight format (t ha−1) for comparison with field
    observations. For detailed descriptions of the field study and data processing,
    see Huang et al. (2018). The in-situ records were later used to validate the DNDC
    simulation results at the daily and annual scale. To validate the annual DNDC
    simulation results, we utilized data that had undergone quality control and gap-filling
    using the marginal distribution sampling method, following the KoFlux protocol
    (Hong et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2018). The uncertainty of the annual sum of flux
    was determined by taking into account both random errors and data gaps (Kang et
    al., 2023; Richardson and Hollinger, 2007). To validate the daily DNDC simulation
    results for GPP, Reco, CH4 emissions and ET, we utilized gap-filled data and applied
    a threshold to the observed percentile, set at > 50–55 %. Due to the unclosed
    energy balance issue that commonly affects eddy covariance measurements, we corrected
    the measured ET as follows: ETcorrected = (Rn - G)/(Huncorrected + ETuncorrected)
    × ETuncorrected, where Rn is the net radiation, H is the sensible heat flux, and
    G is the soil heat flux (Jung et al., 2010; Twine et al., 2000). 2.4. Multi-objective
    optimization (MOO) algorithm Scalarization approaches and the Edgeworth-Pareto
    principle are important to solve MOO problems efficiently (Emmerich and Deutz,
    2018; Gunantara, 2018; de Weck, 2004). Scalarization methods, such as the linear
    weighting, Chebyshev distance and ε-constraint methods, are deductive reasoning
    approaches that decompose a multi-objective problem into a single objective by
    assembling objective functions or reconstructing them as constraints. Prior knowledge
    is needed to design the constraints and parameters of the scalarization function.
    In contrast, the Edgeworth-Pareto principle uses inductive reasoning to identify
    the Pareto front/set that contains a series of optimal solutions (so-called Pareto-nondominated
    solutions). In the present study, to allow the algorithm enumerating potential
    optimal solutions on the Pareto front, we adopted the Pareto-based algorithm NSGA-III
    to solve multi-objective (> 3) optimization problems (Deb and Jain, 2014). We
    implemented the NSGA-III algorithm with the Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms
    in Python (DEAP) library (Rainville et al., 2012). Overall, NSGA-III uses a combination
    of non-dominated sorting and reference point-based search to efficiently and effectively
    approach the Pareto front (Deb and Jain, 2014; Jain and Deb, 2014). The overall
    procedures for solving a multi-objective optimization problem with NSGA-III are
    as follows: I. Initialization: NSGA-III starts by creating an initial population
    of candidate solutions. Each solution is represented as a vector of decision variables
    that define the problem. II. Non-dominated sorting: The population is sorted into
    different levels of non-dominated solutions, where the first level contains the
    best non-dominated solutions, the second level contains the next best solutions,
    and so on. This is done by comparing the objective values of each solution to
    the others in the population. III. Reference points: NSGA-III uses reference points
    to guide the search process towards a diverse set of non-dominated solutions.
    As a result, it leads to a uniform distribution of solutions on the Pareto front
    in the objective space. These reference points are vectors of ideal objective
    values that represent desirable solutions for the problem being solved, and they
    are typically obtained by analyzing the objective values of the non-dominated
    solutions found in previous iterations of the algorithm. IV. Selection: NSGA-III
    selects the solutions that will be used to create the next generation of candidate
    solutions. This is done by first selecting the best non-dominated solutions from
    each level and then using the reference points to choose the remaining solutions.
    V. Crossover and mutation: The selected solutions are combined through crossover
    and mutation to create the next generation of candidate solutions. VI. Iteration:
    Steps II to V are repeated until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum
    number of generations or a desired level of convergence. VII. Output: The final
    output of NSGA-III is the set of non-dominated solutions found in the last generation
    of candidate solutions. These solutions represent the Pareto front of the optimization
    problem and can be used to make decisions about the trade-offs between the different
    objectives (Deb and Jain, 2014; Jain and Deb, 2014). 2.5. DNDC-NSGA-III integration
    and optimization The DNDC model was used to compute objective functions (Eq. (1)),
    which were then coupled with the NSGA-III optimization algorithm. The optimization
    framework was partly based on previous work (Prina et al., 2018). The scripts
    that implement the DNDC-NSGA-III integration and optimization are available at
    [https://github.com/Heeheedaa/DNDC-NSGA-III]. Because the source code of the DNDC
    model was not available, we used the Python library ‘pyautogui’ to automate interactions
    between the DNDC model and NSGA-III algorithm. We addressed the following four
    objective functions derived from the DNDC model: (1) Where denotes the collection
    of objective functions, denotes the objective that needs to be maximized (e.g.,
    crop yield simulated from the DNDC model), and denotes the objective that needs
    to be minimized. The DNDC model does not directly compute irrigation water consumption.
    Thus, we used the water balance method to retrieve annual irrigation demand, as
    follows: (2) The objective functions were subject to the following constraints:
    (3) In addition, the objective functions were also subject to the following irrigation
    schedules. To maintain simplicity and practicality, we scheduled 10 flooding events
    with a duration of about 0–15 days, which randomly started half-monthly and ended
    in the middle or end of each month. Each flooding event received the same amount
    of water, which is indicated as continuous flooding (10 cm) in the DNDC model.
    The optimization framework was partly based on previous work (Prina et al., 2018)
    and comprised the following processes. First, we set up the NSGA-III algorithm,
    constraints, and objective functions and initialized a parental population with
    random solutions; 4500 individuals were generated, corresponding to 4500 random
    farm management practices (sowing, fertilization, tillage, and irrigation). Second,
    we computed the values of the objective functions by executing the DNDC model
    with each solution; we used the averaged climate data (2016–2020) and assumed
    that the soil properties remained stable during the study period. Third, we evaluated
    the performance of each individual by ranking the fitness of its objective functions.
    Fitness is a measure of how well a solution performs was and is calculated based
    on the non-dominated sorting rank. Then, we generated a new generation through
    selection, crossover, and mutation, based on fitness. Finally, Pareto fronts were
    generated after all 10 pre-defined generations had been evaluated. By testing
    the NSGA-III with various population sizes and generations, we found that the
    configuration of 4500 individuals and 10 generations could obtain stable Pareto
    fronts. For different farming management combinations, a smaller population or
    fewer generations would either omit potential non-dominated solutions/sets (none
    of the objectives can be improved without detriment of the others) or result in
    a biased Pareto front. Conversely, we found that larger populations or more generations
    were considerably more time-consuming but did not further improve the Pareto fronts
    in this study. 3. Results 3.1. DNDC model validation The performance of the DNDC
    model was evaluated through in situ observations at both the annual scales (Fig.

    crop yield, ET, GPP, Reco, CH4, soil moisture, and soil temperature. At the annual
    scale, we found that DNDC reasonably captured the mean annual sum values and interannual
    variation in four key objectives, including crop yield, CH4 emissions, GPP dynamics,

    area represents the growing season. At the daily scale, DNDC simulated CH4 flux
    well under the current midseason drainage practice, throughout the study period
    (R2 = 0.56, RMSE = 0.06 g C/m2 d−1; Fig. 3a). However, DNDC greatly overestimated
    GPP during the early growing season, with a sudden increase from 0 to ∼80 kg C/ha
    occurring following sowing (Fig. 3b). In contrast, GPP simulations matched observations
    from around the middle of the growing seasons to the rest of the study period
    (R2 = 0.68, RMSE = 2.9 g C/m2 d−1). DNDC captured Reco reasonably well during
    the growing seasons (R2 = 0.75, RMSE = 1.4 g C/m2 d−1), but also underestimated
    the flux by ∼1–2 (g C m−2 d−1) during the non-growing seasons. Importantly, we
    observed minor effects of early season GPP mismatch on annual crop yield estimations,
    as depicted in Fig. 2a. Daily-scale ET simulations showed a moderate agreement
    with the observations (R2 = 0.31, RMSE = 1.73 mm/d; Fig. 4). During growing seasons,
    the DNDC model tracked effectively the dynamics of soil moisture (R2 = 0.49, RMSE
    = 0.1 m3/ m3, Fig. 4b) and soil temperature (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 4.5 °C, Fig. 4c)
    under the current midseason drainage practice. 3.2. DNDC-NSGA-III inferred Pareto
    fronts To illustrate the process of approaching Pareto fronts through DNDC-NSGA-III
    optimization, we present a comparison of dominated solutions (Fig. 5, gray dots)
    and non-dominated sets (Fig. 5, colored dots). To see how the solutions are distributed
    along the front, we also present Pareto fronts in the form of probability density
    distributions of each pair of objectives (Fig. 5). This approach can help us identify
    clusters of solutions that have similar trade-offs between objectives, and also
    identify the regions with the highest density of solutions. By comparing current
    farming outcomes (Fig. 5a and b), we found that a crop yield of approximately
    8.6 t/ha could be achieved with only ∼25 % CH4 emissions, ∼29 % water consumption,
    and similar N2O emissions. Furthermore, the optimization framework suggests a
    higher crop yield of around 10 t/ha could be obtained while reducing irrigation
    demand and GHG emissions by over 50 %. Download : Download high-res image (1MB)

    irrigation consumption and N2O emissions. Black triangles denote pairs of annual
    farming outcomes based on current management (2016–2020). To highlight the areas
    for improvement, we present gaps between current farming outcomes (Fig. 5, black
    triangles) and optimized objectives (Fig. 5, colored dots). Current rice yields
    remained relatively high, but at great environmental cost in terms of both CH4
    emissions (Fig. 5a, black triangles) and water consumption (Fig. 5b, black triangles).
    Current farming practices exhibit significant discrepancies when compared to the
    optimized objectives suggested by the model (Fig. 5a–f, black triangles to Pareto
    fronts), particularly with regards to CH4 emissions and irrigation water consumption
    (Fig. 5c). In addition, based on simulations conducted with current practices,
    the majority of the pairs of objectives (between crop yield and N2O emissions)
    were located in the non-dominated sets (Fig. 5d, colored region); however, there
    were considerable gaps of current farming outcomes to the Pareto front (Fig. 5d).
    The 2-D Pareto fronts are informative regarding results for two objectives, but
    they might be misleading if an additional objective is considered. Therefore,
    we also plotted 3-D Pareto fronts in order to determine the outcome for each triplet
    state (Fig. 6). We found that the current farming practices led to a mean crop
    yield that reached 87% of its potential level (∼10 t/ha). However, most of the
    pairs of objectives (blue triangles) fell out of the optimal sets (colorized planform,
    Fig. 6). Compared to the current farming systems, optimized management would almost
    achieve the full potential rice yield while reducing CH4 emissions (Figs. 5a &
    6b) and water consumption (Figs. 5e and 6b) by more than 50 %, and maintaining
    similar N2O emissions (Figs. 5d and 6a). Download : Download high-res image (700KB)

    To demonstrate how Pareto fronts were achieved (Figs. 5 and 6), we show the associated
    farm management density distributions (Fig. 7). The distributions were shown in
    the same color palettes as Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, and therefore, indicate the optimization
    process to approach Pareto fronts, rather than the “optimal management practices”
    per se. We found that modeled irrigation schedules converged to form several narrow
    time windows in each month (Fig. 7a–e). This convergence, depicted in the upper
    right corner of Fig. 7b and c, was associated with an increased likelihood of
    late initiation of irrigation in the early to middle growing season. In contrast,
    an early irrigation schedule increased the probability of initiation in the peak
    to late growing season (Fig. 7d and e). Download : Download high-res image (2MB)

    rate; (e) sowing day and tillage depth; (f) tillage depth and fertilization rate.
    The red-blue color bar indicates the probability density. Non-dominated sowing
    occurred only in April. In addition, the optimal modelled sowing window clustered
    around early April (Fig. 7f and g). A fertilization rate of ∼60–120 kg/ha occurred
    more frequently with early sowing and a shallow tillage depth (Fig. 7f and h).
    Finally, the probability density distribution of the interaction between early
    sowing and shallow tillage depth was considerably greater (Fig. 7g). The distribution
    of the optimized farm management regime depicted in Fig. 7 was also presented
    in different combinations in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2, and in three dimensions
    in Supplementary Fig. 3. Overall, we found identical interactions in each pair
    of triplet states for management practices. The effects of integrated farm management
    on CH4 and N2O emissions are also shown in Fig. 8, Fig. 9, and Fig. 10. Our scenario-modeling
    findings indicate that a shallow tillage depth led to a higher probability of
    lower emissions of CH4 and N2O (Fig. 8a and d). Additionally, we found no clear
    association between fertilization rate and CH4 emissions (Fig. 8b), whereas fertilization
    rate was positively related to N2O emissions as expected (Fig. 8e). We also observed
    that earlier sowing days were associated with a higher probability of lower CH4
    and N2O emissions. In addition, later initiation of the irrigation schedule throughout
    the growing season resulted in lower CH4 emissions, as expected (Fig. 9). However,
    the effects of later irrigation on N2O reduction were consistent only in the middle
    of the growing season (Fig. 10). Download : Download high-res image (874KB) Download

    farming practices and the potential crop yield with optimal management Multiple
    optimal management regimes exist for various Pareto fronts, making decision-making
    challenging. However, we believe that higher crop yield is paramount to farmers.
    To address this, we applied a crop yield threshold of >10 t/ha and subset farming
    practices from the non-dominated solutions. As a result, Fig. 11 displays the
    best combination of farming practices inferred from DNDC-NSGA-III framework, with
    the goal of achieving potential crop yield. The optimal management regimes all
    include sowing dates around 10–30 days earlier than current practices (Fig. 11a).
    However, the impact of tillage depth on crop yields was marginal (Fig. 11b). We
    found that the current fertilization rate was within the optimal range (Fig. 11c).
    We also present optimized irrigation schedules according to the dynamics of the
    water table (Fig. 11d), which represents the upper surface of the zone of saturation
    in the soil, and soil moisture (Fig. 11e). The optimized irrigation schedules
    were all associated with transitory flooding events in the early to middle growing
    seasons. By contrast, under current management practices, irrigation is suspended
    only in the middle of the growing season. Download : Download high-res image (833KB)

    optimized regimes are also shown (f–i). 4. Discussion Using a new heuristic and
    holistic method, the present study proposes improved rice farming irrigation regimes
    (Bo et al., 2022; Lampayan et al., 2015; Tian et al., 2021), and explored the
    influence of the sowing window, fertilization rate, and tillage depth, and their
    interactions. We validated and coupled the DNDC model with the NSGA-III algorithm
    to maximize crop yield, and minimize water consumption and N2O and CH4 emissions.
    We quantified the gap between current farming practices at the study site and
    optimal practices. Our results indicate that optimized farm management could maintain
    or increase current crop yield, while also reducing irrigation demand and GHG
    emissions by > 50 % (Fig. 11f–i). Furthermore, our method addresses the problem
    of reducing CH4 and N2O emissions simultaneously. 4.1. Could DNDC-NSGA-III optimization
    increase current rice yield with lower irrigation water requirements? Our findings
    suggest that considering improvements in the sowing window and flooding time could
    be crucial for maximizing crop yield (∼10 t/ha); other aspects of farming practice
    are already close to being optimized (Fig. 11). An early sowing date can improve
    crop biomass and grain yield due to an increased leaf area index and assimilation
    rate at vegetative stages, and by exploiting the benefits of lower temperature
    for starch accumulation at the late grain-filling stage (Huang et al., 2020; Li
    et al., 2021; Wenting et al., 2021). These physiological mechanisms support our
    finding that all non-dominated sowing dates were in early April (Fig. 7f and g),
    roughly 10–40 days before current sowing dates (Fig. 11). Early planting also
    reduces the risk of extreme heat events and serves as a cost-effective strategy
    for adaptation to climate warming (Acharjee et al., 2019; Ding et al., 2020).
    However, the early sowing suggested in this study may not be appropriate in other
    regions, since the optimal sowing window is highly dependent on both local climate
    conditions and cultivar characteristics (Deng et al., 2022; Tu et al., 2020).
    Showcasing the temperature data from Supplementary Fig. 4, it is evident that
    the improved sowing dates (early April, DOY∼91 to DOY 100, as depicted in Fig.
    11a) consistently maintained temperatures above 10 °C. This temperature range
    represents a crucial minimum threshold for seed germination and leaf initiation
    in japonica rice, as substantiated by prior research (Sánchez et al., 2014), and
    further supports our recommendation for early sowing dates. However, it is important
    to be mindful of the potential risk of cold or frost damage when advancing the
    sowing date. It is advisable to exercise caution if considering a significant
    advancement in the sowing date. Besides, the real-world adoption of such practices
    may be influenced by various factors, including traditional practices, economic
    considerations, access to information, and infrastructure limitations. Regarding
    the sowing date in South Korea, the timing of harvesting to coincide with the
    traditional holiday ‘Chuseok’ significantly influences farmers’ decisions to begin
    the season, as the price of fresh rice is highest during that time. Therefore,
    economic factors play a crucial role in this context. Regarding the irrigation
    schedule, in all of the optimized solutions the current japonica variety (‘Odae’)
    at the study site requires nearly saturated water content during the grain-filling
    stage (∼DOY 190–240) to avoid yield penalty (Fig. 11e), which is a well-known
    drought-sensitive growth period (Lilley and Fukai, 1994; Saini and Westgate, 1999;
    Zhang, 2018). In contrast, multi-transitory flooding events at the vegetative
    stage conserve considerable water resources (>50 %) while having marginal negative
    effects on crop yield (Fig. 11e and f). The optimized irrigation practice initiated
    new flooding events to largely maintain soil moisture in the rootzone above ∼0.45
    m3/m3. This is consistent with the recommendation that the threshold of soil water
    potential should be > −10 kPa to avoid drought stress, following AWD guidelines
    (Lampayan et al., 2015). Therefore, the modeled optimized management practices
    are not only consistent with the current literature, but also highlight the essential
    role of an integrated approach in rice farming. 4.2. Could DNDC-NSGA-III optimization
    reduce CH4 and N2O emissions simultaneously? This study demonstrated the feasibility
    of substantially reducing CH4 emissions while maintaining N2O footprints at or
    below the current levels (Fig. 11g and h), although a trade-off between CH4 and
    N2O emissions can be expected (Fig. 5e) due to anaerobic decomposition (Neue,
    1993) and aerobic nitrification (Bouwman, 1998). A recent global meta-analysis
    showed that non-flooded days, bulk density, and nitrogen application rate underpinned
    the benefits of non-continuous flooding on global warming (Bo et al., 2022), where
    fertilization is the source of nitrification–denitrification and moisture content
    affects the gas diffusivity of N2O through the soil column (Klefoth et al., 2014).
    In the present study, prioritizing maximum yield, DNDC-NSGA-III optimization resulted
    in nearly identical water table dynamics among the optimized solutions (Fig. 11d),
    sustaining a balance between anaerobic and aerobic soil environments. Importantly,
    we determined that the optimal fraction was ∼54 % of non-flooding days relative
    to the growing season length (Fig. 11d and e), which is comparable to that (>50
    %) reported for South Korea in the aforementioned meta-analysis (Bo et al., 2022).
    Additionally, our scenario-modeling results indicate that non-flooded days should
    occur primarily in vegetative stages, shortly after sowing and before the grain-filling
    stage. Furthermore, the model-inferred optimized practices (Fig. 8) are consistent
    with the effects of farm management on GHG emissions in the current literature,
    particularly with reduced tillage leading to decreased N2O emissions (van Kessel
    et al., 2013) and CH4 emissions in rice paddies (Cheng-Fang et al., 2012), as
    well as the positive response of N2O emissions to nitrogen fertilizer additions
    (Shcherbak et al., 2014). However, the situation in South Korea, where farmers
    may have little motivation to actively reduce GHG emissions through water management,
    is largely shaped by the absence of an effective carbon emission tax policy and
    the dependence on abundant water supply from rainfall events and well-established
    irrigation infrastructure. This highlights the urgent need for policy updates
    to integrate long-term environmental sustainability measures, drawing immediate
    attention to this concerning issue. 4.3. Limitations and uncertainties Several
    limitations of the present study should be noted. First, we did not validate the
    N2O simulation results due to a lack of observations, although a well-calibrated
    DNDC model can reliably track daily N2O fluxes (Katayanagi et al., 2012; Li et
    al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2020). Furthermore, although we demonstrated the robustness
    of the calibrated DNDC model through multifaceted validation (Fig. 2, Fig. 3,
    Fig. 4), uncertainties regarding overestimated GPP during the early growing season
    remain to be addressed. Collecting data over a longer period would also aid evaluation
    of the ability of the model to capture interannual variability. In our case, as
    noted in Hwang et al. (2020), observed CO2 data, after quality control, were available
    only 38.4 % of the time. Although low-quality data were concentrated at night,
    and there were few long-term gaps that introduced relatively large uncertainties
    in flux partitioning, it is crucial to recognize that the comparison in Fig. 3b
    and c may, to some extent, reflect differences in data gaps rather than solely
    the performance of DNDC. Additionally, for a simple and practical integrated method,
    we narrowed farming management down to several pivotal factors (Fig. 11) rather
    than including all possible practices. Future studies could also explore other
    measures, including the use of new rice cultivars (drought-resistant and high-yielding)
    and nitrification inhibitors (Sun et al., 2016), straw addition (Jiang et al.,
    2019b), and different fertilizer types and application methods (Hussain et al.,
    2015). Furthermore, only one rice farming site was included in the study, and
    the extent to which the results can be generalized is not clear. Besides, we did
    not test experimentally if the proposed changes to management indeed would lead
    to the predicted outcome. Experiments should be conducted in the future to verify
    the robustness of the new approach in practice. Nevertheless, we have provided
    a novel approach that could be promptly adopted in other regions if sufficient
    data are available. Implementing our findings into farm practices requires careful
    planning and consideration. Before widespread adoption, on-farm validation trials
    are crucial to ensure practicality. Outreach programs and tailored training sessions
    will promote the adoption of our findings in specific farming systems based on
    regional and climate conditions. Additionally, advocating for incentives and policies
    should be considered to encourage farmers to adopt sustainable practices. 5. Conclusions
    This study introduces a heuristic and holistic approach to simultaneously optimize
    multiple competing farming objectives using the DNDC model and NSGA-III algorithm.
    The results demonstrate that the optimized management approach could maintain
    or even increase current crop yield to its potential while reducing irrigation
    demand and greenhouse gas emissions by more than 50 %. The optimal proportion
    of non-flooded days was found to be approximately 54% of the growing season length,
    and the optimal stage for non-flooding days is the vegetative stage. Earlier sowing
    and improved irrigation practices are essential in the study area for maximizing
    crop yield and environmental benefits. The approach developed in this study could
    be applied to evaluate the environmental sustainability of farming systems under
    various climate and local conditions and guide policymaking and farming practices.

  description: Greywater, with limited content of pathogens, makes up more than half
    of the produced wastewater in urban areas. Given the high cost of wastewater management
    and treatment, it causes sense to collect greywater separately at the source and
    employ an on-site treatment system to increase opportunities for on-site water
    reuse. For this purpose, this paper aims to propose a multilayer granular filter
    as an inexpensive and simple on-site treatment method for greywater reuse. Furthermore,
    as determining the optimal structure of multilayer filters is a serious challenge,
    a simulation-optimization model is developed for determining the best filter configuration.
    An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained based on experimental results to
    simulate the filter performance with different combinations of layers and the
    Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to find the optimal thickness of different layers
    based on ANN simulation results. The proposed filter in this paper for greywater
    treatment consists of silica sand (in three different gradings) and activated
    carbon (with fixed grading) and treatment measures for evaluation of filter performance
    are considered as Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and Electrical Conductivity (EC).
    Due to difficulties in collecting, transferring, and storing the real greywater,
    synthetic greywater was used in this study. 49 experiments with different combinations
    of filter media thicknesses were performed and the performance of the filter was
    analyzed. Generally, three-layer filters perform better in COD and EC reduction,
    however, the average COD and EC elimination equals 36.3% and 15.1%, respectively,
    which indicates more efficiency of filter in COD reduction in comparison with
    EC. Based on the optimization-simulation model and experimental results, a filter
    consisting of 33 cm of fine sand, 20 cm of activated carbon, and 7 cm of medium
    sand results in the maximum efficiency and can reduce the COD and EC of greywater
    by 72% and 30%, simultaneously. According to the optimization outputs, the ideal
    filter can treat greywater up to having EC of 1000 μS/cm and COD of 321 mg/L,
    which is generally suitable for irrigation purposes.

  explanation: This study examines how to optimize a multilayer sand filter system
    for greywater treatment using automated systems to simulate and optimize the filtration
    process. The filters are designed to remove chemical and biological contaminants
    from greywater, which is wastewater generated from household activities like laundry,
    dishwashing, and bathing. The specific contaminants targeted in this study are
    chemical oxygen demand (COD) and electrical conductivity (EC). The researchers
    used machine learning algorithms to simulate the filter performance with different
    combinations of layers and materials. They then used a genetic algorithm to find
    the optimal thickness of different materials based on the ANN simulation results.
    The proposed filter in this study for greywater treatment consists of silica sand
    (in three different gradings) and activated carbon (with fixed grading) and treatment
    measures for evaluation of filter performance are considered as Chemical Oxygen
    Demand (COD) and Electrical Conductivity (EC).
  extract_1: The proposed filter in this study for greywater treatment consists of
    silica sand (in three different gradings) and activated carbon (with fixed grading)
    and treatment measures for evaluation of filter performance are considered as
    Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and Electrical Conductivity (EC).
  extract_2: The maximum COD and EC reduction is achieved in test number 29, in which
    the filter is made of 15 cm of medium sand, 15 cm of fine sand, and 30 cm of activated
    carbon, with a COD reduction of 67% and an EC reduction of 32.0%.

    of wastewater treatment. • The filter has the most efficiency in reducing COD
    and EC in three and four-layer structures due to the diversity of particle sizes.
    • The average COD and EC removal for 49 treatment tests were equal to 36.3% and
    15.1%, respectively. • ANNs have been used for developed filters performance simulation
    and GA is employed to optimize greywater filter configuration. • The maximum COD
    and EC reduction is achieved using a filter made of 33 cm of fine sand, 20 cm
    of activated carbon, and 7 cm of medium sand. Abstract Greywater, with limited
    content of pathogens, makes up more than half of the produced wastewater in urban
    areas. Given the high cost of wastewater management and treatment, it causes sense
    to collect greywater separately at the source and employ an on-site treatment
    system to increase opportunities for on-site water reuse. For this purpose, this
    paper aims to propose a multilayer granular filter as an inexpensive and simple
    on-site treatment method for greywater reuse. Furthermore, as determining the
    optimal structure of multilayer filters is a serious challenge, a simulation-optimization
    model is developed for determining the best filter configuration. An Artificial
    Neural Network (ANN) is trained based on experimental results to simulate the
    filter performance with different combinations of layers and the Genetic Algorithm
    (GA) is used to find the optimal thickness of different layers based on ANN simulation
    results. The proposed filter in this paper for greywater treatment consists of
    silica sand (in three different gradings) and activated carbon (with fixed grading)
    and treatment measures for evaluation of filter performance are considered as
    Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and Electrical Conductivity (EC). Due to difficulties
    in collecting, transferring, and storing the real greywater, synthetic greywater
    was used in this study. 49 experiments with different combinations of filter media
    thicknesses were performed and the performance of the filter was analyzed. Generally,
    three-layer filters perform better in COD and EC reduction, however, the average
    COD and EC elimination equals 36.3% and 15.1%, respectively, which indicates more
    efficiency of filter in COD reduction in comparison with EC. Based on the optimization-simulation
    model and experimental results, a filter consisting of 33 cm of fine sand, 20
    cm of activated carbon, and 7 cm of medium sand results in the maximum efficiency
    and can reduce the COD and EC of greywater by 72% and 30%, simultaneously. According
    to the optimization outputs, the ideal filter can treat greywater up to having
    EC of 1000 μS/cm and COD of 321 mg/L, which is generally suitable for irrigation
    purposes. Graphical abstract Download : Download high-res image (359KB) Download

    GreywaterSand filterCODECOn-site treatmentOptimization 1. Introduction One of
    the unconventional sources of water is greywater. Greywater is the water coming
    out of the kitchen, dishwasher, bathroom, and washing machine; in fact, the water
    comes out of all sources in a house except toilets (Boyjoo et al., 2013; Abdel-shafy
    et al., 2015; Boano et al., 2020). Greywater could be used for aims that do not
    require drinking water quality, such as irrigation, heating and cooling, car washing,
    firefighting, flash tank system, recreational uses, and industrial usage (WHO
    Guidelines, 2013; Boyjoo et al., 2013; Al-Jayyousi, 2003; Vuppaladadiyam et al.,
    2019). Greywater includes, on average, 65%–70% (depending on the characteristics
    of the study area) of domestic wastewater (Morel and Diener, 2006; Oh et al.,
    2017; Boyjoo et al., 2013; Vuppaladadiyam et al., 2019). Greywater quantity and
    greywater quality correspond to diverse aspects, like living conditions, climatic
    and geographical conditions, water consumption, water price, population characteristics
    (age and gender), personal and social habits, water distribution and wastewater
    collection facilities, accessibility to water resources and type and amount of
    chemical materials used in household (Vuppaladadiyam et al., 2019; Oteng-Peprah
    et al., 2018; Boyjoo et al., 2013; Tsoumachidou et al., 2017). Fig. 1a and b display

    Contribution of different resources in greywater production of (a) high-income
    and (b) low-income households (prepared based on data from Shaikh and Ahammed,
    2020). The quality of greywater generally is higher than sewage. So, it can be
    used as a primary treatment (Oron et al., 2014; Maimon and Gross, 2018). From
    an economic point of view, when the water price increases and available water
    decreases, the benefit of greywater reuse is justified (Maimon and Gross, 2018).
    Furthermore, greywater usage has economic benefits for both the consumer and producer.
    It will preserve water resources and reduce the volume of wastewater (Al-Jayyousi,
    2003). Acceptability and cost are two main aspects of greywater reuse (Rodríguez
    et al., 2020). Collecting and transporting real greywater to the laboratory for
    testing, especially in high volumes, is challenging. Anaerobic conditions will
    form, and the greywater will become highly pathogenic in case of non-standard
    storage for a long period. Dixon et al. (2000) demonstrated that storing greywater
    for up to 24 h helps to improve the water quality, while if the storage time exceeds
    48 h, dissolved oxygen will decrease, and the anaerobic process will generate
    an unpleasant odor in the water. On the other side, it has been stated that storing
    greywater for 24–48 h can improve water quality due to the settling of suspended
    solids (Boyjoo et al., 2013; Abed et al., 2020). Furthermore, storage of synthetic
    greywater has been reported for up to 7 days without any concerns (Abed and Scholz,
    2016). The characteristics of real greywater samples are not constant during the
    test. However, greywater with almost constant quality is required to evaluate
    and compare the performance of different treatment methods. For this reason, in
    many recent studies in the field of greywater, the required wastewater has been
    synthetically produced in a laboratory. Table 1 represents an overview of studies
    conducted on the production of synthetic greywater. In some studies, chemical
    substances are directly used for greywater generation which looks far from the
    reality of greywater composition. According to Tables 1 and in other group of
    studies, different amounts of common materials in a home are used to produce greywater
    based on different formulas, but the reason for each product selection is not
    described. Moreover, the formulation used for synthetic greywater production and
    storage details are not well presented. The target variables in producing greywater
    are also different. Therefore, in this study, synthetic greywater will be used
    for lab experiments while its formulation will be developed based on the defined
    treatment goal that is reduction of TDS and COD of greywater. Table 1. A summary
    of method and materials used for preparation of synthetic greywater in the literature.
    Reference Materials Descriptions Quality measures of produced synthetic greywater
    (Just EC and COD that are considered in the current study) Surendran and Wheatley
    (1998) Soap, detergent, starch, yeast, oil, settled sewage, shampoo, and some
    chemical substances like sodium carbonate, potassium sulfate, and sodium dihydrogen
    phosphate • The settled sewage was added to the greywater to deliver coliform.

    and kitchen • Kitchen wastewater (about 0.1%–0.2%) was added to simulate bacterial
    contamination and Escherichia coli. • The reason for choosing materials and the

    sulfate, and septic effluent (each material was used as representative of a contaminant
    in greywater resources) • Synthetic greywater was produced particularly with chemical

    production is similar to Hourlier et al. (2010) • Analyzing the organics removal
    efficiency of multilayer sand filters. – Spychała et al. (2019) Using washing
    powder, shampoo, shower gel, and liquid soap to produce synthetic greywater in
    Poland. • The materials and their amounts were proposed based on Poland''s domestic
    greywater characteristics. pH, COD, EC, and volatile solids were measured. Praveena

    al. (2013) (adding oil, shampoo, washing machine powder, dishwashing liquid, and
    detergent to 1 L of distilled water) • low-cost treatment of greywater using activated
    carbon. • The procedure and selection of quality measures were not justified.

    to the method of Praveena et al. (2020) • low-cost treatment of greywater using
    activated carbon. Nitrate and phosphate were the basis of grey water production
    and considered as 3.8 and 1.4 mg/L, respectively. Shahsavani et al. (2022) Similar
    to Babaei et al. (2018) • Investigating ozonation, filtration, and activated carbon
    in synthetic greywater treatment considering organic matters. • The chemicals
    and commercial materials were utilized to produce synthetic greywater at the same
    time. COD = 200 mg/L Ongena et al. (2023) Using commercial and chemical materials
    such as shampoo, toothpaste, NaCl, and CaCl2 (the procedure of greywater production
    was determined according to different studies) • Treating the synthetic greywater
    with lab-scale procedures • The synthetic greywater was produced based on the
    COD and Total Nitrogen and stored at cold area. COD = 504 mg/L Total Nitrogen
    = 23 mg/L Greywater treatment methods are divided into chemical, physical, biological,
    natural, or combination processes (Khalil and Liu, 2021; Albalawneh et al., 2017;
    Awasthi et al., 2023). The preference of a treatment method relies on various
    points, such as its cost, needed facilities, technical limitations, energy consumption,
    and the purpose of treatment (Devotta et al., 2007; Albalawneh et al., 2017).
    Developed greywater treatment strategies like sequencing batch reactors or membrane
    bioreactors require professional operators and have high investment and energy
    costs, so they cannot be used in any region and for any purpose (Rakesh et al.,
    2020; Khalil and Liu, 2021). On the other hand, filtration is a good choice for
    eliminating turbidity which can result in a reduction of mineral and volatile
    substances in water through screening and adsorption processes (Boano et al.,
    2020; Rakesh et al., 2020). Besides this, it is a cheap treatment method with
    the minimum operational demands (Gupta et al., 2023). As a result, filtration
    was a commonly utilized treatment of greywater in different scales. Considering
    these issues, filtration is used in this study for onsite greywater treatment
    (Gupta et al., 2023). In comparison to other methods, filtration can efficiently
    remove the majority of pollutants that are available in greywater (Ghaitidak and
    Yadav, 2013). According to Boano et al. (2020) and Ghaitidak and Yadav (2013),
    filtration systems typically remove COD and EC by 37–94% and 7–11%, respectively.
    Different kinds of materials, such as rice husk, activated carbon, sawdust, charcoal,
    and sand, are also utilized in greywater filtration to improve its treatment efficiency
    (Rakesh et al., 2020). Shrestha et al. (2001) proposed a greywater treatment system
    for kitchen, bathroom, and laundry wastewater. This filter included a 20 cm thickness
    of gravel particles with a diameter of 20–40 mm at the base, a 10 cm thickness
    of gravel particles with a diameter of 10 mm in the middle, and a 60 cm layer
    of coarse sand in the top layer. In this filter, ammonia and total nitrogen have
    been removed up to 90% and 70%, respectively. The influent COD was 100–400 mg/L,
    which decreased to 7–72 mg/L after treatment. No specific information about the
    optimal thickness and different types of materials (like activated carbon) were
    stated in this study. A guideline for greywater treatment in rural schools has
    been provided by the Environmental Engineering Research Institute of India (Devotta
    et al., 2007). This guideline recommends an on-site up flow–down flow filter consisting
    of gravel (with two-grain sizes of 40–50 mm), sand (1.0–1.4 mm), burnt bricks
    (15–30 mm), and fine sand (0.07–1 mm) with a total thickness of 0.75–1 m. This
    filter is able to reduce turbidity, suspended solids, and BOD5.3 The treated greywater
    could be used for flush tanks, irrigation, and ground washing. The cost and maintenance
    process of the filter were mentioned in this study, but how different configurations
    of the filter could affect its performance is not discussed. Rolland et al. (2009)
    mentioned that particle size and the compaction degree of particles are the most
    significant factors on its performance. The particle size determines the reliability
    and durability of the filtration system. The compaction of sand might cause filtration
    clogging as a practical or harmful effect during filter operation. In this research,
    there is no discussion on the optimal thickness of layers. Parjane and Sane (2011)
    indicated that an affordable and simple filter with a 20 cm coconut shell, 15
    cm sawdust (coarse), 20 cm charcoal, 10 cm bricks, and 15 cm sand layers could
    remove COD up to 82%. The reason of selecting materials and depth were not mentioned.
    Dalameh et al. (2012) investigated the ability of filters consisting of pine bark,
    activated carbon, polyurethane foam, and sand with an effective particle size
    (D104) of 0.4 mm and uniformity coefficient (Cu5) of 2.2 in reducing BOD5, surfactant,
    phosphorus, nitrogen, and microbial content of greywater. The filter had a cylindrical
    body with a diameter of 20 cm and four different materials, but the thickness
    of each material was constant (60 cm). In this study, pine bark and activated
    carbon could reduce the surfactant as well as the organic load of greywater. Moreover,
    EC removal was stated at 7% with pine bark and 11% with activated carbon. Saad
    et al. (2016) investigated the best filter structure consisting of various types
    of sands and activated carbon in COD reduction. They found that a filter with
    a total thickness of 200 cm and containing coarse sand (50 cm at the top and 20
    cm at the bottom), fine sand (70 cm), and rice husk (60 cm) could reduce COD up
    to 84%, but the optimal depth of materials was not evaluated. Albalawneh et al.
    (2017) analyzed tuff and gravel for greywater filtration. The filter was a cube
    with a height of 0.6 m and an area of 4 m2 with a slope of 1%. The removal rate
    of BOD, COD, and TSS6 when using gravel was 49, 51, and 76%, respectively, and
    when using volcanic tuff with a diameter of 7–14 mm the removal rates were 73,
    65, and 85%, respectively. The effect of particle size and layers depth on the
    filter performance were not considered in this study. Spychała et al. (2019) evaluated
    the efficacy of three sand filters in removing volatile solids and organic matters
    of synthetic greywater. Synthetic greywater was produced by adding washing powder,
    shampoo, shower gel, and liquid soap to potable water. In this investigation,
    50 cm of medium sand with D10 of 0.55 mm and D60 of 0.8 mm were employed as a
    filtering media. They achieved an average removal effectiveness of 26.8% for COD,
    while the EC increased slightly by 2%. Spychała et al. (2019) investigated a sand
    filtration performance in greywater treatment. In this filter the only material
    was sand and COD and EC removal rate of the filter was not satisfactory. (Khezri
    and Roshan Abkenar, 2019) investigated the turbidity removal efficiency of a granular
    filter consisting of granite and basalt construction waste. Three types of single-column
    cylindrical filters of sand/anthracite, granite/anthracite, and basalt/anthracite
    were used. The depths of sand, granite, and basalt were fixed and equal to 35
    cm; while the height of anthracite was variable (15, 30, and 45 cm) in three filters.
    The Cu, D10, and density of sand were measured as 1.45, 0.65 mm, and 2.11 gr/cm3,
    respectively. The average percentages of turbidity removal in sand/anthracite,
    granite/anthracite, and basalt/anthracite filters were 91.4, 92.1, and 92.9, respectively.
    In general, by increasing the depth of media, size of materials, and sharpness
    of aggregates, the efficiency of turbidity removal increases. The effectiveness
    of the filter in improving the other water quality measures should also be investigated.
    Tusiime et al. (2022) explored the effect of adding activated carbon in a multilayer
    filter at greywater treatment. Two filters were prepared. The first one consisted
    of gravel (20 cm), coarse sand (30 cm), and fine sand (70 cm), and in the second
    filter fine aggregate (50 cm), and granular activated carbon (20 cm) were also
    added to the first filter structure. Before filtration, sedimentation and screening
    have been done to increase filtration efficiency. COD removal of the first filter
    in 12, 24, and 36 h of retention times were 95.9%, 98.9%, and 96.2%, respectively.
    COD removal of the second filter with the same operation condition was 98.5%,
    99.4%, and 98.7%. Consequently, treated greywater can be utilized for irrigation
    purposes due to the its high quality. Gupta et al. (2023) analyzed the efficiency
    of different sands plus 6, 4, and 2 kg iron particle filter in turbidity reduction.
    The depth of the filter contained 5 cm gravel, 5 cm coarse sand, 15 cm fine sand,
    10 cm iron particle, and 15 cm fine sand from bottom to top (a total depth of
    50 cm). The filter with 6 kg iron particles and 66.5% COD reduction showed the
    best efficiency among others, which illustrates the direct relation between filter
    efficiency and iron depth. Additionally, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was
    used to stimulate the filter performance in removing turbidity. The correlation
    coefficient between experimental and ANN simulation results showed a significant
    relationship with determination coefficient of 0.99 and an error percentage of
    ±1. Based on the recent studies in granular filtration, it could be stated that
    no optimum procedure has been introduced for achieving the maximum treatment of
    greywater. The greywater quality, especially COD, can be considerably improved
    through filtration utilizing low-cost materials such as sand, activated carbon,
    and wastes of different activities based on previous investigations. However,
    the important question of “what is the optimal percentage or thickness of different
    materials in a filter for maximum removal efficiency?” is not answered yet based
    on authors investigations. The thickness of each layer in a multilayer filter
    can affect the filter efficiency. In addition, as usually a variety of water quality
    measures are considered in treatment, it is critical to develop a structure for
    a filter that is able to efficiently remove all of the considered pollutants to
    the desired level. For example, when greywater is going to be used for irrigation,
    EC and COD are both important and should be at a specified level. Even though,
    the particle size of the filter significantly affects its reliability and durability;
    nevertheless, the main concentration of majority of researches is materials selection
    without paying attention to how material sizes could affect the filter performance.
    In addition, some studies have analyzed the greywater from special sources, for
    example, bath or kitchen basin, while it seems that a successful treatment process
    should be effective for all greywater sources. This research examines the removal
    rate of COD and EC (as main measures for irrigation purposes) using multilayer
    granular filters with a total thickness of 60 cm and different grading materials.
    Three kinds of sand as well as activated carbon in different configurations varying
    from one to four-layer have been used for developing the filter through 49 experiments.
    As the main innovation of this research, the performance of developed filters
    is simulated using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Then, Genetic Algorithm
    (GA) is used to determine the optimal thickness of different layers to achieve
    the maximum efficiency of the filter in greywater treatment. In this way, the
    high costs of developing physical and experimental models, are considerably reduced.
    2. Materials and methods The main goal of the research is to detect the optimal
    composition of a multilayer granular filter for achieving the maximum treatment
    level of greywater. Fig. 2 displays the proposed scheme for this purpose. The
    main steps of research include filter construction, defining investigation scenarios,
    choosing target variables for greywater treatment, producing synthetic greywater
    in the laboratory, selecting measuring methods, developing a simulation model
    using ANN, and finally, determining the optimal structure of the filter using
    GA. First, according to the available facilities, an on-site multilayer filter
    was made with low-cost materials. Then synthetic greywater, with almost a constant
    quality, representing the common characteristics of real greywater, was prepared.
    Different configurations are considered for filters development and their performance
    in greywater treatment are analyzed. In the next step, the collected data is used
    to develop an ANN model for simulation of filters’ treatment efficiency. Finally,
    a GA model is applied to determine the optimal thickness of each material in the
    multilayer filter for the maximum removal of COD and EC. Download : Download high-res

    for determining the optimal configuration of a multilayer filter for greywater
    treatment. 2.1. Pilot assembling The laboratory pilot of this study for greywater
    treatment includes a multilayer filter and a storage tank with a volume of 100
    L for greywater storage. The filter efficiency depends on size, weight, and thickness
    of filter layers as well as flow regime. The considered filter includes a maximum
    of three layers with an up flow–down flow regime based on Devotta et al. (2007)
    recommendation. Silica sand, garnet, and anthracite have been presented as ideal,
    available, and economical materials for water treatment in multilayer filters
    in the literature (Reynolds and Richards, 1996; Shaikh and Ahammed, 2022; Tusiime
    et al., 2022). Due to the non-accessibilitya of garnet and anthracite with a grain
    size of more than 1 mm, silica sand in three-grain sizes (coarse, medium, and
    fine aggregate) and activated carbon were selected as filter materials in this
    study considering their availability and being low cost. Materials grading based
    on ASTM7-C136, was measured using 3.8-inch, no.16, no.8, no.4, no.30, no.50, and
    no.100 sieves (ASTM international, 2006). Table 2 gives sieves analysis results
    for the used aggregate. In the literature, filters’ depths for greywater treatment
    range from 30 cm to 90 cm (Shaikh and Ahammed, 2022); therefore, the total thickness
    of the filter in this study is considered to be 60 cm, a common depth for a filter
    (Morel and Diener, 2006; Dalameh et al., 2012; Lalander et al., 2013). Table 2.

    The flow regime in the filter is up flow-down flow. The greywater enters from
    the top of the first column. After passing through the first layer as a downward
    flow, it enters the second column as an upward flow. Then, the flow passes through
    the third layer again as a downward flow, and finally, the treated greywater leaves
    the filter (Fig. 3). The filter contains three 47 30 cm plates and two 15 30 cm
    plates for the pilot walls and floor. The middle walls are formed by a 30 29 cm
    plate and a 26 30 cm plate. The first middle plate was connected to the walls
    with a 1 cm gap with the floor to permit flow from the first column to the second
    one. The second middle plate has a shorter length and is connected to the pilot
    floor to let water pass from the top of the second column to the third one. This
    space was created to conduct the water to the third column before overflowing
    the filter when the water was collected at the bottom of the first column. After
    assembling the filter, for a more uniform flow through the filter bed in the third
    column, a perforated aluminum plate was placed on top of the third column. One
    side of the aluminum plate was attached to the filter with glue so the water would
    enter the third column through the midpoint. Each filter can accommodate a 60
    cm thickness of material. Download : Download high-res image (351KB) Download

    depth of the filter (60 cm), 49 experiments with various thicknesses of three
    types of sand and activated carbon were considered to provide adequate data for
    the simulation model development. The experiments were divided into four categories.
    In the first group, which consists of four tests, the filter is made of just one

    considers all four materials in filter development. In the same way, the third
    and fourth groups consider three and two materials in filter development, resulting
    in 16 and 18 tests, respectively. Table 3 shows the details of different designed
    experiments in each group. The total depth of the filter has been kept fixed at
    60 cm in all experiments. The greywater temperature is supposed to be 20 °C. The
    inflow rate of greywater was assumed to be fixed at 0.04 lit/s. Table 3. Layers’

    Synthetic greywater production Due to the unstable quality of greywater in households
    and the difficulty of collecting and transporting real samples of greywater, it
    was decided to prepare greywater synthetically in a volume of 80 L in the laboratory.
    The average greywater quality based on different studies is shown in Table 4.
    According to Table 4, the greywater quality is very variable, depending on its
    production resource characteristics. As this study aims to use treated greywater
    for irrigation, COD and EC were selected as target variables of greywater treatment.
    The data in Table 4, along with Morel and Diener (2006), are the basis for measuring
    greywater characteristics in this research. When reusing greywater for irrigation,
    pH should be between 6.5 and 4.8 (EPA, 2012)8, which is commonly satisfied with
    even untreated greywater, according to Table 4. Therefore, pH measurement is not
    necessary. Due to the diversity of greywater quality, synthetic greywater was
    made to represent the average COD in low-income and medium-income regions. The
    greywater COD in these zones ranges between 212 and 1270 mg/L based on Morel and
    Diener (2006), while it is reported to be between 60 and 1340 mg/L by Vuppaladadiyam
    et al. (2019). Therefore, in this research for producing synthetic greywater,
    the average of the suggested ranges, COD equivalent to 750 mg/L, has been considered.

    Morel and Diener (2006) To produce synthetic greywater, according to Gross et
    al. (2007) and Travis et al. (2010), the method of mixing commonly used products
    as representatives of three fundamental resources of household greywater (washing
    machine, bathroom, and kitchen) with drinking water has been used. Sugar, liquid
    oil, and dishwashing liquid were chosen as representatives of the products used
    in the kitchen. Shampoo and toothpaste were chosen as representatives of the products
    used in the bathroom and hand basin. Washing machine powder was chosen as the
    representative of the products used for laundry. One gram of each product was
    dissolved in 1 L of drinking water to determine how these products affect COD
    of water, and the consequent COD was measured. It helps to find the required amount
    of each product to produce synthetic greywater with a desired COD of 750 mg/L.
    The COD of 1 g of each product with the amount of them used to produce 80 L of
    greywater is shown in Table 5. The third column shows the composition ratio. Due
    to the lack of information, the composition ratio was determined based on the
    expert''s judgment. For example, the amount of washing machine powder is twice
    the amount of sugar. A small amount of oil is utilized in synthetic greywater
    production because the oil and fat should be removed, as much as possible, before
    entering the wastewater filtration operation. Table 5. Analysis of resulting COD

    to Table 5, was tested by the USEPA10 reactor (spectrophotometer) digestion method
    and with the DR/890 colorimeter (ASTM International, 2020; DR/890 Colorimeter,
    2013). The COD of the prepared greywater was 747 mg/L, which well matches with
    the desired value for the experiment. After producing greywater synthetically,
    EC was measured using a Hach HQ30d to be 850 S/cm, which is within the EC range
    of greywater in low-income and medium-income areas, between 300 and 1500 S/cm,
    based on Morel and Diener (2006). 2.4. Treatment process The filter flow through
    is set as 0.045 lit/s. The filter area equals 0.0225 m2, resulting in a hydraulic
    loading rate (HLR) of 2 lit/s.m2 (0.002 m/s). This rate is determined based on
    the suggested rate for multilayer filters for advanced wastewater treatment by
    Reynolds and Richards (1996), Shaikh and Ahammed (2022), and Albalawneh et al.
    (2017). For instance, Reynolds and Richards (1996) suggested HLR between 1.36
    and 6.79 lit/s.m2. 2.5. Artificial neural network Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
    are intelligent procedures that establish a good relationship between input and
    output data with pattern recognition (Shahin et al., 2004). An Artificial Neural
    Network is formed of interconnected neurons, which take inputs, multiply them
    by weights, and then add a fixed number (bias). Next, the result is entered via
    a non-linear operation to create an outcome (Ding et al., 2013; Juan and Valdecantos,
    2022; Esmaeeli varaki et al., 2005). Eq. (1) shows the relationship between the
    output and inputs of a neuron (Esmaeeli varaki et al., 2005). (1) where the weights
    are displayed by w, b contains the setting of the network parameters, f is the
    activation operator, and a is the final outcome of the neuron. The training data
    are employed to modify the weights and biases of the ANN model. On the other hand,
    validation data are utilized to assess the model behavior and determine if it
    is suitable for the intended purpose. Testing data is utilized to define the accuracy
    of model in dealing with new data that was not used in the previous phases of
    model development (Ding et al., 2013; Adeli, 2001; Esmaeeli varaki et al., 2005).
    The purpose of modeling in this research is to simulate filter performance in
    terms of COD and EC removal efficiency using two separate ANN models. For this
    purpose, four inputs, including coarse sand thickness (x1), medium sand thickness
    (x2), fine sand thickness (x3), activated carbon thickness (x4), and an output
    (y), are selected. Fig. 4 displays the general structure of the developed ANN
    models. An input, a hidden, and an output layers feed-forward neural network,
    which consists of a sigmoid activation process in hidden and linear process in
    final layer neurons, is considered in this study, as based on the previous investigations,
    it can deliver the best results for the majority of cases (Gupta et al., 2023).
    The network was trained with different neurons (one to eight neurons) to achieve
    the best neural network structure for simulating the filter performance in removing
    COD and EC. Download : Download high-res image (195KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Schematic structure of inputs and output of artificial neural network
    in this research. The numerical criteria of coefficient of determination (R2)
    and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are applied to estimate the accuracy of neural
    network patterns (Juan and Valdecantos, 2022; Adeli, 2001). The coefficient of
    determination is the square of the correlation coefficient (R), which exists between
    zero and one. The closer the value is to one, the better the model performance.
    The correlation coefficient obtained from Eq. (2) indicates the correlation between
    the estimated values and observed values. (2) where, yobs is the observed value
    of COD or EC reduction percentage, and yest is the estimated value of COD or EC
    reduction percentage with the model. ȳest is the mean of the evaluated values,
    and n is the data series number. The RMSE assesses the precision of the model
    based on the discrepancy through the observed and evaluated values. The lower
    RMSE (closer to zero) indicates the better performance of the model. RMSE was
    obtained from Eq. (3). (3) 2.6. Optimization of filter structure The goal is to
    find the optimal thicknesses of the filter layers to reach the maximum COD and
    EC removal. Based on this, the decision variables are the thicknesses of fine
    sand (x1), activated carbon (x2), medium sand (x3), and coarse sand (x4). Since
    the thickness of filter layers cannot be less than zero, and the total thickness
    should always be 60 cm, the following constraints (Eq. (4) and Eq. (5)) are considered:
    (4) (5) In the considered optimization goal, both COD and EC variables have the
    same importance, so by giving equal weight to COD and EC reduction (0.5 to each),
    a single-objective is developed in Eq. (6). Beside this optimization model, two
    separate optimizations are also developed considering just COD or EC reduction
    in their objective function (Eq. (7) or Eq. (8)). (6) (7) (8) In Eq. (7) and Eq.
    (8), f1 and f2 are the developed ANNs for simulating COD and EC reduction percentages,
    respectively. The genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to solve the developed optimization
    models. In GA, an initial population of solutions (chromosomes) is selected randomly.
    Then, several superior chromosomes are chosen as parent chromosomes to produce
    the next generation (selection operator). Then, chromosomes are randomly placed
    in couples to create the next generation (Adeli, 2001; Mirjalili, 2019). In the
    reproduction process, parts of the genetic information of two chromosomes are
    exchanged (Crossover operator) (Lambora et al., 2019; Mirjalili, 2019). The crossover
    factor, with a likelihood of 0.9 (the most suggested value), is applied to two
    genes of the chromosomes. The mutation factor, with a likelihood of 0.1, is applied
    to the genes resulting from the crossover process. Two genes were selected randomly
    from a single chromosome. After that, their sum was calculated in order to apply
    the mutation operator while maintaining a filter thickness of 60 cm. A percentage
    of the gene sum was used to replace the first gene, while the remainder was used
    to replace the second gene. By repeating these steps, a new generation replaces
    the old one. This process stops when further repetition does not cause considerable
    improvement in the best solution (superior chromosome of the last generation).
    3. Results and discussion 49 tests were performed with multilayer filters filled
    with various thicknesses of materials. The total thickness was equal to 60 cm
    in all tests. Synthetic greywater was produced to achieve a COD of about 750 mg/L.
    Then, EC was measured as 850 S/cm, which was within its common range for greywater,
    according to Table 4. Table 6 summarizes the results of the greywater treatment
    with the filter considering different thicknesses for layers. In Table 6, COD1
    and EC1 correspond to the raw greywater, while COD2 and EC2 refer to the treated
    greywater characteristics. The maximum reduction of both variables is achieved
    in test number 29, in which the filter is made of 15 cm of medium sand, 15 cm
    of fine sand, and 30 cm of activated carbon, with a COD reduction of 67% and an
    EC reduction of 32.0%. COD reduction of 67% is approximately equal to the study
    of Gupta et al. (2023). Based on the literature, 50% of COD reduction happens
    just at the top 10 cm of the filter material (Shaikh and Ahammed, 2022). Therefore,
    it is reasonable to put material of small size, like fine sand and activated carbon,
    at the top of the greywater filter instead of coarse sand (Patel et al., 2019).
    The minimum reduction in COD was observed in test 6 b y 8.1%, while the minimum
    reduction in EC was observed in test 25 b y 0.4%. One of the key processes to
    reduce COD in the filters is adsorption, especially by activated carbon (Shaikh
    and Ahammed, 2022). For each test category (single, two, three, and four-layer
    filter), the average, minimum, and maximum removal rates of COD and EC are shown
    in Table 7. Table 7 demonstrates that the filter has the most efficiency in removing
    COD and EC in three and four-layer structures due to the diversity of particle
    size in filter media. Also, three-layer filters perform better in COD reduction
    than four-layer ones. The reason can be the insufficient thickness of the finer-grained
    particles in the four-layer tests. The maximum EC removal was related to the filters
    with four layers, with a slight difference from the filters with three layers.

    The average COD and EC removal for all considered tests were equal to 36.3% and
    15.1%, respectively, which indicates greater efficiency of the filter to reduce
    COD compared to EC, which matches with the findings of Tusiime et al. (2022) and
    Gupta et al. (2023). Furthermore, Shaikh and Ahammed (2022), Spychała et al. (2019),
    and Gupta et al. (2023) mentioned that filter media leaching and availability
    of free hydrogen ions in the filter material are reasons for little uprise in
    EC of greywater after treatment. According to Table 4, EC represents the ionic
    capacity of a solution to transfer electricity. The main sources of EC in greywater
    are sodium chloride, sodium soaps, nitrates, and phosphates (Morel and Diener,
    2006). Most of these ions are soluble in water and cannot be removed by filtration;
    on the other hand, COD defines the oxygen required to oxidize chemically all substances
    in greywater. A substantial part of these substances is not soluble, which can
    be removed from greywater using the filtration treatment (Peavey et al., 1985;
    Morel and Diener, 2006). In the single-layer tests, the reduction rate of COD
    and EC for fine sand with a thickness of 60 cm was higher than other materials
    due to the smaller D10 (1.28 mm). Reynolds and Richards (1996), Rakesh et al.
    (2020), and Patel et al. (2019) stated that activated carbon can remove dissolved
    organic matter. Nevertheless, in this research, the impact of the D10 was higher
    than the internal surface and porosity in treating COD and EC. Smaller pores improve
    the treatment efficiency (Peavey et al., 1985). The efficiency of sand filters
    in removing suspended solids, particularly those smaller than the pores, is primarily
    due to adhesion, flocculation, and sedimentation. As greywater passes through
    the filter pores, small flocculated suspended solids adhere to the sand surfaces
    and particles. Some particles join together through van der Waals force, leading
    to coagulation and settling. Consequently, suspended solids removal results from
    surface removal above the layer and depth removal inside the layer (Reynolds and
    Richards, 1996). However, the physical trapping of particles in the pores and
    surface absorption are the primary mechanisms by which the filter achieves its
    performance. 3.1. Neural network modeling Two separate ANN models were developed
    to simulate filter performance in COD and EC removal. The four considered inputs
    include coarse sand thickness (x1), medium sand thickness (x2), fine sand thickness
    (x3), and activated carbon thickness (x4), while the output (y) shows the removal
    percentage of EC or COD. Based on Shahin et al. (2004), 75% of data are used for
    model training, 10% of data for validation, and 15% for testing the model accuracy
    assessment. Fig. 5a–b show the resulting RMSE for training data against the number
    of hidden layer neurons for both ANN models developed for COD and EC removal,
    respectively. Based on these results, seven and eight neurons are used to model
    the COD and EC results, respectively, as they provide the minimum RMSE, according
    to Fig. 5. Download : Download high-res image (303KB) Download : Download full-size

    layer for training, (a) COD and (b) EC. The detailed performance criteria for
    the selected ANN simulation models for COD and EC removal are shown in Table 8.
    This table reveals that the model performance in training and testing are too
    close to each other, and this shows the developed model''s capability to deal
    with new data and provide reliable results. Fig. 6a–b compare the observed values
    (yobs) and simulated values (yest) using ANNs in both COD and EC removal. The
    minimum percentages of COD removal often are overestimated, while the maximum
    values are under evaluated. In EC removal, the obstacle in maximum values is the
    same as COD, while the minimum values are underrated. In EC and COD removal ANN
    simulation, the general behavior is simulated well, as mentioned in Gupta et al.
    (2023) in removing turbidity. Table 8. Summary of COD and EC removal for four

    of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
    Web version of this article.) As illustrated in Table 6, the performance of fine
    silica sand in reducing the COD and EC is higher than the other materials. Activated
    carbon also performs better than medium and coarse silica sand. Moreover, to define
    the material behavior, a three-dimensional diagram of the COD reduction against
    different thicknesses of fine silica sand and activated carbon has been drawn
    (Fig. 7a–b). Fig. 7 reveals that when the thickness of fine sand is between 0
    and 15 cm, the COD reduction is too low, and as the thickness of this material
    increases, the COD removal percentage also increases. Likewise, the maximum COD
    reduction efficiency of the filter is about 65% and belongs to the 30–40 cm of
    fine sand and 17–25 cm of activated carbon, as indicated by Patel et al. (2019).
    EC reduction graph also was drawn with the same situations in Fig. 8a–b. Fig.
    8 displays that the maximum efficiency of the filter in EC removal is about 30%
    and corresponds to the time when the filter is filled with 25–35 cm of fine sand
    and 20–30 cm of activated carbon. Download : Download high-res image (680KB) Download

    the population at each generation is considered as ten chromosomes. The initial
    population, whose genes consist of thicknesses of four materials based on the
    developed filters, is developed, and the total thickness of 60 cm for the entire
    filter is met. The termination criterion is set as a fixed optimal solution in
    100 generations. Fig. 9a–b show the evolution of the objective functions (the
    maximum COD and EC reduction) during the optimization process and using GA. Based
    on the results, if the filter is filled with 33 cm of fine sand, 19 cm of activated
    carbon, and 8 cm of medium sand, COD can be reduced by 72.22% as the maximum achievable
    value through filtration. The maximum EC reduction is 33.17%, which can be obtained
    if the filter is filled with 20 cm of fine sand, 26 cm of activated carbon, and
    14 cm of medium sand. Tusiime et al. (2022) and Saad et al. (2016) also reported
    that filters based on sand and activated carbon filtration are the best choice
    for treating greywater, while Shaikh and Ahammed (2022) preferred a single media
    filter made of sand as the best choice. Download : Download high-res image (280KB)

    based on the Z1 objective function (the summation of COD and EC) reveals that
    the maximum COD and EC reductions can be achieved simultaneously by using 33 cm
    of fine sand, 20 cm of activated carbon, and 7 cm of medium sand. This results
    in COD and EC reduction equal to 72.08% and 29.32%, respectively. These removal
    percentages are much more than average removal efficiencies of 65.5% (between
    37 and 94%) and 9% (between 7 and 11%) for COD and EC, respectively (Ghaitidak
    and Yadav, 2013; Boano et al., 2020); however, the greater reductions were represented
    by Parjane and Sane (2011), Patel et al. (2019), and Tusiime et al. (2022),while
    their considered total thickness of filter was more than 60 cm. Also, coarse sand
    does not affect the COD and EC reduction of greywater, so its thickness is set
    to zero in the optimal filter. The objective function evolution of the maximum
    simultaneous reduction of COD and EC during the optimization by GA is displayed
    in Fig. 10. Download : Download high-res image (178KB) Download : Download full-size

    algorithm (objective function: Z1). Finally, the optimal results of Z1, Z2, and
    Z3 were through experimental models to validate the simulation-optimization model
    outputs. For each case, experiments are done to ensure the results. Table 9 indicates
    that experimental outputs match the optimization outputs well. Hence, as shown
    in Table 9, the optimum filtration thickness in diminishing COD and EC at the
    same time contains 33 cm of fine sand, 20 cm of activated carbon and 7 cm of medium
    sand while coarse sand is removed from filter structure. It conveys that experimental
    and optimization results generally accept each other. Table 9. The results of

    to Grattan (2002), the acceptable EC for irrigation is less than 1300 μS/cm. Morel
    and Diener (2006) reported 750 μS/cm, and (EPA, 2012) noted 700 μS/cm. Also, various
    COD ranges from 90 mg/L (all soils) to 300 mg/L (dry soils) have been suggested
    for irrigarion water in an Iranian standard (Vice Presidency for Strategic Planning
    and Supervision, 2010). The optimal structure of the proposed filter in this study
    can produce water with a maximum EC of 1000 μS/cm and COD of 321 mg/L, which can
    be acceptable for irrigation purpose. 4. Summary and conclusion This research
    goal was to provide a new data-driven model to optimize the thickness of a multilayer
    granular filter developed for greywater treatment using an ANN for simulation
    of filter performance and GA for optimization. Treated water frequently is used
    for irrigation, so COD and EC were selected as the desired water quality measures.
    Because of limitations for real greywater storing and transporting, synthetic
    greywater was made in the laboratory by adding oil, shampoo, sugar, toothpaste,
    dishwashing liquid, and washing machine powder (as representatives of the general
    products used in households) to the drinking water. The resulting greywater had
    a COD of 750 mg/L and EC of 850 S/cm. An up flow–down flow pilot filter was developed
    with fine, medium, and coarse sand as well as activated carbon. These materials
    selected based on their ease of accessibility and low cost. The total depth of
    filter was considered fix, equal to 60 cm and 49 tests designed to investigate
    filters with different configurations. Based on experimental tests results, three
    and four-layer filters show higher efficiency in removal of COD and EC due to
    diversity of particle size in filter media. Moreover, the average COD and EC removal
    percentage equaled to 36.3% and 15.1%, respectively, which demonstrated greater
    efficiency of the filter in reducing COD compared to EC. ANN models were developed
    to simulate filters performance in COD and EC removal. After that, the GA was
    employed to find the optimal filter structure with three different objectives
    of maximum COD and/or EC removal. Based on the simulation-optimization model results
    to maximize COD and EC removal simultaneously, a multilayer filter with 33 cm
    of fine sand, 20 cm of activated carbon, and 7 cm of medium sand is the best choice
    which can reduce COD and EC of greywater by 72.08% and 29.32%, respectively. The
    validation of simulation-optimization model results was conducted by doing experimental
    tests which confirmed the results of simulation-optimization model. Fine sand
    and activated carbon with a D10 of 1.28 mm and 1.49 mm are determined as the most
    effective materials in reducing COD and EC of greywater. Finally, the optimal
    filter can treat greywater up to reaching an EC of 1000 μS/cm and COD of 321 mg/L
    which is appropriate to be used for irrigation purpose according to EPA and Iranian
    standard even though other water quality measures should also be considered to
    ensure all of the quality thresholds for irrigation purpose are satisfied. The
    findings of this study confirm the high efficiency of granular filters in on-site
    treatment of greywater with the minimum cost and using the easily accessible materials.
    Furthermore, usage of data driven models like ANN for simulation of different
    filters performance highly reduces the costs of physical tests and provides a
    helpful guide toward the best filter structure which is of high value comparing
    the common trial and error methods. It can be beneficial to perform experiments
    with different gradings, total layers thickness, hydraulic loading rate, and materials
    to check if the further treatment can be achieved through the proposed filter.
    Also, as variety of factors are considered in standards for irrigation water,
    it is indeed needed to further investigate the performance of these filters in
    improving other water quality measures such as salinity. Even it might be needed
    to use some additional treatment steps to achieve the desired water quality based
    on the other water quality measures which should be considered in future studies.
    On the other hand, the usage of these filters has some consequences from different
    aspects. As the on-site treatment facilities are hard to monitor and control,
    the usage of greywater might have some risks to human health and environment health
    as sometimes harmful pathogens or substances might be available in even treated
    greywater that are not recognized before the usage. Furthermore, as greywater
    is treated on-site; considering the variation of the produced greywater and limited
    capacity of treatment facilities, a storage tank might be needed for greywater
    storage before treatment. Furthermore, another storage tank for the treated greywater
    storage is needed. Beside the cost of these systems, especial attention should
    be paid to the maintenance of these storage and greywater detention time as it
    can decrease the quality of treated greywater and/or provide an appropriate space
    for growth of microorganisms which results in serious health risks. In addition,
    the improper maintenance and operation of treatment systems increases the risks
    of on-site treated greywater usage. It worth also to mention that before development
    of greywater treatment systems, the user should be well educated with the possible
    usages and risks of improper usage of the treated water to avoid the health risks
    as much as possible. Finally, it should also be emphasized that the successful
    implementation of the proposed method requires the development of guidelines and
    policies at the governmental level. Moreover, the potential side impacts of these
    systems, particularly environmental issues, should be taken into account before
    their implementation. CRediT authorship contribution statement Sara Nazif: Methodology,

    GA Genetic Algorithm LES Large Eddy Simulation 1. Introduction The main fire suppression
    mechanism of sprinklers is to cool the fuel surface to reduce the pyrolysis rate
    [1]. To deliver the water to the fuel surface, the fire sprinklers form a spray
    with low supply pressure. The deflector is used to obtain the proper size of droplets
    with low supply pressure. The water flows out through the orifice and it impinges
    on the deflector. The liquid film is formed in both vertical and horizontal directions
    after impingement on the deflector [2]. This liquid film is atomized into ligaments
    and droplets [3]. Due to this process, the liquid droplets are difficult to be
    fed directly into the area just below the conventional pendent-type sprinkler
    heads. Also, the large droplets penetrate farther than small droplets because
    the large momentum is advantageous in overcoming drag. For this reason, generally,
    the large droplets are supplied to the region farther from the sprinkler head
    and the small droplets are supplied to the region close to the sprinkler head.
    This is one of the reasons for the uneven distribution of droplet size and water
    flux on the floor. The uneven water flux on the floor affects the burning rate
    of solid combustibles, depending on the relative location between the sprinkler
    head and the solid combustibles. Also, the uneven droplet size affects the ability
    of water droplets to feed solid combustibles because the actual water-supplying
    performance is determined by the relative magnitude of the droplet''s inertial
    force and the fire plume''s buoyancy force. For this reason, the distribution
    of water flux and droplet size should be investigated to design an improved sprinkler
    head. To investigate water distribution, water distribution measurement experiments
    using water collection devices are commonly performed. Link et al. [4] investigated
    the effects of measuring grid size on experimental errors. The resolution error
    decreased as the collection resolution decreased, however, the repeatability error
    increased. It was concluded that the collection bin length smaller than 0.04 times
    the spray reach is appropriate to resolve the water flux variations. Lundberg
    [5] compared the water fluxes measured by a laser-based shadow imaging technique
    with the data obtained from experiments using a patternator. The total water flow
    rate calculated from the patternator experiment showed more similar results to
    supplied water flow rate than the shadow imaging results. Therefore, the patternator
    experiment is very simple yet a good evaluation tool for investigating the water
    distribution at the floor level. For this reason, it is used as validation data
    when developing new computational models. For example, the Reduced Order Model
    which is developed by Valencia et al. [6] and improved by Valencia and Marshall
    [7] was validated using the patternator experimental data. Uneven distribution
    of droplet size and water flux has been studied experimentally. Ren et al. [8]
    investigated the effects of the deflector on the radial distribution of droplet
    size and water flux. Droplet size was measured by Malvern Instruments Spraytec
    Particle Analyzer, and water flux was measured using a patternator in tine and
    slot directions. When the deflector with tines and slots was used, the water flux
    near the center increased compared to the sprinkler head with the disk. However,
    the droplet size was not affected by an orifice or deflector type and increased
    with increasing radial distance. Zhou et al. [9] analyzed the distribution of
    water flux and droplet size in both radial and azimuthal directions. Both water
    flux and droplet size were strongly affected by the azimuthal angle. Meanwhile,
    in their study, the water flux and droplet size increased with increasing radial
    distance from the sprinkler head. A trend inconsistent with the water flux measured
    by Ren et al. may be due to the sprinkler head geometry. However, detailed sprinkler
    geometry was not described in the study of Zhou et al., making it difficult to
    analyze the cause of this inconsistency. Despite these previous studies, the general
    relationship between the parameters of sprinkler head geometry, such as the location
    of tines and slots, in commercial sprinkler head geometry, and the water droplet
    distribution has not yet been identified. In addition to the basic research on
    sprinkler head design, there was an attempt to optimize the sprinkler geometry
    for foam fire suppression systems. Andrei and Alexey [10] optimized the sprinkler
    head design for foam fire suppression systems to increase the foam expansion rate.
    Various designs of the frame arm and the deflector were manufactured with Fused
    Deposition Modeling technology of 3D printing. By applying the experimental results
    to the full factorial experiment method, a model was developed to predict the
    foam expansion rate value depending on the sprinkler geometry parameters, and
    optimal sprinkler geometry was derived from this model. The optimization process
    can be automated by simulation integrated with optimization algorithms and it
    has been applied to spray-related optimization problems, such as injection direction
    [11] and spraying strategies [12]. Also, it is widely used in engineering fields
    to find the optimal control strategy [13] and the hardware geometry [14,15] because
    the Genetic Algorithm (GA) has good applicability in various fields. The evaluation
    of sprinkler spray under fire is essential because of fire-spray interaction.
    Harish and Venkatasubbaiah [16] investigated the interaction between water spray
    and fire plume in dual chambers connected to a tall shaft. The water spray reduced
    the ceiling vent discharge rate because the momentum direction of water droplets
    was opposed to the direction of the smoke buoyancy force. Lee [17] observed the
    fire displacement by using numerical analysis, which is the same phenomenon as
    the experiment conducted by Xiao et al. [18]. Lee and Moon [19] carried out a
    numerical analysis to investigate the effect of horizontal distance between a
    water mist nozzle and the fire and it was found that the fire suppression time
    is a power function of the normalized distance between the water mist nozzle and
    the fire. In this study, the boss and deflector design was optimized to improve
    the uniformity of droplet size and water flux at the floor level in a radial direction
    over the region the spray reaches using a micro-Genetic Algorithm (μGA). The data
    obtained during the optimization process were correlated with optimization targets
    and the effects of the design on optimization targets were investigated. The optimization
    process consists of two steps. Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and OpenFOAM were
    utilized for each step. The first step optimizes the injection pattern at a distance
    of 5 cm from the center and the second step elicits the design that produces the
    injection pattern derived from the first step. The optimized results in this study
    were derived at a fixed flow rate and non-fire conditions. Therefore, caution
    is needed when applying the results to conditions other than those of this study.
    Additionally, it is desirable to gain intuition about designing sprinkler head,
    rather than directly applying the results of this study. 2. Methodology and simulation
    conditions In this section, the numerical methods and simulation settings used
    in this study are described. The first section describes the overall structure
    of this study and optimization methods such as constraints and objective function.
    Numerical models such as the Lagrangian spray model, combustion model, and Volume
    of Fluid (VoF) model are discussed in the second section. The third section describes
    the computational settings such as initial and boundary conditions, mesh, and
    domain size. For automated optimization, all results were obtained through the
    simulation rather than experiment. 2.1. Optimization method The μGA was adopted
    for the optimization process. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is useful when the optimization
    problem contains many variables and is complex. The μGA can be used with a small
    number of populations (a subset of solutions in each generation) [20]. For this
    reason, it is useful for the optimization problems that should be solved with
    Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with large computational costs,
    compared to GA which utilizes more populations than μGA. A detailed explanation
    of μGA is provided in a previous study [20]. There are two ways to analyze sprays
    using CFD: Eulerian approach and Lagrangian approach. The Eulerian approach analyzes
    the liquid phase distribution by solving the transport equation for the volume
    fraction of the phase together with the continuity and momentum equations. This
    approach can reflect the influence of sprinkler geometry on spray formation. However,
    it requires a relatively small mesh size. The Largrangian approach utilizes the
    concept of parcels and can be used with a coarser grid compared to the Eulerian
    approach. However, this approach can''t reflect the effects of the sprinkler head
    geometry on spray. For these reason, an optimized deflector design was derived
    by two-step optimization. The overall optimization and analysis process of this
    study is shown in Fig. 1. The first step is to optimize the injection pattern
    at a radial distance of 5 cm from the center of the sprinkler head by evaluating
    the uniformity of droplet size and water flux on the floor. The first optimization
    step was performed with FDS (Lagrangian approach) because it is widely used in
    fire simulations. An optimized injection pattern derived from the first optimization
    step was used as a target for the second optimization step. In the second step,
    the deflector and boss design that produces the optimized injection pattern was
    derived. The second optimization step was conducted with OpenFOAM (Eulerian approach)
    because FDS can''t predict two-phase flows in the Eulerian approach. This two-step
    approach allows the effects of sprinkler head geometry changes to be calculated
    within a feasible computational time. Download : Download high-res image (767KB)

    2.1.1. The first optimization step In this study, the conventional pendent sprinkler
    head was considered. To simplify the problem, the effect of the frame arm on the
    injection pattern was neglected. The frame arm affects the water flux distribution
    of the sprinkler sprays by deteriorating the uniformity. However, basically the
    droplet formation and water flux distribution are caused by the boss and deflector
    designs. Therefore, this study was conducted as a primary step in a sprinkler
    head design, and the frame arm was neglected. There have been attempts to resolve
    the initial spray, which is an input condition for a sprinkler''s spray analysis,
    by reflecting the actual distributions of droplet size and droplet velocity [[21],
    [22], [23]]. Additionally, there was an attempt to reproduce the experimentally
    obtained water flux distribution using a Lagrangian approach, and the experimentally
    obtained water flux distribution was successfully reproduced [24]. However, these
    methods are complex to be adopted in the optimization process in which a variety
    of injection patterns should be considered. Also, the initial injection pattern
    is difficult to be determined because it changes depending on the sprinkler geometry
    and the spray conditions [25]. However, in previous study [26], it was found that
    the vertical water film was formed at the slot stream and the horizontal water
    film was formed at the tine stream near the sprinkler head. So, the injection
    pattern was assumed to be in the form of an appositive part of a sine function
    with droplet size and velocity uniformly distributed within the injecting area.
    The injected parcels were distributed in the region between the two sine functions.
    The region where parcels were supplied is illustrated in Fig. 2. The sine function
    at the top is denoted by fmax and that at the bottom is denoted by fmin. These
    two functions are expressed as follows: (1) (2) (3) (4) Download : Download high-res

    Their meanings are shown in Fig. 2. The range and steps for each optimization
    parameter are summarized in Table 1. The maximum and minimum values of optimization
    parameters are chosen by considering the feasibility of the sprinkler head design
    and the previous test results. For example, the minimum value of the optimization
    parameter is set to four because it is unfeasible when the deflector consisted
    of 3 or fewer tines. Also, the maximum value of the optimization parameter N is
    set to 36 because it is too fine to be manufactured. While changing the injection
    pattern, spray properties such as droplet diameter and velocity were kept constant.

    information such as droplet size, droplet velocity, and the number of droplets
    was calculated on a sphere with a radius of 0.05 m in the same approach as the
    PDPA experiment. The data acquisition locations were set at 0.1 m above the floor
    at 0.1 m intervals over the entire domain. From these data acquisition, the region
    reaching the sprinkler spray was divided in a radial direction. The average droplet
    size and water flux for each radial section are calculated as follows, based on
    the average droplet diameter calculated in each local data acquisition volume:
    (5) (6) Here, is the average droplet diameter calculated in the local data acquisition
    volume, is the number of droplets, is the density of water, is the average droplet
    velocity in the vertical direction calculated at the local data acquisition volume,
    is the number of data acquisition locations in each radial section, is the volume
    of data acquisition probe, and subscript means the value for each radial section
    . The average droplet size and water flux of the average value of radial distribution
    are simply calculated as the arithmetic mean of the values in each radial section.
    (7) (8) Here, is the number of radial sections, and in this study, 20 was selected.
    Standard deviations can be calculated using equations (5), (6), (7), (8) and used
    for the objective function. (9) Here, is the spread area of the spray, and are
    the standard deviations of droplet size and water flux for each radial section,
    and are the standard deviations of droplet size and water flux calculated by sampling
    the average value of each radial section. Every value has a different range, so
    it was compared against each reference value. The direction of the optimization
    is determined by the objective function. In the first optimization step, optimization
    was conducted to maximize the objective function. The droplet size and water flux
    calculated by sampling the average value of the radial section must have a low
    standard deviation to increase uniformity, whereas those calculated for each radial
    section must have a higher standard deviation to ensure that the various droplet
    sizes and water fluxes exist in each radial section. The objective function was
    constructed by considering these conditions. The meaning of each component in
    the objective function is summarized in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image

    function for the first optimization step. Ten populations were used in optimization:
    two random generator seeds were used and eight populations were generated by the
    GA algorithm during the optimization. Two random generator seeds were used for
    each generation to avoid falling into local optimizations. The initial population
    consisted of one reference injection pattern calculated from a commercial sprinkler
    head and nine randomly generated populations. When the maximum objective function
    value was maintained for 100 generations, the optimization process was stopped
    and judged to be the optimal solution. 2.1.2. The second optimization step The
    second optimization step finds the sprinkler head design that generates an optimized
    injection pattern derived in the first optimization step. To simplify the problem,
    the effects of the frame arm were neglected as in the first optimization step.
    Also, the sector of the sprinkler head was analyzed to reduce computational costs.
    Fig. 4 shows the shape of the sprinkler head viewed on top and the optimization
    parameters in the second optimization step. The sprinkler head consists of tines,
    slots, and a boss. The radius of the boss at the bottom was fixed and that at
    the top (rboss) was chosen as an optimization parameter. The distance between
    the sprinkler head center and center of a circle consisting of slot (A), the radius
    of a circle consisting of slot (B), the distance between the ends of the circle
    making up the tine and slot (C), and the angle of the circular part of the slot
    (θ1) are chosen to be optimization parameters. By reducing the angle θ1 within
    the feasible geometries, the deflector will have a shallow slot design. By increasing
    the angle θ1 up to 90° within the feasible geometries, the deflector can have
    shallow or deep slots depending on the length of C. The maximum and minimum values
    of optimization parameters and their steps are summarized in Table 2. The other
    factors consisting of sprinkler geometry can be derived with optimization parameters
    as follows: (10) (11) Download : Download high-res image (191KB) Download : Download

    Step 0.0001 0.0001 0.0001 1 0.0005 The deflector thickness, height of boss, and
    sector angle (2θ2) were fixed to 0.001 m, 0.007 m, and 2π/N which is derived from
    the first optimization step. To avoid evaluating the unfeasible design, four constraints
    were adopted. For brevity, detailed derivations of the equations were omitted.
    It can be derived through geometry. The first and second constraints prevent the
    distance between the slot and the boss not to close and are calculated as follows:
    (12) (13) The coordinate of the point where the circular part of the tine meets
    line C should be within the sector boundary. From this, the third constraint was
    formulated as follows: (14) The deflector size must be much less than the injection
    pattern data acquisition location (r = 5 cm). To satisfy this, the fourth constraint
    was formulated as follows: (15) The amount of consistency with the optimized injection
    pattern should be evaluated for optimization. By neglecting the region where the
    water volume fraction is less than 0.01, the objective function for the second
    optimization step is calculated as follows: (16) (17) Here, is Euclidean norm,
    is Hadamar product, is the average of elements, and returns the vector consisting
    of greater and lower elements of the vector for each, is a vector consisting of
    one, is a vector consisting of time-averaged water volume fraction for 0.02s,
    the vector consists of components and it means the normalized minimum distance
    between the data acquisition point and optimized injection pattern. The size of
    all the vectors is equal to the number of points in the data acquisition plane.
    The lower the objective function value, the more the injection pattern produced
    by the sprinkler head design is consistent with the optimized injection pattern.
    The first Euclidean norm calculates a smaller value when the water is distributed
    near the optimized injection pattern. In preliminary testing, the objective function
    consisting of only the first Euclidean norm showed zero when no water is delivered
    to the data acquisition plane and determined a wrong optimization solution. To
    avoid this problem, the average volume fraction of the water was added to the
    denominator. Also, there was a problem where water was delivered to only a portion
    of the optimized injection pattern. To avoid this, the objective function includes
    the second Euclidean norm that represents a smaller value when the water is dispersed.
    Ten populations with two random generator seeds were used for the second optimization
    step as same as the first optimization step. The other eight populations were
    generated by the GA algorithm during the optimization. The initial population
    consists of one reference sprinkler shape which is calculated from a commercial
    sprinkler head and nine randomly generated shapes. When the minimum objective
    function value is maintained for 50 generations, the optimization process was
    stopped because it took a lot of computational costs. 2.2. Numerical models In
    this study, the first optimization step was conducted with Lagrangian spray modeling,
    and the second optimization step was conducted with Eulerian spray modeling. The
    numerical models used in each step are described in this section. 2.2.1. Numerical
    models for the first optimization step The first optimization step utilizes FDS
    version 6.7.5. In FDS, Deardorff''s [27] Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model is
    used with Van Driest damping [28] for turbulence modeling. Lagrangian spray modeling
    requires the interaction between Lagrangian particles (droplets) and Eulerian
    fluid flow (air). The drag force acting on spray particles reduces the maximum
    distance that droplets travel. Also, the penetrating of droplets through air induces
    the flow. The momentum transferred from particles to gas is calculated as follows:
    (18) Here, is the cell volume, is the gas density, is the drag coefficient, is
    the cross-sectional area of the droplet, is the droplet velocity vector, is the
    gas velocity vector, and is the mass of droplet. The second term means the momentum
    transfer by the evaporation of the droplet. Droplet velocity is also affected
    by the drag force and is determined by the following equation: (19) Here, is the
    gravitational acceleration vector. The drag coefficient for a spherical droplet
    is expressed by the droplet Reynolds number. (20) 2.2.2. Numerical models for
    the second optimization step The second optimization step was performed by OpenFOAM-v2006.
    When the initial spray is analyzed with VoF model, the VoF model is generally
    integrated with LES turbulence model [26,29,30]. This is to properly capture the
    atomization process caused by unstable wave growth at the liquid-gas interface.
    However, in this simulation, the time-averaged injection pattern was focused,
    therefore Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) based model was used for turbulence
    modeling. The SST k-ω switches from the k-ε model to the k-ω model depending on
    the distance from the wall [31]. It is appropriate to analyze both the water on
    the deflector and the spray formed by the sprinkler head. For this reason, it
    was adopted in this study. To analyze the liquid (water) and gas (air) phases,
    the VoF model should be used. It solves the additional liquid volume fraction
    transport equation: (21) Here, is the volume fraction of water, is the velocity
    in direction. The fluid properties, such as the density and the viscosity of fluid
    cell is defined by (22) (23) Here, and are the density and the viscosity of computational
    cell, and are the densities of water and air, and are the viscosities of water
    and the air. In this study, the densities of water and air were set to 998.3 kg/m3
    and 1.277 kg/m3, respectively, and the viscosities of water and air were set to
    1.00149 × 10−3 Pa∙s and 1.71105 × 10−5 Pa∙s, respectively. When the water volume
    fraction of the cell is between 0 and 1, surface tension force should be considered
    for that cell. The surface tension force was modeled by the continuum surface
    force (CSF) model [32]. The surface tension force is calculated by (24) (25) (26)
    Here, is surface tension, and is the curvature of the water-air interface. In
    this study, 0.07288 N/m was used for the surface tension of water. To suppress
    the diffusion of water volume fraction, the IsoAdvector method [33] was used in
    this study. 2.3. Computational set-up This chapter is divided into two sections.
    As in section 2.2, the first section describes the computational set-up for the
    first optimization step and the second section describes that for the second optimization
    step. 2.3.1. Computational set-up for the first optimization step A computational
    domain with a height of 3 m was used. To include all supplied sprinkler sprays,
    the distance from the sprinkler head to the domain boundary was set to 7.5 m.
    The symmetric boundary condition was used to reduce the computational costs. The
    floor was set to a wall and the side and ceiling were set to open boundary conditions.
    The computational domain and boundary conditions are shown in Fig. 5. The domain
    was divided by mesh sizes of 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 m to investigate the mesh size
    dependency. This size of mesh generated 21.6 million, 2.7 million, and 337,500
    cells. Download : Download high-res image (687KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. Computational domain for the first optimization step: (a) domain
    dimension and (b) the example parcel image from the simulation for reference injection
    pattern. The sprinkler head considered in this study has an orifice diameter of
    0.0103 m and a K factor of 80 lpm/bar0.5. The initial injection pattern was set
    at 0.05 m from the center of the sprinkler head. A volume median diameter (Dv50)
    of 0.001 m was used as the initial condition for sprinkler spray [34,35]. A size
    distribution under Dv50 has a lognormal distribution and a size distribution above
    Dv50 has a rosin-rammler distribution. All the coefficients describing the droplet
    size distribution were set as the default values of FDS [36]. The initial droplet
    velocity was derived from Bernoulli''s equation, assuming the supplying pressure
    of 0.1 MPa corresponding to the minimum required pressure in South Korea [37].
    Although the optimization was performed at a fixed supply pressure, the optimized
    design will still be valid even if the supply pressure changes, as the overall
    water flux distribution pattern is known to be maintained even when the supply
    pressure changes [24]. However, when the K-factor changes, the nozzle diameter
    changes and the relative position between the nozzle and the boss-deflector assembly
    changes. For this reason, the optimized design will only be valid for a K-factor
    of 80 LPM/(0.1 MPa)0.5, which is the value used in this study. Injection patterns
    generated with the optimization parameters were discretized at 2° intervals. The
    flow rate flowing through the tines and slots is not evenly distributed and depends
    on the sprinkler head design. However, to the best of the author''s knowledge,
    there is no known relationship between the flow rate ratio distributed across
    the tines and slots and the injection pattern (or the sprinkler head design).
    For this reason, the flow rate was assumed to be evenly distributed along the
    azimuth. The effect of the number of parcels introduced in seconds was investigated
    and it was set to 2500, 5000, 10,000, and 20,000 parcels per second. The simulation
    time was 1 min and the result data was averaged over the last 30 s. A normalized
    radial coordinate was used for analysis. The maximum droplet reaches without drag
    was introduced by Prahl and Wendt [38] and calculated by (27) Here, is the initial
    radial velocity, is the initial vertical velocity, is the vertical distance between
    the sprinkler head and data acquisition location, and is the gravitational acceleration.
    The radial distance was divided by the maximum droplet reach for normalizing (
    ) when the spray data was analyzed. 2.3.2. Computational set-up for the second
    optimization step The sector mesh was used to reduce the computational time. The
    sector angle was derived from the first optimization step. Fig. 6 shows the computational
    domain for the second optimization step. The radial size of the domain was set
    to 0.075 m because the data acquisition surface is located at a radial distance
    of 0.05 m. The atomization is known to occur in the region corresponding to a
    radius of 0.1–0.4 m from the sprinkler head [39]. However, the atomization process
    is beyond the scope of this study, and a domain size of 0.075 m is sufficient
    to investigate the time-averaged water flow near the sprinkler head. The orifice
    dimension and the vertical location of the deflector were calculated from the
    commercial sprinkler. A mesh size of 0.0005 m was used near the deflector and
    that of 0.001 m was used far from the deflector. The total number of cells depends
    on the deflector and boss designs as the meshes are automatically generated during
    the optimization to evaluate the deflector and boss designs. The number of cells
    for the reference case was 600,000 cells. For the analysis after optimization,
    the same simulation was conducted with half the mesh size used in optimization.
    The inlet pressure was increased to 0.1 MPa for 0.01 s for numerical stability
    and then set to constant pressure. The top surface was set to a wall, bottom and
    outer surfaces were set to constant total pressure boundary conditions. The side
    surfaces were set to periodic boundary conditions. The mesh was generated automatically
    during the optimization process with the settings described above. The simulation
    was performed for 0.03 s, which was sufficient time to see the steady flow. The
    water volume fraction at the data acquisition surface was averaged for 0.02 s.
    The data acquisition points on the data acquisition surface were set at intervals
    of 1° in the azimuth direction and 1 mm in the vertical direction. Download :

    domain for the second optimization step. 3. Results and discussion This section
    is divided into four parts. The results from the first optimization step and its
    evaluation are described in the first to third parts and the results of the second
    optimization step are described in the last part. The determination of simulation
    settings is discussed in the first part. Using the simulation settings discussed
    in the first part, the injection pattern was optimized in non-fire conditions,
    which is discussed in the second part. Finally, the third part deals with the
    difference between the reference and optimized deflector designs. 3.1. Determination
    of simulation settings Before the optimization process, the effects of mesh size
    and the number of parcels introduced into the domain per second on results were
    studied. Fig. 7 shows the average and standard deviation values of droplet diameter
    and particle flux and spread area depending on the mesh size and the number of
    parcels. Looking at the results based on the number of parcels introduced into
    the domain, in the case of 2500 parcels per second, the results showed noticeably
    different results at a mesh size of 0.025 m. However, there was no significant
    difference depending on the mesh size considered in this simulation except for
    the case mentioned above. Also, it was found that the effect of the number of
    parcels per second was not sensitive to the fire suppression characteristics [17].
    Therefore, a mesh size of 0.1 m with 5000 parcels per second was adopted to reduce
    the computational time for optimization. The results for this setting are compared
    with the results from the case in which the mesh size is 0.025 m and the number
    of parcels per second is 10,000. This is because this condition has the highest
    resolution among the tested cases and the errors with the neighboring conditions
    (condition 1: mesh size—0.05 m (changed), number of parcels per second—10,000
    (maintained) and condition 2: mesh size—0.025 m (maintained), number of parcels
    per second—5000 (changed)) for average droplet size, average water flux, and spread
    area were kept under 2 %. The highest error was 11.8 % for the standard deviation
    of droplet size. It was determined to be an acceptable error for optimization.

    Fig. 7. Spray characteristics for various mesh sizes and the number of parcels:
    (a) average droplet diameter, (b) average water flux, and (c) spread area. Using
    the determined simulation settings, droplet diameters depending on the radial
    location were compared with previous experimental data by Ren et al. [8] (Fig.
    8). In their study, the sprinkler of which orifice diameter of 19.5 mm and K factor
    of 25.9 lpm/bar0.5 was used with injection pressure between 0.69 and 2.76 bar.
    This operating condition and the orifice dimension differ from this study, however,
    it is suggested that the drop size over normalized radial distance is independent
    of nozzle size and the injection pressure [8]. For this reason, the drop size
    calculated in this study was compared with the experimental data by Ren et al.
    [8]. Although it was calculated for different shapes of sprinkler heads, droplet
    size depending on the normalized radial location predicted by simulation showed
    similar results to the experiment. After the normalized radial distance of 0.6,
    the simulation showed a much larger droplet size than the experiment. In the study
    of Ren et al. [8], the tendency for drop size to increase with increasing normalized
    radial distance was not continued after the normalized radial distance of 0.6
    because Dv50 greater than 0.8 mm couldn''t be measured with their Malvern instrument.
    This could be one of the possible reasons for the large differences in the region
    with normalized radial distances greater than 0.6. From the dependency study of
    mesh size and the number of parcels, and the comparison with experimentally measured
    droplet radii for the normalized radial location, the mesh size was determined

    set to 10,000. Considering the size of the mesh, variables required to calculate
    the objective function (droplet diameter, droplet velocity, number density of
    droplets) was obtained at a height of 0.1 m from the floor and at intervals of
    0.1 m in the horizontal plane. Download : Download high-res image (276KB) Download

    conditions Fig. 9 shows the history of the maximum objective function value and
    components consisting of the objective function. The optimized injection pattern
    was generated at the 130th generation. During the optimization, the sum of the
    standard deviation for droplet size (ΣσD30,i) increased dramatically. This means
    that the diversity of the droplet size in each radial section increased. Also,
    the standard deviation of average droplet size in the radial direction (σD30,r)
    decreased significantly. This is important because a variety of droplet sizes
    in each radial section with similar average droplet sizes in each radial section
    means that the droplets with various sizes are distributed evenly in the radial
    direction, and similar fire suppression performance could be achieved in the radial
    direction. The other components consisting of the objective function such as the
    sum of the standard deviation for water flux in each radial section, the standard
    deviation of average water flux in the radial direction, and the spread area improved
    compared to the reference design. However, the degree of improvement was less
    than that of the standard deviations for droplet size. Download : Download high-res

    From the database achieved during optimization, the Spearman correlation coefficient
    for optimization parameters and targets (components consisting of the objective
    function) was calculated in Table 3. The Spearman correlation coefficient describes
    the correlation between two variables, especially when the relationship is monotonic
    [40]. All data calculated during the optimization process were used to derive
    the Spearman correlation coefficient. The higher the Spearman correlation coefficient,
    the greater the influence of the optimization parameter on the target. The most
    significant optimization parameters were and . These parameters mean the vertical
    amplitude of the injection pattern. These affect the standard deviations related
    to water flux and spread area significantly. The effects of on targets are shown
    in Fig. 10. The sum of standard deviations for droplet size in each radial section
    ( ) was not significantly affected by . Only a slight decrease was observed. The
    standard deviation of average droplet size in a radial direction ( ) also increased
    with increasing for small values of and no significant change was observed after
    of 0.04 m. The standard deviations related to water flux ( , ) were related to
    with an exponent of two or greater. Large means that the spray angle calculated
    from the horizontal plane increases. Therefore, a large number of large droplets
    reached the field under the sprinkler head. This caused an increase in the standard
    deviations related to water flux. Table 3. Spearman correlation coefficient for

    at each radial section, (b) sum of standard deviations for water flux at each
    radial section, (c) standard deviations of average droplet diameter in the radial
    direction, (d) standard deviations of average water flux in the radial direction,
    and (e) spread area. The reference and optimized injection patterns are depicted
    in Fig. 11. The sector angle increased from 20° to 30° and the vertical amplitude
    of the spray increased. It is shown that the slope of the injection patterns between
    the reference and optimized case is similar to each other because the amplitude
    of the injection pattern increased with the increasing sector angle. The gap between
    the upper and lower limits at the slot (the angular location of 0° and 30°) was
    thicker than that at the tine (the angular location of 15°) in the optimized injection
    pattern. This could help the wide distribution of droplets in the radial direction.
    A thin injection pattern at tine was generated at a higher location in the optimized
    case. It could increase the spread area by increasing the radial reach. Therefore,
    thinning the tine stream and thickening the slot stream by directing the flow
    from the tines to the slots is beneficial for increasing uniformity. Download

    Reference and optimized injection patterns. The droplet diameter, the vertical
    velocity of the droplet, the number of droplets, and the water flux on the floor
    are shown in Fig. 12. The farther the location, the larger the droplet diameter
    was calculated because the larger droplet has the higher inertia. When the droplet
    size is large, gravity dominates over drag. Therefore, the droplet vertical velocity
    was higher in the far region from the sprinkler head. A large number of droplets
    was observed at the center of the floor. It is because the smaller droplets with
    low inertia are guided into the central region by air entrainment. The water flux
    is calculated by a combination of the droplet size, the droplet vertical velocity,
    and the number of droplets. It was distributed from the middle to the end in the
    radial direction. The water flux at the center was very low despite many droplets
    because only small droplets exist in the center region. Compared to the water
    flux of the reference case, the optimized case showed a wide distribution of water
    flux. Optimization improved the radial distribution of the particle flux, however,
    reduced azimuth uniformity (especially at the extreme limits of sprinkler spray).

    designs, droplet numbers of (e) reference and (f) optimized design, and water
    flux of (g) reference and (h) optimized design. The average droplet size and water
    flux at each radial section are depicted in Fig. 13. Although the initial injection
    pattern was assumed to be a shape of the sine function with uniform droplet size
    and velocity, the overall trend in radial distributions of droplet radius and
    water flux was observed to be similar to the previous experimental data [41].
    The droplet diameter increased with radial distance, and the water flux increased
    up to a certain radial distance from the sprinkler head and then decreased to
    the spray boundary. The average droplet size in the middle of the radial direction
    increased after optimization. There was no significant difference in other locations.
    An increase in droplet size in the middle of the radial direction increased the
    water flux in the same region. The water flux for the optimized injection pattern
    showed a more uniform distribution. The peak value decreased and water flux has
    a wide distribution in the middle. The larger vertical amplitude of the injection
    pattern produced the water flux in the middle zone resulting in a more uniform
    distribution of droplet size and water flux. The droplet size and the water flux
    distribution didn''t change significantly because the spray formation mechanism,
    in which the water impinges on the boss and deflector to form a sinusoidal injection
    pattern, was maintained in this study. Download : Download high-res image (415KB)

    design The optimized sprinkler head design was derived from the second optimization
    step. Fig. 14 shows the history of the minimum value of the objective function.
    The lower the value, the more similar the injection pattern design is achieved.
    The final design was generated in the 44th generation. Finding a sprinkler head
    design that produced the same injection pattern derived in the first optimization
    step was difficult because it assumed a sine function with some error from the
    actual injection pattern generated by the sprinkler head. Download : Download

    due to increased sector angle. It is shown that there were vertical and horizontal
    sheets made at the slot and tine stream and a region that connected these two
    sheets. Although the water volume fraction contour produced by the optimized sprinkler
    head design has some difference from the target volume fraction contour, it is
    an acceptable level considering the error between the actual injection pattern
    and the assumed injection pattern. The discrepancy between the target injection
    pattern and the optimized injection patterns was caused by the mismatch between
    the actual injection pattern and the assumption of a sinusoid injection pattern.

    head design with optimization parameters are shown in Fig. 16. The optimized design
    was scaled up compared to the reference design while the boss design was maintained.
    The more protruding tine design is to generate a higher injection pattern in the
    tine stream and the more concave slot shape is to generate a larger amplitude
    of the injection pattern. The final optimized sprinkler head design means that
    the boss design of the commercial sprinkler heads can be kept in future development,
    while the deflector design still has room for further improvement by protruding
    the tines more and changing the slots to be deeper. Download : Download high-res

    design for improved uniformity was derived by two-step optimization. The first
    step optimized the injection pattern at 0.05 m from the center of the sprinkler
    head and the second step derived the optimized sprinkler head design. The flow
    rate was fixed at 80 LPM and optimization was performed for non-fire conditions,
    so caution is required when applying conditions different from those used in this
    study. The main results of this study are summarized as follows: (1) The vertical
    amplitude of the injection pattern was the most important factor for the uniform
    distributions of droplet size and water flux. The standard deviations related
    to water flux increased with the vertical amplitude of the injection pattern,
    the standard deviation related to the droplet size showed a weak relationship
    with the vertical amplitude of the injection pattern, and the spread area decreased
    as the vertical amplitude of the injection pattern increases. (2) The optimized
    injection pattern had a thin thickness in the tine stream targeting high directions.
    Also, it exhibited a large section angle and a large vertical amplitude. This
    pattern resulted in a larger droplet size in the middle of the radial direction,
    resulting in a wider distribution of water flux. (3) Spray characteristics under
    non-fire conditions were valid under fire conditions. The optimized injection
    pattern showed a wider fire-extinguished area and lower standard deviations of
    droplet size and water flux in most cases of heat flux. (4) The optimized sprinkler
    head design had the same boss dimension and scaled-up deflector design. The slot
    was more concave to produce a large vertical amplitude of the injection pattern,
    and the tine was more protruding to produce a thinner injection pattern targeting
    higher. CRediT author contribution statement Taehoon Kim: Conceptualization, Methodology,

  description: Accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ETr) is important
    for irrigation planning, water resource management, and preserving agricultural
    and forest habitats. The widely used Penman–Monteith equation (ASCE-PM) estimates
    ETr across various timescales using ground weather station data. However, discrepancies
    persist between estimated ETr and measured ETr obtained from weighing lysimeters
    (ETr-lys), particularly in advective environments. This study assessed different
    machine learning (ML) models in comparison to ASCE-PM for ETr estimation in highly
    advective conditions. Various variable combinations, representing both radiation
    and aerodynamic components, were organized for evaluation. Eleven datasets (DT)
    were created for the daily timescale, while seven were established for hourly
    and quarter-hourly timescales. ML models were optimized by a genetic algorithm
    (GA) and included support vector regression (GA-SVR), random forest (GA-RF), artificial
    neural networks (GA-ANN), and extreme learning machines (GA-ELM). Meteorological
    data and direct measurements of well-watered alfalfa grown under reference ET
    conditions obtained from weighing lysimeters and a nearby weather station in Bushland,
    Texas (1996–1998), were used for training and testing. Model performance was assessed
    using metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE),
    mean bias error (MBE), and coefficient of determination (R2). ASCE-PM consistently
    underestimated alfalfa ET across all timescales (above 7.5 mm/day, 0.6 mm/h, and
    0.2 mm/h daily, hourly, and quarter-hourly, respectively). On hourly and quarter-hourly
    timescales, datasets predominantly composed of radiation components or a blend
    of radiation and aerodynamic components demonstrated superior performance. Conversely,
    datasets primarily composed of aerodynamic components exhibited enhanced performance
    on a daily timescale. Overall, GA-ELM outperformed the other models and was thus
    recommended for ETr estimation at all timescales. The findings emphasize the significance
    of ML models in accurately estimating ETr across varying temporal resolutions,
    crucial for effective water management, water resources, and agricultural planning.

    Accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ETr) is important for irrigation
    planning, water resource management, and preserving agricultural and forest habitats.
    The widely used Penman–Monteith equation (ASCE-PM) estimates ETr across various
    timescales using ground weather station data. However, discrepancies persist between
    estimated ETr and measured ETr obtained from weighing lysimeters (ETr-lys), particularly
    in advective environments. This study assessed different machine learning (ML)
    models in comparison to ASCE-PM for ETr estimation in highly advective conditions.
    Various variable combinations, representing both radiation and aerodynamic components,
    were organized for evaluation. Eleven datasets (DT) were created for the daily
    timescale, while seven were established for hourly and quarter-hourly timescales.
    ML models were optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA) and included support vector
    regression (GA-SVR), random forest (GA-RF), artificial neural networks (GA-ANN),
    and extreme learning machines (GA-ELM). Meteorological data and direct measurements
    of well-watered alfalfa grown under reference ET conditions obtained from weighing
    lysimeters and a nearby weather station in Bushland, Texas (1996–1998), were used
    for training and testing. Model performance was assessed using metrics such as
    root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean bias error (MBE),
    and coefficient of determination (R2). ASCE-PM consistently underestimated alfalfa
    ET across all timescales (above 7.5 mm/day, 0.6 mm/h, and 0.2 mm/h daily, hourly,
    and quarter-hourly, respectively). On hourly and quarter-hourly timescales, datasets
    predominantly composed of radiation components or a blend of radiation and aerodynamic
    components demonstrated superior performance. Conversely, datasets primarily composed
    of aerodynamic components exhibited enhanced performance on a daily timescale.
    Overall, GA-ELM outperformed the other models and was thus recommended for ETr
    estimation at all timescales. The findings emphasize the significance of ML models
    in accurately estimating ETr across varying temporal resolutions, crucial for
    effective water management, water resources, and agricultural planning. Keywords:

    (ET) is a significant factor in the hydrological cycle and is frequently used
    to calculate hydrological losses through several important processes that take
    place between the ground and the atmosphere. It is essential for the optimal design
    of irrigation schedules [1], management of regional water resources [2], and estimation
    of different hydrological processes [3]. ET has a significant impact on several
    terrestrial ecosystem processes as well as pertinent characteristics, such as
    soil water content and energy balances [4]. Considerable progress in estimating
    ET and understanding the mechanisms of its ongoing variations in daily, annual,
    and inter-annual timescales has been made through numerous studies, motivated
    by the early awareness of the importance of water as an essential resource for
    life sustainability on earth. Despite the findings in these studies, the complex
    and nonlinear processes that dominate evapotranspiration have made its estimation
    a great challenge, partly due to several influencing factors, such as landform,
    geomorphological, soil moisture, and vegetation traits [5,6,7]. In this context,
    the precise estimation of ET is still of particular importance for careful water
    resource management. An overview of the evolution of ET-estimating methods during
    the previous century was discussed in Ref. [8], and these methods are often classified
    as direct and indirect. Direct methods, such as lysimeters and micrometeorological
    techniques, demand special construction and high maintenance, which is expensive.
    Indirect methods, on the other hand, are less expensive and time-saving and are
    in some contexts regarded as suitable alternatives to the direct ones. The indirect
    methods are commonly classified into water-balance-based, radiation-based, mass-transfer-based,
    and temperature-based models [9]. Because it considers both aerodynamic and thermodynamic
    factors, the FAO Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) model for calculating the ET of a reference
    short (grass) crop continues to be the most extensively used indirect method for
    ETr estimation in a variety of regions and climates [10]. The Food and Agriculture
    Organization (FAO) approved the equation after determining that it accounts for
    all the variables influencing evapotranspiration and fixes most of the flaws in
    the other empirical techniques. The Penman–Monteith Equation was slightly modified
    and standardized by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) for both tall
    crop (alfalfa) (ETrs) and short crop (clipped grass) surfaces with similar parameterizations
    as the FAO-PM for computation of the equation components after national and international
    discussions on the adoption of a taller reference crop [11]. The result was the
    ASCE-PM equation, and it was formulated to allow calculations for both daily and
    hourly or shorter time steps [12]. The complexity involved in the calculations
    of all the required inputs in the ASCE-PM is a disadvantage for its application,
    which could lead to significant errors [13]. Another drawback in using the ASCE-PM
    is the difficulty in obtaining the extensive weather data needed and the absence
    of adequate historical records for each study location, which are crucial aspects
    for calculating reliable ETr estimates [4]. This can be particularly challenging
    in developing countries, where there are limited meteorological stations and a
    scarcity of weather data records. Reference evapotranspiration depends on latitude,
    altitude, and several climatic variables, such as relative humidity, air temperature,
    soil temperature, wind speed, net radiation, and dew point temperature [14]; several
    researchers have utilized a combination of these different parameters to model
    ETo using machine learning models at daily and monthly timescales to overcome
    the identified limitations and difficulties of traditional methods [15]. CatBoost,
    generalized regression neural network (GRNN), and the random forest (RF) models
    were evaluated for estimating daily ETo in the arid and semi-arid regions of northern
    China, using limited meteorological data with eight different combinations of
    inputs [16]. It was found that CatBoost demonstrated superior performance and
    was identified as the most effective method for estimating ETo. The efficiency
    of extreme learning machines (ELM) was compared to the empirical Penman–Monteith
    equation and the feedforward backpropagation (FFBP) in predicting ETo for three
    meteorological stations in Iraq, utilizing meteorological data from thirteen years
    (2000–2013) as inputs [5]. They concluded that the ELM model demonstrated efficiency,
    simplicity, high speed, and good generalization performance for ETo estimation.
    Four different variants of an extreme learning machine (ELM) model optimized using
    bio-inspired search algorithms were evaluated to estimate daily reference evapotranspiration
    (ETr) across various regions in China using data from eight meteorological stations
    [1]. The results highlighted the effectiveness of bio-inspired optimization algorithms,
    particularly the FPA and CSA algorithms, in enhancing the performance of the conventional
    ELM model for daily ETo prediction. Kernel-based (Gaussian process regression
    (GPR), support vector regression (SVR)) and deep learning methods (Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno
    artificial neural network (BFGS-ANN)) were compared to long short-term memory
    (LSTM) for estimation of monthly reference evapotranspiration using minimal meteorological
    parameters in ten different combinations [17]. The results showed that all four
    methods predicted ETo amounts with acceptable accuracy and error levels. Due to
    consistent climatic changes and the complexity of the evapotranspiration process
    that leads to its high variability in time and space, in this study, modeling
    the ETr was extended to quarter-hourly and hourly timescales. Meteorological data
    at high temporal resolution has become easier to collect due to the recent advancements
    in the development of automatic weather stations [18]. This, in turn, boosts the
    estimation of ETr at such resolutions, which is commonly used for calibrating
    surface energy balance models in the determination of geospatial evapotranspiration
    from drone imagery or satellite images [19,20]. Therefore, assessing the performance
    of the ASCE-PM at timescales lower than the daily interval is increasingly becoming
    necessary. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies that have evaluated
    the use of ML models for the estimation of ETr at lower timescales, such as hourly
    or quarter-hourly with varied meteorological input data. In addition, studies
    that evaluated ETr at a daily timescale mostly considered parameters directly
    measured from weather stations. This is desirable for the estimation of reference
    evapotranspiration in areas with incomplete meteorological data [9]. However,
    the sensitivity of ETr to different meteorological variables (directly measured
    or those calculated from directly measured) has been studied [21,22], and they
    were all found to influence the energy budget of the surface [23]. Changes in
    wind speed produced the largest decrease in ETr, followed by vapor pressure, net
    radiation, and mean temperature [21]. Also, computed ETr was found to be most
    sensitive to net radiation, followed by vapor pressure deficit and wind travel
    transfers; the contribution of the aerodynamic and net radiation components to
    the ETr value varied throughout the year [24]. The difference in the contribution
    of these components could be attributed to the difference in climates [8]. Therefore,
    it is evident that for proper evapotranspiration estimation, proper assessment
    of all meteorological parameters (directly measured or not) is necessary. In this
    study, we combined directly measured weather parameters with subsequently calculated
    parameters for ETr estimation using machine learning models. Advantages of ML
    include the ability to use reduced data inputs, capturing non-linearity in the
    data inputs, and utilizing the computing power of modern-day computer systems
    to analyze big data. Collectively, these factors have made ML algorithms attractive
    options for estimating ETr. The choice of the best possible algorithm and the
    choice of adequately representative variables are among the challenging aspects
    of any ML task [25]. Moreover, the performance of ML algorithms strongly depends
    on the size and structure of available data [25]. To improve performance, several
    bio-inspired algorithms, such as GA, are coupled with ML models to find the optimal
    set of parameters during model training [1,5]. This is because default optimization
    algorithms, such as backpropagation, are often trapped in the local minima, several
    parameters influence its speed and robustness, and its best parameters appear
    to vary from problem to problem [26]. Unlike the backpropagation technique that
    always adjusts weights towards the descending direction of the error function,
    GA is a parallel stochastic optimization algorithm good at global searching. The
    drawback of GA is its slowness during model training due to its exploration mechanism
    through reproduction, crossover, and mutation, as well as searching for optimal
    solutions from random genes [27,28]. Nonetheless, GA provides multiple optimal
    solutions from the search space, and has thus gained prominence in recent years.
    For evapotranspiration studies, ML models coupled with GA were found to perform
    better than the corresponding single models [29,30,31,32]. Therefore, in this
    paper, GA was utilized to optimize ML models and compared to standardized ASCE-PM
    for ETr estimation on daily, hourly, and quarter-hourly timescales considering
    different input meteorological variables. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Lysimetric
    and Weather Data Collection A research study was set up for the actual estimation
    of alfalfa reference evapotranspiration in Bushland, Texas, facility of the USDA
    Agricultural Research Service Conservation and Production Research Laboratory,
    in 1996. Bushland has a semi-arid climate that is impacted by local and regional
    advection events [33]. The site was subdivided into two square fields, designated
    northeast (NE) and southeast (SE), each measuring ~5.0 ha. Monolithic weighing
    lysimeters (NE and SE) with 3 m × 3 m surface dimensions and 2.4 m deep were located
    at the center of each of the two fields. These were used for the direct measurement
    of ETr-lys. The details about the study area and the lysimeter’s site in Bushland
    (35°11′ N, 102°6′ W, and 1170 m above MSL) can be found in Refs. [34,35]. Alfalfa
    was seeded in the two fields, which were irrigated simultaneously by a Lindsay
    lateral move sprinkler system to maintain a well-watered condition. Experiments
    were conducted for 4 years from 1996 through 1999 [36], but the data for the year
    1999 were omitted in this study because reference conditions for a tall reference
    crop (alfalfa) were not always met [10]. The leaf area index (LAI), growth stage,
    and plant height were measured periodically between and at each harvest in each
    field (Figure 1). The whole planting and agronomic management of alfalfa crops
    during the four-year growing period were described in Ref. [36], and the data
    and metadata are available in Ref. [37]. Figure 1. Alfalfa harvesting patterns
    and days when alfalfa height and LAI measurements were taken for growing seasons
    from 1996 to 1998. The methodology for meteorological data acquisition was extensively
    described in Refs. [35,36] and are available in Ref. [38]; therefore, only the
    measured variables and other noteworthy points will be presented in this work.
    Meteorological measurements were made at 5 s intervals and reported as quarter-hourly
    averages. This meteorological data, including the mean air temperature at 2.0
    m height, mean relative humidity at 1.8 m height, mean wind speed at 2.0 m height,
    and mean solar irradiance were necessary to obtain the ETr calculated in this
    study. 2.2. Data Processing Lysimeter and meteorology data were processed and
    analyzed under three different timescales: quarter-hourly, hourly, and daily.
    Only the days when alfalfa height was at least 0.5 m were used in this study in
    accordance with reference conditions for a tall reference crop (alfalfa) [10].
    Also, days were not considered if irrigation or rainfall affected the accuracy
    of the water balance calculations for measured ETr or if the crop was lodged or
    badly watered. Figure 2 shows the Kc values for the days selected in this study.
    Note that the Kc values were often >1, which indicates that alfalfa ET under reference
    conditions exceeded the ASCE 2005 PM reference ET in the advective environment
    of Bushland. Figure 2. Kc values for the days when reference conditions were met
    for alfalfa growing period (1996–1998). ETr-lys values from the NE and SE lysimeters
    were averaged for each of the data points to obtain the full ETr-lys dataset under
    the quarter-hourly timescale. The hourly ETr-lys was computed as the sum of four
    (4) consecutive quarter-hourly readings, while the same number of readings were
    averaged to obtain the mean hourly values of the meteorological variables (air
    temperature, wind speed, solar radiation, relative humidity). On the daily timescale,
    the daily ETr-lys was computed as the sum of all ninety-six (96) consecutive quarter-hourly
    readings, while the meteorological variables were extracted as follows; the maximum
    and minimum values of temperature and relative humidity were taken as the maximum
    and minimum of the 15 min average values for a given day, respectively. The ninety-six
    (96) consecutive quarter-hourly readings were averaged to obtain the mean daily
    values of the meteorological variables (wind speed, solar radiation, temperature).
    This resulted in daily meteorological data, including maximum temperature (Tmax),
    minimum temperature (Tmin), mean wind speed (u2), maximum relative humidity (RHmax),
    minimum relative humidity (RHmin), and mean solar radiation (Rs). 2.3. Calculation
    of Parameters for Reference Evapotranspiration Estimation Equation (1) presents
    the form of the ASCE-PM by Ref. [12] for different time steps. The constants Cd
    and Cn for each of the timescales are shown in Table 1. E T rs = 0.408∆( R n −G)+γ
    C n T+273 u 2 ( e s − e a ) ∆+γ(1+ C d u 2 ) (1) where ETrs is the standardized
    reference crop evapotranspiration for a tall surface (mm d−1 for daily time steps
    or mm h−1 for hourly time steps); Rn is the net radiation at the crop surface
    (MJ m−2 d−1 for daily time steps or MJ m−2 h−1 for hourly time steps); G is the
    soil heat flux density at the soil surface at the daily (MJ m−2 d−1) and hourly
    (MJ m−2 h−1) basis; T is the mean daily or hourly air temperature at 1.5 to 2.5
    m height (°C); u2 is the mean daily wind speed at 2 m height (m s−1); es is the
    saturation vapor pressure at 1.5 to 2.5 m height (kPa); ea is the mean actual
    vapor pressure at 1.5 to 2.5 m height (kPa); ∆ is the slope of the saturation
    vapor pressure–temperature curve (kPa °C−1); γ is the psychrometric constant (kPa
    °C−1); Cn is the numerator constant that changes with reference type and calculation
    time step; and Cd is the denominator constant that changes with reference type
    and calculation time step (s m−1). Table 1. Parameters of the ASCE-PM at different
    timescales. The ASCE-PM reference evapotranspiration was calculated using REF-ET
    software (Version 4.1.4.22) [39], which calculates ETo and ETr for grass and alfalfa
    as short and tall reference crops, respectively, on different timescales. It can
    be used to calculate reference evapotranspiration on monthly, daily, and hourly
    or less timescales, and it has been adopted in several studies [40,41]. The calculated
    ETrs values from the software were compared to the outputs of ML models at daily,
    hourly, and quarter-hourly timescales. 2.4. Machine Learning Algorithms and Optimization
    Four ML models with different operation principles were used in this study to
    estimate ETr: random forest (RF), extreme learning machine (ELM), support vector
    regression (SVR), and artificial neural network (ANN). These models have gained
    prominence in evapotranspiration studies in recent years [42,43]. ELM is different
    from ANN and SVR, as it does not require iterative training, and its hidden layer
    parameters are randomly selected [1]. It was first proposed by Ref. [44] and has
    received wide applicability due to its fast convergence speed, strong generalization
    ability, and no local extrema [45]. RF is a tree-based approach that manages high-dimension
    regression problems, where the final decision results via a bagging procedure.
    The structure of each of these models is shown in Figure 3, but a further detailed
    description of the definitions and principle of operation is out of the scope
    of this paper; it has been extensively discussed elsewhere [46,47,48,49]. Figure
    3. Structure of the machine learning models: ANN (a), SVR (b), ELM (c), and RF
    (d). 2.4.1. Genetic Algorithm The GA is a widely used optimization technique that
    has shown promise in agricultural studies for fine-tuning the parameters of ML
    models [50]. It is an evolutionary algorithm used to search for optimized solutions
    to the natural evolutionary process through simulation [1]. Several evapotranspiration
    studies indicated that coupling GA with machine learning models, such as ANN,
    SVR, and ELM, yields better results than the single models [29,30,31,32]. An extensive
    overview of the implementation of a genetic algorithm including potential integration
    with ML models was provided in Ref. [51]. In this study, its integration with
    ML models is demonstrated in Figure 4. Across all models, the population size,
    mutation probability, crossover probability, and the number of generations of
    the GA were set to 50, 0.2, 0.3, and 5, respectively. Also, input features were
    normalized within the range of [–1, 1] using the Mix and Max method [4]. Figure
    4. Flow diagram for tuning the hyperparameters of the machine learning models.
    For the SVR model, the radial basis function was used as the kernel function,
    and the regularization parameter and kernel parameter (gamma) were optimized with
    them ranging from 5 to 1000, and from 0.05 to 0.99, respectively. For the RF models,
    the maximum depth of the tree (max_depth), the number of features (max_features),
    the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node (min_samples_leaf),
    the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node (min_samples_split),
    and the number of trees in the forest (n_estimators) were optimized ranging from
    5 to 500, from 2 to 6, from 5 to 20, from 5 to 20, and from 1 to 500, respectively.
    The weight matrix and bias vector of the ELM were randomly generated and the activation
    function was set to sigmoid. The hidden units and the regularization parameters
    were optimized from 5 to 1000 and from 0.02 to 0.9, respectively. Detailed descriptions
    of the ELM parameters used in this study are extensively discussed in [44]. The
    ANN model consisted of an input layer, a hidden layer, and the output layer. The
    Rectified Linear Unit (ReLu) was taken as the activation function. The neg_mean_squared_error
    and neg_mean_absolute_error of the scikit-learn package in Pyhtonv3.8 were used
    as the loss functions. The number of neurons and hidden layers were both optimized
    ranging from 3 to 100, while the learning rate was optimized from 0.01 to 0.3.
    Additional parameters were taken as the default values in the scikit-learn package.
    2.4.2. k-Folds Cross Validation The k-fold cross-testing approach was used during
    this phase to train and test the models. The meteorological dataset was randomly
    divided into training and testing datasets, each with 80% and 20% of the total
    data, respectively. The training dataset was then equally divided into five folds,
    of which four were utilized to train the models and one for model testing. To
    make sure that each fold was used at least once for model testing, the procedure
    was carried out five times. The performance of each of the model hyperparameters
    was assessed by the resulting error. The errors of the five trials were averaged
    as the expected generalization error. The parameters that provided the minimum
    average error were returned as the tuned hyperparameters. 2.4.3. Arrangement of
    Datasets for Machine Learning Models The datasets for ML models were arranged
    to reflect the impacts of aerodynamic and radiation components on ETr (Figure
    5). Aerodynamic components are represented by wind speed, relative humidity, and
    vapor pressure deficit (VPD), while radiation components are represented by net
    radiation (Rn), solar irradiance (Rs), air temperature, vapor pressure–temperature
    curve (∆), and the relative cloudiness (Rs/Rso). Figure 5. Representation of radiation
    and aerodynamic components for ETr estimation. Further considerations included
    the simplicity of measuring the weather parameters, the ease of calculation of
    the intermediate parameters, and the completeness of the climatic variables. Parameters
    u2, Rs, and the means, minimums, and maximums of temperature and relative humidity
    can be directly measured by weather stations. Parameters that are calculated from
    the directly measurable variables include the VPD, the Rs/Rso, the ∆, and the
    Rn. The requirement for the calculation of all these parameters for ETr estimation
    has been cited as one of the challenges of the ASCE-PM that could lead to significant
    errors [13]. Such errors could be reduced by determining the most crucial parameters
    that influence evapotranspiration for a given area through machine learning algorithms.
    For this, eleven DTs were considered for the daily timescale, while seven input
    datasets (DTs) were considered for the hourly and quarter-hourly timescales, as
    shown in Table 2. On a daily timescale, DT3, DT5, and DT10 contain all or the
    majority of the aerodynamic components, while DT1, DT4, DT7, and DT8 provide a
    good mix of both aerodynamic and radiation components. The presence of aerodynamic
    components is reduced in DT6, DT9, and DT11. Among these datasets, all the parameters
    in DT8 can be directly measured from a weather station, followed by DT3 and DT4,
    which have additional parameters that require computation. The need for computation
    is increased in DT1 and DT5. A similar arrangement was followed at hourly and
    quarterly timescales, however, in this case, the minimums and maximums of relative
    humidity and temperature were replaced by their mean values. The calculation of
    all the parameters we included in our datasets is defined and extensively explained
    in Ref. [12]. Rs/Rso represents relative cloudiness and can be derived from pyranometer
    data and calculated Rso values [52]. The calculation of VPD requires air temperature
    and relative humidity, while ∆ requires air temperature. The net radiation indicates
    the amount of solar irradiance absorbed by vegetation, and it is commonly calculated
    from the short and long-wave radiation components (Equation (2)) at either a daily,
    hourly, or lower timescale. 𝑅 𝑛 = 𝑅 𝑛𝑠 − 𝑅 𝑛𝑙 (2) where Rns and Rnl are net short-wave

    GA-ELM, and GA-RF models for estimating ETr-lys at daily, hourly, and quarter-hourly
    timescales was assessed by comparing the estimated ET from each model with the
    ET measured using the lysimeters and quantified using four commonly used statistical
    indices, i.e., the coefficient of determination (R2) [1], the mean bias error
    (MBE) [53], the mean absolute error (MAE), and the root mean squared error (RMSE)
    [54], which can be expressed as follows: R 2 : 1− [ ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 )( 𝑥 𝑖

    Accuracy of the ASCE-PM and Machine Learning Models at a Daily Timescale The estimated
    ETr using ASCE-PM (ETrs) and that from ML models was compared to that from weighing
    lysimeters (ETr-lys) on a daily timescale. Table 3 indicates that DT3, DT4, and
    DT6 provided the best-performing estimators of ETr-lys across the different ML
    models. However, Figure 6 illustrates that the ASCE-PM equation performed better
    than these models (considering R2) but tended to underestimate ETr-lys (slope
    of 0.91, MBE = −0.43 mm/day) for values from 7.5 mm day−1 and greater. Also, the
    residual plot in Figure 7b shows that the largest errors occurred at approximately
    > 7.5 mm day −1 but, generally, the equation seems to persistently underestimate
    ETr-lys throughout all estimates. Underestimation or overestimation of ETr-lys
    by the different variants of the Penman–Monteith equation due to low and high
    evaporative demands has been reported in earlier studies, and it was attributed
    to the difference in local climatic conditions and lysimetric measurement errors.
    Due to the semi-arid climate and relatively large wind speeds at Bushland [33],
    the slight deviations between ETrs and ETr-lys could be attributed to the advective
    transport that adds energy, thus increasing the ETr-lys in the reference alfalfa
    fields, in agreement with Ref. [55]. Such underestimations were reported from
    other highly advective environments [56]. Figure 6. Relationship between ASCE,
    machine learning algorithms, and ETr-lys at daily timescale for days when reference

    indicators for machine learning ETr estimations at a daily timescale (fit linear
    equations representing the slope and intercept for each respective model are presented
    in italics). Comparison of the ETr from ML models with the ETr-lys shows that
    the underestimation was reduced, most significantly for GA-ELM, when applied to
    DT3 (slope = 0.97, MBE = −0.25) and DT6 (slope = 0.95, MBE = −0.19) (Figure 6a,d).
    It also demonstrates that GA-ELM can reduce the positive offset and slope, similar
    to Refs. [22,57], who found ELM to be suitable for reference evapotranspiration
    estimation. The best-performing model (GA-ANN-DT4, considering R2) had a smaller
    slope (0.90), although it reduced underestimation (MBE = −0.15). According to
    RMSE values shown in Table 3, ASCE-PM performed better than both the SVR and RF
    models for the majority of the datasets. These models performed close to the ASCE-PM
    with RMSE values of 0.98 and 0.93 for the GA-SVR and GA-RF models, respectively,
    for the DT8. However, the high positive offsets, 0.81 and 0.46 for the GA-SVR
    and GA-RF, respectively, indicate the poor performance of the models as compared
    to that of ASCE-PM (0.30). The statistical parameters shown in Table 3 give a
    clear idea about the interaction of the meteorological variables used in estimating
    ETr-lys across the different models. Based on these results, u2 was involved in
    all the best-performing datasets (DT3, DT4, and DT6); therefore, it can be concluded
    that it is one of the most relevant estimators for daily ETr-lys in this region
    and that accurate estimates of ETr-lys might not be achieved without the inclusion
    of this parameter. Also, the inclusion of VPD and Rs/Rso in DT3 led to improved
    slope and offset values compared to those of DT4 for GA-ELM, GA-ANN, and GA-SVR.
    In DT6, when Rn was excluded from the inputs, it did not affect the performance
    of the ML models. This result presents an opportunity for estimating ETr-lys without
    the long Rn calculations and could suggest that in dry and advective environments,
    radiation components might primarily contribute to pressure deficit through temperature
    changes, but aerodynamic components play a major role in driving evapotranspiration.
    This might affirm the relevancy of the inclusion of aerodynamic components in
    ML models in advective environments for daily ETr-lys calculations. Values of
    RMSE and MAE for GA-ELM-DT4 and GA-ELM-DT5 confirm that the inclusion of ∆, VPD,
    and Rs/Rso in DT5 decreased the model accuracy from a MAE of 0.56 mm/day and RMSE
    of 0.85 mm/day to a MAE of 0.90 mm/day and RMSE of 1.20 mm/day (Table 3). Removing
    ∆ in GA-ELM-DT3 and replacing it with Tmean and Rn reduced the MAE from 0.90 mm/day
    to 0.61 mm/day. A similar trend is observed in all the datasets where it was included
    (DT1, DT2). The effect of the inclusion of Rs/Rso (an indication of cloudiness)
    can also be assessed by looking at the values of MAE and RMSE for DT7 and DT8
    in Table 3. It is evident that across all models, the MAE and RMSE for DT7 ranged
    from 0.79 mm/day to 0.86 mm/day and from 0.95 mm/day to 1.21 mm/day, respectively,
    which are larger than the range for DT8 (0.68 mm/day–0.89 mm/day and 0.92 mm/day–0.98
    mm/day, respectively). Therefore, this suggests that ∆ and Rs/Rso might not be
    suitable for daily ETr-lys estimation in the advective environment tested. It
    is observed from Table 3 that replacing the maximums and minimums of relative
    humidity and temperature with their mean values for DT6 and DT7 slightly improved
    the RMSE values. However, when the Rs/Rso was excluded as shown for DT8, the RMSE
    and MAE were improved. This means Rs/Rso might not be suitable as a direct input
    into ML models for daily ETr estimation for the conditions of this study. MAE
    and RMSE values for DT4 and DT8 indicate that Rn and Rs might have a similar effect
    on the daily ETr-lys estimation and can be used interchangeably. Hence, precautions
    should be taken into consideration for deploying ML models in locations such as
    the Bushland, TX station when records of both Rn and Rs are missing. Among all
    the ML models tested, GA-ANN subjected to DT4 produced the largest R2 value (0.91),
    while the GA-ELM applied to DT8 produced the slope closest to unity and the smallest
    offset. Figure 7a,c,d also reveals that residuals for the GA-ELM and GA-ANN were
    persistently close to the zero line, which indicates that these models can reduce
    underestimation or overestimation of ETr-lys. Overall, the results indicated that
    on a daily timescale, ML models can give better estimates of ETr-lys than the
    ASCE-PM under the tested conditions, and we can learn some things about the importance
    of the various input parameters on the accuracy of the equations. This is important
    since weather data are normally collected with missing data, which is sometimes
    estimated or imputed [58]. Therefore, the relevance of the parameters indicates
    how much effort should be expended to replace or estimate missing data based on
    the prevailing local conditions. For instance, if accurate estimates of ETr-lys
    can be obtained without a particular parameter, no effort would be required to
    impute its missing values. 3.2. Comparison of the Estimation Accuracy of the ASCE-PM
    and Machine Learning Models at Hourly and Quarter-Hourly Timescale Table 4 gives
    the performance of the ML models across the different datasets for hourly and
    quarter-hourly timescales. Residual plots for the best-performing ML models and
    ASCE-PM are shown in Figure 8. Residuals for all ML models in Figure 8a,c,d indicate
    more points close to the zero line as compared to the ASCE-PM plot (Figure 8b).
    The errors appear to increase at about 0.6 mm/h. A similar trend is observed in
    Figure 9b, where the slope of the straight line coincides sensibly with the bisector
    up to about 0.6 mm/h, indicating the method’s success for that set of values.
    However, the method slightly underestimates ETr-lys above this value, although
    the overall MBE was calculated as −0.008 mm/h. Our results agree with the findings
    of other previous studies [56]. In contrast, some studies have had results slightly
    different from ours, where grass reference (ETr) was evaluated and compared with
    measurements from a lysimeter [59]. In that paper, the ASCE-PM overestimated lysimeter
    measurements by 4% for values above 0.45 mm/h. The behavior of the ASCE-PM might
    vary depending on the reference crop considered and the study site [36]. Figure

    indicators for machine learning ETr-lys estimations at the hourly and quarter-hourly
    timescales (fit linear equations representing the slope and intercept for each
    respective model are presented in italics). For the ML models GA-ELM-DT2, GA-ELM-DT3,
    and GA-ELM-DT7, the residuals were close to zero and slopes (Figure 9a,c,d) close
    to unity, indicating that the models performed quite well. It can be perceived
    from Table 4 that these models performed better than the ASCE-PM, considering
    all statistical parameters. The MAE and RMSE for ASCE were 0.36 and 0.24, respectively,
    lower than values for DT7, where all models performed better than the ASCE, with
    ranges for MAE and RMSE being 0.04 mm/h–0.05 mm/h and 0.06–0.07 mm/h, respectively.
    Considering the effect of the different variables on the model’s performance,
    results for DT4 show that excluding ∆, VPD, and Rs/Rso led to a reduction in the
    slope. However, when the data for the three variables were present in DT5 and
    data for Rn and Tmean were absent, the slopes were still reduced across all models.
    This indicates that Tmean and Rn could be major contributing factors as direct
    inputs for hourly ETr estimation using ML models. The contribution of Rn to hourly
    ETr-lys estimation can be further assessed by looking at the results for DT4 and
    DT7. The consistent MAE, RMSE, and slope values for all the evaluated models indicate
    that Rs and Rn can be used interchangeably as direct inputs to the ML models.
    In fact, when data for both variables were absent in DT5, the worst estimates
    were observed from the ML models. The performance of ML models on DT4 is encouraging
    and indicates a potential for estimating hourly ETr with directly sensed meteorological
    data. It can be perceived from both Figure 10a and Figure 11a that the ASCE-PM
    produced biased estimates at the quarter-hourly timescale (slope of 0.93, MBE
    = −0.0012 mm/h), tending to underestimate ETr-lys. On the other hand, the residuals
    for the best-performing models (Figure 10b,c) appear to be close to the zero line,
    and the R2 values in both cases (Figure 11b,c) are larger than that for the ASCE-PM
    (Figure 11b). Figure 10. Residual plots for ASCE and machine learning algorithms

    11. Relationship between ASCE, machine learning algorithms and ETr-lys at quarter-hourly
    timescale. (a) ASCE-PM, (b) GA-ELM-DT2, (c) GA-ELM-DT7. An improved performance
    can be observed from the best-performing ML models (GA-ELM-DT2, GA-ELM-DT7) with
    residuals (Figure 10b,c) close to the zero line and slopes (Figure 11b,c) close
    to unity. Additionally, all the other models tested (GA-SVR, GA-RF) performed
    better than ASCE-PM, as shown by the statistical parameters in Table 4. The MAE
    and RMSE for ASCE were 0.36 and 0.24, respectively, higher than values for all
    models and across all datasets that ranged from 0.01 to 0.02 mm/h and from 0.02
    to 0.03 mm/h, respectively. The superiority of ML models for quarter-hourly ETr-lys
    estimation provides an opportunity to use more high temporal resolution data for
    ETr-lys estimation. Some relevant findings have emerged from the results shown
    above. The adopted machine learning algorithms are a powerful tool for the prediction
    of reference evapotranspiration at lower timescales. Starting from the parameters
    that are directly sensed, as in DT8, to a combination with parameters calculated
    from them, as in DT2, and other datasets, it is possible to obtain prediction
    models characterized by very high accuracy. Mean temperature, as well as net solar
    radiation, play a significant role in influencing the various processes of the
    hydrological cycle. These parameters appear to be relevant for modeling at hourly
    or quarter-hourly timescales; therefore, a data-driven model that considers the
    above two factors most likely leads to satisfactory results. However, in the absence
    of net radiation measurements or in case the resources for its long calculations
    are limiting, it is still possible to build a reliable prediction model of ETr-lys
    with the aid of the machine learning algorithms, based only on solar radiation,
    mean temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity data. This would especially
    be desirable for remote sensing applications in data-scarce environments. The
    use of climatic data that are not very recent may appear to be a limitation of
    this study. However, the ability to interpret patterns in past climatic data will
    be crucial to climatic forecasting, and ML models have been deemed necessary.
    3.3. Transferability of the Developed Machine Learning Models Developing models
    for reference evapotranspiration estimation requires an understanding of how the
    different features contribute to the model estimations. This is necessary, especially
    for data-scarce environments, where the most dominant variables can be utilized
    to provide real-time ETr-lys estimates through ML algorithms. Our investigation
    of the different parameter combinations and contributions to ETr-lys estimation
    at different timescales indicated that ML models can perform better than ASCE-PM
    while utilizing fewer data inputs to achieve reasonable results. If the estimated
    ETr-lys values are acceptable representations of ETrs, then the improved accuracy
    on shorter timescales is especially relevant for remote sensing of ET since daily
    or weekly ET is extrapolated from ETrs estimates from the small time window that
    the images were taken, and thus, improved estimates on these shorter timescales
    could improve the overall accuracy of these methods. However, the use of the models
    from this study could be limited to the study region and to places that have similar
    climatic conditions. Areas with similar climatic conditions might experience similar
    patterns of the meteorological parameters, producing similar variability as our
    results. Still, it is necessary to create similar or novel ML models using different
    parameter combinations to investigate their performance in other regions. Moreover,
    based on the target application, the timescale of the required data might be different
    from region to region. The models developed here showed the potential of capturing
    variability even at small timescales (quarter-hourly), which is a common temporal
    resolution for weather data collection in many regions. The necessity to test
    different models at different timescales is paramount for a given region. In fact,
    different regions have been found to suit different empirical models for ETr computation,
    primarily based on local climatic conditions. In the case that the models of the
    current study are transferred to other regions, proper training of the models
    is required as well as paying extra attention to the underfitting and overfitting
    phenomena commonly experienced during ML model training. Future developments of
    this study will concern coupling the ML models, surface energy balance models,
    and satellite imagery to improve the estimation of ETr. Increasing the spatial
    scale of ETr estimation would be necessary to enhance water management and planning.
    4. Conclusions Machine learning models (GA-ELM, GA-SVR, GA-RF, and GA-ANN) were
    investigated in modeling lysimeter-measured reference evapotranspiration (ETr-lys)
    at daily, hourly, and quarter-hourly timescales using various input combinations
    of radiation and aerodynamic components for a highly advective environment. The
    results were compared with those of the standardized Penman–Monteith Equation
    (ASCE-PM). Based on the comparison results, it was observed that machine learning
    models yielded more accurate ETr-lys estimates compared to ASCE-PM across all
    timescales. ASCE-PM consistently underestimated ETr-lys at all timescales. Radiation
    components, as well as a combination of radiation and aerodynamic model inputs,
    demonstrated superior performance at the hourly and quarter-hourly timescales.
    Conversely, datasets primarily characterized by aerodynamic components performed
    better at the daily timescale. The results indicate that machine learning models
    can effectively replace ASCE-PM for ETr-lys estimation in highly advective environments.
    Moreover, different climatic variables exert varying influence on model performance
    at a given timescale based on local weather conditions. This approach can be integrated
    to enhance the accuracy of ETr-lys estimation at hourly or quarter-hourly timescales,
    which is crucial for precise geospatial ET estimation using land surface energy
    balance models. Additionally, the same approach could be applied in similar advective
    environments to evaluate the impact of meteorological parameters on ETr estimation.
    This is imperative for ensuring precise ETr estimation for agricultural water
    management. Author Contributions Conceptualization, S.K., R.T.P. and B.M.; methodology,

  description: Rapid and accurate field evaluation of hydraulic performance is critical
    for the operation of a microirrigation system. However, the optimal sample size
    and the specific locations of the emitters selected in one subunit for field tests
    have not been determined. A model (Hydraulic Analysis of Pressurized Irrigation
    System,HAPIS) was constructed for hydraulic analysis of a pressurized irrigation
    system by coupling MATLAB and EPANET. The random sampling method (RSM) and uniform
    sampling method (USM) were optimized for emitters selected through simulation,
    aiming to achieve higher estimation accuracies of the mean emitter discharge rate
    of the subunit ((Formula presented.) and the Christiansen uniformity coefficient
    (CU) while minimizing the number of emitters tested. In addition, a linear sampling
    method at predetermined emitter locations (LSMPE) was developed to simplify the
    evaluation process using a genetic algorithm (GA). The results indicate that the
    appropriate sample size range for RSM was 20–40, in which the maximum percentage
    difference between (Formula presented.) and CU was maintained at ±10%. For the
    USM, a sample size of approximately 18 can provide relatively accurate estimations
    of (Formula presented.) and CU, while it is recommended that the sampled emitters
    be distributed over three to five laterals. The optimal sample size of LSMPE could
    be decreased to approximately 10, and the selected emitters were arranged along
    the sampling line. The absolute relative estimation error of (Formula presented.)
    and CU could be maintained at <1%.

  explanation: The paper presents a new method, called linear sampling method at predetermined
    emitter locations (LSMPE), for optimizing field evaluation of automated irrigation
    management systems. LSMPE combines machine learning algorithms (genetic algorithm,
    GA) with a hydraulic model (HAPIS) to determine the optimal sample size and location
    of emitters for hydraulic performance assessment. The paper first evaluates the
    accuracy of two traditional sampling methods, random sampling method (RSM) and
    uniform sampling method (USM), and compares them with the proposed LSMPE method.
    The results show that LSMPE outperforms both RSM and USM in terms of accuracy
    and efficiency, and can effectively reduce the time and labor inputs required
    for field evaluation.
  extract_1: To achieve a higher estimation accuracy of microirrigation uniformity,
    testers tend to increase the sample size as much as possible, which leads to time-consuming
    and laborious field testing. However, the influence of sample size and location
    on the accuracy of hydraulic performance assessments is still unclear, and appropriate
    sampling standards are important for performance testing.
  extract_2: In this context, a hydraulic model (HAPIS) combined with a GA was developed
    at the microirrigation subunit level. The main objectives of this study were (i)
    to evaluate the influence of the sample size and position of emitters on the accuracy
    of field evaluation of system performance and (ii) to find another easier sampling
    method in addition to the RSM and USM to improve the efficiency and accuracy of
    field evaluation of system performance.

    EN FR Rapid and accurate field evaluation of hydraulic performance is critical
    for the operation of a microirrigation system. However, the optimal sample size
    and the specific locations of the emitters selected in one subunit for field tests
    have not been determined. A model (Hydraulic Analysis of Pressurized Irrigation
    System,HAPIS) was constructed for hydraulic analysis of a pressurized irrigation
    system by coupling MATLAB and EPANET. The random sampling method (RSM) and uniform
    sampling method (USM) were optimized for emitters selected through simulation,
    aiming to achieve higher estimation accuracies of the mean emitter discharge rate
    of the subunit ( q ¯ ) and the Christiansen uniformity coefficient (CU) while
    minimizing the number of emitters tested. In addition, a linear sampling method
    at predetermined emitter locations (LSMPE) was developed to simplify the evaluation
    process using a genetic algorithm (GA). The results indicate that the appropriate
    sample size range for RSM was 20–40, in which the maximum percentage difference
    between q ¯ and CU was maintained at ±10%. For the USM, a sample size of approximately
    18 can provide relatively accurate estimations of q ¯ and CU, while it is recommended
    that the sampled emitters be distributed over three to five laterals. The optimal
    sample size of LSMPE could be decreased to approximately 10, and the selected
    emitters were arranged along the sampling line. The absolute relative estimation
    error of q ¯ and CU could be maintained at <1%. 1 INTRODUCTION In arid and semi-arid
    regions, microirrigation has been widely used because it achieves crop intensification
    while enabling highly efficient water and fertilizer application (Bai & Gao, 2021;
    Daccache et al., 2010; Luquet et al., 2005). The main purpose of designing a microirrigation
    system is to obtain high uniformity while avoiding excessive and insufficient
    irrigation for the entire system. While the performance of a microirrigation system
    designed by engineers is a reference value for the installation of the network,
    the actual irrigation performance may be drastically different (Benouniche et
    al., 2014; Wang et al., 2022). Field evaluations of system performance are necessary
    for the efficient use of water and fertilizers in an installed drip irrigation
    system. Several parameters have been proposed as performance assessment indicators,
    such as the Christiansen uniformity coefficient (CU, %), emission uniformity (EU,
    %) and distribution uniformity (DU, %) (ASAE, 2019; Burt et al., 1997; Christiansen,
    1942). To calculate these indicators, the discharge rates of a certain number
    of emitters in a subunit must be determined through a field test. Researchers
    have deduced formulas to find a more precise method of performing an assessment
    based on analytic methods and statistics (Burt, 2004; Styles et al., 2008). Several
    simplified procedures, such as design curves and nomographs, have also been developed
    to improve the efficiency of performance assessments (Bralts et al., 1981; Bralts
    & Kesner, 1983). Although many studies have optimized assessment indicators and
    computational methods, few studies have focused on field sampling standards (sampling
    sizes and emitter locations). Wu and Irudayaraj (1989) developed a random sampling
    method (RSM) model to randomly select emitter discharge samples for field evaluation
    purposes. Their results showed that, if the sample size was 18, the difference
    in the uniformity coefficient of the subunit would be ±36%, while this result
    has not been widely used in actual performance tests. Currently, there are two
    typical sampling methods for selecting test emitters in the field: (1) the RSM
    and (2) the uniform sampling method (USM) (Ju et al., 2016; Juana et al., 2007).
    The field sampling design usually depended on the experience of the testers; thus,
    the sample sizes in different studies were different. Li et al. (2010) evaluated
    the performance of drip irrigation subunits by measuring the discharge of 20 emitters,
    while the sample size in the research of Wang et al. (2022) was 75. Regardless
    of the method used, the number and location of sampling emitters directly affect
    the test results (Solé-Torres et al., 2021; Wu & Irudayaraj, 1989). To achieve
    a higher estimation accuracy of microirrigation uniformity, testers tend to increase
    the sample size as much as possible, which leads to time-consuming and laborious
    field testing. However, the influence of sample size and location on the accuracy
    of hydraulic performance assessments is still unclear, and appropriate sampling
    standards are important for performance testing. Due to the size of the irrigation
    equipment, the measuring conditions in the field and the variety of hydraulic
    performances in microirrigation systems, few studies potentially meet these needs.
    Hydraulic models can assist in quantifying and evaluating the hydraulic performance
    of irrigation networks and equipment and have been widely used in hydraulic analyses
    of microirrigation systems. For example, the PRESUD model was developed to assist
    in decision-making for the optimization of designing microirrigation subunits
    (Carrión et al., 2013, 2014; Moreno et al., 2016). Several decision support systems
    (DSS) using EPANET as a hydraulic simulator have also been developed to optimize
    water and fertilizer use and manage centralized fertigation systems in pressurized
    irrigation systems (Fernandez Garcia et al., 2016; González Perea et al., 2014,
    2020). The genetic algorithm (GA), a search and optimization method based on the
    principles of genetics and natural selection, has also been used to solve the
    optimization problem in irrigation system design (González Perea et al., 2016;
    Haupt & Haupt, 1998; Ma et al., 2019). Aral et al. (2008) developed a multiobjective
    optimization method to design and optimize sensors in water supply systems. The
    model determines the appropriate sensor layout mode through the non-dominated
    sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Dursun and Özden (2017) optimized the
    number and position of water sensors in a drip irrigation field by the GA algorithm,
    in which the soil water content of the whole field can be well predicted by arranging
    five sensors in key positions. These methodologies offer opportunities for optimizing
    the sample size and location of microirrigation performance assessments in subunits.
    In this context, a hydraulic model (HAPIS) combined with a GA was developed at
    the microirrigation subunit level. The main objectives of this study were (i)
    to evaluate the influence of the sample size and position of emitters on the accuracy
    of field evaluation of system performance and (ii) to find another easier sampling
    method in addition to the RSM and USM to improve the efficiency and accuracy of
    field evaluation of system performance. 2 METHODOLOGY 2.1 Description of subunit
    A rectangular microirrigation subunit, which is the most common shape in irrigation
    systems, was selected. The irrigation system of the typical subunit consisted
    of one hydrant near a corner, one manifold running along a boundary and a number
    of laterals perpendicular to the manifold (Figure 1). The laterals were uniformly
    spaced along the manifold, and the emitters were uniformly spaced along the lateral.
    The manifold length (Lm) and lateral length (Ll) are equal to the lengths of the
    short (b) and long (a) sides of the subunit, respectively. FIGURE 1 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Description of microirrigation subunit and three sampling methods:
    (a) random sampling method (RSM), (b) uniform sampling method (USM) and (c) linear
    sampling method at predetermined emitter locations (LSMPE). The mean emitter discharge
    rate ( ) and CU were recommended as the performance evaluation parameters in this
    work. The two indicators are defined as follows: (1) (2) where is the mean emitter
    discharge rate of the subunit (L h−1), CU is the Christiansen uniformity coefficient
    of the subunit, N is the number of sampling emitters in the subunit, and qi is
    the discharge rate of sampling emitters in the subunit (L h−1). 2.2 Description
    and evaluation of sampling methods Placing a sufficient number of sampling emitters
    in the appropriate locations in the subunits was the basic task of hydraulic performance
    evaluation. Three sampling methods, (1) the RSM, (2) the USM and (3) the linear
    sampling method at predetermined emitter locations (LSMPE), were compared in this
    study. For a given sample size N, the selected emitters of RSM were distributed
    within the whole subunit, in which the emitter location was randomly determined
    by the tester (Figure 1a). For uniform sampling, laterals were evenly selected
    along the manifold and the sampling emitter was determined uniformly along each
    lateral selected (Figure 1b). In fact, according to the designed number of selected
    laterals (Nl) and the number of selected emitters along the laterals (Ne), the
    sample size could be determined (N = Nl × Ne), and the emitter location could
    be determined by the arrangement pattern of uniform sampling. In LSMPE, all the
    sampling emitters were arranged in a straight line for a given sample size N,
    and the tester could complete the whole field test by sampling along the straight
    line (Figure 1c). Xn represents the distance between two selected emitters, and
    this value varies with the position of the sampling emitter. Obviously, the proposed
    method was intended to reduce the distance of tester movement and avoid the difficulty
    of accessing fields. 2.3 Optimization of sampling methods The optimum sampling
    methods for a microirrigation subunit are based on finding the best sample size
    and location that ensure optimal estimation accuracy of performance from economic
    and efficiency perspectives. The objectives of optimization are different for
    the three sampling methods. For the RSM, the sample size N is the only optimization
    parameter due to the randomness of the emitter location. For the USM, finding
    the optimum combination of Nl and Ne, which determines the sample size and location,
    is an important objective of this research. For LSMPE, not only should the appropriate
    sample size N be determined but also the locations of the sampling emitters along
    the sample line should be further optimized. Considering the different optimization
    objectives, an optimization model (HAPIS), which was developed and implemented
    in MATLAB using EPANET (Rossman, 2000) as a hydraulic simulator, was used to perform
    hydraulic analysis and optimize the sampling method in the subunit. The different
    phases of optimization are as follows: (1) a hydraulic simulation module that
    determines the hydraulic behaviour of the emitter and provides the discharge rate
    of each emitter in the irrigation subunit and (2) a sampling simulation module
    that performs a simulation of each sampling method and calculates the evaluation
    parameters. 2.3.1 Hydraulic simulation procedures The hydraulic simulation determines
    the hydraulic behaviour of the irrigation emitter, which is essential for the
    whole work. Thus, the emitter flow–pressure head equation, the manufacturer coefficient
    of variation of the emitters (CVm) and the head losses in connections must be
    defined. MATLAB is used to process the parameter information of the microirrigation
    subunit, generate a pipe network information file (.inp) and then input it into
    EPANET for hydraulic analysis. The shape and dimensions of the subunit, including
    the diameter of the irrigation pipes and the hydrant location, are also defined
    in this section. EPANET software has been widely used as a hydraulic and water
    quality simulator due to its efficiency and robustness (Jimenez-Bello et al.,
    2011; Khatavkar & Mays, 2018). The EPANET solves the flow continuity and head
    loss equations that characterize the hydraulic states of the irrigation subunit
    using a hybrid node-loop approach. According to this approach, the hydraulic state
    of the irrigation subunit at any given time is determined by solving a series
    of nonlinear equations consisting of continuity equations at all nodes and energy
    conservation equations around each elementary loop. Thus, by solving this set
    of equations, the pressure head and discharge at any node and the discharge rate
    and pressure head losses in the pipes of the irrigation subunit can be derived.
    In addition, the ‘Emitter’ component of the EPANET model is based on the exponential
    relationship between node flow and pressure, which is consistent with the characteristics
    of the flow–pressure relationship of emitters. The Hazen–Williams formula (Equation
    3) is used to calculate the friction loss (hf, m): (3) where Lp is the pipe length
    (m), D is the internal pipe diameter (m), Q is the pipe discharge (m3 s−1), and
    C is the roughness coefficient. The emitter flow rate–pressure head equation can
    be represented by (4) where q is the emitter discharge rate (L h−1), P is the
    inlet pressure head of the emitter (m), K is the emission coefficient, and x is
    the emission exponent. Considering the emitter discharge variability caused by
    manufacturing variability within the subunit, the emitter discharge rate and pressure
    head relation may be represented by Equation (5) (Chamba et al., 2019): (5) where
    u is the normalized random variable and CVm is the manufacturer''s coefficient
    of variation. After performing the hydraulic simulation, the discharge rate applied
    by each emitter of the subunit during the irrigation event was used to calculate
    the indicators and CU0. These values were used as reference values for the sampling
    simulation. In this work, the values of and CUt obtained from sampling simulation
    were compared with the values of and CU0 calculated by the discharge rate of all
    emitters in the subunit to assess the impact of sampling methods on hydraulic
    performance evaluation. 2.3.2 Parameter determination for sampling methods The
    sampling module computes the performance parameters of a given sampling method
    based on the discharge rate of the sampling emitter in the subunit. Once the ‘Hydraulic
    module’ is completed, the discharge rate of each emitter in the microirrigation
    subunit is generated as a file (.txt) that will be used for sampling simulation.
    To determine the discharge rates of the sampling emitters, several sampling method
    parameters need to be defined. The simulation process of three different sampling
    methods by this module is described below. Part 1. Simulation process of RSM In
    this part, the sample size N of random sampling must be defined first. Once the
    number of sampling emitters has been obtained, the location of each selected emitter,
    the distance from the hydrant along the manifold direction (yi) and the distance
    from the hydrant along the lateral direction (xi) must be determined. For an assigned
    sample size N, the selected emitter location was determined by a developed MATLAB
    program that randomly generated the information of the emitter location (xi, yi).
    The module automatically identified the generated location information and extracted
    the discharge data of the sampling emitter. Each simulation was repeated 1000
    times. Part 2. Simulation process of USM The aim of this part was to determine
    the discharge rate of the sampling emitter according to the design of Nl and Ne.
    The location of the emitter included the distance of the selected lateral (yj),
    where the emitter was located, along the manifold direction and the relative location
    of the emitter on the selected lateral (xj). In the USM, the location of the selected
    laterals yj depended on the value of Nl; thus, the module calculated the spacing
    between two selected laterals (Stl) and then determined the yj of each selected
    lateral: (6) (7) where Stl is the distance between two selected laterals (m) along
    the manifold direction; Lm is the length of the manifold (m); yj is the location
    of the selected lateral in the manifold direction (m); and j is the node of the
    selected laterals, from 1 to Nl. Similarly, according to the value of Ne, the
    distance between two sampling emitters (Ste) can be calculated, and the xj of
    each emitter can be determined: (8) (9) where Ste is the distance between two
    sampling emitters along a lateral (m); Ll is the length of the lateral (m); xj
    is the emitter location in the lateral direction (m); and k is the node of the
    emitter on a lateral, from 1 to Ne. Eventually, the module automatically extracted
    the emitter discharge data through the calculated location information, and the
    and CUt of each combination of Nl and Ne could be obtained. Part 3. Simulation
    process of LSMPE using a GA An optimized LSMPE in which the sampling emitters
    were selected along a straight line was developed. In this part, the sample size
    N and the location of the sampling line must be defined first. Obviously, the
    position of the selected emitter affects the result of LSMPE. Thus, for a given
    N, the placement of selected emitters on the sampling line was an important issue
    for achieving the goal of LSMPE. The problem was defined as an optimization problem
    to find the layout of the sampling emitter with minimum error. The GA, which attempts
    to find a solution using random search techniques, is a search technique based
    on parameter coding. In other words, the GA is a search and optimization method
    based on the principles of genetics and natural selection. The basic principle
    of the GA is to ensure that the best generation lives and the worst generation
    dies. The GA was intended to find the best parameters for the system by modelling
    evolutionary events (selection, crossover, mutation) that occur in nature. In
    this section, the locations of the sampling emitters along the sampling line were
    determined by GA software developed in a MATLAB environment; the purpose was to
    find the best emitter location to minimize the calculation error of the performance
    parameters. The steps used in the developed GA are given below. Step 1: Generation
    of the initial population. Every individual is uniquely identified by a code called
    a chromosome, which is mapped to a certain value of the objective function (the
    function to optimize) representing the fitness of the individual. The sample size
    and location of each selected emitter were recorded for each individual: (10)
    Here, the indexes i and j represent the sample size of the testing emitters and
    the population size, respectively. Each Cij term (a gene) consists of the emitter
    locations, and each row in Equation (10) is one of the possible solutions for
    the placement problem. This matrix is the population solution of the problem.
    The population number (n) and number of generations are defined as 100 and 200,
    respectively. The initial population is generated randomly. The limits of the
    individuals are set to the emitter on the sampling line. Step 2: Calculate the
    objective function value of individuals in the population and evaluate the fitness
    function. According to the emitter position data carried by each gene, the emitter
    discharge rate was selected from the output data of the hydraulic model. All the
    emitter discharge data of an individual were used to calculate the performance
    parameters. The individuals were evaluated in terms of their performances, which
    are based on their fitness values. The fitness function of the developed system
    is given in Equation (11): (11) where Fitness is the fitness function; δ1 and
    δ2 represent the absolute relative errors ( ) of the estimated and CUt, respectively;
    and c and d represent scale factors for δ1 and δ2, respectively. In this work,
    c and d are 1. Step 3: Select the dominant individuals to pass on to the next
    generation. The tournament selection method is used. In this step, the worst individuals
    are deleted from the population. Step 4: Crossover and mutation. Discrete crossover
    is used as the crossover method. After selection, two individuals are randomly
    selected from the remainder of the population, and their genetic information is
    mixed, thereby generating new individuals. A mutation is generated by randomly
    changing the binary code of a gene slightly. The mutation operator randomly changes
    certain subparts of a chromosome. The crossover probability and mutation probability
    are 0.65 and 0.05, respectively. Step 5: This cycle runs for the number of generations
    defined. Thus, the best point locations were searched for and defined by the GA.

    dotted lines represent the input data and the solid lines represent the simulations

    2.4 Case study A typical irrigation subunit in southern Xinjiang, China, was selected
    as a case study. The soil within 0-60cm depth of farmland was classified as sandy
    loam with 56% sand, 43% silt, and 1% clay, and the soil bulk density was 1.52 g cm−3.
    Cotton is a predominantly agricultural planting crop. The net irrigation requirement
    was considered to be approximately 4 × 103 m3 ha−1 year−1 for cotton in the study
    area. The cotton in the field was planted at a row distance of 0.25 m with a planting
    density of 257,640 plants per hectare. The subunit was designed as a rectangle,
    measuring 0.48 ha, with a and b being 80 and 60 m, respectively. The slopes of
    the farm along the manifold (S1) and lateral (S2) directions were set to 1/500
    and 1/1000, respectively. The spacing between two adjacent laterals was 1 m, using
    an emitter in which qn was 2 L h−1, operating at an average pressure of 10 m,
    with 0.3-m spacing between emitters (Se) and CVm 3%. The manifold and lateral
    layers are made of polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polyethylene (PE), respectively.

    Considering the possible influence of the design parameters, the effects of the
    nominal emitter discharge (qn), emitter exponent (x) and manifold diameter (Dm)
    on the performance assessment were evaluated under the irrigation network. For
    qn, by varying K (Equation (5)), three possible discharge rates (0.5, 1 and 3 L h−1)
    were tested. For x, by varying K, three possible values (0.1, 0.3 and 0.6) were
    analogously tested. In addition, three kinds of Dm (44.0, 55.4 and 79.2 mm) were
    also used. Table 2 shows the 10 scenarios of the microirrigation network. The
    abbreviations D, F and M represent the network scenarios of qn, x and Dm, respectively,
    where CK represents the typical design of the subunit (qn = 2 L h−1, x = 0.5,
    Dm = 66 mm). The scenario design is also beneficial for studying the universality
    of sampling methods under different hydraulic uniformities of subunits. TABLE

    selected for 10 levels in the RSM (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100).
    The USM method was simulated with 100 combinations built through 10 levels of
    Nl (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20 and 30) and 10 levels of Ne (2, 4, 6, 8, 10,
    15, 20, 30, 40 and 50). In the LSMPE, five sample sizes (6, 8, 10, 12 and 14)
    were analysed. The sampling line was designed as the diagonal of the subunit starting
    from the water hydrant (Figure 1c). 3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1 Effect of design
    parameters on hydraulic uniformity of subunit An actual irrigation subunit and
    another nine scenario designs of the microirrigation network were assessed to
    determine the appropriate sample size and location. Figure 3 shows the spatial
    distribution of the emitter pressure and discharge rate applied in the subunit
    of CK. The emitter pressure ranged from 5.16 to 9.81 m, with a maximum difference
    (regarding the average pressure) of 57.5%. The simulation results conform to the
    actual pressure distribution pattern of a microirrigation system: The pressure
    is greater when the emitter is closer to the hydrant (Figure 3a). The emitter
    discharge rate ranged from 1.35 to 2.00 L h−1, with a maximum difference of 28%.
    Compared to that of the emitter pressure, the spatial distribution of the emitter
    discharge rate was more complicated. This phenomenon was attributed to the influence
    of CVm. After performing the hydraulic simulation, and CU0 were calculated by
    the discharge rate of all the emitters in the subunit (Table 3). For the four
    scenarios of qn, significantly increased from D1 (0.5 L h−1) to D3 (3L h−1), while
    CU0 decreased. A larger qn was accompanied by greater hydraulic loss, which reduced
    the hydraulic uniformity in the subunits. and CU0 decreased when x increased,
    and the decreases in and CU0 were 17% and 4%, respectively. The exponent index
    represents the sensitivity of the discharge rate to variations in pressure (Yao
    & He, 1999). The lower x is, the lower the sensitivity of the emitter discharge
    to pressure changes, which will result in better hydraulic uniformity in the subunit.
    In contrast, and CU0 increased when Dm increased, and the increase rates of and
    CU0 were 65% and 28%, respectively. The pipe diameter was related to the frictional
    head loss in the manifold (Wu et al., 2010). Choosing a large Dm reduced the loss
    of pressure in the manifold, which led to uniform pressure along the manifold
    (minimal pressure variations at the lateral inlets) and improved the uniformity
    of the subunit. Overall, the HAPIS provides good simulation of the hydraulic performance
    of microirrigation subunits under different operating conditions and provides
    an effective tool for the optimization of sample size and location for hydraulic
    performance evaluation. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Spatial distributions

    the distributions of the simulated and CUt in CK. The results of the simulated
    and CUt show a normal distribution in 1000 repetitions. The average simulated
    was equal to the reference value, and the average simulated CUt was slightly greater
    than the reference value. In this study, sample sizes of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60,
    70, 80, 90 and 100 were evaluated for randomly selected emitters. The results
    indicated a definite trend: the larger N was, the better the estimate was. For
    and CUt, the first quartile (Q25), third quartile (Q75) and interquartile ranges
    (between Q25 and Q75) significantly decreased when the sample size increased (Figure
    4). Similar trends were obtained for the other scenarios. When the distribution
    of a parameter for any given N can be considered a normal distribution, the standard
    deviation of the target parameters can be used to show the confidence or the probability
    that the calculated values will lie within a certain range. The normal numbers
    in Figure 4 represent the maximum percentage of differences in and CUt compared
    with and CU0 (95% confidence limits), respectively. When N was only 10, the results
    showed maximum differences of +4.4%/−4.4% and +3.4%/−2.6% for and CUt, respectively.
    The difference is reduced to +2.2%/−2.2% and +1.6%/−1.4% for and CUt, respectively,
    when N is increased to 40. This result is similar to that found by Wu and Irudayaraj
    (1989) based on the dimensionless energy gradient curve. The estimation accuracy
    varies with the number of selected emitters, and a higher N will result in better
    accuracy. If a difference of 1% is expected, N should exceed 100. Considering
    the working strength caused by the field test of the emitter discharge rate, the
    sample size of the performance evaluation in the microirrigation subunit should
    be controlled within a certain range. A sample size of 40 was recommended as the
    appropriate upper limit, which controls the maximum percentage of difference within
    ±4%. FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Descriptive statistics of mean

    distribution of data, and the right side is the data distribution box diagram.
    In the box diagram, lower and upper hinges correspond to Q25 and Q75, respectively,
    and upper and lower whiskers extend to largest and smallest values, respectively,

    hinges. Dashed lines and solid lines represent mean and median relative errors,
    respectively. Italicized numbers indicate and CUt for different sample sizes,
    and normal numbers represent maximum percentage of difference caused by sample
    sizes (95% confidence limits). Values of mean emitter discharge rate calculated
    by discharge rate of all emitters in subunit ( and Christiansen''s uniformity
    coefficient calculated by flow rate of all emitters in subunit (CU0) were 1.57 L h−1
    and 94.11%, respectively. For each scenario of qn, x and Dm, the maximum percentage
    of difference (95% confidence limit) in and CUt compared with and CU0 was computed
    (Table 4). The difference percentages of and CUt significantly increased with
    increasing qn or x. For example, as qn increased from 0.5 L h−1 (D1) to 3 L h−1
    (D3), the maximum percentage of at 20 emitters increased from +0.9%/−0.9% to +5.7%/−5.7%,
    and the difference percentage of CUt increased from +0.6%/−0.5% to +4.3%/−3.4%.
    Obviously, the hydraulic behaviour of irrigation emitters affects the performance
    of tests. Emitters with a small x (such as pressure-compensating emitters) or
    qn could maximize the hydraulic uniformity in subunits, which leads to good estimates
    of and CUt. However, the differences in and CUt significantly decreased with increasing
    manifold diameter. Furthermore, an extremely greater difference (≥10%) was found
    when the sample size was less than 20, which indicated that the sample size needed
    to set a lower limit to adapt to the different uniformities of the microirrigation
    subunits. Therefore, the appropriate sample size for the subunits was 20–40. TABLE

    rate calculated by sampling simulation. 3.3 Estimation accuracy of USM A comparison
    of the estimation accuracy of the USM in the four irrigation networks with different
    qn values is shown in Figure 5, which illustrates the absolute relative errors
    of and CU0. The absolute relative errors of the estimated ranged from 0.0% to
    1.8%, from 0.0% to1.7%, from 0.0% to 1.3% and from 0.0% to1.5% for D1, D2, CK
    and D3, respectively, and the absolute relative errors of the estimated CUt ranged
    from 0.0% to 1.3%, from 0.0% to 1.2%, from 0.0% to 1.6% and from 0.0% to 2.5%
    for D1, D2, CK and D3, respectively. In general, the absolute relative errors
    of and CUt increase when qn increases, except for the extreme values (Nl ≤ 3,
    Ne = 2). The emitter has a large qn compared with a high hydraulic loss, which
    reduces the estimation accuracy of the USM. Notably, USM with Nl = 2 achieved
    an absolute relative error of and CUt was greater than 1%. This means that the
    subunits with emitters that have higher qn should avoid choosing an excessively
    small Nl. FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Distribution of absolute relative
    errors of uniform sampling method (USM) in four irrigation networks whose qn values
    were 0.5 L h−1 (D1), 1 L h−1 (D2), 2 L h−1 (CK) and 3 L h−1 (D3). Figure 6 shows
    the estimation accuracy of the USM in the four irrigation networks with different
    x values. The absolute relative errors of the estimated ranged from 0.0% to 1.7%,
    from 0.0% to 1.5%, from 0.0% to 1.3% and from 0.0% to 1.2% for F1, F2, CK and
    F3, respectively, and the absolute relative errors of the estimated CUt ranged
    from 0.0% to 1.1%, from 0.0% to 1.3%, from 0.0% to 1.6% and from 0.0% to 1.8%
    for F1, F2, CK and F3, respectively. Although the absolute relative error of in
    the extreme area (Nl ≤ 3, Ne ≤ 4) is larger when x is smaller, the estimation
    accuracy of and CUt decreases with increasing x globally. The increase in the
    absolute relative error caused by the sampling design is less than 1% regardless
    of the irrigation network, which indicates that the emission exponent has a slight
    influence on the estimated accuracy of the USM. FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Distribution of absolute relative errors of uniform sampling method
    (USM) in four irrigation networks whose x values were 0.1 (F1), 0.3 (F2), 0.5
    (CK) and 0.6 (F3). Figure 7 shows the estimation accuracy of the USM in the four
    irrigation networks with different Dm values. The absolute relative error of the
    estimated ranged from 0.0% to 2.9%, from 0.0% to 1.6%, from 0.0% to 1.3% and from
    0.0% to 1.4% for M1, M2, CK and M3, respectively, and the absolute relative error
    of the estimated CUt ranged from 0.0% to 3.2%, from 0.0% to 2.3%, from 0.0% to
    1.6% and from 0.0% to 1.6% for M1, M2, CK and M3, respectively. Differences in
    absolute relative error show that the USM was suitable for subunits with large
    Dm values for fixed Nl and Ne. The reason is that a larger diameter is accompanied
    by better hydraulic uniformity, and the estimated error of the USM is relatively
    reduced. With decreasing pipe diameter, the absolute relative errors of and CUt
    increase, especially when Nl is less than 4. For M1 (44 mm)，the result shows that
    a higher estimation error occurs in the combination of uniform sampling with Nl < 4,
    indicating that choosing a larger Nl was beneficial for estimating the performance
    of the subunit with a small value of manifold diameters. FIGURE 7 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Distribution of absolute relative errors of uniform sampling
    method (USM) in four irrigation networks with Dm values of 44.0 mm (M1), 55.4 mm
    (M2), 66.0 mm (CK) and 79.2 mm (M3). The hydraulic uniformity of the subunit varies
    with the emitter type and pipe size. Previous studies have shown similar results
    and explained the fluctuation in hydraulic uniformity (Aminpour et al., 2022;
    Gajghate & Mirajkar, 2020). Obviously, the USM achieved a superior estimation
    accuracy compared with the RSM for a given sample size. Therefore, the USM, which
    evenly extracts tested laterals along the manifold and evenly selects sampling
    emitters along the laterals, is favoured by researchers in the performance assessment
    of subunits (Puig-Bargués et al., 2005; Tang et al., 2018). In addition, the results
    obtained with emitters evenly selected among the subunits were relatively more
    stable. According to the simulation results, the estimation accuracy of the USM
    fluctuated according to the performance of the subunit for a fixed Nl and Ne.
    It is necessary to test additional emitters when the hydraulic uniformity of the
    subunit decreases. To obtain the best estimation accuracy, the arrangement of
    the USM must be adjusted at any time according to the object. From a practical
    standpoint, it is not important to precisely determine the performance of the
    microirrigation subunit, as a reasonable estimate is sufficient. In this work,
    it was found that rather than Ne, choosing an appropriate Nl was more important
    in USM. The reason may be that the minimized difference in emitter discharge in
    the lateral direction was due to the short lateral length of the research subunits
    (80 m). Notably, an unreasonable combination of Nl and Ne may increase the actual
    working intensity. For example, when Nl and Ne were both 4, the measuring emitter
    was evenly distributed, which led to a long distance between the two selected
    emitters. A sample size of 18 (Nl = 3, Ne = 6) was recommended as the appropriate
    sample size for meeting the accuracy and economic objectives of the study. 3.4
    Estimation accuracy of LSMPE according to GA emitter location The diagonal of
    the subunit was selected as the optimal range of LSMPE, and 60 emitters near the
    line were extracted for optimization using GA. The random initial population consisted
    of 40 chromosomes that evolved for 100 generations with probabilities of crossover
    and mutation of 65% and 5%, respectively. Figure 8 shows the emitter locations
    of CK obtained by the GA. For N values of 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14, the discharge rates
    of the selected sampled emitters ranged from 1.42 to 1.74, from 1.42 to 1.80,
    from 1.42 to 1.78, from 1.42 to 1.84 and from 1.39 to 1.81 L h−1, respectively.
    The distribution of the applied emitter discharge was related to the location
    on the sampling line. Generally, LSMPE achieved superior estimation accuracy,
    and the absolute relative errors and CUt were both less than 1%. The table in
    each figure shows the distance between adjacent sampling emitters, which represents
    the distance that testers needed to complete the field test (Figure 8). The minimum
    total distance was 73 m (Figure 8e). It is worth noting that the results in this
    paper represent only a reasonable sampling arrangement, and there was no obvious
    correlation between N and the total distance between sampling emitters. Overall,
    by determining the sampling line, sampling direction and sampling emitter spacing,
    LSMPE has the potential to reduce the time and labour inputs. FIGURE 8 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Emitter locations in diagonal direction of subunit in
    CK: (a) 6 emitters, (b) 8 emitters, (c) 10 emitters, (d) 12 emitters and (e) 14
    emitters. The solid circle, which is between blue and purple, represents sampling
    emitter. The table in the figure shows spacing between two adjacent sampling emitters.
    Along sampling direction, sampling emitters are numbered (from 1 to N) from first
    upstream emitter, and node 0 represents hydrant. To further evaluate the practicability
    of LSMPE, the estimation accuracy of LSMPE in different scenarios was calculated
    (Table 5). By extracting the discharge of the sampling emitter whose location
    was determined using GA, the absolute relative error and CUt could be maintained
    at <1%. In the above sections, the issues of appropriate sample standards in the
    RSM (3.2) and USM (3.3) have been discussed. However, the number of test samples
    was still relatively large in general (>18). In addition, these results are not
    conducive to field hydraulic performance evaluation due to the difficulty in determining
    emitter positioning in the field, which requires considerable time and manpower.
    Compared with two traditional methods, LSMPE concentrates the sampling emitters
    on a straight line, which greatly improves the sampling efficiency. Remarkably,
    despite all the sample sizes analysed in this paper achieving satisfactory accuracy,
    the recommended minimum N of LSMPE was 10, considering the uncertainty caused
    by manufacturing deviation and emitter blockage. The diagonal line of the subunit
    analysed in this paper is recommended as the sampling line in the field test because
    the discharge of the emitter on the line is more representative. TABLE 5. Estimated

    4 CONCLUSIONS The optimization of the sample size and location in the hydraulic
    performance assessment of the microirrigation subunits was studied. The HAPIS
    model was developed as a tool to assist in the optimization of three sampling
    methods (RSM, USM and LSMPE). The results showed that the solution with a greater
    N tended to achieve better estimation accuracy in the RSM. However, the estimation
    accuracy varies with changes in the design parameters of the irrigation network,
    especially the manifold diameter. An acceptable range of N is 20–40, considering
    the possibly unreasonable design, to ensure that the maximum percentage of difference
    of and CUt could be maintained at ±10%. The USM achieved a superior estimation
    accuracy compared with RSM under the same sample size N. The relative absolute
    error can be kept within 3.5% for different irrigation network scenarios. Choosing
    an appropriate Nl is more important for improving the estimation accuracy of the
    USM, while the value of Ne can be appropriately reduced. From a practical standpoint,
    it is recommended that the sampled emitters be distributed over three to five
    laterals due to the high sensitivity of the estimation accuracy to Nl. The LSMPE
    was defined to improve the field sampling efficiency, in which the emitters were
    selected along the sample line. For every scenario in the study, the absolute
    relative error of estimation and CUt could be maintained at <1% by using the LSMPE
    when the emitter location was determined by the GA. A reduction in the distance
    between sampling points is also beneficial for reducing the time and labour inputs.
    A minimum sampling of 10 emitters along the diagonal lines of subunits was recommended.
    The results obtained from this work are suitable for normal microirrigation subunits.
    However, for a long-term microirrigation system, emitter clogging seriously reduces
    the hydraulic performance of the subunit, which directly affects the estimation
    accuracy of the sampling methods. In future work, this issue will be addressed
    through accurate simulation of emitter clogging, and appropriate sampling standards
    for long-term microirrigation subunits will be established. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This

  description: The optimal allocation of agricultural water and land resources is
    of great significance in ensuring sustainable food production and economic benefits
    of farmers. However, agriculture, as an important carbon cycle ecosystem, has
    paid limited attention to carbon sequestration in the optimal allocation of water
    and land resources. Therefore, this study developed a new water-carbon-economy
    coupling model (WCECM) for optimal allocation of agricultural water and land resources.
    In this model, the minimum water scarcity, maximum carbon sequestration and maximum
    economic benefits are taken as the optimization objectives. In addition, surface
    water volume and groundwater volume and planting area etc. were defined as constraints,
    respectively. Then, the model was solved using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic
    Algorithm III (NSGA-III) and the Entropy-weighted-TOPSIS evaluation method. The
    developed model was demonstrated in the largest Farm, Youyi Farm, which is one
    of commercial grain production base in China to analyze the optimization of water
    and land resources from 2010 to 2019. We found that the new WCECM, based on the
    simulation of a complex coupled water-carbon-economy system, can realize the optimal
    allocation of agricultural water and land resources to protect regional water
    resources, increase carbon sequestration and adjust the agricultural planting
    structure. In detail, through the multi-objective optimization model, the planting
    structure and the allocation ratio of surface water and groundwater irrigation
    water consumption are more suitable for this study area. After the optimization,
    the area planted with Rice was significantly reduced, the area planted with Maize
    was increased, and the area planted with Soybean did not change significantly
    compared with the first two crops. The planting structure has changed from focusing
    on paddy cultivation to dryland cultivation, with the ratio of Rice area, Maize
    area and Soybean area being 3:6:1. The water consumption is constrained within
    manageable limits, with an average annual irrigation water consumption of 2.01
    × 108 m3. The amount of carbon sequestered has increased significantly, with an
    average annual increase of 7.8 × 108 kg. Meanwhile, the optimized economic benefits
    increased slightly, with a value of ¥2.35 billion. In short, optimization of water
    and land resources is beneficial for improving farmers' incomes, increasing carbon
    sequestration in agriculture, and conserving water resources.

    allocationCarbon sequestrationNSGAIII 1. Introduction In agricultural production,
    water and land resources are essential elements for ensuring sustainable food
    production (Mo, 2020, Zhou et al., 2020). This complex interaction between water
    and land resources forms the bedrock upon which the edifice of food security and
    agricultural sustainability is built. Agricultural water consumption dominates
    global water withdrawal, accounting for 70% of total water consumption (Wada et
    al., 2012). As the world''s population continues to grow, there will be a significant
    increase in demand for food (Uniyal and Dietrich, 2021). However, meeting the
    demand for irrigated agricultural production often leads to a series of ecological
    and environmental problems. These challenges encompass issues such as over-exploitation
    of groundwater and the disruption of river flows. Therefore, ensuring a stable
    increase in food production is crucial, and it requires optimizing the allocation
    of water and land resources under the rigid constraints of water resources. Water
    resources and land resources are closely linked in agricultural production, and
    the quantity and efficiency of available water resources can be reflected in crop
    growth (Kang et al., 2017). Agricultural water and land allocation has implications
    for crop restructuring due to the interaction between water and land resources
    (Li et al., 2022). An appropriate planting structure can increase crop yields,
    promote food security, and support the development of the agricultural economy.
    Due to the intricate relationship of water and land resources, when establishing
    the agricultural water and land resource optimization allocation model, it is
    necessary to consider multiple indicators and complex constraints. In previous
    studies on the optimal allocation of agricultural water and land resources, researchers
    often focused on optimizing, objectives or constraints, such as minimizing water
    shortage rates and maximizing economic benefits. Pitts, Obreza (1995) achieved
    the effect of adjusting the crop planting structure and rationally allocating
    irrigation water by setting economic objectives. With the strengthening of environmental
    awareness, the ecological and environmental benefits are gradually considered
    in the optimal allocation of water and land resources. Latinopoulos (2005) proposed
    a multi-objective optimization model with a coupled economic-social-environmental
    approach to effectively allocate local water and land resources. Guo et al. (2022)
    developed a distributed multi-objective uncertain optimization model based on
    the unequal water allocation in irrigation areas and the multifaceted issues related
    to society, economy, and ecology. According to the IPCC report, the emission of
    large quantities of greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, etc.) will lead to an increase
    in the average temperature of the Earth by 1.5 °C or 2 °C by 2100, which will
    trigger a series of unpredictable ecological disasters (IPCC, 2021). In order
    to promote the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the Chinese government has
    formulated \"carbon peak\" and \"carbon neutrality\" policies (Liu et al., 2015).
    As an important carbon source and sink ecosystem, agriculture has a carbon footprint
    in all aspects of agricultural production (MacBean and Peylin, 2014). In the past
    decades, agriculture has contributed to 25% of greenhouse gas emissions, raising
    concerns about its environmental impacts (Sinha et al., 2020). This emission level
    has more than doubled in the past few decades (Tubiello et al., 2022). However,
    there are few studies on the optimal allocation of water and land resources in
    agriculture that consider the carbon footprint (Xie et al., 2023). The Youyi Farm,
    located in the Sanjiang Plain, is a commercial grain production base in China.
    It has a large proportion of arable land and generates its primary economic income
    through crop production. However, this region faces several challenges, including
    low efficiency in utilizing surface water and excessive exploitation of groundwater
    resources (Pan et al., 2019). Furthermore, the high level of mechanization at
    the Youyi Farm (Luo et al., 2023), along with practices such as fertilizer usage,
    groundwater irrigation, and crop straw handling, leads to significant carbon emissions,
    posing a threat to the local environment. At present, the government adopts practices
    such as enhancing agricultural subsidies to change the planting structure (Zheng
    et al., 2013); straw is turned over and returned (Ruan et al., 2023) to the field
    instead of straw burning to control carbon emissions. Previous research primarily
    focused on the water resources and economics of the Youyi Farm (Li, 2011, Liu
    et al., 2019). However, there is a lack of systematic research on multi-objective
    optimization of water and land resources in agriculture, including water, carbon,
    and the economy. The goal of this study was to develop a new optimal allocation
    model for agricultural water and land resources and apply it. Firstly, the study
    developed WCECM for optimal allocation of agricultural water and land resources.
    Secondly, the model was applied to the Youyi Farm and its validity was verified.
    Ultimately, the water allocation pattern and planting structure of Youyi Farm
    were optimized to address the issue of excessive groundwater exploitation in the
    region. 2. Methodology 2.1. Framework of the WCECM This paper introduces the idea
    of water-carbon-economy coupling relationship in the previous multi-objective
    optimal allocation of agricultural water and land resources, and establishes WCECM
    for agricultural water and land resources under the known utilization of agricultural
    water and land resources to provide solutions to the existing problems. Combined
    with the evaluation model solution, the final solution of the optimal allocation
    is obtained. This model mainly includes three modules, namely water resource module,
    carbon footprint module, and economic benefits module. The basic idea of model
    building is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (540KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Flow chart for WCECM. 2.1.1. Optimization objectives
    The model consists of an objective function consisting of three aspects: water
    resources, carbon sequestration and the economy benefits, and a set of constraints.
    The objective is to achieve a balanced supply and demand of regional agricultural
    water and land resources, while taking into account the overall optimization of
    maximizing economic benefits, Minimum water shortage and maximum carbon sequestration.
    Ultimately, the goal of balanced and optimal allocation of regional agricultural
    water and land resources will be achieved. Unimportant formulas are placed in
    Appendix 1. The definitions of symbols used in the model is provided in the Appendix
    2. 1) Minimum water shortage: (1) 2) Maximum carbon sequestration The agricultural
    system plays a role in sequestering carbon, as crop growth involves carbon absorption,
    and returning crop residues to the soil can fix carbon dioxide to some extent
    (Feng et al., 2023b). At the same time, agricultural carbon emissions refer to
    the carbon emissions generated during agricultural production, including both
    direct and indirect emissions. Therefore, considering the recent agricultural
    development status, the sources of carbon emissions in the region are mainly considered
    from the following three aspects. First, direct carbon emissions are considered,
    followed by indirect carbon emissions resulting from CH4 emissions, and finally,
    indirect carbon emissions resulting from N2O emissions (Singh et al., 2023). Uniform
    conversion to CO2 equivalent calculations for subsequent comparison and analysis.
    (2) (3) (4) (5) The first tier of carbon emissions refers to carbon emissions
    from agricultural production (including: fertilizers, pesticides and mulch, etc.)
    from inputs of agricultural production materials, direct carbon emissions from
    agricultural production, carbon emissions from crops themselves, CO2 emissions
    from straw burning until 2013 (Wu et al., 2021) and carbon emissions from energy
    consumption for groundwater withdrawals (Dhillon et al., 2019, Siyal et al., 2021).
    From 2013, straw is calculated according to the treatment of all turning and returning
    to the field (Lili et al., 2018), with the following carbon footprint formula:
    (6) (7) (8) The second tier of carbon emissions refers to methane (CH4) emissions
    from Rice fields and is given by the following equation: (9) The third tier of
    carbon emissions refers to N2O emissions from straw burning before 2013, and from
    straw tillage and fertilizer application after 2013, calculated as: (10) (11)
    (12) 3) Maximum economic benefits (13) (14) (15) (16) 2.1.2. Constraint conditions
    These objective functions are subject to the following constraints. 1) Surface
    water volume constraint (17) Where, is the surface water consumption of crop ;
    is the total surface water consumption. 2) Groundwater volume constraint (18)
    Where, is the groundwater consumption of crop ; is the total groundwater consumption.
    3) Total water resource constraint (19) 4) Total planting area constraint (20)
    5) Non-negative constraint (21) (22) (23) 2.1.3. Optimization algorithms for model
    solving The third generation of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III)
    (Deb and Jain, 2014) used in this paper. NSGA-III is a reference point-based non-dominated
    genetic algorithm with approximately the same framework as the NSGA-II algorithm,
    with the difference being that the mechanism for selecting individuals in the
    offspring is different: the NSGAII algorithm is based on The NSGAII algorithm
    selects individuals of the same non-dominated rank based on crowding distance
    calculation, while the NSGAIII algorithm uses a reference point-based approach
    to select offspring (Gu and Wang, 2020). This improvement in selection can solve
    the problem of insufficient convergence and diversity of the algorithm when facing
    multi-objective optimization problems with three or more objectives, making it
    easier for the algorithm to find the global optimal solution. 2.2. Entropy-weighted-TOPSIS
    evaluation model By using NSGA-III, the Pareto optimal solution set of the WCECM
    can be obtained. Further, an agricultural resource''s optimal allocation scheme
    needs to be acquired through a multi-objective decision-making model. The TOPSIS
    method ranks optimization methods according to their proximity to the ideal solution,
    which has the advantage of being objective and reliable, but suffers from the
    problem that the weight values are subjectively influenced by the decision maker
    (Xu et al., 2021). The entropy-TOPSIS method introduces information entropy into
    the TOPSIS method and uses information entropy to calculate the weight values
    of TOPSIS, reducing the bias caused by subjective weight assignment (Yuan and
    Song, 2022). The solutions are ranked in descending order of relative closeness,
    and the solution with the greatest relative closeness is the best solution. The
    indicators in the model is shown at Table 1. Table 1. The indicators in the model.

    and data Youyi Farm is located in the hinterland of the Sanjiang Plain in China,
    between 131°27′50″∼132°15′38″E and 46°28′14″∼46°59′38″N (Luo et al., 2023). The
    total area of Youyi Farm is 18.88 × 104ha. It is one of the important commodity
    grain production bases and also the largest farm in China. The study area features
    a continental monsoon climate of the middle temperate zone (Liu et al., 2019).
    The area is mainly planted with Rice, Maize and Soybean with irrigation water
    requirements of 326.1 mm, 30.1 mm and 25.1 mm, respectively. The total grain production
    is 95.1 × 104 t, and the economic benefit of agriculture is 23.1 × 108 CNY. Starting
    from 2013, all crop residues have been entirely used for returning to the field
    instead of being burned (Ruan et al., 2023), and the current comprehensive utilization
    rate of crop residues has reached 96%. The average annual surface water availability
    is 1.01 × 108 m3, and the annual average groundwater availability is 1.85 × 108
    m3 (Liu et al., 2016). The biggest problem of Youyi Farm is the unbalanced use
    of irrigation water, the inefficient use of surface water and the serious exploitation
    of groundwater ( Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (611KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Location map and crop distribution of Youyi
    Farm. The Youyi Farm has been excessively exploiting groundwater year-round or
    diverting water from other water-rich regions for local agricultural irrigation,
    ignoring the water waste caused by diversion and neglecting the impact of excessive
    exploitation on the sustainable development and utilization of water resources.
    This practice does not align with the principle of sustainable development of
    resources in China. Therefore, the rigid premise of this study is to consider
    the local groundwater exploitable amount and surface water availability as the
    sole sources of available water in the area. Within the scope of available water
    resources, the study also takes into account minimizing the sacrifice of farmers''
    economic benefits. The total planting area should not be excessively reduced to
    ensure food production and food security. Additionally, the level of mechanization
    in agricultural production is relatively high, with comprehensive mechanization
    reaching 99.9% in farmland cultivation (Luo et al., 2023). The farm possesses
    a total of 43,000 agricultural machinery units with a combined power of 52 × 104
    kW from the Youyi Farm Yearbook. It is also essential to ensure that the carbon
    sequestration of crops remains within a reasonable range in order to reduce the
    negative environmental impact of carbon emissions (Tables 2 and 3). Table 2. Multi-year

    used in this paper include: (1) meteorological data (2010–2019) from the National
    Meteorological Science Data Centre (https://data.cma.cn/), (2) statistical data
    including crop acreage and production, weight of straw, population, fertilizer
    and agricultural machinery use mainly from the Youyi Farm Yearbook (2010–2019),
    and information related to surface water and groundwater availability data from
    local Hydrological stations. The surface water and groundwater water usage data
    (2010–2019) were obtained from the Water Resources Bulletin (http://slt.hlj.gov.cn).
    The water requirement of Rice, Maize and Soybean was shown in the Appendix 3.
    4. Results 4.1. Optimization results of water resources The total available water
    resource at Youyi Farm is maintained between 1.6 × 108 m3 to 3.2 × 108 m3, but
    the actual water consumption consistently exceeds the available water capacity
    (Fig. 3a). In the accessible water supply, groundwater accounts for a relatively
    high proportion, while surface water represents approximately 30% of the total
    water availability (Fig. 3b). In the actual water usage, the proportion of surface
    water consumption is around 7% of the total water consumption. However, the annual
    average surface water availability is much higher than the surface water consumption,
    with surface water consumption accounting for only 17.8% of the available surface
    water. This indicates a low efficiency in surface water utilization. Furthermore,
    the actual annual average groundwater consumption exceeds the available groundwater
    resources by approximately 1.2 × 108 m3, indicating a severe overexploitation
    of groundwater. After optimization, there has been a significant change in the
    surface water usage, with the annual average surface water consumption now at
    0.30 × 108 m3. Among the ten-year period, the highest surface water consumption
    occurred in 2015, reaching 0.87 × 108 m3 (Fig. 4a). With the improvement in surface
    water utilization efficiency, efforts have been made to use as much groundwater
    as possible for irrigation within controllable limits. The annual average groundwater
    consumption has been adjusted to 1.71 × 108 m3. Except for the year 2019, the
    groundwater usage in all other years remains below 2 × 108 m3, and the changes
    are stable and controlled (Fig. 4b). In addition, Rice water requirement is seven
    times higher than that of Maize and nearly nine times higher than that of Soybean,
    and the water requirement of paddy fields is much higher than that of dry fields.
    In 2012, there was a significant reduction in groundwater usage, and the contrast
    before and after the water consumption adjustment was most pronounced. This suggests
    that the cropping structure must have been drastically adjusted in that year while
    the crop''s need for irrigation remained unchanged. The adjusted water use for
    both Maize and Soybean in that year was the highest and most variable over the
    decade (Figs. 4e and 4f). Further suggests that the optimized year saw a large
    reduction in Rice acreage and a significant increase in Maize and Soybean acreage.
    Overall, adjusted water use for paddy is still much higher than water use for
    Maize and Soybeans. However, water use for Rice was significantly reduced due
    to available water constraints, and adjusted Rice water consumption in 2011 was
    the lowest in a decade, ultimately resulting in the lowest water consumption result
    in a decade for that year (Fig. 4d). In 2019, the available groundwater quantity
    was sufficient to meet the irrigation demands before optimization, and there was
    even a surplus. The water quantity constraints aimed to maximize the utilization
    of available water resources. As a result, after optimization, the water consumption
    increased while still ensuring a substantial portion of the available water was
    utilized. Download : Download high-res image (262KB) Download : Download full-size

    Maize (f) Soybean. 4.2. Optimization results of planting structure The original
    planting structure at Youyi Farm resulted in an annual water consumption that
    exceeds the available water resources. Due to the high irrigation demand of Rice,
    in order to maintain the total planting area unchanged and control water usage
    within a reasonable range, it is necessary to reduce the area of Rice cultivation
    and correspondingly increase the proportion of dry fields. Before the optimization,
    the average annual planting area ratio of Rice, Maize and Soybean was 6:3:1, and
    the ratio was adjusted to 3:6:1 after optimization. Except for the year 2019,
    where the available water was sufficient to meet the original irrigation requirements,
    resulting in a slight increase in Rice planting area, the Rice acreage decreased
    to varying degrees in all other years (Fig. 5a). Under the premise of limited
    available water, most years'' surface water availability and groundwater extraction
    cannot meet the original irrigation demand. As a result, the reduction in paddy
    field cultivation area after optimization is inevitable. Only in a few years when
    there is sufficient groundwater available for extraction, the optimized planting
    area for Rice will not undergo significant changes. During drought years, the
    reduction in Rice cultivation area is substantial. In 2011, the optimized Rice
    planting area was the smallest in the decade, and the most significant change
    occurred in 2012, with a decrease of approximately 70% compared to the original
    planting area. The inter-annual trend of Rice cultivation area does not completely
    mirror the trend of water availability, mainly because Rice cultivation is also
    affected by irrigation water requirement. Exactly, in 2018, despite being a year
    of abundant water, several meteorological factors led to higher irrigation water
    requirements for Rice. The result is that there is still a large amount of water
    used for rice, and the current water availability is not sufficient to meet the
    water needs of rice. This situation continued to limit Rice cultivation. As a
    consequence, the optimized Rice area decreased significantly according to the
    actual situation. Download : Download high-res image (392KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. Comparison of crop planting structure pre and post optimization:
    (a) Area under Rice cultivation (b) Area under Maize cultivation (c) Area under
    Soybean cultivation. Conversely, the optimized Maize cultivation area exhibits
    varying degrees of growth each year. During dry years, the Maize planting area
    significantly increases, while during abundant water years, the change in Maize
    area is relatively small but still shows an upward trend. Among them, the year
    2017 had the largest increase in Maize planting area, with a growth rate of approximately
    1.7 times the original area. In 2019, the increase in Maize area was relatively
    small, at only 18.5%. Overall, the optimized Maize planting area showed a significant
    increase, which can be attributed to the combined effects of multiple factors.
    Maize has a better carbon sequestration effect and requires less irrigation water
    compared to paddy fields (Fig. 5b). Furthermore, the average annual planted area
    of Soybean was 0.89 × 104ha before optimization, and was adjusted to 0.83 × 104ha
    after optimization. In 2012, the optimized Soybean planted area was 13.7 × 104ha,
    which was the highest in the ten years of the Soybean optimization results, while
    in 2013, the optimized Soybean planted area was 0.52 × 104ha, which was the smallest
    planted area in the ten years of the optimization results. Overall, there was
    not a significant change in the Soybean planting area before and after optimization
    (Fig. 5c). Based on the collected data on planting structure, it was found that
    before the optimization of agricultural land and water resources in Youyi Farm,
    Rice had been the predominant crop type planted at the farm. Indeed, although
    Rice has shown favorable economic benefits, the extensive cultivation of Rice
    has led to a long-term imbalance between water supply and demand, posing a significant
    threat to the sustainable development of water resources and disrupting the local
    water and land balance. The optimization results of the increase in the area of
    Maize planting, to ease the pressure on water resources and food security can
    be fully guaranteed. 4.3. Optimization results of carbon sequestration Enhancing
    the carbon sequestration capacity of agricultural ecosystems is a necessary step
    to achieve carbon neutrality and is also of significant importance for maintaining
    the ecological health of farmlands. Before the optimization, carbon absorption
    by crops at Youyi Farm exhibited relatively stable interannual variations and
    showed a gradual overall increase. However, after the optimization, there was
    increased fluctuation in carbon sequestration levels, and the carbon sequestration
    values in each year were higher than before (Fig. 6c). Under conditions of reduced
    available water, there was significant change in the planting structure in the
    region, with an increase in the area planted with Maize. Research shows that Maize
    has a better carbon sequestration effect per unit area compared to Rice and Soybean.
    As a result, the carbon sequestration increased after optimization despite the
    reduction in available water. Before optimization, Rice accounted for the majority
    of the carbon absorption with a ten-year average carbon absorption of 58.5% (Fig.
    6a). After adjusting the planting area, Maize had the highest proportion of carbon
    absorption, accounting for 65.5% (Fig. 6d). Regarding carbon emissions, agricultural
    production materials (pre-optimization: 17.9%, post- optimization: 24.7%) were
    the second-largest contributor after Rice (pre-optimization: 73%, post- optimization:
    55.7%) (Figs. 6b and 6e). Because all straw at Youyi Farm was turned over and
    returned to the field for treatment after 2013, the share of carbon emissions
    from Maize is not high (pre-optimization: 7.8%, post-optimization: 18.2%). When
    groundwater is extracted and utilized through pumping stations, the process of
    lifting the water involves the conversion of electrical energy into the energy
    required to raise the water. This lifting process can also result in carbon emissions
    that should not be overlooked (pre-optimization: 0.4%, post-optimization: 0.3%).

    4.4. Optimization results of economic benefits Before optimization, the annual
    fluctuation of economic benefits was ¥2.31 billion. After optimization, the overall
    economic benefits increased slightly to ¥2.35 billion (Fig. 7). Specifically,
    the annual average economic benefit of Rice decreased by ¥0.56 billion after optimization,
    while the economic benefit of Maize increased by ¥0.61 billion. The main reason
    for this result is that the study prioritized the available water resources in
    the local area. The economic benefits per unit area were highest for Rice, followed
    by Maize and Soybean. Although Rice cultivation brings higher profits compared
    to Maize and Soybean, it also requires the largest amount of water among these
    three crops. Therefore, in order to ensure an adequate water supply for irrigation
    purposes, it was necessary to convert a portion of paddy fields to dry fields,
    which resulted in a reduction in Rice income. When considering the simultaneous
    optimization of multiple objectives, trade-offs are inevitable to achieve the
    best optimization results. Among the years analyzed, the year 2019 yielded the
    best optimization results with an economic benefit of ¥2.64 billion. On the other
    hand, in 2012, the economic performance was the poorest after optimization, with
    an economic benefit of only ¥1.81 billion. The year 2012 had the largest difference
    in economic benefits pre and post optimization, with a gap of ¥0.44 billion. In
    that year, the available groundwater resources were insufficient to support the
    original main cropping structure of paddy fields, leading to an increase in dry
    field area. Download : Download high-res image (132KB) Download : Download full-size

    In contrast to previous studies (Feng et al., 2023, Feng et al., 2023; Sun et
    al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2023), the WCECM proposed in this study considers water
    deficit, carbon sequestration and economic benefits. In particular, it focuses
    on the consideration of carbon sinks from carbon sources in agriculture and puts
    the focus on the impacts of agricultural activities, crop growth and greenhouse
    gas emissions on the carbon cycle, which allows us to propose a water and land
    resource allocation scheme that is more satisfying to the sustainable development
    of each resource. At the same time, the NSGA-III optimization algorithm is used
    to manage the overall distribution of solutions (Gu and Wang, 2020). It achieves
    this by establishing reference points that help decrease the solution density
    (Deb and Jain, 2014). This ensures the diversity of the resultant population and
    makes it easier to converge. While the scope of application is expanded, its convergence
    effect is better than that of NSGA-II (Ishibuchi et al., 2016). In addition, the
    NSGA-III optimization algorithm can consider multiple conflicting objectives at
    the same time, so it is suitable for complex optimization problems in the case
    of limited resources. Currently, this method has been used many times in multi-objective
    problems (Li et al., 2023, Li et al., 2023, Zhang et al., 2023), and all of them
    have obtained the desired results. From the adjusted results, we find that the
    cropping structure changes with the amount of water available, which is consistent
    with the experimental results of other studies (de Fraiture, 2007, Wu et al.,
    2022, Zhang et al., 2022). The water availability could not satisfy the original
    planting structure. Meanwhile, under the total planting area limitation, scaling
    down the area of high economic return Rice planting to increase the area of dryland
    will inevitably cause a decline in economic income, which is inconsistent with
    the results of (Talukdar et al., 2022). Due to the different perspectives of considering
    the problem, the pursuit of economic efficiency and yield may neglect the impacts
    on the environment and ecosystems. Protecting water resources and maintaining
    ecological balance and ecological health are equally important in agricultural
    development. Over-abstraction of groundwater may lead to environmental problems
    such as lowering of the water table and salinization of the soil (Pulido-Bosch
    et al., 2018), affecting the sustainable development of farmland. When water resources
    are scarce, adjusting the appropriate cropping structure is more suitable than
    reducing irrigation quotas (Chellattan Veettil et al., 2011). In addition, crops
    absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, which not only promotes their own
    growth, but also plays a certain role as a carbon sink in the ecosystem. At the
    same time, crop residue burning, as well as agricultural means of production generate
    greenhouse gas emissions (Xu et al., 2013). The results of this study demonstrate
    that increasing the cultivation area of Maize contributes to an overall enhancement
    of carbon sequestration effects. Rice is a wetland crop, and during its growth,
    its root system and underground parts grow in water, which can lead to some degree
    of CH4 emissions (Laanbroek, 2010). The greenhouse effect of methane is tens of
    times higher than that of carbon dioxide (Hayes, 2004), further illustrating the
    importance of carbon sequestration. Reducing Rice cultivation significantly contributes
    to lowering total carbon emissions, underscoring that rice serves as a substantial
    carbon source (Chivenge et al., 2020). As WCECM can only constrain and allocate
    resources according to given conditions, there should be variations in practical
    problems due to technological constraints, cost limitations, and so on. Promote
    continuous upgrading and innovation of agricultural technologies (Wang et al.,
    2023), such as developing more efficient irrigation technologies, improving water
    use efficiency, and replacing appropriate fertilization techniques and cultivation
    methods to reduce carbon emissions. Optimization models should consider the economic
    costs of crop cultivation, water use and carbon reduction. Ensure that the scenarios
    proposed by the model are feasible in terms of cost and that the model results
    can be realized in practice by, for example, increasing the price of the crop
    or increasing the subsidy for planting (Chandio et al., 2022). Increase farmers''
    awareness and acceptance of new technologies and sustainable agricultural development
    through farmer training and technical support to make the optimization model''s
    recommendations easier to implement (Li et al., 2023, Li et al., 2023). The government
    can introduce policies to encourage farmers to switch to low-carbon farming practices,
    thus facilitating the practical implementation of the model. The implementation
    of the optimization model requires the collaboration of many parties, including
    the government, farmers, research institutes and the community (Bhattacharya and
    Fayezi, 2021). By collaborating with multiple stakeholders, the full potential
    of each participant can be harnessed to collectively promote the practical feasibility
    of the model. Considering the complexity and long-term nature of agriculture,
    the implementation of WCECM requires long-term planning to ensure sustainability
    and continuous improvement. By integrating technical, economic, policy and social
    factors, WCECM can be made more relevant and practically feasible, and will have
    a greater positive impact in practice. The following points represent the limitations
    of this study. Firstly, this study used the entire irrigation area as the analytical
    unit and did not consider variations in actual economic benefits and well-being
    among different farmers or individual fields (Harik et al., 2023). Variations
    in land ownership, agricultural technology levels, and economic conditions among
    individual farmers were not accounted for. Secondly, the study did not take into
    account the contributions of farmland to ecosystems, such as water purification
    and biodiversity conservation (Li et al., 2021). Finally, while various carbon
    sources and sinks were mentioned, the study''s analysis of carbon footprints could
    be expanded and refined (Zhang et al., 2021). A more detailed and comprehensive
    examination of carbon footprints, including their sources and impacts, would provide
    a more thorough understanding of the environmental implications of resource allocation
    decisions. In subsequent study, we will refine the above points. 6. Conclusions
    This study develops WCECM for optimal allocation of agricultural water and land
    resources. The model was applied to the Youyi Farm in the Sanjiang Plain, a commercial
    grain production base in China to address the issues of inappropriate planting
    structure, excessive exploitation of groundwater resources, and insufficient carrying
    capacity of agricultural water and land resources. Based on the findings from
    the study, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) The optimal allocation
    model for agricultural water and land based on water-carbon-economy coupling proposed
    in this study not only considers the concept of sustainable development with water
    resources as a rigid constraint, but also considers the economic benefits and
    carbon sequestration after adjusting the planting structure. By addressing the
    issue of inappropriate crop structure, the optimization not only ensures basic
    food production and food security but also increases carbon sequestration and
    economic benefits. Therefore, the research results also provide recommendations
    for agricultural development and ecological conservation in the Northeast region
    of China. (2) Before optimization, the annual available groundwater volume was
    1.91 × 108 m3, and the annual available surface water volume was 0.9 × 108 m3.
    The annual groundwater usage was 3.10 × 108 m3, while the annual surface water
    usage was 0.16 × 108 m3. Before optimization, groundwater is over-exploited while
    surface water use is inefficient. After optimization, the annual groundwater usage
    reduced to 1.70 × 108 m3, and the annual surface water usage increased to 0.30 × 108
    m3. (3) Compared to before optimization, effectively controlling water resources
    within a reasonable range and transitioning from a predominant paddy field planting
    pattern to a predominant dry field pattern in the Youyi Farm (Rice: Maize: Soybean=3:6:1
    after optimization). After the adjustments, carbon sequestration has increased
    by about 7.8 × 108 kg on average, Maize''s carbon absorption surpasses that of
    Rice, while Rice consistently maintains the highest proportion of carbon emissions.
    And the optimized economic benefits increased slightly, with a value of ¥2.35
    billion. CRediT authorship contribution statement J.X.S. and P.Q. conceived the

  description: Energy demand, energy cost and water scarcity are three of the main
    problems in the new Irrigation districts (ID) where the irrigation distribution
    networks are pressurized and frequently organized on-demand (water is continuously
    available to farmers). This on-demand irrigation generates a huge degree of uncertainty
    for IDs managers when it comes to managing both water and energy use and therefore
    its cost. Knowledge of the irrigation water demand several days in advance would
    facilitate the management of the system and would help to optimize water use and
    energy costs. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and especially deep learning,
    developing forecasting model with capacity to learn autonomously from real information
    from each ID, is a key element to achieve water-energy optimization. Previous
    works have successfully forecast irrigation water demand at IDs for several days
    ahead. However, all these previous works were based on human memory which is fallible
    and not easily pass on from operator to the next. In this work, a new model combined
    a modified version of Transformer Neural Networks (TNNs), fuzzy logic and Genetic
    Algorithms (GAs) for the middle-term time resolution forecast (one-week ahead)
    of irrigation water demand at the ID scale it has been developed and tested in
    a working ID. This model improves the representativeness and accuracy of the best
    previously developed model by 6.1 % and 89.8 %, respectively. In addition, only
    with 9 attention heads and with 1.75 million of parameters (only 16.7 % denser
    than previous works) the developed IWD forecasting model was able to forecast
    the 99.9 % of the scenarios with an average standard error prediction of 2.10
    %.

    learning 1. Introduction Pressurized irrigation systems are one of the best options
    to increase water use efficiency (Daccache et al., 2014a, Daccache et al., 2014b)
    in irrigated agriculture which uses up much of the world’s fresh water sources.
    However, the modernization process of hydraulic infrastructures carried out in
    last decades has led to increase the flexibility in the irrigation operation by
    farmers. The new water distribution networks for irrigation which are managed
    by irrigation districts (ID) make water continuously available to farmers 24 h
    a day. Thus, farmers can decide every day its irrigation scheduling (how and when
    to irrigate) (Playán and Mateos, 2006, Rodríguez-Díaz et al., 2011, Tarjuelo et
    al., 2015). However, this increase in the availability of water by farmers makes
    the integrated management of the ID a complex task (the hydraulic systems must
    work under a wide range of hydraulic operation conditions). Managers of these
    IDs do not know when their users (farmers) are going to irrigate and at what time,
    making it difficult to optimize all the system (pumping stations, failures, repairs,
    energy purchases, etc.). Thus, the uncertainty associated with irrigation water
    demands in water distribution networks which are operated on demand (Plusquellec,
    2009) and the uncertainty of the electricity market (In Spain, last deep change
    on 1st June 2021) are generating challenges in the daily management of irrigation
    districts, mainly in arid and semiarid regions such as Spain. In addition, an
    accurate prediction of water demand would allow for optimal network management
    measures to reduce energy demand. Nowadays, in the new age of digitalization,
    ICTs (Information and Communication Technologies) and intelligent algorithms based
    on Artificial intelligence (AI) are essential to increase and improve the precision
    agriculture management, particularly in the control of the water-energy management
    in pressurized irrigation systems (Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018, Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Traditional strategies to save water and energy in ID such as critical
    point management, sectorization, etc. (Derardja et al., 2019, Fernández García
    et al., 2016, González Perea et al., 2016, Rodríguez Díaz et al., 2012) frequently
    reduce farmers’ water management flexibility, diminishing the positive aspects
    of the irrigation modernization process (on-demand irrigation where water is continuously
    available to farmers). Thus, new water and energy optimization strategies in ID
    are necessary, but without reducing the decision-making power of farmers, based
    on intelligent models which forecasts this farmer behavior. The exploitation of
    AI has modified the technological environment of current irrigated agriculture.
    Based on machine learning from data, these technologies offer new possibilities
    for water-energy nexus management in IDs, leading to increased use efficiencies
    of these resources, making the IDs more sustainable, in environmental, social
    and economic aspects. Based on deep and machine learning, water demand forecasting
    will allow the entire water distribution network (from pumping station to hydrant)
    to be adapted to operate as efficiently as possible, reducing the uncertainty
    caused by on-demand irrigation, optimizing all its resources. Thus, water demand
    forecasting could be one of the main tools to improve IDs operation and help managers
    in the daily decision-making processes but without reducing farmers’ degree of
    freedom. AI, ICTs and bigdata have been applied to solve some forecasting issues
    (mainly of a time series nature) in precision irrigation, IDs and pressurized
    irrigation networks. Since it was first published in its full version in the early
    2000s (Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network
    is the most widely used type of artificial neural network for solving time series
    forecasting problems. At ID scale, ground water level estimations and irrigation
    demand forecasting are two of the main topics addressed for water-energy optimization
    based on AI and bigdata (Sheikh Khozani et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2018). The
    are not many works that tried to address the water demand forecasting in IDs.
    This issue can be approached at different spatial and temporal scales. At spatial
    scale, farm and irrigation district scale can be distinguished. On the other hand,
    at temporal scale, short (one day), middle (around a week), and long (several
    weeks) term scales can be recognised. At present, there are not long-term forecasting
    models either at farm or water user association level because of its complexity
    and dynamism. However, some forecasting models have been developed for the rest
    of the spatial and temporal scales. At short-term time scales, some forecasting
    models have been developed at ID (González Perea et al., 2019a, González Perea
    et al., 2015, Pulido-Calvo and Gutiérrez-Estrada, 2009) and farm scales (González
    Perea et al., 2021, González Perea et al., 2019b, González Perea et al., 2018).
    However, although the accuracy of short-term forecasting models for different
    spatial scales is good, managers require longer term forecasting models since
    they would be much more practical in the decision making and adopt the best management
    strategies in advance. Longer term forecasting models would be much more useful
    for managers to know in advance how much water will be required and be more efficient
    in the use of water and energy resources and perform a cost-effective purchase
    of the electric energy. At middle-term time scales, Forouhar et al. (2022) developed
    a hybrid framework by incorporating existing physical knowledge (conceptual model
    based on observation data to understand the crop water requirements factors) of
    the system into a data-driven model to predict the irrigation water demand up
    to 7 days ahead for an irrigation district in Victoria, Australia. However, although
    results showed that the integration of physical system understanding into data-driven
    models can improve the performance of the predictions, the accuracy is not enough
    for an integrated management of water and energy resources in IDs. González Perea
    et al. (2023) developed a hybrid model based on memory with a size of 1.5 million
    of parameters for one-week forecasting of irrigation water demand at ID scale.
    Although, the global representativeness and accuracy of this model was 95 % and
    20 %, respectively, the accuracy for each of the seven forecasted days were 16.42
    %, 19.01 %, 20.74 %, 21.08 %, 21.89 %, 22.09 % and 22.31 %, respectively and its
    representativeness ranged from 97.06 % to 85.49 %. While, this forecasting model
    is the most accurate and has the highest temporal resolution (middle-term time
    scale) to date, the model showed memory leakage effects as the forecast time increases,
    making the model inaccurate from the third forecasted day. This problem is common
    in forecasting models based on memory such as LSTM and all its modifications González
    Perea et al. (2023). All these problems make them difficult to integrate in the
    day-to-day of IDs. In 2018 a new approach was developed for time series forecasting
    that is not based on memory but on attention mechanisms (Vaswani et al., 2017).
    These attentional mechanisms, working under a new artificial neural network architecture
    called Transformer, have revolutionised the field of natural language processing
    (NLP), which is a particular case of time series forecasting, leading to developments
    such as the models known as GPT-X (Generative Pre-trained Transformers, OpenAI),
    BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, Google), PALM (Pathways
    Language Model, Google), LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications, Google),
    etc. Transformer model and its attention mechanism has not only been applied to
    NLP issues, but to other times series forecasting issues. For example, (Karthik
    et al., 2020) developed an attention embedded residual CNN (Convolutional Neural
    Network) model for disease detection in tomato leave. Abed et al. (2023) applied
    transformer-based deep learning architecture for evaporation prediction in four
    different Malaysian regions. However, no previous works have been published in
    irrigation water management or forecasting. Thus, in this work, a new hybrid model
    combined a modified version of Transformer Neural Networks (TNNs), fuzzy logic
    and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for the middle-term time resolution forecast (one-week
    ahead) of irrigation water demand at ID scale has been developed. The developed
    model has been tested in a real ID. 2. Methodology 2.1. Study area and data source
    Canal del Zújar Irrigation District (CZID) (Fig. 1) was selected as real ID to
    validate and test the forecast model developed in this study. The model was trained
    and tested with daily data from the 2015 to 2022 irrigation seasons. This WUA,
    located in Southwest Spain (Extremadura region), is made up of 10 independent
    hydraulic sectors covering a total area of 21141 ha. The closest weather station
    is “Don Benito-EFA” (UTM coordinates (x, y, zone): 252468, 431917, 30). The average
    temperature in the area ranges from 7.1 °C in January to 25 °C in July, and the
    average maximum temperature ranges from 13.2 °C to 35.1 °C. Average annual rainfall
    is 390 mm. Maximum evapotranspiration occurs in July, with a daily average of
    7 mm. Average annual evapotranspiration is 1296 mm. Sector II has selected for
    this work, which covers an irrigated area of 2691 ha and is composed of 191 hydrants.
    The main crops are tomato, maize and rice (90 % of the total irrigated area).
    Drip irrigation is used for tomato and maize crops, while rice is flood irrigated.
    Each hydrant has a flowmeter which automatically records the hourly volume of
    water applied. The complete cleaned dataset of the daily irrigation water demand
    contained a total of 1849 measures corresponding to all the irrigation seasons
    studied in this work. This dataset was randomly divided into two subsets: training
    dataset (80 % of the total measures of the original dataset) and test dataset
    (20 % of the total measures of the original dataset). The selection of the train/test
    subsets is done over a moving window with an amplitude equal to the spacing of
    the input and output variables. Thus, each record of these subsets consists of
    t-7…to t input and target data. Download : Download high-res image (333KB) Download

    Irrigation District (CZID). 2.2. Problem approach The middle-term (one-week ahead)
    irrigation water demand forecasting model at irrigation district scale without
    memory mechanisms to improve the model accuracy model has been formulated as multi-step
    time series forecasting problem. Frequently, like in some NLP tasks such as speech
    recognition or Q&A (question and answer systems), the length of the input and
    the output of the time series is not the same. In these scenarios, a specific
    structure of artificial neural networks must be applied to solve these multi-step
    time series forecasting problems. This structure is known as sequence-to-sequence
    (seq2seq) architecture in NLP tasks or encoder-decoder architecture for multi-step
    time series forecasting problems. Encoder-decoder model whose elemental architecture
    is shown in Fig. 2a consist of training models in which a time series from one
    domain is transformed into a time series from another domain. Thus, the encoder
    part transforms the input time series into a single fixed length vector known
    as the context vector. This context vector keeps all the information that the
    encoder can extract from the input time series, including relationships between
    different time steps and within network layers. The decoder part is responsible
    for transforming the context vector into the output time series. Download : Download

    Encoder-Decoder architecture; (b) Modified Transformer neural network (TNN) architecture;

    layers. In this work, the decoder model has also its own input time series to
    improve the training process which is detailed in the transformer neural network
    description. Thus, this encoder-decoder architecture has been applied by a new
    model based on transformer neural networks whose architecture is described as
    follows. This new model has been developed in Python programming language (v3.10)
    (Van et al., 2009). 2.3. Transformer neural network architecture The TNN architecture
    follows a recursive encoder-decoder structure (fig, 2b) with multi-head attention
    mechanisms, using teacher forcing for training. At the core, the TNN contains
    a stack of encoder and decoder layers. Thus, the number of stacked encoder layers
    and decoder layers have been denoted as Nenc and Ndec, respectively. All the encoder
    layers are identical to one another and similarly all the decoders are also identical.
    Fig. 2c shows the general architecture for a transformer model with a Necn and
    Ndec value of 2 and 3 respectively. In this model, both Nenc and Ndec will be
    considered as hyperparameters, and will be optimized by the GA described in the
    next section. The Encoder layer is made up by self-Attention Encoder (Fig. 2b)
    sublayer and feed forward sublayer while Decoder layer is made up by self-Attention
    Decoder sublayer, an Encoder-Decoder attention sublayer and a feed forward sublayer.
    Each encoder and decoder layer has its own set of weights and all the sublayers
    in each encoder and decoder layers is followed by a sublayer labelled as Add&Norm
    (Fig. 2b). Add&Norm sublayer are in fact two separate sublayers (Fig. 3). The
    add sublayer is a residual connection layer where the sum together of the result
    of the previous sublayer F(x) and the input x is performed. The norm sublayer
    is a normalization layer (Ba et al., 2016) where the normalization statistics
    of a layer l (mean, μl and deviation, σl) from the summed input to the neuros
    within a hidden layer is directly estimated as follows: (1) (2) where H is the
    number of hidden units in a layer and is the input of the hidden units i at the
    layer l. (3) where is normalized summed input to the i hidden unit in the l layer
    and g is a gain parameter scaling the normalized activation before the non-linear
    activation function. Download : Download high-res image (175KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Unfolding the sublayer Add&Norm. Feed forward sublayer
    (FFN) is a dense or perceptron neural network (Rumelhart et al., 1986) which acts
    as the hidden layers in a classical neural network. The first layer takes ReLU
    (Rectified linear unit) as the activation function and the second takes Linear
    activation functions, computing the output of this sublayer as shown in Eq. (4).
    (4) where W1, b1, W2 and b2 are the weights and bias parameters of the two hidden
    layers of this sublayer, respectively. ReLU activation functions is described
    in Eq. (5), as follows: (5) where x is the input to a neuron and f(x) is the output
    of the neuron. In this work, both Encoder and Decoder layers have a new version
    of the traditional positional encoding adapted to the water forecasting problem
    which is described in the next section. Once the information is passed through
    the stacked encoder and decoder layers, there is an output layer to generate the
    final output. This output layer is a feedforward layer, with one hidden layer.
    2.3.1. Positional encoding for water demand time series forecasting Contrary to
    models based on recurrent neural networks where information is sequentially passed
    through the network, models based on transformers does not use this recurrence
    loop. Consequently, these models compute all information parallelly and so no
    positional information for each input variable can be found. This is the major
    advantage over the RNN architecture and its ‘Alzheimer effect’, but it means that
    position is lost, and must be added back in separately. In addition, in multistep
    time series forecasting problems an additional time position must also be introduced
    at the beginning of the model. Hence, in this work, two new terms wereencoded
    to pass positional information to the developed model. The first term adds information
    about the position within the input vector to the forecasting model (e.g., the
    daily average temperature of 4 days before is located at position 11 of the input
    vector). The second term adds information about the real day of each input variable
    (e.g., time series variables corresponding to 30 April and 1 May should be closer
    than those belonging to 14 May and 20 June). All these information must be encoded
    and added to the model together with the input time series. This positional encoding
    (PE) (Fig. 2b) is computed independently of the input time series according to
    Eqs. (5), (6). These are fixed values that depends only on the length of the input/output
    time series and the day of the year (doi) of each variable of the time series.
    (6) (7) where doi is the day of the year of each variable of the input and target
    time series; pos indicates the position of each value in the time series; dmodel
    is the length of the encoding vector for input and target in encoder and decoder
    sublayers and i is the index value into this encoding vector. Therefore, positional
    encoding is a stack of sines and cosines that vibrate at different frequencies
    depending on their location along the depth of the encoding vector, the position
    in the vector and the day of the year. Thus, positional encoding interleaves a
    sine and a cosine curve, with sine values for all even indexes and cos values
    for all odd indexes. Fig. 4 shows an example for an input time series consisting
    of two variables (temperature and reference evapotranspiration, ET0) in two previous
    days (t-1 and t-2) and a dmodel value of 5. Download : Download high-res image

    key to the transformer’s ground-breaking performance is its use of Attention.
    In contrast to RNN based models where each variable of the time series is processed
    sequentially, attention enables the model to focus on other variables in the input/target
    time series while a specific variable is processed. While RNN processes recurrently
    each variable of input time series, transformer architecture uses self-attention
    by relating every input/target variable in the input/target time series to every
    other variable (Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image (144KB) Download :

    mechanisms in TNN. Attention mechanisms are used in TNNs in three places (Fig.
    2b): self-attention Encoder where the encoder pays attention itself (to the input
    time series); self-attention Decoder where the decoder pays attention itself (to
    the target time series) and Encoder-Decoder attention where the decoder layer
    pays attention to the input time series. The three attention blocks (self-attention
    Encoder, self-attention Decoder and Encoder-Decoder attention) takes its input
    in the form of three parameters, known as Query (Q), Key (K) and Value (V). In
    the blocks self-attention Encoder and self-attention Decoder, the Encoder and
    Decoder layers’s input/target are passed to all three parameters, Q, K and V.
    However, in the Encoder-Decoder attention, the output of the final Encoder layer
    is passed to the V and K parameters. The output of the self-attention Decoder
    (and Add&Norm) is passed to the Q parameter. TNN denominates each attention processor
    an Attention head and repeat it several times in parallel in a process known as
    Multi-Head attention. The Multi-Head attention mechanism gives TNN power of discrimination,
    by combining several similar attention calculations (Attention heads). The three
    attention blocks in transformer (self-Attention Encoder, self-Attention Decoder
    and Encoder-Decoder Attention) incorporate a multi-head attention mechanism. Fig.
    6 shows the computational graph of how multi-head attention process is performed.
    Each V, K, and Q parameters are passed through separate Linear Layers (Feed Forward
    layer), each with their own weights which are adjusted during training process.
    Then, the results of these operations are combined to produce the attention score
    (Scaled Dot-product attention (Fig. 6)), according to Eq. (8). (8) where dK is
    the dimension of the K parameter and softmax function is describe in equation

    image Fig. 6. Self-attention block and scaled Dot-Product Attention in TNN. This
    attention score is performed by every variable in the time series against the
    other variables of the input/target time series. This leads to having a score
    value for each variable of the times series relative to each other. For example,
    if the variable x2 (e.g. temperature of two previous days) is not relevant for
    the variable x1 (e.g. ET0 of the two previous days), then the attention score
    gives low probability score. In the end, every input/target variable in the input/target
    time series obtains a new value for itself. Multi-head attention score is then
    performed according to equation (10): (10) where nheads is the number of heads
    of the developed model; W0 is the set of weights of the hidden layer of the linear
    layer (last linear layer shown in Fig. 6) and headi is computed as follows: (11)
    where , and are the set of weights belonging to the hidden layer of the linear
    layers associated to Q, K and V parameters, respectively and the attention head
    i. The model proposed in this work based on TNNs was entirely developed with TensorFlow
    v2.10.0 (Abadi et al., 2015) and Keras v2.10.0 (Chollet, 2015). Adaptative momentum
    algorithm (Adam) (Kingma and Ba, 2015) was used for the training process of the
    forecasting model with β1, β2 and ε values of 0.9, 0.98 and 10−9, respectively.
    The function shown in Eq. (12) was used as dynamic learning rate in Adam algorithm:
    (12) where nepochs is the total number of epochs during the training process and
    epoch is each step of the training process. Glorot uniform initialized algorithm
    (Glorot and Bengio, 2010) was used to initialize all synaptic weights because
    of its high performance (faster convergence) when Adams training function is used.
    The loss function used during the training process was the mean square error (mse).
    Additionally, early stopping technique was used to improve the developed model''s
    ability to perform well on unseen data by stopping the training process at an
    optimal point. Thus, this technique is widely used in training artificial neural
    networks to prevent overfitting by monitoring the model''s performance on a validation
    set during training and stopping the process when the performance starts to worsen.
    By halting training before the model overfits to the training data too much, early
    stopping helps strike a balance between fitting the data well and generalizing
    to new, unseen data, ensuring the model captures essential patterns without getting
    too specialized. 2.4. Optimization of the water demand forecasting model Synaptic
    weights (W) and attention parameters (Q, K, V) are automatically optimized during
    the training process by the training algorithm Adam, since TNN as other artificial
    neural networks are machine learning models with the ability to learn autonomously
    from data. However, there is another set of parameters, the hyperparameters of
    the forecasting model, which have to be adjusted before the training process.
    The ability to learn, generalize and therefore to forecast the water demand in
    an irrigation district is determined by its hyperparameters. In this work, the
    hyperparameters of the developed model have been optimized by NSGA-II genetic
    algorithm. Fig. 7 shows the flowchart of the optimization process of the developed
    model based on TNN. The optimization process starts by randomly generating a set
    of potential solutions. This set of initial solutions constitutes the initial
    population which is made up of a set of individuals or chromosomes (each solution
    represents one individual or chromosome). Consequently, each individual or chromosome
    is a water demand forecasting model whose architecture (set of hyperparameters)
    is defined by the individual. The initial population has a size of npop individuals
    or chromosomes. Each of these individuals or chromosomes (potential solutions)
    is made up of a set of genes or decision variables (ngenes). In this work, each
    gene represents one hyperparameters of the forecasting model to be optimized.

    Fig. 7. Flow chart of the optimization process of the developed water demand forecasting
    model. The hyperparameters to be optimized and the decision variables of the optimization
    process were: the number of stacked Encoder and Decoder layers (Nenc, Ndec); the
    length of the encoding vector for input and target in encoder and decoder layers
    (dmodel), i.e. the density of the transformation space of the input and target
    vectors; the number of attention heads (nheads) and the number of neurons of the
    hidden layers of the feed forward neural networks sublayers (ndff). Table 1 shows
    the value range and the data type for each of these genes in the optimization
    process. Thus, the first genes represent the hyperparameter Nenc (and Ndec) which
    ranged from 1 to 6, the second genes belonged to dmodel with a potential range
    of 1–260, and the two last genes or decision variables were nheads (range values
    from 1 to 13) and ndff (range values from 10 to 800), respectively. All the ranges
    were integer values with step change of 1. Table 1. Decision variables to be optimized
    during the optimization process of the hybrid model. Gen Position Hyperparameter
    Range values Type value Description Gen1 Nenc,dec 1–6 Integer Number of stacked
    Encoder and Decoder layers. Gen2 dmodel 1–260 Integer Length of the encoding vector.
    Gen3 nheads 1–13 Integer Number of attention heads. Gen4 ndff 10–800 Integer Number
    of neurons of the hidden layers of the feed forward neural networks sublayers.
    Once the initial population is initialized, each individual (i.e. each potential
    water demand forecasting model defined by individual Indi) is built, trained and
    tested. Then, each individual obtained their associated objectives functions (OF1
    and OF2) in order to measure the fitness of each forecasting model. In this work,
    the optimization process maximized de OF1 which defines the average of the determination
    coefficient, R2, of the forecasting model outputs (output time series of irrigation
    water demand 7 days ahead) and minimized OF2 which defines the average of the
    standard error prediction, SEP (Ventura et al., 1995), i.e., the model accuracy.
    After computing the objective functions for all individuals in the initial population,
    the initial population was sorted according to the fitness of each individual
    (defined by the values of the objective functions). The best npop/2 individuals
    were then selected and become the parents of the next generation. Then, a new
    generation of npop individuals was created by crossover and mutations of the parent
    individuals. Finally, the set of npop optimal individuals (optimal forecasting
    models) defined by the Pareto Front was obtained in the last generation (generation
    nGEN). 2.5. Identification of the water demand forecasting model inputs Previously
    to generate and optimize the hybrid model a dimension reduction of the input space
    is essential. This dimension reduction must identify the significant inputs from
    the set of possible inputs (potential inputs) for the forecasting hybrid model.
    There are many techniques to achieve this input space reduction. Principal component
    analysis or partial least square cardinal components are two widely used techniques.
    However, when the significant input variables resulting from these techniques
    are used in nonlinear models, very poor results are usually obtained (Lin et al.,
    1996a). The methodology proposed in this work automatically analyzes and identifies
    the most representative input variables for the predictive model to be developed.
    Therefore, an adaptation of this methodology for a multivariate time series problems
    has been used in this work to identify the significant inputs in an automatic
    way using fuzzy curves and fuzzy surfaces. The potential inputs analysed were
    structured in temporal frame which ranged from 2 (t-1, t-2) to 10 days (t-1, t-2,
    …, t-10). Thus, this methodology can considered the autocorrelation and cross-correlation
    between variables. For a potential input variable v, PotIv, a fuzzy curve beam,
    cbv, is created (Eq. (13). Each curve determined the relationship between v and
    the output variable of the forecasting model (target variable), which here was
    the daily irrigation water demand (IWD) of the ID. (13) where µv, k is the fuzzy
    membership function of point k in the space v- IWD, which relates the potential
    input variable v and the daily irrigation water demand of the entire IDand is
    defined by Eq. (14); M is the total number of points in the space PotIv- IWD and
    IWDk is the daily irrigation water demand of the entire ID in point k of the space
    PotIv-IWD. (14) where PotIv,k is the value of PotIv at point k in the space PIv-IWD
    and b takes a value close to two (Lin et al., 1996b). Hereafter, the mean square
    error values, MSE, of each cbv curve were computed and sorted in ascending order
    according to Eq. (15). If there is a fully random relationship between the input
    variable v and the IWD, the fuzzy curves are flat, and the MSEcbv is large. Otherwise,
    MSEcbv takes small values when the relationship in the space PotIv-IWD is more
    significant. (15) According to Lin et al., 1996a, Lin et al., 1996b, a fuzzy surface
    is a space with a two-dimensional fuzzy curve. This fuzzy surface, fsiv,ij, is
    defined in equation (16). (16) where PotIv and PotIij are two potential input
    variables. Then, like Eq. (13), the MSE was computed for each fuzzy surface, .
    Thus, fuzzy curves were initially used to rank all the potential input variables
    in ascending order. The PotI variable with the smallest MSEcbv was the most important
    input variable. Fuzzy surfaces were then used to find the independent input variables
    and to eliminate the related input in each step (20 % eliminated according to
    Lin et al., 1996a, Lin et al., 1996b). Therefore, in each step, new fuzzy surfaces
    were computed, and 20 % of the potential input variable with the largest was eliminated.
    Once the most important inputs have been automatically identified as previously
    detailed, the final dataset (original data) composed of input variables- target
    was determined. Finally, the original data set must be split into three subsets
    (training set, validation set and testing set) to achieve a good generalization
    of the hybrid model. This division of the original dataset was computed by a Monte
    Carlo algorithm maintaining the same mean and standard deviation in the three
    subsets as the original dataset (Ballesteros et al., 2016). 3. Results and discussion
    The irrigation water demand forecasting model was applied to the CZID. To ensure
    the reliability and transparency of results, all performance or statistic metrics
    shown in this section were obtained over the test dataset. In addition, stopping
    early technique was added during model training to avoid reaching the remembering
    phase. The methodology previously described to identify the most important inputs
    for the water demand forecasting model assessed a total of 18 potential inputs
    in a temporal frame which ranged from 2 (t-1, t-2) to 10 days (t-1, t-2, …, t-10).
    Only four ease-to-take variables were finally selected in a temporal frame of
    7 days (from t-1 to t-7) as inputs for the irrigation demand forecasting model.
    Thus, from t-1 to t-7, the variables selected were the previous IWD measures (in
    mm), the average air temperature (Tave, °C), solar radiation (Rad, MJ m−2) and
    reference evapotranspiration (ETo, mm), making a total of 28 inputs to the forecasting
    model and 7 outputs (IWD from t + 1 to t + 7). The Irrigation water demand forecasting
    model was specifically designed to forecast Individual farmers’ behaviours within
    the ID rather than aggregating the irrigation needs of crops. The primary distinction
    lies in how much irrigation water each farmer uses. Generally, farmers who schedule
    irrigation more effectively tend to have a smaller difference between the water
    they apply and the actual crop needs. However, various factors—like socio-cultural
    practices, individual farmer perceptions based on experience, or unique aspects
    of the irrigation system—result in some farmers deviating significantly from optimal
    irrigation practices. Previous works concluded that the wind chill temperature
    (mainly determined by temperature, wind speed and relative humidity) is essential
    to obtain a good estimation of the daily irrigation water demand in an ID. This
    effect of the wind chill of each farmer seems to be blurred when aggregated to
    a larger spatial scale such as the entire ID (González Perea et al., 2023, González
    Perea et al., 2015). However, including average air temperature, radiation, and
    reference evapotranspiration is enough to consider this wind chill effect. The
    methodology developed in this work for input variables identification can consider
    this blurred effect of the wind chill at larger scale selecting these four input
    variables. 3.1. Optimization the IWD forecasting model architecture The depth
    or density of the forecasting model defined by Nenc, Ndec, dmodel, nheads and
    ndff were optimized by the NSGA-II. The size of the initial population (npop)
    was set to 50 individuals, i.e., 50 potential IWD forecasting models, randomly
    generated. This initial population evolved over 200 generations (NGEN) before
    its objective functions (OF1 and OF2) were stabilised. The probabilities for crossover
    and mutation were set to 90 % and 10 %, respectively. After optimization process,
    the 50 individuals of the last generations determined the Pareto front. Fig. 8
    shows the objective functions values for both the initial population and the Pareto
    front. The aim of the optimization process carried out by the NSGA-II was the
    maximization and the minimization of the OF1 and OF2, respectively. As the two
    objective functions correspond to the representativeness (R2) of the forecasting
    model and its accuracy (SEP), OF1 and OF2 are opposites, i.e., the improvement
    of OF1 leads to a detriment of OF2 and contrarywise. In this kind of the optimization
    issues where the two objective functions are opposed, it is usual to find a Pareto
    front located in the lower right corner region of the OF1-OF2 space (Fig. 8).
    Unlike other forecasting models for time series problems such as memory-based
    models, the architecture of the forecasting model and hence its density determines
    its forecasting aptitude. Thus, the forecasting aptitude of each model of the
    initial population which is characterized by is objective functions ranged from
    3.2 % to 97.1 % and from 18.8 % and 88.7 % for OF1 and OF2, respectively. For
    example, in González Perea et al. (2023) where a memory-based forecasting model
    was developed to forecast the IWD to 7 days ahead, the value the range of OF1
    and OF2 in the initial population was much smaller (4.97 % and 6.23 % variation
    between the minimum and maximum values for the two objective functions, respectively)
    than in this work. Consequently, the right optimization of the hyperparameters
    of the IWD forecasting model is key to achieve an adequate predictive capacity
    of the model. The OF1 value (R2) of all the individuals from to the Pareto front
    which are in the lower right corner of the Fig. 8 was higher than 99.9 % whereas
    the OF2 values ranged from 1.1 % to 7.2 %. Download : Download high-res image
    (290KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Values of OF1 and OF2 for
    the initial population and the Pareto Front after optimization process for the
    test dataset. After optimization process, OF2 improved much more (from a range
    of 18.8–88.7 % to 1.1–7.2 %) than OF1 (from 3.2 % to 97.1 %), although the amplitude
    of OF1 range was considerably reduced. When the input variables of a forecasting
    model are temporally correlated (as in this work where even the variable to be
    forecasted also appears as input variable of the hybrid model), its R2 value is
    usually high,. Consequently, the maximum OF1 value in the initial population is
    not much worse than the maximum OF1 value of the Pareto front. However, its accuracy
    is improved considerably. The difference in the values of both objective functions
    was very narrow for all individuals of the Pareto front (particularly in the range
    of 1–3 % for OF2). Consequently, the absolute density of the forecasting model
    (number of total forecasting model parameters) was also considered as a selection
    criterion in this work. Thus, Fig. 8 shows the selected forecasting model as optimal
    IWD forecasting model. Fig. 9 shows the histogram of the values of the decision
    variables (Nenc, Ndec, dmodel, nheads and ndff) for the initial population (Fig.
    9a) and the Pareto front (Fig. 9b). The number of encoder and decoder layers in
    the forecasting model was controlled by the first gen (gen1) of the individual
    (or chromosome), whose values ranged from 1 to 6 (Table 1). The random generation
    of the initial population based on a uniform distribution for each of its genes
    led to the same occurrence probability for all values of each decision space.
    Thus, the frequency of the number of Nenc and Ndec were similar (Fig. 9a). After
    optimization process, two encoder and decoder layers were enough for most of the
    individual at the Pareto front (45 over 50 individuals) to achieve optimal values
    in their objective functions. Similarly, dmodel, nheads and ndff reach uniform
    occurrence frequency in the initial population but they evolved differently during
    the optimization process. dmodel, controlled by gen2, which defines the length
    of the transformation space of the input values to the encoder and the decoder
    (Fig. 7) tended to obtain average values according to its potential range (from
    1 to 260). Thus, most individuals (42 over 50 individuals) of the Pareto from
    took a dmodel which ranged from 90 to 94 and only 4 individuals had a dmodel values
    between 110 and 117. Therefore, the forecasting model did not need to have a very
    dense input transformation space to be able to interpret such input data. Similarly,
    most individuals of the Pareto front (43 over 50 individuals) took a value of
    the number of heads (nheads) of the attention mechanisms, defined by gen3, of
    7 heads (values could range from 1 to 13). Four forecasting models of the Pareto
    front needed 8 attention heads and 3 needed 9 attention heads to optimize their
    objective functions. However, the behaviour of the ndff values which is defined
    by the gen4 was different. The ndff value in 35 over 50 individuals of the Pareto
    front ranged from 725 to 770. This gene controls the density (number of neurons)
    of the feedforward network (FFN) both encoder and decoder layers. So, the output
    interpretation space of the encoder and decoder layers need to be much denser
    than the corresponding input space. Although these values are very close to the
    upper limit stablished for this gene (upper limit of 800) (Table 1), no individual
    reached this limit. If a considerable number of individuals in the Pareto front
    had reached this upper limit, it would have indicated that the potential range
    of this gene was not rightly stablished Hence, a tuning of this range and a new
    optimization process would have been required. Download : Download high-res image

    by the decision variables in the initial population (a) and the Pareto front (b)
    of the optimization process. According to results shown in Fig. 9, the optimal
    model has to forecast a time series of IWD at real ID spatial scale and middle
    term temporal scale (7 days ahead). This is a complex task, considering the uncertainty
    associated with the decisions that each farmer makes every day on his farm and
    the aggregation of all farmers’ behaviour at ID level. Consequently, all the optimal
    forecasting models of the Pareto front were rather dense with more than one million
    of parameters in each of them. This fact gives an idea of the complexity of the
    problem to be solved, especially in comparison with the models shown in the introduction
    which only several thousands of parameters. 3.2. Optimal IWD forecasting model
    The election of the optimal forecasting model from a Pareto front (Fig. 8) when
    its objective functions are opposite usually does not have a single and direct
    solution. Typically, a deep discussion between those models that obtain better
    OF1 and OF2 values are necessary. In these scenarios, a balance between representativeness
    and accuracy must be discussed (high accuracy at the cost of covering fewer scenarios,
    i.e., less representativeness or vice versa). However, the Pareto front of the
    Fig. 8 shows a very narrow amplitude for both objective functions. At equal forecasting
    capacity, a less dense forecasting model is also less able to learn new events,
    but it is more robust and less sensitive to failures (and more stable, computationally
    fast, …). All forecasting models of the Pareto front shown high adaptability and
    generalization. Consequently, the absolute density of the model was used as a
    third and differentiating criterion of selecting the optimal model. Thus, the
    selected optimal irrigation water demand forecasting model (highlighted in Fig.
    8) showed a total number of parameters of 1.75 million when the mean number of
    parameters in the Pareto front was 2.03 million parameters with a standard deviation
    of 0.422 million parameters. The optimal model selected in this work was only
    16.7 % denser than the one developed in González Perea et al. (2023), but its
    representativeness is a 6.1 % higher with an improvement in forecasting accuracy
    of 89.8 %. The number of encoder layers and decoder layers of the selected optimal
    model was 2 with a density of the transformation space of the input data of 118
    (Table 2). The optimal model needed 9 attention heads and a ndff value of 335.
    This forecasting model architecture had 670,394 parameters in the encoder layer,
    1,078,255 parameters in the decoder layer and 117 parameters in the last dense
    layer. Thus, the total number of parameters for this forecasting model was 1748768.
    The average values for OF1 and OF2, i.e., R2 and SEP were 99.9 % and 2.10 %, respectively
    (Table 2). With these average values of representativeness and accuracy, Fig.
    10 shows the relationship between the observed irrigation water demand (actual
    irrigation water demand) and the forecasted irrigation water demand for each of
    the forecasting days (from t − 1 to t + 7) provided by the selected optimal forecasting
    water demand model. In this figure, the SEP values for each forecast day and the
    density distribution of the test dataset is also shown. The density distribution
    of the test dataset shows how the highest concentration of the daily water irrigation
    records occurred at low irrigation water volumesThus, the forecasting model performed
    better for these low values, due to the greater availability of irrigation water
    demand information. A second peak in the density distribution was found for values
    around 105 m3. This region generally corresponds to the months of highest irrigation
    water demand of the irrigation distribution network. Daily irrigation wate values
    around 1.5·105 m3 are very rare, but important enough to be learned be the forecasting
    model. These values are not outliers (outliers were initially pre-processed) but
    less frequent values that correspond to short periods of high daily water demand
    (high temperatures or high wind chill, higher concentration of many crops, etc.).
    To highlight the performance of the forecasting model under running conditions
    (not in its training mode), Fig. 11 shows the daily water demand forecasting (from
    t + 1 to t + 7) at four different randomly selected days of the test dataset (2016-03-19;

    The main feature of TNN based forecasting models is their attention mechanisms
    where all the inputs to the forecasting model are processed in parallel creating
    attention structures that focus on finding different relationships between the
    model inputs (Self-Attention encoder), between model outputs (Self-Attention Decoder)
    and between input–output model (Encoder-Decoder Attention). These multi-attention
    mechanisms in TNNs-based forecasting models and their parallel processing make
    them highly accurate in time series forecasting problems, like how humans process
    information. These attention mechanisms created during the training phase are
    used by these forecasting models to make inference, in this work, the forecasting
    of the daily irrigation water demand seven days ahead. Consequently, attention
    mechanisms provide very valuable knowledge to understand the real behaviour of
    any ID (in this case the CZID) in different periods of the irrigation season.
    Thus, the internal analysis of the forecasting model (focused on the multi-head
    attention region) and the discussion on the care mechanisms created and how they
    are activated depending on the period of the irrigation season are essential to
    extract useful information on the real behaviour of the CZID. For this reason,
    Fig. 12, Fig. 13, Fig. 14, Fig. 15 show the representation of the nine attention
    heads that made up the attention mechanisms of the optimal forecasting model during
    inference for the four randomly selected periods of the irrigation season, 2016-03-19,
    2020-07-07, 2021-09-15 and 2022-05-28, respectively. As the four figures show,
    the attention that the forecasting model pays to each input variable (IWD, Tave,
    Rad and ETo from t-1 to t-7) with respect to the 7-days IWD forecasting (from
    t + 1 to t + 7) changes throughout the irrigation season (e.g. the attention at
    the beginning of the irrigation season in March (Fig. 12) is not the same as for
    the month of May (Fig. 15)). Each of the nine attention heads in the IWD forecasting
    model paid attention to different areas of the input–output space. Heads number
    1, 3, 4 and 6 tended to focus their attention on the Rad (almost all the time
    series) variable and some previous days of IWD and ETo. This attention was kept
    for all the inference days, and was constant for the whole time series of the
    daily irrigation water demand. Download : Download high-res image (370KB) Download

    8 and 9 tended to focus their attention on the more distant records of IWD, on
    the Tave and part of the ETo. In these heads, ETo variable had more weight (more
    attention) in all inference days mainly on days with low attention to IWD variable
    (Fig. 12). That is, here again the combination of farmer’s wind chill (with ETo
    variable and Tave) with his or her ‘habit’ in terms of irrigation application
    (IWD records) can be observed as González Perea et al., 2023, González Perea et
    al., 2015 concluded. Heads 2 and 5 are responsible for paying attention to more
    specific areas of the input time series depending on the forecasted day (t + x).
    At the end of the irrigation season (Fig. 14), these two heads focused on the
    t-2 day on IWD, Tave and ETo for inference the term t + 3, t + 4 of irrigation
    water demand while for larger terms such as t + 5, t + 6 and t + 7 the model focused
    on Rad variable and some records of IWD and t-3 and t-6 of ETo. In this period
    of the irrigation season, probably because of fewer water-demanding crops, the
    attention heads are more specific depending on the day to be forecasted (t + x).
    On the contrary, in the period of the maximum irrigation needs in the CZID (Fig.
    13, Fig. 15) all attention heads focused their attention mostly on previous IWD
    records and again large-scale (ID average) wind chill. Here, an overall temporal
    trend prevails over the individual behaviour of each farmer. That is, the effect
    of the ‘habit’ of each farmer is diluted (because of the large number of simultaneous
    farmers applying irrigation water) in a general ID behaviour. In mathematical
    terms, it could be said that the mean predominates over the variance. 4. Conclusions
    The development of new tools that, without restricting the freedom of farmer in
    terms of irrigation scheduling, make it possible to know in advance the ID’s behaviour
    for its subsequent optimization is essential even more under water scarcity and
    energy dependency scenarios. AI and more specifically deep learning with ability
    to develop forecasting models that learn from real information from each ID can
    be powerful tool to know the behaviour of the ID in advance. Thus, in this work,
    a novel methodology to develop a forecasting model to know in advance (7 days
    ahead) the irrigation water demanded by a real ID has been proposed. The developed
    forecasting model was tested in a real ID (CZID). The new developed model based
    on TNNs and optimized by NSGA-II improves the representativeness and accuracy
    of the best previously developed model by 6.1 % and 89.8 %, respectively. The
    right hyperparameters optimization of the IWD forecasting model (carried out by
    the NSGA-II) was key to achieve an adequate generalization of the forecasting
    model. In addition, the analysis of the initial population of the optimization
    process and the Pareto front showed that when input (previous IWD, Tave, Rad and
    ETo) and output (IWD) variables are temporally correlated, the accuracy of the
    forecasting model depended even more on the right choice of the model architecture.
    Thus, with 1.75 million of parameters (only a 16.7 % denser than previous works)
    the developed IWD forecasting model was able to forecast the 99.9 % of the scenarios
    with an average accuracy of 2.10 %. Finally, the number of heads of the developed
    forecasting model was 9. The multi-head attention mechanism provides useful information
    on the actual irrigation behaviour of the ID. The attention that the forecasting
    model pays to each input variable respect to the 7-days IWD forecast changes and
    it is automatically adapted throughout the irrigation season. Thus, this model
    can be very useful for managers since it offers accurate forecasting of daily
    irrigation water demand for 7 days ahead, which plays an essential role for water
    management and energy contracting in irrigation districts considering current
    and expected scenarios of water scarcity and high energy prices. CRediT authorship

  explanation: "The paper focuses on Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms for optimizing\
    \ closed-loop control strategies in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Reinforcement\
    \ Learning (RL) is a powerful mathematical framework that enables an agent (sensor\
    \ node) to learn via interacting with its environment and to model a problem as\
    \ a Markov decision process (MDP). \n\nThe specific RL technique used in the paper\
    \ is Q-learning, which is a value-based RL algorithm that estimates the optimal\
    \ action-value function, denoted as Q(s, a), for each state-action pair (s, a).\
    \ The Q-value represents the expected long-term reward for taking action 'a' in\
    \ state 's' and following the optimal policy thereafter.\n\nIn the provided context,\
    \ the goal of using RL for closed-loop control in WSNs is to optimize the sensor\
    \ nodes' transmission and sensing parameters, such as transmission power, sensing\
    \ range, and sampling rate, in order to achieve specific performance objectives,\
    \ such as maximizing network coverage, minimizing energy consumption, or improving\
    \ localization accuracy.\n\nThe effectiveness of RL for this purpose stems from\
    \ its ability to learn the optimal control strategies directly from the sensor\
    \ network's environment, without requiring explicit knowledge of the network dynamics\
    \ or a priori assumptions about the optimal behavior. By continuously interacting\
    \ with the environment and updating its Q-values, the RL algorithm can adapt to\
    \ changing network conditions and learn the best actions to take in each state\
    \ to achieve the desired objectives.\n\nSpecifically, the RL algorithm in the\
    \ paper utilizes a reward function that captures the desired performance objectives,\
    \ such as coverage area, energy consumption, or localization accuracy. The sensor\
    \ nodes then interact with the environment by taking actions, such as adjusting\
    \ their transmission power or sensing range, and observing the resulting changes\
    \ in the reward function. \n\nBased on these observations, the RL algorithm updates\
    \ the Q-values for each state-action pair, gradually learning the optimal control\
    \ strategies that maximize the expected long-term reward. Over time, the sensor\
    \ nodes converge to a near-optimal control policy that balances the trade-offs\
    \ between different performance objectives, leading to improved network performance."

    Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes Abstract: Wireless
    sensor networks (WSNs) have attracted substantial research interest, especially
    in the context of performing monitoring and surveillance tasks. However, it is
    challenging to strike compelling tradeoffs amongst the various conflicting optimization
    criteria, such as the network''s energy dissipation, packet-loss rate, coverage,
    and lifetime. This paper provides a tutorial and survey of recent research and
    development efforts addressing this issue by using the technique of multi-objective
    optimization (MOO). First, we provide an overview of the main optimization objectives
    used in WSNs. Then, we elaborate on various prevalent approaches conceived for
    MOO, such as the family of mathematical programming-based scalarization methods,
    the family of heuristics/metaheuristics-based optimization algorithms, and a variety
    of other advanced optimization techniques. Furthermore, we summarize a range of
    recent studies of MOO in the context of WSNs, which are intended to provide useful
    guidelines for researchers to understand the referenced literature. Finally, we
    discuss a range of open problems to be tackled by future research. Published in:

    A. Motivation Wireless sensor networks (WSN) consist of a large number of compact,
    low-cost, low-power, multi-functional sensor nodes that communicate wirelessly
    over short distances [1], [2]. In WSNs, the sensor nodes are generally deployed
    randomly in the field of interest, which are extensively used for performing monitoring
    and surveillance tasks [3]–[5]. Depending on the specific application scenarios,
    WSNs may rely on diverse performance metrics to be optimized. For example, the
    energy efficiency and network lifetime are among the major concerns in WSNs, since
    the sensor nodes are typically powered by battery, whose replacement is often
    difficult. Furthermore, the network coverage, latency and the fairness among sensor
    nodes are important for maintaining the quality-of-service quality-of-service
    (QoS) [6], [7]. In practice, these metrics often conflict with each other, hence
    the careful balancing of the trade-offs among them is vital in terms of optimizing
    the overall performance of WSNs in real applications. In conventional WSN designs,
    typically the most salient performance metric is chosen as the optimization objective,
    while the remaining performance metrics are normally treated as the constraints
    of the optimization problem. Such single-objective optimization approaches, however,
    may be unfair and unreasonable in real WSN applications, since it artificially
    over-emphasizes the importance of one of the metrics to the detriment of the rest
    [8]. Hence, a more realistic optimization is to simultaneously satisfy multiple
    objectives, such as the maximal energy efficiency, the shortest delay, the longest
    network lifetime, the highest reliability, and the most balanced distribution
    of the nodes’ residual energy, or the trade-offs among the above objectives [9],
    [10]. Accordingly, multi-objective optimization multi-objective optimization (MOO)
    can be naturally adopted for solving the above problem, since it may be more consistent
    with the realistic scenarios [11]. MOO algorithms have been a subject of intense
    interest to researchers for solving diverse multi-objective optimization problems
    (MOP), in which multiple objectives are treated simultaneously subject to a set
    of constraints [12]. However, it is infeasible for multiple objectives to achieve
    their respective optima at the same time, thus there may not exist a single globally
    optimal solution, which is the best with respect to all objectives. Nevertheless,
    there exists a set of Pareto-optimal or non-dominated solutions generating a set
    of Pareto-optimal outcomes/objective vectors, which is called Pareto front/frontier
    Pareto front (PF) or Pareto boundary/curve/surface. Explicitly, the PF is generated
    by the specific set of solutions, for which none of the multiple objectives can
    be improved without sacrificing the other objectives [13]. This set of Pareto-optimal
    or non-dominated solutions constitutes the focus of our interest, and it is also
    called the Pareto-efficient set or Pareto set Pareto set (PS) that is mapped to
    the PF in the objective function space [14]. Diverse approaches, such as mathematical
    programming based scalarization methods and nature-inspired metaheuristics, may
    be used for finding the PSs of MOPs. Scalarizing an MOP means formulating a single-objective
    optimization problem such that optimal solutions to the single-objective optimization
    problem are Pareto-optimal solutions to the MOP [15]. In addition, it is often
    required that every Pareto-optimal solution can be reached with the aid of specific
    parameters of the scalarization. Representatives of scalarization methods include
    the linear weighted-sum method, the ε -constraints method [15] and goal programming
    goal programming (GP) based methods. MOPs are more often solved by bio-inspired
    metaheuristics, such as multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) [16],
    [17] and swarm intelligence based optimization algorithms (SIOAs) [18]. MOEAs
    aim for finding a set of representative Pareto-optimal solutions in a single run
    [14], [19], [20]. As a subset of MOEAs, the multi-objective genetic algorithms
    (MOGAs), such as the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm strength Pareto evolutionary
    algorithm (SPEA) [16] and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II non-dominated
    sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) [21], have been particularly widely researched
    in the family of MOO algorithms [22], because they are capable of efficiently
    constructing an approximate PF. This is mainly due to the fact that MOGAs accommodate
    a diverse variety of bio-inspired operators to iteratively generate a population
    of feasible solutions. Compared to genetic algorithms (GAs) that rely on the interplay
    between genetics and biological evolution, SIOAs seek to understand the collective
    behavior of animals, particularly insects, and to use this understanding for solving
    complex, nonlinear problems. One of the most widely used SIOAs is the ant colony
    optimization ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm [23], which has indeed been
    invoked for solving the MOPs in WSNs [24]. Several other bio-inspired algorithms
    related to swarm intelligence will be surveyed in Section IV. B. Contributions
    of This Survey In this paper, we focus our attention on various basic concepts,
    conflicting performance criteria/optimization objectives, as well as the MOO techniques
    conceived for striking a trade-off in the context of WSNs. The contributions of
    our work are four-fold, which are listed as follows: We provide in-depth discussions
    on the basics, metrics and relevant algorithms conceived for MOO in WSNs. We present
    a comprehensive coverage and clear classification of various prevalent MOO algorithms
    conceived for solving MOPs, and clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each MOO
    algorithm in the context of WSNs. We provide an exhaustive review of the up-to-date
    research progress of MOO in WSNs according to different trade-off metrics. We
    highlight a variety of open research challenges and identify possible future trends
    for MOO in WSNs, according to the latest developments of WSNs. C. Paper Organization

    Related Surveys and Tutorials A range of surveys have been dedicated to diverse
    single-objective research domains in WSNs, such as their energy efficiency [25],
    routing [26], congestion control [27], their MAC protocols [28], data collection
    [6], privacy and security [29], localization [30], [31], cross-layer QoS guarantees
    [32], sink mobility management [33], and network virtualization [34]. In recent
    years, several surveys and tutorials advocated MOO methods for optimizing the
    conflicting performance objectives of WSNs. Specifically, Wang et al. [35] provided
    a review of recent studies on multi-objective scheduling and discussed its future
    research trends. In [36], the MOO criteria and strategies conceived for node deployment
    in WSNs were surveyed. Performance trade-off mechanisms of the routing protocols
    designed for energy-efficient WSNs were reviewed in [37], where various artificial
    intelligence techniques and the related technical features of the routing protocols
    were discussed. Coello [38] surveyed the most representative MOEAs and their major
    applications from a historical perspective. Konak et al. [39] presented a comprehensive
    survey and tutorial of MOGAs. Furthermore, Adnan et al. [40] provided a holistic
    overview of bio-inspired optimization techniques, such as particle swarm optimization
    particle swarm optimization (PSO), ACO and GA. In particular, Kulkarni and Venayagamoorthy
    [41] presented a brief survey of how to apply PSO in WSN applications, while bearing
    in mind the peculiar characteristics of sensor nodes. They also presented a state-of-the-art
    survey of computational intelligence in the context of WSNs and highlighted numerous
    challenges facing each of the MOPs discussed [42]. Additionally, Jabbar et al.
    [43] reviewed the optimization in biological systems and discussed bio-inspired
    optimization of non-biological systems. In contrast to other surveys, Deif and
    Gadallah [44] provided a classification of algorithms proposed in the literature
    for planned deployment of WSNs. They discussed and compared diverse WSN deployment
    algorithms in terms of their assumptions, objectives and performance. Additionally,
    in a more recent study Iqbal et al. [45], [46] reviewed the MOO techniques and
    simulation tools conceived for solving different problems related to the design,
    operation, deployment, placement, planning and management of WSNs. The above-mentioned
    surveys related to MOO in WSNs are outlined at a glance in Table I, which allows
    the readers to capture the main contributions of each of the existing surveys.
    TABLE I Existing Surveys Relating to MOO in WSNs SECTION III. Fundamentals of
    WSNs A. System Model WSNs generally consist of hundreds or potentially even thousands
    of spatially distributed, low-cost, low-power, multi-functional, autonomous sensor
    nodes and communicate over short distances [1]. Each node is usually equipped
    with a sensor unit, a processor, a radio transceiver, an A/D converter, a memory
    unit, and a power supply (battery). The typical architecture of a WSN node is
    illustrated in Fig. 2. A WSN node may also have additional application-dependent
    components attached, such as the location finding system and mobilizer. By combining
    these different components into a miniaturized device, these sensor nodes become
    multi-functional. In other words, the structure and characteristics of sensor
    nodes depend both on their electronic, mechanical and communication limitations,
    as well as on their application-specific requirements. One of the great challenges
    facing WSNs is to use such resource-constrained sensor nodes to meet certain application
    requirements, including sensing coverage, network lifetime and end-to-end delay.
    Fig. 2. Typical architecture of a WSN node. Show All Typically, sensor nodes are
    grouped into clusters, and each cluster has a node that acts as the cluster head,
    which has more resources and computational power than the other cluster nodes.
    All nodes gather and deliver their sensed information to the cluster head, which
    in turn forwards it to a specialized node, namely the sink node or base station,
    via a hop-by-hop wireless communication link. In indoor scenarios, a WSN is typically
    rather small and consists of a single cluster supported by a single base station.
    Multiple clusters relying on multiple base stations are possible in a large-scale
    deployment of WSNs. Fig. 3 shows the relationship between WSNs and the infrastructure-based
    networks. Typically, a sink node or base station is responsible for gathering
    the uplink information gleaned from sensor nodes through either single-hop or
    multi-hop communications. Then, the sink node sends the collected information
    to the interested users via a gateway, often using the internet or any other communication
    path [47]. It should be noted that with the development of machine-to-machine
    communications, it is possible to have sensors and machines directly connected
    to cellular network based mobile Internet. Fig. 3. Wireless sensor networks and
    their relationship to infrastructure-based networks. Show All At the time of writing,
    the most common way of constructing WSNs relies on the ZigBee communications protocol,
    which complies with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, outlining the specifications of
    both the physical layer physical layer (PHY) and the medium access control medium
    access control (MAC) layer. This is widely regarded as the de facto standard for
    WSNs [48]. A WSN operates in the unlicensed industrial, scientific, and medical
    industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band, in which it coexists with many
    other successful communication systems, such as the IEEE 802.11 standard based
    wireless local area network wireless local area network (WLAN) and the 802.15.1
    standard based Bluetooth communication systems. Therefore, a WSN may face the
    challenge of co-channel interferences imposed by both other WSNs and other co-existing
    heterogeneous wireless systems. This coexistence problem may substantially affect
    the performance of WSNs. B. Applications In WSNs, sensor nodes are generally deployed
    randomly in the majority of application domains. When the sensor nodes are deployed
    in hostile remote environments, they may be equipped with high-efficiency energy
    harvesting devices (e.g., solar cells) for extending the network lifetime [49].
    Numerous practical applications of WSNs have been rolled out with the advancement
    of technologies. In general, the applications of WSNs can be classified into two
    types: monitoring and tracking. Monitoring is used for analyzing, supervising
    and carefully controlling operation of a system in real-time. Tracking is generally
    used for following the change of an event, a person, an animal, and so on. Existing
    monitoring applications include indoor/outdoor environmental monitoring [50],
    industrial monitoring [51], precision agriculture (e.g., irrigation management
    and crop disease prediction) [52], biomedical or health monitoring [53], electrical
    network monitoring [54], military location monitoring [55], and so forth. Tracking
    applications include habitat tracking [56], traffic tracking [57], military target
    tracking [58], etc. We summarize their classification in Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Taxonomy
    of WSN applications. Show All A more detailed portrayal of WSN applications is
    given in Fig. 5. For instance, in environmental monitoring, WSNs can help us perform
    forest fire detection, flood detection, forecast of earthquakes and eruptions,
    pollution monitoring, etc. [50], [59]. In industry and agriculture, WSNs can sense
    and detect farming and wildlife, monitor equipment and goods, protect commercial
    property, predict crop disease and production quality, control pests and diseases,
    etc. [51], [52]. In healthcare and biomedical applications, WSNs can be utilized
    for diagnostics, distance-monitoring of patients and their physiological data,
    as well as for tracking the medicine particles inside patients’ body, etc. [53].
    In particular, WSN based wireless body area networks (WBAN) can help monitor human
    body functions and characteristics (e.g., artificial retina, vital signs, automatic
    drug delivery, etc.), acting as an in vitro or in vivo diagnostic system [60].
    In the infrastructure, WSNs have been widely used for monitoring the railway systems
    and their components, such as bridges, rail tracks, track beds, track equipment,
    as well as chassis, wheels, and wagons that are closely related to rolling stock
    quality [61]. WSNs also allow users to manage various appliances both locally
    and remotely for building automation applications [62]. In military target tracking
    and surveillance, a WSN can assist in intrusion detection and identification.
    Specific examples include enemy troop and tank movements, battle damage assessment,
    detection and reconnaissance of biological, chemical and nuclear attacks, etc.

    represents the Intel digital health group’s “sensing health with intelligence,
    modularity, mobility, and experimental re-usability” [47]. Show All Furthermore,
    several novel WSN application scenarios, such as the Internet of Things [63],
    cyber-physical systems [64] and smart grids [65], among others, have adopted new
    design approaches that support multiple concurrent applications on the same WSN.
    The applications of WSNs are not limited to the areas mentioned in this paper.
    The future prospects of WSN applications are promising in terms of revolutionizing
    our daily lives. C. MOO Metrics In this subsection, a succinct overview of the
    most popular optimization objectives of WSNs is provided. Over the past years,
    a number of research contributions have addressed diverse aspects of WSNs, including
    their protocols [66], routing [67], energy conservation [25], lifetime [68] and
    so forth. The QoS, as perceived by the users or applications, was given insufficient
    attention at the beginning. However, at the time of writing, how to provide the
    desired QoS is becoming an increasingly important topic for researchers. Different
    applications may have their own specific QoS requirements, but some of the more
    commonly used metrics for characterizing QoS are the coverage area and quality,
    the delay, the number of active nodes, the bit-error rate bit-error rate (BER)
    and the overall WSN lifetime. There are many other QoS metrics worth mentioning,
    and a range of factors affecting the QoS in WSNs are portrayed in Fig. 6, which
    was directly inspired by [69] and reflects the application requirements of a WSN.
    It is indeed plausible that the network’s performance can be quantified in terms
    of its energy conservation, lifetime, and QoS-based metrics in specific applications.
    However, multiple metrics usually conflict with each other. For example, when
    more energy is consumed by the nodes, the operating lifetime of the network reduces.
    Similarly, if more active nodes are deployed in a given region, a lower per-node
    power is sufficient for maintaining connectivity, but the overall delay is likely
    to be increased due to the increased number of hops. Hence, an application-specific
    compromise has to be struck between having more short hops imposing a lower power
    dissipation but higher delay and having more longer hops, which reduces the delay
    but may increase the transmit-power dissipation. Fig. 6. The interplay of factors
    affecting the QoS in WSNs. Show All 1) Coverage: “Coverage” is one of the most
    important performance metrics for a sensor network. In other wireless communication
    networks, coverage typically means the radio coverage. By contrast, coverage in
    the context of WSNs corresponds to the sensing range, while connectivity corresponds
    to the communication range. WSN coverage can be classified into three types: area
    coverage, point coverage and barrier coverage [44]. In area coverage, the coverage
    quality of an entire two-dimensional two-dimensional (2D) region is considered,
    where each point in the region is observed by at least one sensor node. In point
    coverage, the objective is to simply guarantee that a finite set of points in
    the region are observed by at least one sensor node. Barrier coverage usually
    deals with the detection of movement across a barrier of sensor nodes. The most
    richly studied coverage problem in the WSN literature is the area coverage problem.
    The characterization of the coverage varies depending both on the underlying models
    of each node’s field of view and on the metric used for appraising the collective
    coverage. Several coverage models [70]–[72] have been proposed for different application
    scenarios. A coverage model is normally defined with respect to the sensing range
    of a sensor node. The most commonly used node coverage model is the so-called
    sensing disk model, where all points within a disk centered at the node are considered
    to be covered by the node [73]. More specifically, a point p is regarded to be
    covered/monitored by at least a node v if their Euclidean distance is less than
    the sensing range R s of node v . Given a set of nodes, finding the optimal positions
    of these nodes to achieve maximum coverage is in general an NP-complete problem
    [11]. There are many different ways of solving the coverage optimization problem
    suboptimally. Here, in order to make the coverage problem more computationally
    manageable, we consider an area A represented by a rectangular grid, which is
    divided into G=xy rectangular cells of identical size, and let ( x j , y j ) denote
    the coordinate of node j . As a result, the network coverage C v (x) is defined
    as the percentage of the adequately covered cells over the total cells of A and
    it is evaluated as follows [11], [74]: C v (x)= ∑ x x ′ =0 ∑ y y ′ =0 g( x ′ ,
    y ′ ) xy , (1) View Source and g( x ′ , y ′ )={ 1, if ∃ j∈{1,…,N}, d ( x j , y
    j ),( x ′ , y ′ ) ≤ R s , 0, otherwise, (2) View Source where N is the number
    of nodes, g( x ′ , y ′ ) is the monitoring status of the cell centered at ( x
    ′ , y ′ ) , R s is the sensing range of a node, and d ( x j , y j ),( x ′ , y
    ′ ) is the distance from the location of node j to the cell centered at ( x ′
    , y ′ ) . Having a better coverage also leads to a higher probability of detecting
    the event monitored [75]. 2) Network Connectivity: Another issue in WSN design
    is the network connectivity that is dependent on the selected communication protocol
    [76]. Two sensor nodes are directly connected if the distance of the two nodes
    is smaller than the communication range R c . Connectivity only requires that
    the location of any active node is within the communication range of one or more
    active nodes, so that all active nodes can form a connected communication network.
    The most common protocol relies on a cluster-based architecture, where all nodes
    in the same cluster can directly communicate with each other via a single hop
    and all nodes in the same cluster can communicate with all nodes in the neighboring
    clusters via the cluster head. In a given cluster only a single node acts as the
    cluster head, which has to be active in terms of collecting all information gleaned
    by the other nodes for the sake of maintaining connectivity. In cluster-based
    WSNs, the connectivity issues tend to hinge on the number of nodes in each cluster
    (because a cluster head can only handle up to a specific number of connected nodes),
    as well as on the coverage issues related to the ability of any location to be
    covered by at least one active sensor node. For an area represented by a rectangular
    grid of size x×y , let R c i and R s i denote the communication range and sensing
    range of the i th sensor node, respectively. To guarantee each sensor node is
    placed within the communication range of at least another sensor node and to prevent
    sensor nodes from becoming too close to each others, the objective function associated
    with the network connectivity can be expressed as [77] f con = ∑ i=1 x×y 1− e
    −( R c i − R s i ) , (3) View Source where R c i − R s i >0 has to be satisfied
    for achieving network connectivity. Maintaining the network’s connectivity is
    essential for ensuring that the messages are indeed propagated to the appropriate
    sink node or base station, and the loss of connectivity is often treated as the
    end of the network’s lifetime. Network connectivity is closely related to the
    coverage and energy efficiency of WSNs. To elaborate a little further, substantial
    energy savings can be achieved by dynamic management of node duty cycles in WSNs
    having high node density. In this method, some nodes can be scheduled to sleep
    (or enter a power-saving mode), while the remaining active nodes provide continuous
    service. As far as this approach is concerned, a fundamental problem is to minimize
    the number of nodes that remain active while still achieving acceptable QoS. In
    particular, maintaining an adequate sensing coverage and network connectivity
    with the active nodes is a critical requirement in WSNs. The relationship between
    coverage and connectivity hinges on the ratio of the communication range to the
    sensing range. A connected network may not be capable of guaranteeing adequate
    coverage regardless of the ranges. By contrast, Wang et al. [78] and Xing et al.
    [79] presented a sufficient condition for guaranteeing network connectivity, which
    states that for a set of nodes that cover a convex region, the network remains
    connected if R c ≥2 R s . There exist tighter relationships between R c and R
    s for achieving network connectivity, provided that adequate sensing coverage
    is guaranteed [80]–[82]. Intuitively, if the communications range of sensor nodes
    is sufficiently large, then maintaining connectivity is not a problem, because
    in this case there always exists a node to communicate with. A more in-depth discussion
    of the relationship between coverage, connectivity and energy efficiency of WSNs
    can be found in [78]–[82]. 3) Network Lifetime: Another important performance
    metric in WSNs is their lifetime. Tremendous research efforts have been invested
    into solving the problem of prolonging network lifetime by energy conservation
    in WSNs. Indeed, the energy source of each node is generally limited, while recharging
    or replacing the battery at the sensors may be impossible. Hence, both the radio
    transceiver unit and the sensor unit of each node have to be energy-efficient,
    and it is vitally important to maximize the attainable network lifetime [83],
    defined as the time interval between the initialization of the network and the
    depletion of the battery of any of the sensor nodes. For the simplicity of exposition,
    typically all sensor nodes are assumed to be of equal importance, which is a reasonable
    assumption, since the “death” of one sensor node may result in the network becoming
    partitioned, or some area requiring monitoring to be uncovered. Thus, the network’s
    lifetime is defined as the time duration from the application’s first activation
    to the time instant when any of the sensor nodes in the cluster fails due to its
    depleted energy source. More explicitly, this objective can be formulated as T
    net =min T j , (4) View Source where j=1,2,…,N . The lifetime of a sensor node
    is generally inversely proportional both to the average rate of its own information
    generated and to the information relayed by this node. Hence, the network’s lifetime
    is also partially determined by the source rates of all the sensor nodes in the
    network. 4) Energy Consumption: Sensor nodes are equipped with limited battery
    power and the total energy consumption of the WSN is a critical consideration.
    Each node consumes some energy during its data acquisition, processing and transmission
    phases. For instance, in a heterogeneous WSN, different sensor nodes might have
    diverse power and data processing capabilities. Hence, the energy consumption
    of a WSN depends both on the Shannon capacity of the channels among the nodes
    and on these nodes’ functionality. The energy consumption of a path P is the sum
    of the energy expended at each node along the path, hence the total energy consumption
    E(P) of a given path is given by [84] E(P)= ∑ i=0 L ( t a i + t p i )× P o i +
    P t i × t m , (5) View Source where t a i and t p i indicate the time durations
    of data acquisition and data processing taking place at node i , respectively.
    L is the number of nodes on the given path. Furthermore, t m is the message transmission
    time, while P o i and P t i denote the operational power and transmission power
    dissipation of node i , respectively. 5) Energy Efficiency: Energy efficiency
    is a key concern in WSNs, and this metric is closely related to network lifetime
    in the particular context of WSNs [90].1 As an example, herein the energy efficiency
    of node i is defined as the ratio of the transmission rate to the power dissipation.
    Explicitly, it is formulated as η i = W log 2 (1+ γ i ) p i , (6) View Source
    where W denotes the communication bandwidth, p i is the transmission power of
    node i and γ i denotes the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio signal-to-interference-plus-noise
    ratio (SINR) at the destination receiver relative to node i , respectively. Due
    to the limited energy resources of each node, we have to utilize these nodes in
    an efficient manner so as to increase the lifetime of the network [91]. There
    are at least two approaches to deal with the energy conservation problem in WSNs.
    The first approach is to plan a schedule of active nodes while enabling the other
    nodes to enter a sleep mode. The second approach is to dynamically adjust the
    sensing range of nodes for the sake of energy conservation. 6) Network Latency:
    For a WSN, typically a fixed bandwidth is available for data transfer between
    nodes. Again, having an increased number of nodes results in more paths becoming
    available for simultaneously routing packets to their destinations, which is beneficial
    for reducing the latency. Meanwhile, this may also degrade the latency that increases
    proportionally to the number of nodes on the invoked paths. This is due to additional
    contention for the wireless channel when the node density increases, as well as
    owing to routing and buffering delays. The delay between source node u so and
    sink node u si , denoted as D u so , u si , is defined as the time elapsed between
    the departure of a collected data packet from u so and its arrival to u si , and
    is given by [92], [93] D u so , u si = = ∝ ( T q + T p + T d )×N( u so , u si
    ) c×N( u so , u si ) N( u so , u si ), (7) View Source where T q is the queue
    delay per intermediate forwarder, T p is the propagation delay and T d is the
    transmission delay. All of them are, for the sake of simplicity, regarded as constants
    and collectively denoted by c . Finally, N( u so , u si ) denotes the total number
    of data disseminators between u so and u si . As a consequence, the minimization
    of the delay corresponds to minimizing the number of intermediate forwarders between
    the source and the sink. It is worth noting that Haenggi and Puccinelli [94] astutely
    argued that long-hop based routing is a very competitive strategy compared to
    short-hop aided routing in terms of latency, albeit this design dilemma also has
    ramifications as to the scarce energy resource of the nodes. 7) Differentiated
    Detection Levels: Differentiated sensor network deployment is also an important
    issue. In many real WSN applications, such as underwater sensor deployments or
    surveillance applications, certain parts of the supervised region may require
    extremely high detection probabilities if these parts constitute safety-critical
    geographic area. However, in the less sensitive geographic area, relatively low
    detection probabilities have to be maintained for reducing the number of nodes
    deployed, which corresponds to reducing the cost imposed. Therefore, different
    geographic areas require different densities of deployed nodes, and the sensing
    requirements are not necessarily uniformly distributed within the entire supervised
    region. Let us use d((m,n),(i,j)) to denote the Euclidean distance between the
    coordinates (m,n) and (i,j) . A probabilistic node detection model can be formulated
    as [95]–[97] p((m,n),(i,j))={ e −ad((m,n),(i,j)) , 0, d((m,n),(i,j))≤ R s , d((m,n),(i,j))>
    R s , (8) View Source where a is a parameter associated with the physical characteristics
    of the sensing device and R s is the sensing range. 8) Number of Nodes: Each sensor
    node imposes a certain cost, including its production, deployment and maintenance.
    As a result, the total cost of the WSN increases with the number of sensor nodes.
    When deploying a WSN in a battleground, sensor nodes have to operate as stealthily
    as possible to avoid being detected by the enemy. This implies that the number
    of nodes has to be kept at a minimum in order to reduce the probability of any
    of them being discovered. [98]–[103] are dedicated to optimal node deployment
    by considering the accomplishment of the specified goals at a minimum cost. Minimizing
    the number of active nodes is equivalent to maximizing the following objective
    [104]: f( K ′ )=1− | K ′ | |K| , (9) View Source where | K ′ | is the number of
    active nodes and |K| is the total number of nodes. 9) Fault Tolerance: Sensor
    nodes may fail, for example, due to the surrounding physical conditions or when
    their energy runs out. It may be difficult to replace the existing nodes, hence
    the network has to be fault tolerant in order to prevent individual failures from
    reducing the network lifetime [36], [105]. In other words, fault tolerance can
    be viewed as an ability to maintain the network’s operation without interruption
    in the case of a node failure, and it is typically implemented in the routing
    and transport protocols. The fault tolerance or reliability R k (t) of a sensor
    node can be modeled using the Poisson distribution in order to capture the probability
    of not having a failure within the time interval (0,t) as [1]: R k (t)= e − λ
    k t , (10) View Source where λ k is the failure rate of sensor node k and t is
    the time period. Numerous studies have been focused on forming k -connected WSNs
    [78], [79], [106]. The k -connectivity implies that there are k independent paths
    in the full set of the pair of nodes. For k≥2 , the network can tolerate some
    node and link failures. Due to the many-to-one interaction pattern, k -connectivity
    is a particularly important design factor in the neighborhood of base stations
    and guarantees maintaining a certain communication capacity among the nodes [106].
    10) Fair Rate Allocation: It is important to guarantee that the sink node receives
    information from all sensor nodes in a fair manner when the bandwidth is limited.
    The accuracy of the received source information depends on the allocated source
    rate. Simply maximizing the total throughput of the network is insufficient for
    guaranteeing the specific application’s performance, since this objective may
    only be achieved at the expense of sacrificing the source rate supposed to be
    allocated to some nodes [107]. For example, in a sensor network that tracks the
    mobility of certain objects in a large field of observation, lower rates impose
    a reduced location tracking accuracy and vice versa. By simply maximizing the
    total throughput instead of additionally considering the above fairness issues
    among sources, we may end up with a solution that shuts off many sources in the
    network and enables only those sources whose transport energy-cost to the sink
    is the lowest. Hence, considering the fairness of rate allocation among different
    sensor nodes is of high significance. An attractive methodology of achieving this
    goal is to adopt a network utility maximization network utility maximization (NUM)
    framework [107], in which a concave, non-decreasing and twice differentiable utility
    function U i ( x i ) quantifies the grade of satisfaction of sensor node i with
    the assigned rate x i , and the goal is to maximize the sum of individual utilities.
    A specific class of utility functions that has been extensively used for achieving
    fair resource allocation in economics and distributed computing [108] is formulated
    as: U α (x)={ logx 1 1−α x 1−α  α=1,  α>1, (11) View Source where x=( x i ,∀i)
    and the functional operations are elementwise. When we have α=1 , the above utility
    function leads to the so-called proportional fairness, whereas when α→∞ , this
    utility function leads to max–min fairness.2 11) Detection Accuracy: Having a
    high target detection accuracy is also an important design goal for the sake of
    achieving accurate inference about the target in WSNs. Target detection accuracy
    is directly related to the timely delivery of the density and latency information
    of the WSN. Assume that a node k receives a certain amount of energy e k (u) from
    a target located at location u and K o is the energy emitted by the target. Then,
    the signal energy e k (u) measured by node k is given by [84] e k (u)= K o /(1+α
    d p k ), (12) View Source where d k is the Euclidean distance between the target
    location and the location of node k , p is the pathloss exponent that typically
    assumes values in the range of [2, 4], while α is an adjustable constant. 12)
    Network Security: Sensor nodes may be deployed in an uncontrollable environment,
    such as a battlefield, where an adversary might aim for launching physical attacks
    in order to capture sensor nodes or to deploy counterfeit ones. As a result, an
    adversary may retrieve private keys used for secure communications by eavesdropping
    and decrypt the communications of the legitimate sensors. Recently, much attention
    has been paid to the security of WSNs. There are two main types of privacy concerns,
    namely data-oriented and context-oriented concerns [29]. Data-oriented concerns
    focus on the privacy of data collected from a WSN, while context-oriented concerns
    concentrate on contextual information, such as the location and timing of traffic
    flows in a WSN. A simple illustration of the two types of security attacks is
    depicted in Fig. 7. Fig. 7. Two types of privacy attacks in a WSN [29]: Data analysis
    attack and traffic analysis attack conducted by a malicious node. Show All We
    can observe from Fig. 7 that a malicious node of the WSN abuses its ability of
    decrypting data in order to compromise the payload being transmitted in the case
    of data analysis attack. In traffic-analysis attacks, the adversary does not have
    the ability to decrypt data payloads. Instead, it eavesdrops to intercept the
    transmitted data and tracks the traffic flow on a hop-by-hop basis. For the sake
    of improving the network security, we can minimize the loss of privacy that is
    calculated based on information theory as [110] ζ=1− 2 −I(S,X) , (13) View Source
    where I(S,X) is the mutual information between the random variables S and X .
    More specifically, S represents the current position of the node of interest,
    X is the observed variable known to the attacker and correlated to S , while I(S,X)=H(S)−H(S|X)
    with H(⋅) denoting the entropy. Additionally, we can also minimize the probability
    of eavesdropping in a WSN, as presented in [111], to improve the network security.
    Table II summarizes the representative existing contributions to optimizing the
    particular WSN performance metrics mentioned above. TABLE II Major Existing Approaches
    for Evaluating/Improving/Optimizing Each Metric SECTION IV. Techniques of MOO
    In this section, we briefly present the MOO techniques proposed in the literature
    for tackling various important problems in WSNs. A. Optimization Strategies Optimization
    covers almost all aspects of human life and work. In practice, the resources are
    limited, hence optimization is important. Most research activities in computer
    science and engineering involve a certain amount of modeling, data analysis, computer
    simulations and mathematical optimization. This branch of applied science aims
    for finding the particular values of associated variables, which results in either
    the minimum or the maximum values of a single objective function or multiple objective
    functions [40]. A typical optimization process is composed of three components
    [43]: the model, the optimizer/algorithm and the evaluator/simulator, as shown
    in Fig. 8. The representation of the physical problem is carried out by using
    mathematical formulations to establish a mathematical model. Fig. 8. A simple
    illustration of optimization process. Show All As an important step of solving
    any optimization problem, an efficient optimizer or algorithm has to be designed
    for ensuring that the optimal solution is obtained. There is no single algorithm
    that is suitable for all problems. Optimization algorithms can be classified in
    many ways, depending on the specific characteristics that we set out to compare.
    In general, optimization algorithms can be classified as: Finitely terminating
    algorithms, such as the family of simplex algorithms and their extensions, as
    well as the family of combinatorial algorithms; Convergent iterative methods that
    evaluate Hessians (or approximate Hessians, using finite differences), such as
    Newton’s method and sequential quadratic programming; evaluate gradients or approximate
    gradients using finite differences (or even subgradients), such as quasi-Newton
    methods, conjugate gradient methods, interior point methods, gradient descent
    (alternatively, “steepest descent” or “steepest ascent”) methods, subgradient
    methods, bundle method of descent, ellipsoid method, reduced gradient method,
    and simultaneous perturbation based stochastic approximation methods; and evaluate
    only function values, such as interpolation methods and pattern search methods.
    Heuristics/metaheuristics that can provide approximate solutions to some optimization
    problems. Recently, bio-mimetic heuristics/metaheuristics based strategies have
    been widely used for solving MOPs, since they are capable of obtaining near-optimal
    solutions to optimization problems characterized by non-differential nonlinear
    objective functions, which are particularly hard to deal with using classical
    gradient- or Hessian-based algorithms. A general MOP consists of a number of objectives
    to be simultaneously optimized and it is associated with a number of inequality
    and equality constraints. Without loss of generality, a multi-objective minimization
    problem having n variables and m ( m>1 ) objectives can be formulated as min f(x)=
    s.t.  g i (x)≤ h j (x)= min[ f 1 (x), f 2 (x),…, f m (x)] 0, i=1,2,…, m ie , 0,
    j=1,2,…, m eq , (14) View Source where we have x∈ R n with R n being the decision
    space, and f(x)∈ R m with R m representing the objective space. The objective
    functions of (14) are typically in conflict with each other in the real world.
    Explicitly, the improvement of one of the objectives may result in the degradation
    of other objectives, thus it is important to achieve the Pareto-optimality, which
    represents the conditions when none of the objective functions can be reduced
    without increasing at least one of the other objective functions [13]. For the
    minimization of m objectives f 1 (x), f 2 (x),…, f m (x) , we have the following
    definitions. Non-dominated solutions: A solution a is said to dominate a solution
    b if and only if [170]: f i (a)≤ f i (b)  ∀i∈{1,2,…,m} , f i (a)< f i (b)  ∃i∈{1,2,…,m}
    . Solutions that dominate the others but do not dominate themselves are termed
    non-dominated solutions. Local optimality in the Pareto sense: A solution a is
    said to be locally optimal in the Pareto sense, if there exists a real ϵ>0 such
    that there is no other solution b dominating the solution a with b∈ R n ∩B(a,ϵ)
    , where B(a,ϵ) shows a bowl having a center a and a radius ϵ . Global optimality
    in the Pareto sense: A solution a is globally optimal in the Pareto sense, if
    there does not exist any vector b that dominates the vector a . The main difference
    between global and local optimality lies in the fact that for global optimality
    we no longer have a restriction imposed on the decision space R n . Pareto-optimality:
    A feasible solution is said to be Pareto-optimal, when it is not dominated by
    any other solutions in the feasible space. PS, which is also often referred to
    as the efficient set, is the collection of all Pareto-optimal solutions and their
    corresponding images in the objective space are termed the PF. The PF of an MOP
    is portrayed both with and without constrains in Fig. 9. Observe from Fig. 9 (a)
    that the Pareto-optimal solutions of the objective functions in the PF (marked
    as asterisk) provide better values than any other solution in R m . The ideal
    solution marked by a square indicates the joint minimum of the objective values
    f 1 and f 2 and it is often difficult to reach. The remaining solutions marked
    as solid circles are all dominated by at least one solution of the PF. In contrast
    to the unconstrained scenario of Fig. 9 (a), in Fig. 9 (b), the curve illustrates
    the PF of a constrained MOP. The solid circles in the feasible region represent
    the feasible solutions, while the remaining points outside the feasible region
    (e.g., the points marked by triangles) are infeasible [171]. Fig. 9. The PF of
    MOP with and without constrains, m=2 . Show All B. MOO Algorithms Numerous studies
    have been devoted to the subject of MOO and a variety of algorithms have been
    developed for solving MOPs in WSNs. In fact, optimization algorithms are more
    diverse than the types of objective functions, but the right choice of the objective
    function has a much more grave impact than the specific choice of the optimization
    algorithm. Nevertheless, the careful choice of the optimization algorithm is also
    vital, especially when complex MOPs are considered. Solving an MOP means finding
    the PS of the MOP. As mentioned in Section I, there are various classes of methods
    designed for generating the PSs of MOPs, such as mathematical programming based
    scalarization methods, nature-inspired metaheuristics, and so forth. It should
    be noted that scalarizing an MOP means formulating a single-objective optimization
    problem whose optimal solutions are also Pareto-optimal solutions to the MOP [15].
    Additionally, it is often required that every Pareto-optimal solution can be reached
    with the aid of specific parameters of the scalarization. 1) Mathematical Programming
    Based Scalarization Methods: Mathematical programming based classic scalarization
    methods conceived for MOO include the linear weighted-sum method, the ϵ -constraints
    method [15], and the goal programming (GP) based methods [9], [172]–[177], as
    detailed below. a) Linear weighted-sum method: The linear weighted-sum method
    scalarizes multiple performance metrics into a single-objective function by pre-multiplying
    each performance metric (i.e., component objective) with a weight. Since different
    performance metrics have different properties and each metric may have a different
    unit, the normalization must be implemented firstly when using the linear weighted-sum
    method for striking compelling performance trade-offs. Then, a different weight
    is assigned to each metric to get an evaluation function. Finally, the optimal
    compromise is obtained according to the Pareto-optimal solutions generated by
    solving multiple single-objective problems, each corresponding to a specific vector
    of weight values. It can be proved that the optimal solution to each of these
    single-objective problems is a Pareto-optimal solution to the original multi-objective
    problem, i.e., the image of these solutions belong to the PF. The linear weighted-sum
    method is easy to implement and can avoid complex computations, provided that
    the weights are appropriately chosen, since only a single optimal value has to
    be calculated for each single-objective problem. It is worth pointing out that
    all the weights are in the range [0, 1], and the sum of them is 1. However, there
    is no a priori correspondence between a weight vector and a solution vector, and
    the linear weighted-sum method usually uses subjective weights, which often results
    in poor objectivity and makes the objectives to be optimized sensitive to the
    weights. The need to solve multiple single-objective optimization problems with
    the aid of different sets of weight values also implies that a substantial overall
    computational complexity may be imposed. Furthermore, the lack of a reasonable
    weight allocation method degrades its scientific acceptance. To elaborate a little
    further, typically the decision maker is a priori unaware of which weights are
    the most appropriate ones to generate a satisfactory solution, hence he/she does
    not know in general how to adjust the weights to consistently change the solution.
    This also means that it is not easy to develop heuristic algorithms that, starting
    from certain weights, are capable of iteratively generating weight vectors to
    reach a certain portion of the PF. In addition, the linear weighted-sum method
    is incapable of reaching the non-convex parts of the PF. Finally, a uniform spread
    of the weight values, in general, does not produce a uniform spread of points
    on the PF. This fact implies that usually all the points are grouped in certain
    parts of the PF, while some (potentially significant) portions of the PF based
    trade-off curve have not been reached. Note that if the decision maker has a priori
    preference among the multiple objectives considered, or he/she would like to select
    the most satisfactory solution from the Pareto-optimal solutions obtained, a powerful
    multiple criteria decision-making method referred to as the analytical hierarchy
    process analytical hierarchy process (AHP) [178]–[182] can be used to determine
    the relative weights. Using AHP, the weights can be flexibly altered according
    to the specific application requirements. AHP has been widely used in the context
    of trade-off mechanisms (e.g., [183] and [184]), where AHP first decomposes a
    complex problem into a hierarchy of simple subproblems, then synthesizes their
    importance to the original problem, and finally chooses the best solution. b)
    ε -constraints method: The ε -constraints method creates a single-objective function,
    where only one of the original objective functions is optimized while dealing
    with the remaining objective functions as constraints. This method can be expressed
    as [185]: min  f i (x) s.t.  f j ≤ ε j , j≠i, H(x)=0, G(x)≤0, (15) View Source
    where f i (x), i=(1,2,…,N) is the selected function for optimization and the remaining
    N−1 functions act as constraints. It was proved by Miettinen [186] that if an
    objective f j and a vector ε=( ε 1 ,…, ε j−1 , ε j+1 ,…, ε N )∈ R N−1 exist, such
    that x ∗ is an optimal solution to the above problem, then x ∗ is a weak Pareto
    optimum of the original MOP. Therefore, this method is capable of obtaining weak
    Pareto-optimal points by varying the ε vector, but it is not guaranteed to obtain
    all of them. Under certain stronger conditions, it can even obtain the strict
    Pareto optimum [186]. This method is very intuitive and the parameters ε j used
    as upper bounds are easy to interpret. Another advantage of this method is that
    it is capable of finding Pareto-optimal solutions on a non-convex PF. Similar
    to the linear weighted-sum method, having to empirically vary the upper bound
    ε j also implies a drawback of the ε -constraints method, and it is not particularly
    efficient if the number of objective functions is higher than two. c) Goal programming
    (GP): Instead of maximizing multiple objectives, GP is an analytical approach
    devised for solving MOPs, where the goal values (or targets) have been assigned
    to all the objective measures and where the decision-maker is interested in minimizing
    the “non-achievement” of the corresponding goals. In other words, the underlying
    assumption of GP is that the decision-maker seeks a satisfactory and sufficient
    solution with the aid of this strategy. GP can be regarded as an extension or
    generalization of linear programming to handle multiple conflicting objective
    measures. Each of these measures is given a goal or target value to be achieved.
    The sum of undesirable deviations from this set of user-specified target values
    is then minimized with the aid of a so-called achievement function. There are
    various forms of achievement functions, which largely determine the specific GP
    variant. The three oldest and still widely used forms of achievement functions
    include the weighted-sum (Archimedean), preemptive (lexicographic) and MINMAX
    (Chebyshev) [9], [172]–[177]. There exist other scalarization methods devised
    for MOO, such as the conic scalarization method of [176] and [187]. 2) Nature-Inspired
    Metaheuristic Algorithms: MOPs are more often solved by nature-inspired metaheuristics,
    such as multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) [16], [17] and swarm intelligence
    based optimization algorithms (SIOAs) [18]. This is because most classical optimization
    methods are based on a limited number of standard forms, which means that they
    have to comply with the particular structures of objective functions and constraints.
    However, in realistic scenarios it is often impossible to accurately characterize
    the physical problem with an ideal standard-form optimization problem model. Additionally,
    many complicated factors, such as a large number of integer variables, non-linearities,
    and so forth may occur. Both of them can make the realistic problems hard to solve.
    Therefore, the classical mathematical programming based optimization methods may
    not be suitable for solving the MOPs encountered in real-world WSNs. Over the
    most recent decade, metaheuristics have made substantial progress in approximate
    search methods for solving complex optimization problems [188]. A metaheuristic
    technique guides a subordinate heuristic using concepts typically derived from
    the biological, chemical, physical and even social sciences, as well as from artificial
    intelligence, to improve the optimization performance. Compared to mathematical
    programming based methods, metaheuristics based optimization algorithms are relatively
    insensitive to the specific mathematical form of the optimization problems. However,
    the higher the degree of accuracy required, the higher the computational cost
    becomes. So far, the field of metaheuristics based optimization algorithms has
    been mostly constituted by the family of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) [17] and
    the family of SIOAs [44]. In the following, we will review some of their salient
    representatives. a) Evolutionary algorithms (EAs): EAs belong to the family of
    stochastic search algorithms inspired by the natural selection and survival of
    the fittest in the biological world. The goal of EAs is to search for the globally
    near-optimal solutions by repeatedly evaluating the objective functions or fitness
    functions using exploration and exploitation methods. Compared with mathematical
    programming, EAs are eminently suitable for solving MOPs, because they simultaneously
    deal with a set of solutions and find a number of Pareto-optimal solutions in
    a single run of the algorithm. Additionally, they are less susceptible to the
    specific shape or to the continuity of the PF, and they are also capable of approximating
    the discontinuous or non-convex PF [189]. The most efficient PF-based MOEAs have
    been demonstrated to be powerful and robust in terms of solving MOPs [17]. Genetic
    Algorithms (GAs): GAs constitute the most popular branch of EAs [190]. GAs are
    based on genetics and evolutionary theory, and they have been successfully used
    for solving diverse optimization problems, including MOPs. They have appealing
    advantages over traditional mathematical programming based algorithms [44] in
    terms of handling complex problems and convenience for parallel implementation.
    GA can deal with all sorts of objective functions no matter they are stationary
    or transient, linear or nonlinear, continuous or discontinuous. These advantageous
    properties of GAs have inspired their employment in solving MOPs of WSNs. GAs
    rely on the bio-inspired processes of initialization, evaluation, selection, crossover,
    mutation, and replacement, as portrayed in its simplest form in the flow-chart
    of Fig. 10. The MOGA [191] has attracted particularly extensive research attention
    among all the algorithms of MOO. By operating on the generation-by-generation
    basis, a number of Pareto-optimal solutions can be found throughout the evolution
    generations. Thus, obtaining the Pareto-optimal solution set provides us with
    a set of flexible trade-offs. Several solution methods based on MOGAs were presented
    in [112] and [192] for optimizing the layout of a WSN. More specifically, Jourdan
    and De Weck [112] advocated a MOGA for the optimal deployment of static sensor
    nodes in a region of interest, which simultaneously maximized the coverage area
    and the network’s lifetime. The authors then extended their work to three specific
    surveillance scenarios in [192] using the same MOGA. Recently, the non-dominated
    sorting genetic algorithm non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) [193],
    the niched Pareto genetic algorithm niched Pareto genetic algorithm (NPGA) [194]
    and the SPEA [16] have been recommended as the most efficient MOEAs. Differential
    Evolution differential evolution (DE): DE was developed by Storn and Price [195].
    It is arguably one of the most powerful real-valued optimization algorithms. DE
    relies on similar computational steps as employed by a standard EA. It commences
    its operation from randomly initiated parameter vectors, each of which (also called
    genome or chromosome) forms a candidate solution to the optimization problem.
    Then, a mutant vector (known as donor vector) is obtained by the differential
    mutation operation. To enhance the potential diversity of the candidate solutions,
    a crossover operation comes into play after generating the donor vector through
    mutation. The final step of the algorithm calls for selection in order to determine
    whether the target vector survives to the next generation [196]. The main stages
    of the DE algorithm are illustrated in Fig. 11. However, unlike traditional EAs,
    the DE algorithm is much simpler to implement, with only a few parameters to be
    set. Therefore, DE has drawn much attention and has been successfully applied
    in numerous domains of science and engineering (see [197], [198]). Artificial
    Immune System (AIS): AIS is a computational intelligence paradigm inspired by
    the biological immune system. It has been applied to a variety of optimization
    problems and has shown several attractive properties that allow EAs to avoid premature
    convergence and to enhance local search [199]. AIS is capable of recognizing and
    combating pathogens. Molecular patterns expressed on those pathogens are referred
    to as antigens. An antigen is any molecule that can be recognized by the immune
    system and is capable of provoking the immune response. This immune response is
    specific to each antigen. The cells called lymphocytes have a vital role in the
    immune system. There are two types of lymphocytes: B cells and T cells. When an
    antigen is detected, B cells that best recognize the antigen, will proliferate
    by cloning. Some of these new cloned cells will differentiate into plasma cells,
    which are the most active antibody secretors. These cloning and mutation processes
    are termed the clonal selection principle [200], which is one of the inspiring
    methodologies employed in AIS for solving optimization problems. Based on the
    clonal selection principle, an algorithm is developed, where various immune system
    aspects are taken into account, such as the maintenance of the memory cells, selection
    and cloning of the most stimulated cells, death of non-stimulated cells, re-selection
    of the clones with higher affinity, as well as the generation and maintenance
    of diversity. The steps of the AIS are provided in form of pseudocode in Table
    III. Similar to the computational frameworks of EA, AIS can be readily incorporated
    into the evolutionary optimization process and particularly, AIS are often exploited
    in evolutionary techniques devised for MOO to avoid premature convergence. On
    the other hand, the main distinction between the field of AIS and GAs is the nature
    of population development [201]. Specifically, the population of GAs is evolved
    using crossover and mutation operations. However, in the AIS, similar to evolutionary
    strategies where reproduction is a cloning, each child produced by a cell is an
    exact copy of its parent. Both algorithms then use mutation to alter the progeny
    of the cells and introduce further genetic variations. Imperialist Competitive
    Algorithm imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA): Inspired by the socio-political
    evolution process of imperialism and imperialistic competition, ICA was originally
    proposed by Atashpaz-Gargari and Lucas [202]. Similar to other EAs, ICA starts
    with an initial population, with each of them termed a country. The countries
    can be viewed as population individuals and are basically divided into two groups
    based on their power, i.e., imperialists (countries with the least cost function
    value) and colonies. After forming initial empires, the colonies start moving
    toward their relevant imperialist. This movement is a simple manifestation of
    the assimilation policy, which is pursued by some of the imperialists and results
    in improvements of the socio-political characteristics, such as culture, language
    and economical policy, in the colonies. Then, the imperialistic competition starts
    among all the empires. The imperialistic competition will gradually result in
    an increase of the power of stronger empires and a decrease in the power of weaker
    ones. In this process, weak empires will lose their colonies and eventually collapse.
    In the long run, ICA converges to a state where only a single powerful empire
    exists in the world and all the other countries are colonies of that empire.3
    In this state, the best solution of the optimization problem is given when all
    colonies and the corresponding imperialist have the same cost. TABLE III Pseudocode
    of Artificial Immune System Fig. 10. Simplified flow-chart of a GA. Show All Fig.
    11. Simplified illustration of a DE algorithm. Show All ICA has been successfully
    applied in numerous single-objective optimization problems [203], [204], where
    most results indicate that it is superior to the GA in terms of both its accuracy
    and convergence rate. The basic structure of the multi-objective imperialist competitive
    algorithm multi-objective imperialist competitive algorithm (MOICA) is the same
    as that of the ICA. However, new methods are developed to determine the imperialist
    countries, to define the power of the imperialist countries, and to calculate
    the total power of empires for imperialistic competition. Selecting imperialists
    (best countries) from a set of Pareto-optimal solutions impacts both the coverage
    and the diversity of solutions. This impact is more significant when the optimization
    problem has a high number of objectives. A novel MOICA was proposed in [157] for
    handling node deployment, where both the fast non-dominated sorting and the Sigma
    method were employed for selecting the best countries as imperialists. b) Swarm
    intelligence optimization algorithms (SIOAs): Swarm intelligence constitutes a
    branch of artificial intelligence artificial intelligence (AI), and it exploits
    the collective behavior of self-organized, decentralized systems that rely on
    a social structure, such as bird flocks, ant colonies and fish schools. These
    systems consist of low-intelligence interacting agents organized in small societies
    (also referred to as swarms), exhibiting traits of intelligence, such as the ability
    of reacting to environmental threats and the decision making capacities. Swarm
    intelligence has been utilized in the global optimization framework of controlling
    robotic swarms in [44]. Three main SIOAs have been developed, namely, ACO [24],
    PSO [205] and artificial bee colony artificial bee colony (ABC) [206]. Ant Colony
    Optimization (ACO): ACO was inspired by the foraging behavior of some ant species.
    These ants deposit pheromones on the ground in order to mark their nest-to-food
    paths that should be followed by other members of the colony. Additionally, they
    also deposit a different type of pheromone to mark dangerous paths for the others
    to avoid any threat. The ACO algorithm is capable of solving discrete/combinatorial
    optimization problems in various engineering domains. It was initially proposed
    by Dorigo et al. [23], [207] and has since been widely researched and diversified
    to solve a class of numerical problems. To illuminate the basic principle of ACO,
    let us consider the paths A and B of Fig. 12 between a nest and a food source
    as an example [40]. Furthermore, let us denote by n A(t) and n B (t) the number
    of ants along the paths A and B at the time step t , respectively, and by P A
    and P B the probability of choosing path A and path B , respectively. Then, the
    probability of an ant choosing path A at the time step t+1 is given by P A (t+1)=
    [c+ n A (t)] α [c+ n A (t)] α + [c+ n B (t)] α =1− P B (t+1), (16) View Source
    where c is the degree of attraction of a hitherto unexplored branch and α ( α≥0
    ) is the bias towards using pheromone deposits in the decision process. An ant
    chooses between the path A or path B using the following decision rule: if U(0,1)≤
    P A (t+1) then choose path A , otherwise choose path B . Here, U is a random number
    having a uniform distribution in the range of [0, 1]. ACO performs well in the
    dynamic and distributed routing problems of WSNs. Particle Swarm Optimization
    (PSO): Similar to the underlying philosophy of other swarm intelligence approaches,
    PSO aims for mimicking the social behavior of a flock of birds. It consists of
    a swarm of s candidate solutions, termed particles, which explore an n -dimensional
    hyperspace in search of the global solution. In PSO, the particles regulate their
    flying directions based both on their own flying experience and on their neighbors’
    flying experience [208]. After several improvements conceived by researchers,
    PSO became an often-used population-based optimizer, which is capable of solving
    stochastic nonlinear optimization problems at an affordable complexity. The position
    of the i th particle is represented as X i,d , while its velocity is represented
    as V i,d . Each particle is evaluated through an objective function f( x 1 , x
    2 ,…, x n ) , where we have f :  R n ⟶R . The cost (fitness) of a particle close
    to the global solution is lower (higher) than that of a particle being farther
    away. The best position of particle i is denoted as P i,d . Then, the particles
    are manipulated according to the following two equations [208]: V i,d (t+1)= X
    i,d (t+1)= w V i,d (t)+ λ 1 r 1 (t)[ P i,d (t)− X i (t)] + λ 2 r 2 (t)[ P d (t)−
    X i (t)], X i,d (t)+ V i,d (t+1), (17) (18) View Source where we have 1≤i≤s and
    1≤d≤n . Additionally, λ 1 and λ 2 are constants, w is the so-called inertia weight,
    while P d is the position of the best particle. Still referring to (17), r 1 (t)
    and r 2 (t) are random numbers uniformly distributed in [0, 1]. In the t th iteration,
    the velocity V and the position X are updated using (17) and (18). The update
    process is iteratively repeated until either an acceptable P d is achieved or
    a fixed number of iterations t max is reached. The general framework of the multi-objective
    PSO is shown in Fig. 13, which includes some key operations, such as the maintenance
    of the archive, global optimum selection, as well as the velocity and position
    update [209]. More explicitly, the particle population relies on an archive for
    storing the Pareto-optimal solutions during the iterative process and for selecting
    the global optimum from these solutions. This is the key point in which the multi-objective
    PSO is different from the traditional single-objective optimization. The employment
    of the PSO as a stochastic global optimization algorithm in the MOP of WSNs is
    relatively new and hence there is a paucity of contributions. A multi-objective
    routing model based on ACO was proposed in [24], which optimizes the network’s
    delay, energy consumption and data packet loss rate. This novel method has been
    shown to be capable of adapting to different service requirements. Rani and Devarajan
    [115] developed a MOO model based on PSO and fuzzy logic fuzzy logic (FL) for
    sensor node deployment, aiming for maximizing the network’s coverage, connectivity
    and lifetime. They have shown that the technique provides efficient and accurate
    decisions for node deployment in conjunction with low estimation errors. Artificial
    Bee Colony (ABC): The ABC algorithm was first introduced by Karaboga and Basturk
    [206], and it was derived from the behavior of honey bees in nature. Since the
    structure of the algorithm is simple, it has been widely used for solving optimization
    problems. In the ABC model, the position of a food source represents a possible
    solution to the optimization problem and the amount of nectar in a food source
    corresponds to the quality (fitness) of the associated solution. The honey bee
    swarm consists of three groups of bees, namely the employed bees, onlookers and
    scouts. Correspondingly, the ABC algorithm has three phases [151], [210]. It is
    assumed that there is only a single artificial employed bee for each food source.
    Therefore, the number of employed bees in the honey bee swarm is equal to the
    number of food sources around the hive. Employed bee phase: At the first step,
    the randomly distributed initial food sources are produced for all employed bees.
    Then, each employed bee flies to a food source in its memory and determines a
    neighbor source, whose nectar amount is then evaluated. If the nectar amount of
    the neighbor source is higher than that of the previous source, the employed bee
    memorizes the new source position and forgets the old one. Otherwise, it keeps
    the position of the one in its memory. In other words, an employed bee updates
    the source position in its memory if it discovers a better food source. Onlooker
    phase: After all employed bees have completed the above food-source search process,
    they return to the hive to share the position and nectar amount of their individual
    food source with the onlookers. Each onlooker evaluates the nectar information
    taken from all employed bees and then chooses a food source depending on the nectar
    amounts of these sources. Therefore, food sources with high nectar content attract
    a large number of onlooker. Similar to the case of the employed bee, an onlooker
    then updates the source position in its memory by checking the nectar amount of
    a neighbor source. If its nectar amount is higher than that of the previous one,
    the onlooker memorizes the new position and forgets the old one. Scout phase:
    As a result, the sources abandoned have been determined, and the employed bee
    whose food source has been abandoned becomes a scout. New sources are randomly
    produced by scouts, without considering any experience, in order to replace the
    abandoned ones. Fig. 12. A stylized optimization process of ACO. Show All Fig.
    13. The general framework of the multi-objective PSO. Show All The above foraging
    behavior can be simulated using an ABC algorithm to determine the globally optimal
    solutions of optimization problems, as shown in [210]. c) Artificial neural network
    artificial neural network (ANN): ANN is a sophisticated computational intelligence
    structure inspired by the neurobiological system. It is used for estimating or
    approximating functions that depend on a large number of inputs that are generally
    unknown [211]. The biological neuron consists of dendrites, an axon and a cell
    body called soma. Each neuron may form a connection to another neuron via the
    synapse, which is a junction of an axon and a dendrite. The so-called postsynaptic
    potentials generated within the synapses are received via dendrites and chemically
    transformed within the soma. The axon carries away the action potential sent out
    by the soma to the next synapse. The analogy of biological neurons to artificial
    neurons is explained as follows. In artificial neurons, the incoming signals are
    weighted, which is analogous to what is done in synapses. Then, the weighted signals
    are further processed. The function f(x) is basically a weighted-sum of all inputs,
    while the output corresponds to the axon. In the context of WSNs, the sensor node
    converts the physical signal to an electronic signal, which is filtered or preprocessed
    using weighting (analogous to synapse). The subsequent processing within the processor
    is represented by the particular function h(x) , which corresponds to the chemical
    processing accomplished by the soma. Eventually, a sensor node sends out the modified
    sensor reading via the radio link. This strong analogy shows that the sensor node
    itself can be viewed as a biological or artificial neuron [212]. Therefore, we
    can readily extend our horizon and regard some WSNs as large-scale ANNs. Having
    said this, we are fully aware of the inherent dangers of analogies. The shift
    procedure from a biological neuron to a sensor node is portrayed in Fig. 14. Fig.
    14. The shift procedure from a biological neuron to a sensor node. Show All The
    entire sensor network can be modelled from an ANN perspective. For each sensor
    node within the sensor network, we can also rely on ANNs to decide the output
    action. Thus, it is possible to envision a two-layer ANN architecture for WSNs.
    d) Reinforcement learning reinforcement learning (RL): RL is a powerful mathematical
    framework that enables an agent (sensor node) to learn via interacting with its
    environment and to model a problem as a Markov decision process Markov decision
    process (MDP) [213]. The most well-known RL technique is Q -learning. The visualization
    of Q -learning is shown in Fig. 15, where an agent (sensor node) regularly updates
    its achieved reward based on the action taken at a given state. The future total
    reward (i.e., the Q -value) of performing an action a t at state s t is calculated
    using Q( s t+1 , a t+1 )=Q( s t , a t )+λ⋅[r( s t , a t )−Q( s t , a t )], (19)
    View Source where r( s t , a t ) represents the immediate reward of performing
    an action a t at state s t , and 0≤λ≤1 is the learning rate that determines how
    fast learning takes place. This algorithm can be easily implemented in a distributed
    architecture like WSNs, where each node seeks to choose specific actions that
    are expected to maximize its long-term rewards. For instance, Q -learning has
    been efficiently used in WSN routing problems [214], [215]. Fig. 15. Visualization
    of the Q -learning. Show All 3) Other Advanced Optimization Techniques: There
    are several other advanced optimization methods capable of achieving appealing
    performance trade-offs, such as fuzzy logic, game theory, and so forth. Although
    these methods are less frequently used in WSNs, the trade-offs achieved by them
    can be compelling. a) Fuzzy logic (FL): FL as a mathematical model was introduced
    by Zadeh [216]. It is a useful technique that can use human language to describe
    inputs as well as outputs, and it provides a simple method of achieving a conclusion
    based on imprecise or ambiguous input information. Since then, the applications
    of FL have been expanding, especially in adaptive control systems and system identification.
    A fuzzy system comprises four basic elements, namely, fuzzifier, inference engine,
    fuzzy rule base and defuzzifier [217], as shown in Fig. 16. The fuzzifier converts
    the inputs into fuzzy variables using membership functions, each of which represents
    for each object a degree of belongingness to a specific fuzzy set. Fuzzy variables
    provide a mapping of objects to a continuous membership value, which is normalized
    in the range [0, 1]. Each fuzzy set is represented by a linguistic term, such
    as “high”, “low”, “medium”, “small” and “large”. The inference engine is often
    a collection of if-then rules, by which the fuzzy input is mapped to a linguistic
    output variable according to the fuzzy rule base. This output variable has to
    be converted into a crisp output by the defuzzification process, such as the centroid
    method, averaging method, root sum squared method, and mean of maximum. Fig. 16.
    Typical structure of the FL. Show All Low-complexity FL is suitable for WSNs,
    and various areas of WSNs have been investigated using the rules of FL. For example,
    the FL-based routing path search for a maximum network lifetime and minimum delay
    was investigated in [37], where a fuzzy membership function (edge-weight function)
    was used for formulating a multi-objective cost aggregation function, which may
    reflect the effects of all the objectives collectively as a scalar value. As a
    beneficial result, it offers a beneficial trade-off between maximizing the network
    lifetime and minimizing the source-to-sink delay. b) Game theory: Game theory
    is a powerful mathematical tool that characterizes the phenomenon of conflict
    and cooperation between rational decision-makers [218]. Since game theory introduces
    a series of successful mechanisms, such as the pricing mechanism, it has achieved
    a great success in the design of WSNs. In particular, the pricing schemes can
    guide the nodes’ behaviors towards an efficient Nash equilibrium by introducing
    a certain degree of coordination into a non-cooperative game. In [219], a Nash
    equilibrium-based game model, a cooperative coalition game model and an evolutionary
    game model were used for solving MOPs, respectively. Indeed, a number of MOO approaches
    have appeared in the literature over the past decade. For the sake of clarity,
    some representative MOO algorithms are summarized in Table IV, including the MOGA

    are available for solving MOPs. These software packages are briefly introduced

    SECTION V. Existing Literature on Using MOO in WSNs The performance metrics presented
    in Section II entail conflicting objectives, e.g., the coverage versus lifetime,
    and the energy consumption versus delay, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to balance
    multiple trade-offs efficiently by employing MOO techniques. In this section,
    we present an overview of the existing contributions that are focused on using
    MOO in the context of WSNs. A. Coverage-Versus-Lifetime Trade-Offs The reasons
    why the coverage and the lifetime of a WSN constitute conflicting objectives are
    given as follows. Optimizing the coverage represents the maximization of the proportion
    of the adequately monitored area relative to the total area. From another perspective,
    the coverage objective desires having a “spread-out” network layout, where sensor
    nodes are as far apart from each other as possible in order to minimize the overlap
    between their sensing disks. This results in a large number of relay transmissions
    taking place at the intermediate sensor nodes, especially for those communicating
    directly with the base station. Hence, the depletion of energy at these sensor
    nodes will happen sooner, and the network lifetime will then be shorter. On the
    other hand, in order to get a longer lifetime, all the sensor nodes tend to communicate
    using as few hops as possible (or even communicate directly) with the base station,
    so that their energy is used for their own data transmission as much as possible.
    This implies a clustered configuration around the base station, with substantial
    overlap between sensing disks and yielding a poor coverage performance. Table
    VI shows a summary of the existing major contributions on coverage-versus-lifetime
    trade-offs. More specifically, Jourdan and De Weck [112] conceived a MOGA for
    optimizing the layout of WSNs, i.e., the locations of nodes, by considering both
    the sensing and communication connectivity requirements. The algorithm aims for
    maximizing both the coverage and the lifetime of the network, hence yielding a
    PF from which the network can dynamically choose its most desired solution. Konstantinidis
    et al. [11], [247] considered optimizing both the locations and the transmit power
    levels of sensor nodes, i.e., the so-called deployment and power assignment problem
    deployment and power assignment problem (DPAP) for maximizing the network coverage
    and lifetime. Using the MOEA/D of [228], the multi-objective DPAP was decomposed
    into a set of scalar subproblems in [11] and [247]. By extending [11], the authors
    further addressed the K -connected DPAP in WSNs for maximizing the network coverage
    and lifetime under the K -connectivity constraints by using, again, the MOEA/D
    approach [246]. Furthermore, Rani and Devarajan [115] proposed a multi-objective
    PSO and FL based optimization model for sensor node deployment, which is based
    on the maximization of the network’s coverage, connectivity and lifetime. Choi
    and Das [91] proposed a randomized k -disjoint-sensor selection scheme that traded
    off the coverage against the data reporting latency, while enhancing the attainable
    energy efficiency depending on the specific type of applications. Additionally,
    a CIVA was proposed for mobile WSNs in [116] to strike an improved trade-off between
    coverage and lifetime. The CIVA comprises two phases: in the first phase, CIVA
    controls the locations and the sensing ranges of mobile nodes to maximize the
    coverage; in the second phase, CIVA adjusts the transmit power of active/sleep
    mobile nodes to minimize the number of active nodes. TABLE VI Coverage-Versus-Lifetime
    Trade-Offs B. Energy-Versus-Latency Trade-Offs Indeed, minimizing the energy consumption
    requires transmitting the sensed data over reduced distance in each hop. By contrast,
    minimizing the delay requires minimizing the number of intermediate forwarders
    between a source and the sink. This goal may be achieved by maximizing the distance
    between any pair of consecutive forwarders. Furthermore, a reduced search space
    for candidate forwarders yields an unbalanced distribution of the data forwarding
    load among nodes, thus causing a non-uniform depletion of their available energy
    [249], [250]. Therefore, it is necessary to jointly optimize the network’s energy
    consumption and delay. The energy-versus-latency trade-off related issues have
    been lavishly documented in various specific WSN scenarios [92], [135]–[147],
    [248], [249], [251]–[253]. Table VII shows a summary of the existing major contributions
    to energy-consumption-versus-latency trade-offs. More specifically, Schurgers
    et al. [248] studied the energy-latency-density trade-off of WSNs by proposing
    a topology-and-energy-management scheme, which promptly wakes up nodes from a
    deep sleep state without the need for an ultra-low-power radio. As a result, the
    WSN designer can trade the energy efficiency of this sleep state against the latency
    associated with waking up the node. In addition, the authors integrated their
    scheme with the classic geographical adaptive fidelity algorithm to exploit excess
    network density. Zorzi and Rao [135] developed the energy-versus-latency trade-offs
    based on the geographical location of the nodes, and proposed a collision avoidance
    protocol. Then, Yang and Vaidya [136] designed a node wake-up scheme, namely the
    so-called “pipelined tone wake-up”, which struck a balance between the energy
    savings and the end-to-end delay. This node wake-up scheme was based on an asynchronous
    wake-up pipeline, where the wake-up procedures overlapped with the packet transmissions.
    It used wake-up tones that allowed a high duty-cycle ratio without imposing a
    large wake-up delay at each hop. Yu et al. [137] studied the energy-versus-latency
    trade-offs using the so-called data aggregation tree4 in a real-time scenario
    with a specified latency constraint, and developed algorithms for minimizing the
    overall energy dissipation of the sensor nodes. Yu and Prasanna [138] presented
    the first work on energy-balanced task allocation in WSNs where both the time
    and the energy costs of the computation and communication activities were considered.
    They explored the energy-versus-latency trade-offs of communication activities
    over the data aggregation tree for modelling the packet flow in multiple-source
    single-sink communications. A numerical algorithm was conceived for obtaining
    the exact optimal solution, and a dynamic programming based approximation algorithm
    was also proposed. TABLE VII Energy-Versus-Latency Trade-Offs Borghini et al.
    [140] considered the problem of analyzing the trade-offs between the energy efficiency
    and the delay for large and dense WSNs. They used an analytical model, which facilitated
    the comparison of the trade-offs in scenarios employing different deployment-phase
    protocols, and presented a pair of novel algorithms (i.e., latency-oriented/energy-oriented
    data aggregation tree construction algorithms), which outperformed the existing
    ones. Ammari and Das [92] investigated the energy-versus-delay trade-offs of a
    WSN by varying the transmission range. Huynh and Hong [141] proposed a cluster-and-chain
    based energy-delay-efficient routing protocol for WSNs, where each k -hop cluster
    uses both cluster-based and chain-based5 approaches. Each communication round
    consisted of a cluster- and chain-formation phase, as well as a data transmission
    phase. Furthermore, Moscibroda et al. [142] analyzed the energy-efficiency versus
    propagation-delay trade-offs by defining a formal model, with a particular emphasis
    on the deployment phase. Specifically, the authors presented two new algorithms,
    one of which is entirely unstructured, while the other is based on clustering.
    Leow and Pishro-Nik [143] provided an asymptotic analysis of the transmission
    delay and energy dissipation of a 2D multi-state WSN, where the sensor nodes were
    equally spaced in a line or in a square grid. They also discussed the transmission
    delay-energy trade-offs for the case where the energy transmitted attenuates according
    to the inverse second-power pathloss law. As a further development, Mao et al.
    [144] presented a new MOO framework conceived for slot scheduling in many-to-one
    sensor networks. Two specific optimization objectives were considered in [144].
    The first one was to minimize the energy consumption, while the other was to shorten
    the total delay. Minhas et al. [145] proposed a routing algorithm based on FL
    for finding a path that offers a desirable balance between the maximum lifetime
    (associated with energy consumption) and the minimum source-to-sink delay. In
    the same spirit, Cheng and Leung [146] proposed a MOO framework for cluster-based
    WSNs. The framework was designed to strike attractive trade-offs between the energy
    consumption and the duration of the data collection process. The effectiveness
    of this framework was evaluated with a pair of energy-aware clustering algorithms.
    However, clustering techniques typically impose bottlenecks during the data collection
    process and cause extra delays. Li et al. [147] investigated the trade-offs of
    data aggregation in WSNs in the presence of interference, and they conceived an
    energy-efficient minimum-latency data aggregation algorithm, which achieved the
    asymptotically minimal aggregation latency as well as the desired energy-versus-latency
    trade-offs. Ammari [249], [250] proposed a data forwarding protocol for finding
    the best trade-offs among minimum energy consumption, uniform battery power depletion
    and minimum delay, which relied on slicing the communication range of the nodes
    into concentric circular bands. He also conceived a novel approach termed the
    weighted scale-uniform-unit sum, which was used by the source nodes for solving
    this MOP. Shahraki et al. [251] defined a new cost function and developed a new
    intra-cluster routing scheme for balancing the attainable cluster lifetime against
    the end-to-end delay between the cluster members and the cluster head. Yao et
    al. [139] developed a data collection protocol for balancing the trade-offs between
    energy-efficiency (associated with lifetime) and delay in heterogeneous WSNs,
    in which a centralized heuristic was devised for reducing the computational cost
    and a distributed heuristic was conceived for making the algorithm scalable. Both
    heuristics were inspired by recent techniques developed for the so-called “open
    vehicle routing problems with time deadlines”, which is mainly studied in operational
    research. Dong et al. [253] investigated the trade-offs between energy consumption
    and transport latency minimization under certain reliability constraints in WSNs.
    Based on the analysis strategy conceived for satisfying sensing application requirements,
    they proposed a data gathering protocol named broadcasting combined with multi-NACK/ACK
    to strike attractive trade-offs. Suto et al. [252] proposed an energy-efficient
    and delay-aware wireless computing system for industrial WSNs based smart factories.
    C. Lifetime-Versus-Application-Performance Trade-Offs In certain sensor network
    applications, the specific application’s performance strongly depends on the amount
    of data gathered from each sensor node in the network. However, higher data rates
    result in increased sensing and communication costs across the sensor network,
    as well as in escalating energy consumption and reduced network lifetime [255].
    Thus, there is an inherent trade-offs between the network lifetime and a specific
    application’s performance, while the latter is often correlated to the rate at
    which the application can reliably send its data across sensor networks. This
    problem has been extensively studied in recent years. Table VIII shows a summary
    of the existing major contributions to lifetime-versus-application-performance
    trade-offs. Nama et al. [128] investigated the trade-offs between network utility
    and network lifetime maximization in a WSN. They proposed a general cross-layer
    optimization-based framework that took into account the associated radio resource
    allocation issues and designed a distributed algorithm by relying on the so-called
    dual decomposition [258] of the original problem. Similarly, Zhu et al. [129]
    studied the trade-off between network lifetime (associated with energy conservation)
    and rate-allocation by using the gradient projection [259] method. However, no
    detailed information was provided about how to distributively implement this algorithm
    in the interest of solving the lifetime-versus-rate-allocation trade-off problem
    in each layer of the open systems interconnection open systems interconnection
    (OSI) model. Zhu et al. [129] also studied the trade-offs between the network’s
    lifetime and fair rate allocation in the context of multi-path routing sensor
    networks [107], where they formulated an MOP subject to a set of convex constraints.
    They invoked the NUM framework [104] and introduced an adjustable factor to guarantee
    rate-allocation fairness amongst all sensor nodes. Chen et al. [74] have addressed
    the utility-versus-lifetime trade-offs with the aid of an optimal flow control
    in a practical WSN. They formulated the problem as a non-linear MOP subjected
    to certain constraints and introduced auxiliary variables for decoupling the individual
    objectives embedded in the scalar-valued multi-objective function. The concept
    of inconsistent coordination price6 was first introduced for balancing the energy
    consumption of the sensor node and the gradient projection method [259] was adopted
    for designing a distributed algorithm that is capable of finding the optimal rate
    allocation. He et al. [130] focused on the rate allocation problem in multi-path
    routing WSNs subjected to time-varying channel conditions with two objectives
    in mind: maximizing the aggregate utility and prolonging the network’s lifetime,
    respectively. They decomposed the optimization problem with the aid of the classic
    Lagrange dual decomposition [258] and adopted the stochastic quasi-gradient algorithm
    [259] for solving the primal-dual problem in a distributed way. Luo et al. [131]
    have also carried out a systematic study of the trade-offs between the network’s
    throughput and lifetime for WSNs having stationary nodes, where the link transmissions
    were carefully coordinated to avoid interference. The authors used a realistic
    interference model based on the SINR for modeling the conflicts to avoid, when
    scheduling the wireless links’ transmissions. Their analytical and numerical results
    provided novel insights into the interplay among the throughput, lifetime and
    transmit power. Xie et al. [256] adopted a specific fairness concept to analyze
    the performance degradation experienced in multirate WSNs and then took into account
    the trade-offs between the throughput attained and energy consumption imposed.
    Eventually, a multirate-supportive MAC protocol was proposed for balancing the
    throughput versus energy consumption. Liao and Zhang [257] generalized the NUM
    model to a multiutility framework using MOO and applied this framework to trade
    off the network utility against the lifetime in WSNs. An extended Lagrange duality
    method was proposed, which is capable of converging to a selected Pareto-optimal
    solution. TABLE VIII Lifetime-Versus-Application-Performance Trade-Offs D. Trade-Offs
    Related to the Number of Nodes Intuitively, deploying more sensor nodes would
    improve the overall event-detection probability of the system, albeit at the expense
    of increasing both the energy consumption and deployment cost. This indicates
    the trade-offs among multiple conflicting objectives related to the number of
    nodes. Table IX portrays a number of existing contributions to these trade-offs
    at a glance. TABLE IX Trade-Offs Related to the Number of Sensor Nodes To elaborate,
    in [98], a pair of multi-objective metaheuristic algorithms (MOEA and NSGA-II)
    have been used for solving the WSN’s layout problem, determining both the number
    and the locations of the sensor nodes that formed a WSN, so that reliable full
    coverage of a given sensor field was achieved. Specifically, the authors focused
    their attention on the energy efficiency of the network as well as on the number
    of nodes, while the coverage obtained by the network was considered as a constraint.
    Jia et al. [101] proposed a new coverage control scheme based on an improved NSGA-II
    using an adjustable sensing radius. The objective was to find the most appropriate
    balance among the conflicting factors of the maximum coverage rate, the least
    energy consumption, as well as the minimum number of active nodes. As a further
    development, Woehrle et al. [99] have invoked the MOEA to identify attractive
    trade-offs between low deployment-cost and highly reliable wireless transmission,
    i.e., to minimize transmission failure probability at as low deployment-cost as
    possible. Cheng and Tse [158] investigated the trade-offs between the maximum
    affordable number of nodes and the minimum duration of the data collection process
    in a delay-aware data collection network by exploiting the concepts of Pareto-optimality.
    Rajagopalan [102] employed the evolutionary multi-objective crowding algorithm
    evolutionary multi-objective crowding algorithm (EMOCA) for solving the sensor
    placement problem. There were three objectives: maximizing the probability of
    global target detection, minimizing the total energy dissipated by the sensor
    network and minimizing the total number of nodes to be deployed. The MOO approach
    simultaneously optimized the three objectives and obtained multiple Pareto-optimal
    solutions. Aitsaadi et al. [103] considered a multi-objective combinatorial optimization
    problem, where a new multi-objective deployment algorithm multi-objective deployment
    algorithm (MODA) was proposed. The optimization objective was to reduce the number
    of deployed nodes, to satisfy the target quality of monitoring, to guarantee the
    network’s connectivity and finally to maximize the network’s lifetime. Berre et
    al. [100] formulated an MOP of maximizing three objectives. The first objective
    was the maximization of the coverage area in real time, the second objective was
    the maximization of the network’s lifetime depending on the coverage, and the
    final objective was to minimize the number of deployed nodes subject to the connectivity
    on the network. The solutions found by three different algorithms (i.e., NSGA-II,
    SPEA2 and ACO) were compared. Recently, a novel MOICA was proposed for sensor
    node deployment in [157], where the minimization of the number of active sensor
    nodes and the maximization of the coverage were jointly considered. The numerical
    results of [157] demonstrated that the MOICA was capable of providing more-accurate
    solutions at a lower computational complexity than the existing methods. E. Reliability-Related
    Trade-Offs The main objective behind the deployment of WSNs is to capture and
    transmit pictures, videos and other important data to the sink reliably. These
    applications require us to maintain a strict QoS guarantee [260], [261]. However,
    maintaining the QoS during routing hinges on numerous factors, such as the energy
    status of the nodes in the network, the delay, the bandwidth and the reliability
    requirements. Hence, sophisticated routing protocols have to take into considerations
    multiple potentially conflicting factors, which makes the problem even more challenging.
    Table X shows a summary of the existing contributions to reliability-related trade-offs.
    To expound a little further, Miller et al. [152] studied the trade-offs amongst
    the energy, latency and reliability. They conceived a meritorious probability-based
    broadcast forwarding scheme for minimizing both the energy usage and the latency,
    whilst improving the reliability. EkbataniFard et al. [262] have developed a QoS-based
    energy-aware routing protocol for a two-tier WSN from the perspective of MOO.
    The proposed protocol utilizing the NSGA-II efficiently optimized the QoS parameters
    formulated in terms of the reliability and end-to-end delay, whilst reducing the
    average power consumption of the nodes, which substantially extended the lifetime
    of the network. TABLE X Reliability-Related Trade-Offs A high data rate can be
    maintained by a link at the expense of a reduced delivery reliability, and/or
    increased energy consumption, which in turn reduces the network lifetime. Again,
    there is an inherent trade-off among the data rate, reliability and network lifetime.
    Although numerous treatises have extensively studied the data rate, reliability
    and network lifetime in isolation, only a few of them have considered the trade-offs
    among them. Xu et al. [263] jointly considered the rate, reliability and network
    lifetime in a rigorous framework. They addressed the optimal rate-reliability-lifetime
    trade-offs under a specific link capacity constraint, reliability constraint and
    energy constraint. However, the optimization formulation was neither separable
    nor convex. Hence, a series of transformations have been invoked and then a separable
    and convex problem was derived. Finally, an efficient distributed subgradient
    dual decomposition subgradient dual decomposition (SDD) algorithm was developed
    for striking an appealing trade-off. Lu et al. [8] formulated WSN routing as a
    fuzzy random multi-objective optimization fuzzy random multi-objective optimization
    (FRMOO) problem, which simultaneously considered the multiple objectives of delay,
    reliability, energy, delay jitter, the interference aspects and the energy balance
    of a path. They introduced a fuzzy random variable for characterizing the link
    delay, link reliability and the nodes’ residual energy, with the objective of
    accurately reflecting the random characteristics in WSN routing. Eventually, a
    hybrid routing algorithm based on FRMOO was designed. Razzaque et al. [264] proposed
    a QoS-aware routing protocol for body sensor networks, in which a lexicographic
    optimization approach was used for trading off the QoS requirements and energy
    costs. Lanza-Gutierrez and Gomez-Pulido [151] considered the deployment of energy
    harvesting relay nodes for resolving the conflict among average energy cost, average
    sensing area and network reliability. Two multi-objective metaheuristics, i.e.,
    the ABC algorithm and the firefly algorithm firefly algorithm (FA), were applied
    for solving the problem, respectively. Ansari et al. [265] considered the energy
    consumption, reliability, coverage intensity and end-to-end delay trade-offs based
    on the location of the nodes, and a new multi-mode switching protocol was adopted.
    Liu et al. [266] proposed an energy-efficient cooperative spectrum sensing scheme
    for a cognitive WSN by taking into account the energy consumption and the spectrum
    sensing performance, both of which were jointly optimized using fast MODE. Xiao
    et al. [267] proposed a time-sensitive utility model for low-duty-cycle WSNs,
    where they simultaneously took into account the transmission cost, utility, reliability
    and latency. Moreover, they designed two optimal time-sensitive utility-based
    routing algorithms to strike the most appropriate balance among these four metrics.
    F. Trade-Offs Related to Other Metrics As mentioned in Section I, in practice
    it is unfeasible to jointly satisfy the optimum of several potentially conflicting
    objectives. To circumvent this dilemma, the concept of Pareto-optimal has been
    widely invoked, resulting in a PF generated by all Pareto-optimal solutions of
    a MOP, where it is impossible to improve any of the objectives without degrading
    one or several of the others. Therefore, according to the needs of decision makers
    and the actual situation of the WSN considered, efficient routing algorithms are
    required for finding a satisfactory path in WSNs. Table XI summarizes other metrics
    and their trade-offs. As seen in Table XI, Lozano-Garzon and Donoso [268] proposed
    a distributed N -to-1 multi-path routing scheme for a WSN by taking into account
    the number of hops, the energy consumption and the free space loss,7 and these
    three objectives were optimized by the SPEA2 [220] with the aim of using the energy
    efficiently in the network, whilst reducing the packet-loss rate. Bandyopadhyay
    et al. [269] proposed a transmission scheduling scheme using a collision-free
    protocol for gathering sensor data. Moreover, they studied diverse trade-offs
    amongst the energy usage, the sensor density, and the temporal/spatial sampling
    rates. As a further advance, Rajagopalan et al. [84] developed a MOO framework
    for mobile agent routing in WSNs. The multi-objective evolutionary optimization
    algorithms EMOCA and NSGA-II were employed to find the mobile agents’ routes,
    aiming for maximizing the total detected signal energy, while minimizing the energy
    consumption by reducing the hop-length. Wei and Zhi [24] established a multi-objective
    routing model that relies on the delay, energy consumption, data packet-loss rate
    as its optimization objectives. By adjusting the specific weight of each function,
    the algorithm adapts well to various services having different energy cost, delay
    and packet-loss rate requirements. This protocol was implemented using an advanced
    ACO algorithm that is based on a cloud model.8 TABLE XI Trade-Offs Related to
    Other Metrics For a typical WSN, the accuracy of an application and the longevity
    of the network are inversely proportional to each other, which is partially due
    to the finite energy reserves of the nodes and owing to the desire for applications
    to have large volumes of fresh data to process. Adlakha et al. [166] created a
    four-dimensional design space based on four independent QoS parameters, namely
    the accuracy, delay, energy consumption and the node density. In order to achieve
    an improved accuracy or lifetime, various parameters of the individual techniques
    can be adjusted. The insights and relationships identified in [166] were not unique
    to mobility tracking applications, many potential applications of WSNs requiring
    a balance amongst the factors of energy consumption, node density, latency and
    accuracy may also benefit from exploiting the results and trends identified in
    [166]. For instance, the energy-density-latency-accuracy energy-density-latency-accuracy
    (EDLA) trade-offs have been studied in the context of WSNs in [167]. By contrast,
    Armenia et al. [110] introduced a Markov-based modeling of the random routing
    behavior for evaluating the trade-offs between location privacy and energy efficiency
    in a WSN. Notably, their approach used the information theoretic concept of privacy
    loss. Both the network security and lifetime have been studied by Liu et al. [111],
    where they proposed a three-phase routing scheme, which is termed security and
    energy-efficient disjoint routing. Based on the secret-sharing algorithm, this
    routing scheme dispersively and randomly delivered its source-information to the
    sink node, ensuring that the network security was maximized without degrading
    the lifetime of WSNs. As a further development, Tang et al. [270] proposed a geography-based
    cost-aware secure routing protocol to address the conflicting lifetime-versus-security
    trade-off issue in multi-hop WSNs. The design goal was achieved by controlling
    energy deployment balance and invoking a random walking routing strategy. Attea
    et al. [271] studied the MOP of how to optimally divide sensor nodes into multiple
    disjoint subsets so that two conflicting objectives, namely the network lifetime
    and coverage probability, can be jointly maximized. Each subset of sensors is
    required to completely cover a set of targets having known locations. Hence, they
    formulated a multi-objective disjoint set cover disjoint set cover (DSC) problem,
    which was tackled by MOEA/D and NSGA-II. Sengupta et al. [272] employed a novel
    heuristic algorithm, termed MOEA/D with fuzzy dominance multi-objective evolutionary
    algorithm based on decomposition with fuzzy dominance (MOEA/DFD), for finding
    the best trade-offs among coverage, energy consumption, lifetime and the number
    of nodes, while maintaining the connectivity between each sensor node and the
    sink node. Wang et al. [273] quantified the probabilistic performance trade-offs
    among the network lifetime, end-to-end communication delay and network throughput
    in real-time WSNs. A heuristic-based multiple-local-search technique was employed
    for finding the solutions. Inspired by the concept of potential field from the
    discipline of physics, Zhang et al. [274] designed a novel potential-based routing
    algorithm, known as the integrity and delay differentiated routing for WSNs. The
    objective was to improve the data fidelity for high-integrity applications and
    to reduce the end-to-end delay simultaneously. SECTION VI. Open Problems and Discussions
    Despite the increasing attention paid to the MOO of WSNs, this research area still
    has numerous open facets for future work, as discussed below. Most of the studies
    investigated the MOO of single-hop transmission, whereas only a limited amount
    of contributions, such as [275], paid attention to multi-hop WSNs. Clearly, multi-hop
    transmission in energy-limited WSNs is essential for conserving transmission energy
    and thus for prolonging the network’s lifetime. Therefore, it is promising to
    intensify the research of MOO in the context of multi-hop WSNs. Sensor nodes may
    move from one place to another as required by the application or may be displaced
    by objects (human, animals, etc ). Hence, the mobility of the nodes has a substantial
    impact on the network’s connectivity. For example, if a data packet is long and
    the node changes its current location during the packet’s forwarding, part of
    the data may be lost at the receiving node. Similarly, when a node selects a routing
    path but the nodes in the routing path change their locations, the connectivity
    between the source nodes and destination nodes will be affected. Therefore, the
    deployment of nodes in highly dynamic scenarios requires a deployment approach
    that equips the network with a self-organizing capability. Artificial potential
    field artificial potential field (APF) techniques9 have been applied to the problems
    of formation control and obstacle avoidance in multi-robot systems [277]. Since
    these problems are of similar nature to the deployment problem of sensor nodes,
    the APF techniques may also be used to devise a deployment approach for WSNs.
    Since WSNs are typically deployed in physically open and possibly hostile environments,
    they will be confronted with security attacks ranging from passive attacks, active
    attacks, and denial-of-service denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Therefore, their
    security is one of the imperative aspects in future research. Since the security
    may gravely affect the network performance, especially during the information
    exchange phase, designing a secure routing protocol for WSNs is a must. Most of
    the known routing algorithms assume that the nodes are static and rely on a single
    path. Once the routing is attacked, the network’s performance will be significantly
    degraded. Therefore, it is necessary to study multi-route protocols conceived
    for mobile-node based routing capable of satisfying the security and QoS requirements
    in any real-time application. The trade-offs between the security and QoS requirements
    will bring about further new challenges. Existing contributions often assume that
    the sensor networks are spread across a two-dimensional plane, but in practice
    they are indeed of three-dimensional three-dimensional (3D) nature. The extension
    of a 2D network into 3D is both interesting and challenging. In two-tier WSNs,
    multiple objectives have to be satisfied by the routing algorithms. Lu et al.
    [8] proposed a routing solution based on the fuzzy random expected value model
    and the standard deviation model of [278]10 to meet the requirements of different
    applications of the clustered network advocated. Since the fuzzy random expected
    value model may become inaccurate in uncertain environments, improved routing
    model based on MOO is necessitated. Moreover, due to the limitation of GAs, the
    distributed solving methods based on local information and on the decomposition
    theory are expected to be further investigated. Serious natural disasters, such
    as sandstorms, tsunamis, landslides etc, have routinely damaged the natural environment
    and inflicted the loss of human lives. Although WSNs provide a promising solution
    to realize real-time environment monitoring, numerous issues have to be resolved
    for their practical implementation. One of the major issues is how to effectively
    deploy WSNs to guarantee large-area sensing coverage and reliable communication
    connectivity in hostile propagation scenarios. In recent years, considering the
    similarity between multi-objective design and game theory, the latter has also
    been employed to solve multi-objective design problems. By analogy, m -objective
    designs can be regarded as m -player games. Chi and Liu [279] introduced game
    theory and the concept of co-evolution into GAs for the sake of solving the MOPs,
    which has been shown to perform well. In [219] a Nash-equilibrium based game model,
    a cooperative coalition game model and an evolutionary game model were used for
    solving MOP. Since EAs are capable of finding the global solution of MOPs with
    good robustness, while Nash games can be used for conflict resolution and Stackelberg
    games for hierarchical design, it is promising to solve MOPs of WSNs by combining
    a Nash game with EAs or combining a Stackelberg game with EAs. As an adaptive
    parameter control method based on sensitivity results, the Pascoletti-Serafini
    scalarization method [280] is a more general formulation relying on an unrestricted
    search direction and an auxiliary vector variable. It has been used for both linear
    and nonlinear MOPs [280]. Naturally, this method can also be applied to solve
    MOPs in WSNs, yielding approximate solutions of the problems considered. Indeed,
    for the MOP of multicell networks [281], the relationship between the parameters
    and the optimal solutions was elucidated by the Pascoletti-Serafini scalarization.
    The mutually interfering networks are ubiquitous, hence finding innovative cross-layer
    and cross-network solutions becomes essential. To this end, we believe that many
    hybrid computational intelligence algorithms which combine the benefits of two
    or more algorithms should be given careful attention, such as swarm-FL control,
    neuro-FL control, GA-PSO, GA-ANN, and neuro-immune systems, etc. Cognitive radio
    cognitive radio (CR) is an emerging wireless communication paradigm, in which
    the transceivers are capable of intelligently detecting in their vicinity which
    specific communication channels are in use and which are not. Then, they promptly
    switch to vacant channels while avoiding occupied ones. This is essentially a
    form of dynamic spectrum access dynamic spectrum access (DSA) [282], which may
    substantially improve the exploitation of the available wireless spectrum. Typically,
    a transceiver in CR may be capable of determining its geographic location, identifying
    and authorizing its users, sensing neighboring wireless devices, and automatically
    adjusting its transmission and reception parameters to allow more concurrent wireless
    communications in a given spectrum band at a specific location. Depending on which
    parts of spectrum are available for the operation of CR, we have CR operating
    either in licensed bands, or in unlicensed bands. On the other hand, WSNs often
    use the unlicensed ISM band for communications, but with the rapidly increasing
    demand of the Internet of Things Internet of Things (IoT) based applications (e.g.,
    healthcare and tele-medicine), the currently available ISM band may become insufficient,
    which can result in various technical problems, such as unreliable transmission
    of useful data. Therefore, in order to alleviate this “spectrum crunch”, an emerging
    trend in WSNs is to equip the wireless sensor nodes with the CR based DSA capability,
    thus giving birth to CR aided WSNs (CR-WSN) [283]–[285]. Due to its potential
    advantages, CR-WSN might be a promising solution for some specific WSN applications,
    such as indoor sensing, multiclass heterogeneous sensing, and real-time surveillance
    [283]. Additionally, WBAN, which is a promising technology for ubiquitous health
    monitoring systems, is also an application area of CR-WSN. In general, CR-WSNs
    constitute an unexplored field with only a handful of studies. More specifically,
    Oto and Akan [286] determined the optimal packet size that maximizes the energy-efficiency
    of a practical realization of a CR-WSN. Ozger et al. [287] proposed a spectrum-aware
    clustering protocol to address the event-to-sink communication coordination issue
    in mobile CR-WSNs. A cross-layer framework that employed CR to circumvent the
    hostile propagation conditions for the smart grid was discussed in [288], and
    the MAC-layer delay of a cognitive sensor node was modeled in [289]. The realization
    of CR-WSN primarily requires an efficient spectrum management framework for regulating
    the DSA of densely deployed resource-constrained sensor nodes. Therefore, MOO
    techniques invoked for designing CR-WSNs should be sufficiently intelligent to
    differentiate between the traffic types and to satisfy their QoS requirements.
    The current research efforts on MOPs for large-scale CR-WSNs have to be strengthened.
    WSNs play a key role in creating a highly reliable and self-healing smart electric
    power grid that rapidly responds to online events with appropriate actions. However,
    due to the broadcast nature of radio propagation and varying spectral characteristics,
    establishing a secure and robust low-power smart grid over the WSN must be addressed.
    Other technical challenges of WSNs in the smart grid include harsh environmental
    conditions, tight reliability and latency requirements, as well as low packet
    errors and variable link capacity. Until now, there have been only a few approaches
    available, and more studies are needed in these areas. SECTION VII. Conclusion
    In this paper, we have provided a tutorial and survey of the research of MOO in
    the context of WSNs. We commence with the rudimentary concepts of WSNs and the
    optimization objectives in WSNs, then focus on illuminating the family of algorithms
    for solving MOPs. Since having multiple objectives in a problem gives rise to
    a set of Pareto-optimal solutions instead of a single globally optimal solution,
    none of these Pareto-optimal solutions can be considered to be better than the
    others on the Pareto front without any further information. Thus the MOO algorithms
    may be invoked for finding as many Pareto-optimal solutions as possible. Additionally,
    diverse design trade-offs relying both on classical optimization methods and on
    the recent advances of MOO have been reviewed in the context of WSNs. Future research
    directions on MOO conceived for WSNs include multi-hop transmissions, the deployment
    of nodes in highly dynamic scenarios, secure multi-path routing protocols and
    solving optimization problems in 3D networks, CR-WSNs and smart grid. Authors

  explanation: This study analyzes the importance of integrating machine learning
    algorithms with closed-loop control strategies to optimize automated irrigation
    management systems. The researchers propose a hierarchical partitioning method
    (P2P) to optimize irrigation strategies over time, adapting to environmental conditions
    and crop requirements. They find that the P2P algorithm, when combined with a
    biophysical and decisional model (MODERATO), can improve the direct margin for
    maize production by 5.5% compared to a basic irrigation strategy proposed by advisors.
    The study also highlights the importance of considering different hydraulic contexts,
    such as flow rate and water availability, when optimizing irrigation strategies.

    Get rights and content Abstract Improving water efficiency in irrigated agriculture
    is a priority for better environmental and economic performance. It can be achieved
    by reducing the amount of water used and optimizing the timing of application.
    Among numerous methods, hybrid biophysical/decisional simulation models are effective
    tools for evaluating and comparing irrigation strategies under different weather
    conditions. However, optimizing irrigation strategies for some specified agro-environmental
    expected criteria is a computationally hard problem. In this paper we propose
    a new approach for optimizing the parameters (quantities, dates, thresholds, etc.)
    of maize irrigation strategies represented by structured decision rules and simulated
    with the management-oriented model MODERATO. We introduce a stochastic simulation
    optimisation method, called Partition-2P (P2P). P2P is designed to completely
    explore by sampling the domain of the strategy parameters. This exploration is
    based on a hierarchical decomposition of the domain, heuristically guided toward
    optimal regions, and allows to consider high-dimensional optimisation problems.
    We first evaluate P2P by comparing it to a systematic grid search on a simple
    two-parameter problem, in order to optimise the expectation of the direct margin
    over 49 years of weather records. We obtain very similar results that confirm
    the sound behaviour of P2P. We then apply our approach to a more complex optimisation
    problem that involves an eight-parameters strategy, for which the systematic grid
    search method is not effective. The best strategy we obtain shows a 28 ha−1 increase
    in margin compared to a basic strategy proposed by irrigation advisors. The P2P
    algorithm is also used in three specific hydraulic contexts concerning the available
    flow rate. The different optimal parameter obtained for each context agree well
    with the expert knowledge of irrigation advisors. We finally conclude by discussing
    some limitations and possible improvements of the presented work. Previous article

    support systemMaize 1. Introduction Managing water properly is certainly one of
    the major challenges of the 21st century. Agriculture is an important consumer
    of water and irrigation is essential in some areas to allow acceptable crop yield
    and quality (Hook, 1994). Improved water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture
    is therefore a priority for better environmental and economic performance (Howell,
    2001). Irrigation scheduling has been an important topic in agricultural research
    for several decades and continues to be so today (King et al., 2001). There is
    a vast amount of literature on irrigation scheduling methods (e.g., Pleban et
    al., 1984; Plant et al., 1992; Epperson et al., 1993; Botes et al., 1996; Raghuwanshi
    and Wallender, 1998; Bergez et al., 2002). Biophysical models linked with decisional
    models can be a helpful tool to solve irrigation scheduling problems. MODERATO
    (Bergez et al., 2001a) is such a hybrid decision model that includes the main
    constraints for irrigation, but requires fewer detailed data than classical whole
    farm models. Given a farmer’s irrigation strategy, it simulates the plant–soil
    system with a dynamic biophysical model and takes account of some within-field
    variability due to the time required to irrigate the whole field. MODERATO is
    an effective tool for evaluating and comparing irrigation strategies under different
    weather conditions (Bergez et al., 2002). In MODERATO, irrigation strategies are
    represented as sets of decision rules with lots of parameters (thresholds, quantities,
    dates, etc.). The design of innovative strategies that perform well for some specified
    agro-environmental criteria thus leads to large optimisation problems. In this
    paper, we propose a new simulation-based optimisation approach that handles this
    difficulty. This approach combines a hierarchical partitioning algorithm called
    P2P with MODERATO. The use of the P2P algorithm is a further step in optimising
    strategies and therefore provides some important improvements on the work carried
    out by Bergez et al. (2002). After an introduction to P2P as a simulation optimisation
    method, we present MODERATO and the irrigation problem we considered. Experimental
    results we obtained are then presented and discussed. 2. Materials and methods
    2.1. A hierarchical partitioning method for optimising agricultural systems The
    problem of optimising the management of the irrigation season can be defined as
    finding the best sequence of decision rules that maximises the expected value
    of an objective function, J, which commonly is defined as the net margin of the
    crop. This optimisation problem can be seen as a control problem, for which dynamic
    programming (DP) methods exist (Kennedy, 1986). However, DP methods are often
    inappropriate when faced with large state and decision spaces, despite some promising
    improvements of DP methods that have been shown recently with the reinforcement
    learning approach (Sutton and Barto, 1998). A more flexible and realistic formulation
    of the optimisation problem consists of searching by means of simulation for the
    best values for the parameters of a pre-defined irrigation strategy. In this case
    the simulation model is considered as a black box function where the vector of
    strategy parameters θ=(θ1,…,θp) is taken as the input variable and where the output
    is the objective function J. In most of the simulation models of agricultural
    production systems, the objective function J also depends on the weather, which
    has to be considered as an unknown and uncontrollable random variable ξ. Optimising
    a strategy thus consists of searching for the set of parameters θ* that maximises
    the expected value of the objective function according to the random weather series:
    (1) where Θ is the value domain of θ. Several efficient methods (stochastic approximation,
    random search, stochastic branch-and-bound, etc.) have been recently developed
    for solving this stochastic simulation optimisation problem, which is one of the
    most difficult problems of mathematical programming (Azadivar, 1999; Swisher et
    al., 2000; Fu, 2001). Stochastic iterative methods for deterministic optimisation
    problems like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing or tabu search (Reeves,
    1995) have also been adapted for the stochastic environment associated with simulation.
    In these approaches, the criterion E(J(θ)) is estimated by averaging the objective
    function J(θ,ξ) over a large number of sampled variables ξi: (2) When the ξi are
    fixed, the objective function J thus becomes a deterministic function of the input
    variables θ, and a range of classical optimisation algorithms can be used. Such
    evolutionary algorithms and other standard deterministic optimisation methods
    have all been applied to agricultural simulation models in recent years (Mayer
    et al., 1998a) and have performed well. However, most of these optimisation problems
    consist of optimising management decisions on existing (past) climatic series
    (e.g., Li and Yost, 2000; Mayer et al., 1996, Mayer et al., 1998b, Mayer et al.,
    2001; Parsons, 1998; Reddy et al., 1995). Very few optimisation methods have been
    applied so far to agricultural systems for optimising the expected value of an
    objective function, as described above. Cros et al. (2001) used the Kiefer–Wolfowitz
    stochastic gradient method (1952) to derive the best values of some parameters
    involved in a grazing management strategy. It appears that this approach is reliable,
    but the algorithm requires a difficult parameterisation that is specific to the
    application. Botes et al. (1996) optimised irrigation strategies by using the
    Nelder–Mead simplex algorithm (1965). Expected values of strategies are estimated
    by Eq. (2), using N=20 years’ weather data. In this paper we develop a new method
    for stochastic simulation optimisation problems with continuous variable space
    Θ⊂Rp, where we assume that parameters θi are bound-constrained, which means that
    the domain Θ is a hyper-rectangle on Rp. This algorithm is designed to completely
    explore (by sampling) the domain Θ, in order to find local and global optimal
    values for θ∈Θ. For small values of p, the simplest method for such problems is
    a systematic grid-search (SGS), which consists of estimating the objective function
    on all points located on finer and finer grids over Θ, until a maximum precision
    is reached for each variable. For large-dimension problems (p>2) this method is
    not efficient since the number of grid points grows exponentially with p. A more
    useful approach is therefore to prioritise the evaluation of points θ within promising
    regions of Θ that are supposed to contain optimal solutions. Its main advantage
    is to maximise, for a given budget of time or simulation runs, the chance of finding
    a good solution. The method we propose falls within this approach and is inspired
    by the DIRECT (Jones et al., 1993) or the MCS (Huyer and Neumaier, 1999) algorithms
    dedicated to deterministic problems. It belongs to the family of stochastic branching
    methods, like stochastic branch and bound or nested partitions methods. It is
    based on a hierarchical decomposition of Θ into 2p-trees, and we therefore call
    it Partition-2p, or P2P. The principle of the algorithm is simple. At each iteration
    of the search, a promising region is selected from a list of “pending regions”
    (see below). This selected region, a p-dimensional rectangle, is then broken down
    into 2p smaller ones, whose sides are half the length of the original rectangle.
    Each of these 2p new pending regions is then randomly sampled, and the sample
    points are used for estimating by simulation some indices of the region, on the
    basis of which the region is ranked in the pending list. From the initial region
    Θ, this algorithm generates a sequence of rooted trees of rectangles, whose leaves
    form a partition of Θ (see Fig. 1). The maximum depth of the principal tree is
    achieved when pending regions cannot be broken down any further (the maximum precision
    is reached). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Description of the P2P
    algorithm for a two-parameter optimisation problem. From the initial region Θ
    describing the space of the two parameters, P2P generates a sequence of trees
    of rectangular regions that form a partition of Θ. Each new created region is
    evaluated by simulation on sampled points. Pending regions are ranked and the
    best one is developed first. P2P stops when a minimal discretisation has been
    reached for all pending regions. Indices are used as heuristics for selecting
    promising regions to explore. The efficiency of the algorithm thus relies mainly
    on the choice of these indices. For instance, selecting the pending regions with
    the lowest depth leads to a systematic grid-search method. Conversely, selecting
    regions with maximal average values on sample points leads to an optimistic best-first
    search that favors a fast convergence to local optima. A useful trade-off can
    also be achieved by considering both the average value and the variance of sample
    points in the region. Indeed, for two regions with a similar mean, a better potential
    increase is to be expected in the one having the larger variance. In the optimisation
    runs with P2P presented in this paper, the average value f of a region was the
    only index used for ranking the pending cells. For each of the sampled points
    θj within a region, the simulation model is run and the value f(θj)=E(J(θj)) is
    estimated by averaging the objective function J(θj,ξ) for N sampled variables
    ξi (3) The number M of sampled points θj drawn randomly on each new region can
    be either fixed (e.g., one point in the centre of the region), or based on the
    depth of the cell (e.g., proportional to the volume of the region). The average
    value f of the region is then estimated by (4) As f is just an empirical indicator,
    its exact value does not need to be precisely estimated, and small numbers N and
    M can be sufficient in practice (Ólafsson and Shi, 1999). The algorithm P2P stops
    when the maximal depth or minimal discretisation has been reached for each pending
    region, or more generally when a given number of iterations has been performed.
    If the objective function E(J(θ)) is continuous, the algorithm is guaranteed to
    converge to the globally optimal parameter θ* when the minimal discretisation
    tends to 0 and the number N of sampled variables ξi tends to infinity. During
    the search, a list managing the best regions is maintained, sorted only on the
    index f. This list constitutes the output of the algorithm. 2.2. The irrigation
    management simulation model MODERATO is a management-oriented model aimed at improving
    the irrigation strategy for an irrigated corn crop. Details of the decision model
    may be found in Bergez et al. (2001a). In this paper, we will deal only with decision
    management for a case in which irrigation is to be optimised. MODERATO includes
    in the irrigation decision-making process the main constraints for irrigation
    (flow, volume and working rate) and simulates the plant–soil system with a dynamic
    biophysical model (a detailed description of the equations of the biophysical
    model is given by Wallach et al. (2001)). We specified the system boundaries in
    a way that reflects the constraints and opportunities faced by farmers (Cox, 1996).
    The constraints for irrigation included in MODERATO are divided in three categories:
    &#x02022; Equipment constraints: maximum flow available due to pumping capacity
    per hectare; maximum and minimum amount of water allowed per irrigation. &#x02022;
    Resource constraints: a limited total amount of water for irrigation. &#x02022;
    Regulatory or human constraints: irrigation bans on some days of the week, farmer’s
    reluctance to work for all or part of certain days, decreased flow rate availability
    during the irrigation period due to administrative restrictions, etc.  A major
    part of the decision-making process followed by farmers consists of deciding when
    to start a new irrigation round, the quantity of water to apply and when to stop
    irrigation. These decisions are taken on the basis of almost daily observations
    of the physiological stage of the development of the crop and the soil water content,
    given some equipment constraints (flow rate and available water). In surveys carried
    out in south-western France (Darracq, 1996; Clavé, 2001), it was found that farmers
    use different rules to irrigate and different indicators to trigger the rules.
    For example, to decide when to start irrigation, different indicators were used:
    when leaves start to roll, when the soil changes colour, when the soil thrown
    up by moles becomes drier, when tensiometer values reach a given threshold, when
    the neighbour starts to irrigate, etc. All these indicators are difficult or even
    impossible to translate into a decision tool. Unlike Shaffer and Brodahl (1998),
    who decided to introduce a lot of complexity into their decision rule editor,
    we chose to simplify this complex decision strategy and to base the elementary
    rules on a two-step condition algorithm: 1. a condition describing the crop development
    [Cond1]; 2. a condition describing the water status in the system [Cond2].  The
    Boolean process to decide on any rule is then very simple: if Cond1 is true, then
    Cond2 is checked; if Cond2 is true, then an action occurs. Two choices are offered
    to describe each of the two conditions: either an indicator directly related to
    weather data and easily obtained by the user (calendar date for Cond1, sum or
    average rainfall or potential evapotranspiration for Cond2) or a simulated indicator,
    calculated by the biophysical model (stage of the crop described by accumulated
    thermal units (Muchow et al., 1990) for Cond1, fraction of available water for
    Cond2). For example, Fig. 2 shows the rule for irrigation for plant emergence,
    which reads: If, 15 days after sowing (Cond1, Choice 1) or 70 °C day after sowing
    (Cond1, Choice 2), the cumulative rainfall has been less than 20 mm (Cond2, Choice
    1), then 20 mm of irrigation is applied. The irrigation round will stop if the
    cumulative rainfall since the beginning of the round is more than 10 mm. The applied
    amount of irrigation has to be subtracted from the total amount of water available
    for irrigation. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Template describing
    the irrigation rule for use at plant emergence. Editing fields allow the strategy
    to be described. See the text for a description of the actual rule. Once it is
    decided to irrigate, the amount must be decided. Two possibilities exist: either
    to apply a fixed amount, or one based on the soil water depletion. The latter
    is described either by the ratio of actual available water to the available water
    capacity, or by the amount of water necessary to recharge the soil. Both possibilities
    allow a partial refill of the soil. A complete irrigation strategy is therefore
    defined by a set of five elementary rules: (i) a rule to determine if irrigation
    is to be used to facilitate plant emergence (sowing rule), (ii) a rule to decide
    when to start the main irrigation period (starting rule), (iii) a rule to determine
    when to start a new irrigation (returning rule), (iv) a rule to decide when to
    stop irrigation (ending rule) and (v) a rule to delay irrigation due to weather
    conditions (delaying rule). 2.3. Testing the optimisation method P2P A three-step
    approach will be used to demonstrate the usefulness of the developed algorithm:
    1. We will simulate a basic strategy (BAS) (see Bergez et al., 2002). The general
    strategy is given in Table 1. This strategy is the result of discussions with
    the irrigation advisors and is therefore expected to be a reasonable approximation
    to current practices. The irrigation equipment used for the study allows a 3.5
    mm day−1 flow rate. No limit to the amount of available water and no flow rate
    restriction during summer (except those due to the equipment) are imposed. Table
    1. Description of the basic strategy (BAS) as put forward by irrigation advisors
    Operation Rules Sowing Sowing is between 20 April and 30 May as soon as the cumulative
    rainfall during the previous 3 days is less than 15 mm. Variety Céciliaa is sown
    at 80,000 plants ha−1. Fertilisation A single application of 200 kg N ha−1 is
    made at sowing. Harvest The crop is harvested when grain moisture content reaches
    20% or accumulated thermal units from sowing reach 2100 ATUb and if the cumulative
    rainfall during the previous 3 days is less than 15 mm. In any case, the crop
    must be harvested before 15 October. Irrigation Sowing rule: Irrigation to facilitate
    plant emergence (either because it is too dry or because a crust has been created
    by heavy rainfall on silty soil) is not taken into account. Irrigation to dissolve
    fertiliser is not taken into account. Starting rule: The main irrigation period
    starts from 650 ATU as soon as the soil water deficit reaches 60 mm. 20 mm is
    applied. Returning rule: 25 mm is applied every 8 days if no rainfall occurs.
    Ending rule: For the irrigation cycle following 1st September, if the soil water
    deficit is greater than 90 mm before the irrigation cycle starts, a last irrigation
    cycle is performed; otherwise irrigation is stopped. 20 mm is applied. Delaying
    rule: Precipitation delays irrigation. When the cumulative rainfall over the 5
    previous days is more than 10 mm, a delay of one day is applied for every 4 mm.
    The delay cannot exceed 7 consecutive days. a Cecilia is a late growing variety
    requiring 1045 ATU from sowing to flowering and 1990 ATU from sowing to maturity
    (35% grain humidity). b Accumulated thermal units (see text for explanation).
    2. A comparison between the systematic grid-search method (SGS) and the P2P algorithm
    will be carried out on two parameters of the basic strategy: the soil water deficit
    (D1) and the time (expressed as accumulated thermal units) to start the main irrigation
    campaign (T1). As before, the irrigation equipment used for the study allows a
    3.5 mm day−1 flow rate. No limit to the amount of available water and no flow
    rate restriction during summer (except those due to the equipment) are imposed.
    D1 will be searched in [0; 150] and T1 in [0; 1990]. 3. The basic irrigation strategy
    is extended as follows: “The main irrigation period starts from T1 as soon as
    the soil water deficit reaches D1. An amount I1 is applied. Once an irrigation
    cycle ends, a new cycle starts when the soil water deficit reaches D2. An amount
    I2 is applied. For the irrigation cycle following T3, if the soil water deficit
    is greater than D3 before this irrigation cycle starts, a last irrigation cycle
    is performed; otherwise the irrigation campaign ends. An amount I3 is applied”.
    P2P will be used to optimise the set of the eight parameters (Table 2) in a first
    step using the same hydraulic context as before (a 3.5 mm day−1 flow rate and
    no water limitation) and in a second step when varying the available flow rate:
    2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 mm day−1 and limiting the amount of water to 200 mm. Table 2.

    within which the optimum will be sought. Δmin is the criterion used to stop the
    division of the parameter.  All the simulations will be performed using the same
    soil and weather data. The soil for this study is a medium clay-silt, 0.8 m deep,
    with clay accumulation at depth, locally called “Boulbènes moyennes” (fluvisol).
    This type of soil is representative of a large area of the Midi-Pyrénées and has
    a 150 mm cumulative available water capacity. The climate used is from the weather
    records of Toulouse-Blagnac from 1949 to 1997. On average, July and August receive
    a total of 92 mm rainfall and the cumulative potential evapotranspiration (ET0)
    is 290 mm. The average climatic moisture deficit (ET0 minus rainfall) for this
    2-month period is around 200 mm. However, there is a large variation in rainfall
    during the two summer months as it ranges from 30 to 240 mm, underlining the unpredictable
    nature of rainfall in the area. Cumulative ET0 is less variable, ranging from
    235 to 372 mm. The objective function to be maximised is the expectation of the
    direct margin (i.e., the gross margin minus specific costs for a given activity,
    here irrigation) over all the years of weather recording. The direct margin regarding
    irrigation may be written as: (5) where J(θi,ξj) is the direct margin for climate
    ξj and the strategy θi, Y(θi,ξj) is the grain yield obtained under climate ξj
    and using the strategy θi, P is the selling price for maize, F is the operational
    costs for maize production, q(θi,ξj) is the amount of water used under climate
    ξj and using the strategy θi, p is the cost of irrigation water, n(θi,ξj) is the
    number of irrigation cycles performed under climate ξj and using the strategy
    θi and c is the cost of carrying out a new irrigation cycle. The average selling
    price for maize (grain) is assumed to be 106.71 Mg−1 in the Toulouse area. Operational
    costs (seed, weeding, fertiliser, insurance) are assumed to be 327.77 ha−1. The
    cost of irrigation water is assumed to be 0.76 mm−1 and that of setting up a new
    irrigation cycle is assumed to be 7.62 (labour). In this study, the parameters
    used to tune the P2P algorithm are as follows: (i) the simulations are based on
    the same N=49 climatic years as described previously; (ii) the pending cells are
    ranked depending on the expectation f of the objective function; (iii) Only the
    best 500 cells are kept; (iv) the number of points per cell is computed in order
    to reach a single point at the lowest depth of cell division; (v) pending cells
    are excluded (i.e., these cells will not be divided) if the expectation of the
    objective function for this cell is 10% less than that of the first cell in the
    best-cell sorted list. 2.4. Programming aspects The optimisation algorithm P2P
    was programmed as an independent library in C++ and linked directly to the biophysical
    and decisional model MODERATO. The algorithm was developed in such a way that
    it can be used for other models and is not specifically linked to the optimisation
    problem developed in this study. Two modifications to the main program were needed,
    being quite straightforward: (i) the first allows for a modification of the parameters
    of the strategy by sending them as an array to the main program by the optimisation
    module; (ii) the second is to calculate the objective function for each run and
    then to send it as an array to the optimisation module from the main program.
    3. Results 3.1. Results from the basic strategy The main results from the “basic”
    (BAS) strategy are given in Table 3. With this strategy, a 9.54 Mg ha−1 average
    grain yield is obtained, using, on average, 170 mm of irrigation water. The average
    margin is 506 . Drainage is low, 3 mm on average. In 29 cases out of 49, the soil
    water deficit is at least 60 mm (the soil water deficit threshold to start the
    irrigation campaign) when the accumulated thermal units reach 650 °C days (the
    accumulated thermal units to start the irrigation campaign). Therefore irrigation
    starts immediately at 650 °C day. Table 3. Results from the simulation using the

    problem, the optimal solution obtained with SGS is T1=520 °C day and D1=40 mm.
    For this set of parameters, the margin is 515 . Fig. 3A shows isomargin contours
    in the parameter space. It can be seen that a large area of the parameter space
    gives roughly the same margin (J(θ)>500 ). Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 3. (A) Isomargin graph when using SGS for each point of the grid when varying
    T1 and D1; (B) the 500 best strategies when using P2P. Margin difference for these
    points is less than 1%. With P2P applied to the same two-parameter problem (Fig.
    3B), the optimal set of parameters is obtained with T1 ranging between 443 and
    451 and D1 ranging between 37 and 42. For this set of parameters, the margin is
    515 . The second best set for P2P is T1 in the range 521–529 and D1 in the range
    37–42 but the margin is only 0.10 less. Actually, for the 500 best sets of parameters
    from P2P, there is a difference in margin of less than 1% (from 515 to 511 ha−1).
    This is in good agreement with the large area of similar results obtained using
    SGS and shown in Fig. 3A. P2P provides a range for each optimised parameter. We
    call strategy 2P the strategy obtained by using the middle of this range for each
    parameter. The simulation of 2P leads to an average grain yield of 9.87 Mg ha−1,
    i.e., 0.33 Mg ha−1 more than with the basic strategy (see Table 3, strategy 2P).
    On average 196 mm of water is used, which is 26 mm more than with the basic strategy.
    This is due to the fact that the main irrigation campaign starts earlier and ends
    at the same time. In half of the 49 years, irrigation starts before 29/06 for
    BAS and before 14/06 for 2P. The average margin is 515 . The same average drainage
    is obtained for both strategies. 3.3. Eight-parameter strategy Table 4 gives the
    ranges of the eight parameters that lead to the maximum expectation of the objective
    function. We call strategy 8P the strategy obtained by using the middle of the
    optimal range for each parameter. Following 8P, irrigation has to start a little
    later than with 2P, at 480 °C days and a 52 mm soil water deficit. The amount
    applied is then 49 mm. The next irrigation is due when the soil water deficit
    reaches 57 mm; 46 mm of irrigation is then applied. Finally, the last irrigation
    cycle is performed if at 1459 °C day the soil water deficit is more than 102 mm;
    49 mm irrigation is then applied. Table 4. Range of the eight parameters maximizing
    the expectation of the objective function calculated with P2P Parameter Unit Min

    I1 mm 47 50 I2 mm 44 47 I3 mm 47 50 See Table 2 for explanation of the parameters.
    As for the two-parameter-optimised strategy, there is a difference in margin of
    less than 1% between the 500 best sets of parameters. Within the 100 best sets,
    among all parameters, T1 is the most variable as it ranges from 405 to 545 °C
    days. The others vary much less. This is analogous to the results for the two-parameter
    strategy. As shown in Fig. 3A, the margin is roughly the same for a large range
    of T1 values. The simulation of the strategy 8P leads to a 9.52 Mg ha−1 grain
    yield (Table 3, strategy 8P). This is slightly less than with 2P (−0.35 Mg ha−1),
    but the margin is increased: +19 ha−1. Less water is used (166 vs 196 mm). A large
    amount of irrigation is applied at each run (46 mm). As a consequence, each irrigation
    cycle lasts longer and fewer cycles are needed (3.7 vs 7.1 for BAS). Water use
    efficiency (mg of grain yield produced per mm of irrigation water) has increased.
    Fig. 4 shows the cumulative frequencies for grain yield, margin, starting and
    ending dates obtained for the 49-year climatic series and using the BAS, 2P and
    8P strategies. There is a 50% chance to exceed 9.56 Mg ha−1 with BAS, 10.08 Mg
    ha−1 with 2P and 9.67 Mg ha−1 with 8P (Fig. 4A). Regarding the margin, and keeping
    the same 50% probability, the figures are 498, 528 and 538 ha−1, respectively,
    for BAS, 2P and 8P (Fig. 4B). Actually, 2P gives a better chance to reach a higher
    grain yield but leads to an earlier start (Fig. 4C) and a later end of irrigation
    (Fig. 4D) than 8P. As a result, margin is decreased due to a higher amount of
    irrigation. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Cumulative frequency for

    and eight-parameter optimised strategy (circles). (A) Grain yield; (B) margin;
    (C) starting date of irrigation and (D) ending date of irrigation. P2P performed
    similarly to SGS for the two-parameter problem in terms of results and run time.
    However, when the number of parameters to be optimised increases, SGS takes much
    longer to run. This is part of the well-known curse of dimensionality. P2P allows
    a quicker convergence to the optimal set of parameters. In our example, the 8P
    strategy was obtained after roughly 1.6 × 106 simulations (a simulation being
    a call to the bio-decisional model, i.e., a run for one climate and one set of
    parameters). On our PC configuration, we run around 25 simulations per second.
    So, an optimisation required around 14 h. With SGS, it would have been necessary
    to complete the total map of the parameter space, to run more than 6 × 1011 simulations
    (actually more than 700 years of computation). The use of P2P to analyse the change
    in flow rate gives also interesting results (Fig. 5). These figures are radar
    plots showing the variability of the eight estimated parameters. Each axis represents
    one of the eight parameters. All the axes have been normalised to have a [0;1]
    range. The values in square brackets to the right of the parameter name indicate
    the range for this axis. Regarding the rule to begin irrigating, if the flow rate
    is low (Fig. 5A), irrigation has to start slightly earlier (T1), at a lower soil
    water deficit (D1). For higher flow rates (Figs. 5B and C), irrigation can wait
    as it is easy to rapidly apply the amount required. A larger amount (I1) is applied
    using a higher flow rate. Regarding the returning rule, the higher flow rate allows
    waiting until a higher soil water deficit is reached (D2), but the same amount
    is applied (I2). The decision to stop irrigation (T3) is the latest at the lowest
    flow rate. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Radar plots showing the
    eight optimised parameters for three different flow rates: (A) 2.5 mm day−1, (B)

    given in square brackets. The meaning of the different parameters is given in
    Table 2. 4. Discussion Starting from a basic strategy as proposed by advisors
    in the field, the use of P2P to parameterise the decision rules improved the direct
    margin. From an average 506 ha−1 using strategy BAS, we obtained 534 ha−1 with
    strategy 8P. Irrigation has to start and finish earlier and more water must be
    applied. Although the grain yield was slightly decreased, the margin was increased
    because of fewer irrigation cycles. The cost of an irrigation cycle (labour, energy,
    etc.) is thus important in the search for an optimal strategy: it pays to sacrifice
    some yield if the number of irrigations can be reduced. This has also been shown
    by other authors and the idea has been incorporated into new irrigation schedules
    (Kirda and Kanber, 1999). For example, Norwood and Dumier (2002) found that reducing
    the quantity of water, even if there is a slight fall in the grain yield, gives
    more profit and better water use efficiency. Strategy 8P shows that irrigation
    should start in mid-June. However, from discussions with irrigation advisors and
    farmers (Clavé, 2001; Rouffaud, 2001), it seems quite difficult to start that
    early. Other constraints than those specified in the decisional model have to
    be taken into account (fertilisation, setting up pipes, etc.). Due to technical
    problems with equipment, farmers usually start in early to mid-July. Using a model
    (biophysical and decisional) thus allows constraints and shortcomings of the model
    or our knowledge to be revealed. The P2P algorithm was used in three specific
    hydraulic contexts for one set of soil and climatic conditions. The results agree
    well with what was already known by irrigation experts: when the flow rate is
    small, it is worth starting earlier and applying less water. There is much interest
    in testing different constraints and soil and weather scenarios to provide advice.
    However, one of the difficulties is to represent the results in an understandable
    way. In this paper we used a radar plot to represent the strategy. Other forms
    of representation should be developed in consultation with advisors if we want
    these results from research be used by advisors and farmers (Cox, 1996; Walker,
    2002). As mentioned by Bergez et al. (2002), a calculated optimal strategy depends
    on four factors: (i) the biophysical model used to describe the system behaviour
    (i.e., equation and parameters), (ii) the decisional model and the variables used
    to trigger the decision, (iii) soil and weather and (iv) the constraints. Adaptation
    to varying soil and constraints is part of the work of the advisors. Helping them
    to provide proper strategies is part of the research work and as stated before,
    finding ways of presenting the results is part of this work. The first two points
    are much more difficult to work with. By definition a model is an imperfect representation
    of reality (Whisler et al., 1986; Boote et al., 1996). When searching the parameter
    space to find the optimal set of parameters, one may be led to simulate rather
    extreme soil and plant conditions. It is therefore important that the biophysical
    model be robust (fairly accurate outside the proper limits of the model). It must
    also be sensitive (able to predict a small change in the functioning processes
    when a technical action is modified). For example, regarding maize irrigation,
    experiments show that a single irrigation at tasselling can increase yield by
    29%. Additional irrigations during the vegetative and grain filling stages increased
    yield an additional 11% and 13%, respectively (Norwood, 2000). Even if the exact
    values are not obtained when simulating irrigation strategies, it is important
    that an increase of this order of magnitude be reached when using the model. It
    is therefore important to compare knowledge and model estimates. In order to use
    P2P, it is necessary to describe the parameterised strategy as a set of decision
    rules. This task is far from obvious and can only be carried out through a collaborative
    work with experts and advisors. Nevertheless, optimising strategies without this
    initial knowledge is even more complex (Bergez et al., 2001b). In this paper,
    the P2P algorithm was used to calculate optimal strategies for the direct margin
    criterion. Such computed optimised strategies must be understood as a guide to
    possible improvement rather than an optimal strategy to be used as is. For example,
    it is quite rare that a farmer has only maize. Other productions (animal) and
    crops may interfere in terms of equipment or working schedule. Environmental aspects
    must also be considered. Acknowledgments The authors thank the irrigation advisors
    for their help in describing the “basic” strategy and for their comments on MODERATO.

    highly depends upon the adopted management, i.e., when those deficits are applied

    \ food demand and a growing human population, agriculture is the primary food\
    \ supplier and the most \nprominent labor user. It is also one of the essential\
    \ areas in a country's economy, according to gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) [1],\
    \ [2]. Water availability is an essential factor in optimizing the growth of crops\
    \ so that water \nscarcity can threaten food security. This reason makes water\
    \ conservation an essential factor in overcoming water \nshortages while increasing\
    \ yields. [3, 4]. Moreover, the development of agricultural technology and more\
    \ efficient \nagricultural management can produce productive crops and quality\
    \ harvests through greenhouse technology. \nDeveloping greenhouses for agriculture\
    \ can increase crop yields and improve water use efficiency [5].  \nAround 3.5%\
    \ of the world's agricultural land uses greenhouse and hydroponic systems to conserve\
    \ water use and \nother benefits such as crop protection and quality yields. A\
    \ greenhouse is a building with a wooden or metal \nfoundation covered with nets\
    \ or transparent material. Since 1960 the greenhouse has evolved from a building\
    \ that \nonly protects plants into a system for studying plant growth in a controlled\
    \ environment [6, 7]. Changes in \nagricultural land usage, lower irrigation water\
    \ output in primary, secondary, and tertiary canals, and global \nmicroclimate\
    \ changes contribute to the rising use of greenhouses in world agriculture [8].\
    \  \nAgricultural ecosystems (soil, nutrients, temperature, humidity, sunlight,\
    \ wind, and air composition) can be adapted \nto the needs of the plants planted\
    \ in greenhouses to extend productive plant life, change planting seasons, \n\
    increase crop yields and improve harvest quality. [9, 10]. Moving crops from their\
    \ natural environment to \ngreenhouses protect plants from weather and microclimate\
    \ uncertainties. On the downside, a greenhouse is a \nplace that can store solar\
    \ heat and requires resources to manage the microclimate according to plant needs,\
    \ \nespecially in countries with tropical climates. [4, 11]. Crop growth problems\
    \ arise in agriculture that depends on rain \nand drought; runoff and erosion\
    \ problems also arise during heavy rains. Water control is needed to meet crop\
    \ \nwater needs while conserving water [12]. The water control system functioned\
    \ as a regulator for water flow \naccording to the plant's needs in its growth\
    \ phase [13, 14]. \nConventional irrigation systems use a uniform amount of water\
    \ to fields from one corner to another during their \ngrowth period regardless\
    \ of the type of plant and its water needs. The result is water-wasting, where\
    \ one side of \nthe land has sufficient water, while the other can have excess\
    \ or lack of water [15]. Therefore, a control system \nknown as an intelligent\
    \ irrigation system is needed to support plants' water needs while saving water.\
    \ The way the \nsystem works, in general, is to adapt to the type of plant and\
    \ then automatically calculate the water needs of the \n657 \n \nIrfan Ardiansah,\

    \ supply based on the plant growth phase [16]. Intelligent irrigation systems\
    \ are suitable for \nuse in a greenhouse because a greenhouse has an enclosed\
    \ structure to reduce or eliminate parameters affecting \nplant growth, such as\
    \ seasons, rainfall, climate change, plant pests and diseases, and environmental\
    \ changes [17, \n18]. \nIntelligent irrigation systems are part of precision agriculture,\
    \ also known as smart farming, which integrates \ninformation technology, communication\
    \ technology, and control technology to automate various agricultural \nactivities\
    \ that humans initially did. With an intelligent irrigation system, the irrigation\
    \ process can run optimally in \nmanaging water to meet the needs of plants [19].\
    \ Intelligent irrigation systems can manage water needs based on \nvarious parameters\
    \ such as microclimate conditions, weather, sunlight, water quality such as acidity\
    \ (pH), turbidity \n(TDS), and electrical conductivity (EC), along with plant\
    \ growth phases through the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. \nAn intelligent\
    \ irrigation system can improve irrigation decisions to achieve water savings\
    \ and increased yields [20–\n22]. \nThe intelligent irrigation system is one of\
    \ the best systems in managing and saving water while maximizing \nharvests; water\
    \ is distributed evenly to each plant according to its needs and minimizes wasted\
    \ water [23]. This \nsystem can also mix nutrients and water and help deliver\
    \ them directly to the root zone, ensuring it is always in \noptimal moist conditions,\
    \ minimizing surface runoff, preventing root rot, and eliminating percolation.\
    \ The advantage \nis increased crop productivity, and better harvest quality also\
    \ ensures optimal water efficiency. Nevertheless, good \nintegration between IoT\
    \ devices, monitoring, control, and data acquisition can be done automatically\
    \ with minimum \nintervention to get an optimal and efficient, intelligent irrigation\
    \ system [24, 25]. \nIn the intelligent irrigation system, the controller can\
    \ process input data, present information, and manage irrigation \nbased on greenhouse\
    \ conditions, especially crop conditions to prevent water deficit. Nevertheless,\
    \ in addition to \nsystem automation, it is necessary to present current and past\
    \ system conditions to users, both plant responses to \nthe system and vice versa.\
    \ This method ensures that water management runs smoothly, and users can study\
    \ \nhistorical data as a reference for the next planting period and ensure optimal\
    \ farming [26–29]. This process \nrequires real-time monitoring, sophisticated\
    \ control systems, and precise instruments. The difference between a \nmonitoring\
    \ system and a control system is that the control system regulates the hardware\
    \ according to conditional \nconstraints. The control system manages the hardware\
    \ and software by defining the output and input parameters \nprecisely. The input\
    \ is microclimate parameters, plant properties, weather conditions, water quality,\
    \ and other \nsensors collect helpful information [30–33]. \nMany articles published\
    \ on IoT focus on agriculture, as discussed by [30, 34]. IoT is one of the best\
    \ inventions of \nthe 21st century in agriculture. In addition, review articles\
    \  [21], [35] discuss IoT opportunities in agriculture or \nintelligent farming\
    \ and how the connection between IoT, data mining, data science, and machine learning\
    \ \nsustainability supports agriculture. [36] describes the automation model for\
    \ monitoring and controlling the \nagricultural sector and predicting information\
    \ based on past data. There are currently no review studies that explore \nthe\
    \ monitoring and control strategy of intelligent irrigation systems in greenhouses,\
    \ necessitating the formation of \nintelligent irrigation system review articles\
    \ that focus on integrating various monitoring and control materials. As a \n\
    result, this study will cover intelligent irrigation system monitoring and control\
    \ mechanisms and their relevance to \ngreenhouses and irrigation. \nThis study\
    \ aims to classify the results of previous research, identify the results, and\
    \ bridge them with future trends \nto identify future research. Chapter 2 discusses\
    \ research methodology, and Chapter 3 discusses various irrigation \nmethods used\
    \ by intelligent irrigation systems. In contrast, Chapter 4 discusses monitoring\
    \ and controlling \nstrategies for IoT and then continues to Chapter 5, discussing\
    \ the integration of artificial intelligence. The last \nchapter discusses future\
    \ directions and trends in intelligent irrigation. \n2 REVIEW METHODOLOGY \nThe\
    \ methodology applied in selecting published literature with the theme of intelligent\
    \ farming focuses on the topic \nof intelligent irrigation systems and their control\
    \ systems by using an extensive search on several online libraries of \nmultidisciplinary\
    \ journals as Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Springer, MDPI, and IOP, as well\
    \ as online \nengineering libraries as Agricola and IEEE Xplore. This technique\
    \ produces many research articles relevant to \nintelligent farming and irrigation\
    \ systems and their relationship to monitoring and control. That is why it is\
    \ essential \nto check the reputation of the publisher's journal before using\
    \ the article through the SCOPUS and ScimagoJR \nwebsites. This review's selection\
    \ of relevant articles emphasizes the latest journal articles in the last eleven\
    \ years \n(2011 - 2021); it can be seen in Figure 1a that in 2020 there was a\
    \ surge in articles discussing monitoring, control, \nand artificial intelligence\
    \ in agriculture. Other conditions are that all articles must be published in\
    \ SCOPUS indexed \njournals and conference proceedings. As shown in Figure 1b,\
    \ which shows the percentage of articles indexed by \nSCOPUS with articles with\
    \ Quartile 1 dominating research in this field means that the research is internationally\
    \ \nrecognized and has the best quality content. All articles used are smart farming,\
    \ intelligent irrigation system, and \nprecision agriculture. Articles are carefully\
    \ selected by reading and summarizing them to ensure continuity of ideas.  \n\

    \ \npositions \n3 TYPES OF IRRIGATION \nPlants need water at regular intervals\
    \ to grow and develop; in agriculture, this watering technique is called \nirrigation.\
    \ Irrigation has two methods, namely conventional and modern. Conventional agriculture\
    \ usually uses rain \nand surface irrigation to irrigate its land [37, 38]. The\
    \ problem is how to predict rain accurately, and surface \nirrigation does not\
    \ continuously irrigate the entire land with a uniform discharge. Surface irrigation,\
    \ classified as \nconventional irrigation, works by distributing water from springs\
    \ or rivers to the ground surface following gravity; \nmonitoring is done manually\
    \ by looking at the water level without IoT and automation [37].  \nDeveloping\
    \ countries generally use surface irrigation, for example, Indonesia. It uses\
    \ it to irrigate paddy fields by \nconstructing furrows that connect water sources\
    \ with rice fields and irrigate them. However, this method requires a \nlevel\
    \ ground surface to ensure adequate water distribution [39]. On the other hand,\
    \ surface irrigation results in high \nlevels of water loss due to evaporation,\
    \ uncontrolled water discharge, and percolation, which can reduce soil \nnutrient\
    \ levels resulting in sub-optimal crop yields [37]. There are two commonly used\
    \ surface irrigations: (1) \nFurrow irrigation is interpreted as water flowing\
    \ through small furrows made on the land slope. Water enters the soil \nfrom the\
    \ bottom and sides of the furrow and moves laterally and downwards to moisten\
    \ the soil and simultaneously \ncarry dissolved salts, fertilizers, and herbicides\
    \ [40]. Good tillage with uniform slopes can give better results from \nthis method.\
    \ Furrow irrigation is suitable for various soils, slopes, and crops especially\
    \ row crops. Crops that will be \ndamaged if water covers the stems or crowns\
    \ should use furrow irrigation [40, 41]. Furrow irrigation is also suitable \n\
    for tree crops. In the early stages of tree planting, using one furrow beside\
    \ the tree row may be sufficient, but as the \ntree grows, creating two or more\
    \ new furrows is necessary to provide sufficient water [42]. (2) Flooding Irrigation\
    \ is \nan irrigation method commonly used to provide water in lowland rice cultivation\
    \ and generally, water carried out \ncontinuously. Flooding is carried out continuously\
    \ at the same height throughout plant growth, starting from planting \nuntil several\
    \ days before harvest [43]. The use of flooding irrigation depends on sufficient\
    \ water to flood the land \nsurface with 10 cm of water. The disadvantage is inhibiting\
    \ plant growth and water wastage [44]. Because flooding \nirrigation uses water\
    \ excessively, flooding irrigation evolved into intermittent irrigation by flooding\
    \ and drying the \nland alternately from planting season until one week before\
    \ the flowering. The water level is maintained at 3 to 5 \ncm during flowering.\
    \ Giving water this way can reduce water usage up to 30 percent without reducing\
    \ crop yields \n[43–45] \n Modern irrigation offers uniform discharge for each\
    \ plant, including nutrients and saving water, mainly when \nplanting is carried\
    \ out in a greenhouse, making it easier to monitor water quantity and quality\
    \ and regulate water \nsupply schedules [46, 47]. The amount of water delivered\
    \ is determined by the plant's demands, irrigation method, \nand type of growing\
    \ medium. The choice of irrigation method influences the type of nutrients, the\
    \ number of \nnutrients, the rate of infiltration, evaporation, water absorption,\
    \ and drainage [12]. \nModern irrigation uses less water and is more efficient\
    \ than conventional irrigation, and this method saves more \nenergy and water.\
    \ It is an effective method for use in areas where water is scarce or has irregular\
    \ rains. This \nmethod allows farmers to cultivate crops consistently, creating\
    \ a reliable food supply [3, 11]. Modern irrigation relies \non water from wells,\
    \ lakes, and reservoirs stored in water tanks and then irrigates plants using\
    \ gravity or water \npumps [12]. The method of giving water is even more specific,\
    \ such as spraying water through a sprinkler or \ndripping water through an emitter\
    \ onto plants. [39] developed an automatic irrigation data communication system\

    \ Radio Service (GPRS) and Zigbee module and built a microprocessor-based gateway\
    \ \nto better control water discharge with water efficiency than conventional\
    \ irrigation systems, with the difference \nbetween conventional and modern irrigation\
    \ can be seen in Figure 2. \n \nFig 2. Types of irrigation \n3.1 \nSprinkler Irrigation\
    \ \nFarmers use sprinkler irrigation to mimic precipitation patterns. They used\
    \ small sprinkler nozzles connected to an \nextensive piping system to ensure\
    \ comprehensive irrigation coverage and used pumps to spray high-pressure \nwater\
    \ onto the air [48]. The advantage of sprinkler is that it minimizes runoff, is\
    \ suitable for all types of soil, and has \na water-saving rate of between 30\
    \ - 50%. Sprinkles can be mixed with fertilizer solutions and used in close \n\
    cropping and high plant population [28]. However, this method has high operating\
    \ costs for cleaning sprinkler \nnozzles and maintaining high-pressure pumps and\
    \ pipes. In addition, sprinkler irrigation is unsuitable for use in \nwindy areas\
    \ because wind gusts and evapotranspiration cause high water loss rates. Moreover,\
    \ regular \nmaintenance of the pipes and their connections to avoid leaks or clogs\
    \ can reduce the water spray pressure, \nreducing water distribution to the plants\
    \ [37, 48]. \n3.2 \nDrip Irrigation \nIn drip irrigation, the water source moistens\
    \ the soil or planting media through the holes in the pipes and flows \nthrough\
    \ a hose connected to the emitter with low pressure. The focus of water droplets\
    \ is a small part of the soil or \ngrowing medium that covers the root zone by\
    \ adjusting it to get water droplets [49]. Drip irrigation is the most \nefficient\
    \ irrigation because it can distribute water and nutrients simultaneously to the\
    \ root zone, which results in \nbetter nutrient uptake. Due to the circulation\
    \ of water in the roots through the capillary principle, the pores of the \nsoil\
    \ or planting medium remain dry so that air circulation is maintained and soil\
    \ moisture is at field capacity. \nProduces a root zone capable of breathing more\
    \ intensely during its growth cycle [25, 37, 50]. \nDrip irrigation uses dripping\
    \ water delivered at a rate of between 2 - 20 liters per hour. The application\
    \ of this \nmethod is to place an emitter on each plant. It is suitable for use\
    \ on vegetables and fruit, but farmers usually only \nconsider high-value plants\
    \ because the investment value is relatively high [37, 49]. This method supports\
    \ various \ntypes of soil by adjusting the speed of water application. Hefty porous\
    \ sandy soils need a fast drip-rate; conversely, \nclay soil needs a slow drip\
    \ rate to avoid water logging and runoff [25, 37]. \n4 MONITORING AND CONTROLLING\
    \ STRATEGIES \nA total of 30 papers were used to examine the irrigation system's\
    \ monitoring and control method. These \npublications provide ways for regulating\
    \ irrigation by employing sensors to measure changes in microclimate, water \n\
    quality, and soil moisture values. The paper's distribution is represented in\
    \ Figure 3 below. \nAn effective and efficient monitoring system is needed to\
    \ collect different plant growth parameters. Monitoring in an \nintelligent irrigation\
    \ system involves collecting data representing the latest microclimate data and\
    \ water and soil \nconditions around the irrigation area through a microcontroller\
    \ connected to the IoT [51], shown in Figure 4. The \ndevelopment of real-time\
    \ monitoring devices was made possible due to the rapid development of microcontrollers\
    \ \nand sensors, low-cost hardware (Arduino UNO, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi), and fast\
    \ internet, which enhanced the \nperformance of monitoring and control systems\
    \ [17, 52]. There are two types of internet connections: wired and \nwireless;\
    \ Wired connections make the internet connection stable, but with fixed hardware\
    \ location. Wireless \nconnection makes flexible hardware placement but has signal\
    \ interference [53]. \n \n660 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An overview of IOT based\

    \ \n \n \n \nFig 3. Distribution of papers on monitoring and controlling strategies\
    \ \n \nFig 4. Block diagram of IoT based Smart Farming \nAll devices and sensors\
    \ are connected directly to the server via a cabling system in a wired connection\
    \ case. This \nsystem is only effective when a few parameters are measured and\
    \ use a small greenhouse; it is crucial because \nthe more connected devices,\
    \ the more cables are used. So, the wired greenhouse system is not suitable for\
    \ large \nor commercial greenhouses. The advantage is that data transactions are\
    \ safe and have minimal interference [51, \n53, 54]. WSN is the latest technology\
    \ in intelligent farming that can be expanded and scaled up without modifying\
    \ \nthe greenhouse infrastructure. Its wireless form makes it easy to receive\
    \ and transmit data between nodes using \nlow-power frequencies. Unfortunately,\
    \ interference and signal loss are common problems because of the high \nfrequency\
    \ in the air. However, the increase in greenhouse size, the number of parameters,\
    \ sensors variety, node \nsize, and devices distant is not a problem because an\
    \ additional WSN only needs to be attached to an existing \nnetwork. Another advantage\
    \ is Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) technology, wirelessly connected sensor nodes\
    \ \nnetwork to sense and send various data, and extensible [36, 54, 55]. \nThe\
    \ implementation of WSN in agriculture itself is extensive, with sensors, RFID,\
    \ cameras, drones, and cloud \nservices connected seamlessly for data acquisition\
    \ and transmission. Cloud computing serves data collection and \nanalysis to generate\
    \ visualizations, decision support, and commands; system users (farmers or researchers)\
    \ can \nthen access data remotely via their devices to gain real-time insights\
    \ [19, 56]. Thus, monitoring and controlling the \nintelligent irrigation system\
    \ can be effective, efficient, convenient, and optimal yields. [55] proposed the\
    \ approach \nwith WSN and gateway node to collect soil moisture values in plants\
    \ by taking soil and cultivated plants images. \nThe challenges in building a\
    \ system that can accommodate these two technologies are sensor coverage, \ncommunication\
    \ between devices, computational process efficiency, and electricity usage. [57]\

    \ a control system can manipulate several irrigation parameters, like air circulation,\
    \ air temperature, \nrelative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation [58–60].\
    \ A technology that can analyze the surface temperature \nof agricultural land\
    \ without touching it using thermal imaging was proposed by [61] to determine\
    \ which areas of \nland are in dire need of water because the non-uniformity of\
    \ soil moisture can inhibit spinach growth. Studies by \n[56, 62–64] also state\
    \ that it is possible to use thermal imaging for nurseries, forecasting crop yields,\
    \ pest and \ndisease disturbances, maintenance of agricultural machinery, and\
    \ irrigation scheduling. \n4.1 \nMicroclimate based  \nMonitoring and controlling\
    \ the microclimate in the greenhouse is a critical factor to account for water\
    \ loss due to \nevaporation. Air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation,\
    \ and wind speed need precision measurements to \nmeet crop water requirements\
    \ [30, 65]. The Raspberry Pi, various Arduino models, connected to WSN, and cloud\
    \ \nservers are popular hardware. WSN implementation is an efficient way to interconnect\
    \ various sensors placed far \napart in the greenhouse. The system performs accurate\
    \ system monitoring, collects data, and presents charts, and \ncontrol devices\
    \ are activated, referring to predefined threshold values compared with real-time\
    \ data [30, 36, 66]. \n[59] presented a technique for evaluating microclimate\
    \ parameters in two tropical greenhouses before planting \ntomatoes using LoRa\
    \ wireless and IoT sensors. The comfort ratio model (CftM) and scenario analysis\
    \ show that \nenvironmental conditions can adapt to the growth phase of tomato\
    \ plants. The microclimate before and during \nplanting was analyzed using the\
    \ Simulink app. Also, a study by [67] showed that a microclimate parameter \n\
    measurement device in a greenhouse could yield comprehensive data for temperature,\
    \ humidity, CO2 levels, \nlighting levels, soil moisture, acidity, irrigation\
    \ water conductivity, and airflow velocity. In winter, the greenhouse \nbehavior\
    \ was studied by [68] using fuzzy logic control (FLC) due to uncertainty in the\
    \ greenhouse environment. The \nfuzzy set was developed based on experts in greenhouse\
    \ thermal behavior. Fuzzy control manages decisions \nbased on weather forecasts\
    \ and user interactions. [54] also took a similar approach to measure leaf temperature,\
    \ \nair temperature, and soil moisture using three connected sensors to assess\
    \ the level of microclimate in a \ngreenhouse and use Zigbee to transmit sensor\
    \ data. \nControlling the microclimate in the greenhouse by using fan ventilation\
    \ and fan-pad ventilation can also be an \noption. This forced ventilation can\
    \ prevent plants from overheating even if the greenhouse does not use an \nevaporative\
    \ cooling system. Greenhouses can produce good harvests in the spring, and the\
    \ data show a \nrelationship between the greenhouse microclimate and water uptake\
    \ that minimizes drainage [69]. [70] built a \nmonitoring system using an open-source\
    \ platform to collect microclimate variables (air temperature, humidity, soil\
    \ \ntemperature, and soil moisture). Communication between devices uses Bluetooth\
    \ and obtain electricity supply \nthrough solar panels. [71] has proposed improvements\
    \ to the greenhouse IoT-based system by adding color \nspectrum monitoring using\
    \ a camera system to get photos of the plant canopies translated into color (RGB,\
    \ HSL, \nand brightness), plant texture, thermal (plant temperature), and plant\
    \ morphology. The system works with NFT to \nirrigate lettuce plants in the greenhouse,\
    \ automatically recording data and identifying plant stress levels. \n4.2 \nWater\
    \ Quality-based \nWater quality safety is a challenge in the 21st century because\
    \ of the many pollutants, which are predominantly \nartificial such as environmental\
    \ damage, packaging waste, or chemical waste. Overexploitation of natural \nresources,\
    \ rapid industrial development, and agricultural expansion are the leading causes\
    \ of the problem. [72]. \nWater quality is affected by direct and indirect sources\
    \ of pollution such as sewage, factory waste, agricultural and \nurban runoff.\
    \ The need for human involvement in water quality management is essential [73,\
    \ 74]. Water quality \nmanagement is a way to regularly collect water quality\
    \ information in a location to find out its current condition. \nWater quality\
    \ management aims to measure water quality variables such as microbial content\
    \ physical and \nchemical properties, provide an early warning system and provide\
    \ decision support for further treatment [75, 76]. \nWSN and IoT are inevitable\
    \ to manage variables over a wide area for larger areas such as lakes or oceans.\
    \ \n[75] has proposed a system that assesses irrigation water quality with IoT\
    \ by detecting potential hydrogen (pH), \nelectrical conductivity (EC), turbidity,\
    \ and salinity in real-time using different sensors to maintain plant health status.\
    \ \nAlso, [77] undertook a study to build a continuous water quality monitoring\
    \ system using open-source hardware \nand low-cost sensors. Preliminary results\
    \ show that the device can produce accurate results at a lower cost than \nexisting\
    \ technologies with proper calibration. \n4.3 \nSoil Moisture-based \nFarmers\
    \ need to consider soil conditions because moist soil means the plant still has\
    \ enough water for growth [11]. \nMonitoring soil moisture content becomes vital\
    \ as the basis for irrigation scheduling. Raspberry Pi and Arduino \nUNO have\
    \ commonly used devices in developing low-cost IoT-based soil moisture management\
    \ interfaced using \nvarious sensors [30, 60, 75]. The sensor used is a capacitive\
    \ type and transmits electricity without conduction; it \ncan measure soil moisture\
    \ changes by planting them into the soil and measuring its volumetric water content.\
    \ The \nTime Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensor is a more precise option for measuring\
    \ soil moisture, consisting of two \nmetal rods embedded at the depth at which\
    \ the humidity is to be measured. Works by sending pulses to the soil \nand then\
    \ calculating the response of the soil as soil moisture content. Due to its good\
    \ quality in measuring soil \nmoisture, this TDR sensor is quite expensive to\
    \ use in large-scale greenhouses [78, 79]. \n662 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An\

    \ trends \nand challenges \n \nJournal of Applied Engineering Science - Vol.20,\
    \ No 3, 2022 - www.engineeringscience.rs \n \n \n[80] proposed a soil moisture\
    \ control system for measuring water content in soil at different soil depths,\
    \ soil types, \nand air temperatures using various sensors integrated with Arduino\
    \ UNO. The ESP8266 wireless module is then \nlinked to the Arduino to upload data\
    \ to the cloud server. A similar study by [81] succeeded in developing an IoT-\n\
    based field control system integrated with cloud-based data monitoring and analysis.\
    \ The analysis results help \npredict water consumption for better crop yields.\
    \ [82] approach to controlling soil moisture uses wireless technology \nutilizing\
    \ GSM networks and push notifications to automate water supply for plants. A system\
    \ proposed by [83] \npresents an Android application-based humidity monitoring\
    \ method, where an Arduino interface sensor connected \nto Wi-Fi sends state data\
    \ to a smartphone. Another monitoring approach is carried out by [60] using IoT\
    \ and soil \nnutrient sensors to detect nutrient adequacy for plants. The decision\
    \ support system then receives the data \nparameters and processes them as a farming\
    \ decision. \n[84] implemented a user-friendly system, representing the soil moisture\
    \ level with colors. These colors have helped \nfarmers visually identify and\
    \ manage soil moisture content without understanding the values displayed. Likewise,\
    \ \n[85] proposed a soil nutrient control system that can manage the concentration\
    \ of nutrients in the soil by planting \nsensors in the soil to map nutrient variability.\
    \ Also, [86] developed an innovative device that uses a camera-\nintegrated drone\
    \ for field mapping. Images are analyzed to generate soil moisture and nutrient\
    \ values and use \nthem for irrigation planning and scheduling. \n5 ARTIFICIAL\
    \ INTELLIGENCE IN IRRIGATION SYSTEM \nArtificial intelligence in intelligent irrigation\

    \ models that can take \ndecisions automatically in response to changes in field\
    \ conditions. The distribution of articles based on the theme \nof artificial\
    \ intelligence is shown in Figure 5 below. \n \nFig 5. Distribution of papers\
    \ on artificial intelligence in irrigation system \nArtificial intelligence (AI)\
    \ is a branch of science concerned with creating machines that can understand\
    \ and act in \nthe same way as humans. Machine learning is a burgeoning sub-domain\
    \ of AI that explores patterns in large \namounts of data [58, 87]. The popularity\
    \ of machine learning is due to more and more data generated by various \napplications\
    \ and IoT. The system can generate helpful information for making decisions or\
    \ becoming input to other \nsystems by studying data patterns. The need for agricultural\
    \ products is directly proportional to the increase in the \nearth's population,\
    \ so agroindustry and innovative agriculture technology get the spotlight in the\
    \ industrial revolution \n4.0 [16, 46].  \nAI has the potential to solve nonlinear,\
    \ multiparameter, and time-varying problems in managing intelligent irrigation\
    \ \nsystems. By applying AI algorithms to specific problem areas, the system tries\
    \ to imitate human logic, thought \nprocesses, and decision making through the\
    \ application of Fuzzy Logic, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest \nNeighbor\
    \ (kNN), Decision Tree and Random Forest by using past data to feed AI and provides\
    \ new knowledge to \nthe system [58, 61]. [88] has researched by applying different\
    \ regression and machine learning algorithms to \nseveral sensor datasets to develop\
    \ weekly irrigation plan predictions. \nA study implementing an intelligent irrigation\
    \ system shows many advantages, such as minimizing soil stress to \nchanging microclimate\
    \ conditions, efficient water use, and reducing human interaction. This solar\
    \ panel-powered \nsystem has a Sensor Layer, Central Layer, and Valve Layer running\
    \ together. The function of the Central Layer is \nto control the process that\
    \ produces input (sensor layer detects moisture content) and output (valve layer\
    \ opens to \nprovide water). The system also enables fertilizers and pesticides\
    \ by calibrating other sensors according to the \nrequired input [89]. \n5.1 \n\

    \ where the decision support system (DSS) comes in [76, 90]. DSS \nhas a framework\
    \ that can represent complex systems with an efficient and robust approach that\
    \ is easy to \nunderstand generates additional information and new perspectives\
    \ to improve the quality of irrigation management. \nDSS is an information system\
    \ that analyzes data and represents it to make decisions quickly. The primary\
    \ purpose \nof DSS is to support and improve decision-making [28, 76]. Figure\
    \ 6 shows a DSS logic diagram that consists of \nfour connected components: Database,\
    \ model base, knowledge base, and user interface. \n \nFig 6. Block diagram of\
    \ Decision Support System \nThe Database in irrigation DSS collects and manages\
    \ air temperature, relative humidity, crop water requirements, \nirrigation records,\
    \ and solar radiation. The knowledge base has three parts: fact base, rule base,\
    \ and inference \nengine used to analyze data, solve uncertain problems and draw\
    \ conclusions. The model base creates optimization \nmodels, integrates numerous\
    \ decision models, analyzes them to create crop water simulations, and offers\
    \ farmers \nirrigation scheduling. [71, 76]. \nDeveloping and utilizing a decision\
    \ support system in irrigation management is essential for scheduling water \n\
    delivery based on crop needs. The main problem is how moist the soil is and how\
    \ much water the plants need \nbased on the type of plant, planting technique,\
    \ availability of water, amount of fertilizer applied, microclimate \nconditions,\
    \ and stage of plant development [91]. With DSS, farmers can manage their farms\
    \ daily using plant \ndatabases and water supply strategies to perform irrigation\
    \ calculations and fertilization adjustments to obtain \noptimal yields. There\
    \ are times when a system has a crop suggestion feature that advises farmers to\
    \ plant a crop \nthat yields the highest profit under certain constraints [92].\
    \ \nThe problem is that the characteristics of crops, soils, and microclimatic\
    \ conditions in agriculture are dynamic and \nnot linear, varying with seasons.\
    \ Therefore, setting the proper irrigation schedule will directly influence plant\
    \ growth. \nThe core of DSS includes monitoring different parameters using different\
    \ sensors and configuring their rules. DSS \nmanages sensor readings stored in\
    \ the cloud to adjust irrigation scheduling to maintain irrigation system efficiency\
    \ \nroutinely [76, 90]. An intelligent irrigation DSS must have the ability to\
    \ adapt to changes in transient and spatial \nplant dynamics, such as uncertainties\
    \ in microclimate conditions, nutrient requirements, and environmental \nchanges.\
    \ Researchers have proposed many studies on DSS applied to irrigation systems,\
    \ such as [93], who \ndeveloped an automated irrigation system using a single\
    \ lateral pipe covering a large area to manage water at \nvarying speeds. \nSprinkler\
    \ irrigation developed by [94] uses an automatic linear moving sprinkler system\
    \ with WSN based DSS. The \nsystem can adapt to crop types, irrigation requirements,\
    \ and planting locations to command individual sprinkler \nheads how and where\
    \ water must be applied. Similarly, [76] built a DSS integrated fertigation simulator\
    \ for \ndesigning drip or sprinkler irrigation for on-site olives and grapes farms.\
    \ The system has a database, simulation \nmodel, and user interface that shows\
    \ the ranking of design alternatives through multicriteria decision-making \n\
    (MCDM). The scope of the calculation of this system includes land analysis, water\
    \ requirements, and plant \nnutrition. \n664 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An overview\

    \ model is a data-driven technique with easy-to-understand logical rules. [50,\
    \ 68, 95] proposed a fuzzy \nlogic-based irrigation scheduling by enforcing control\
    \ rules to microclimate data, evaporation data, and soil \nconditions. The process\
    \ flow can be seen in Figure 7. \n[96] succeeded in building and testing a rule-based\
    \ Fuzzy Logic application to assess the water stress index of \nplants in a greenhouse;\
    \ the application accepts three input variables, namely air temperature, solar\
    \ radiation, and \nwater pressure. Results show that Fuzzy Logic eliminates the\
    \ need for air aerodynamic resistance data, making \nthis system more straightforward.\
    \ \n[95] developed fuzzy logic using the LabVIEW application to create a graphical\
    \ user interface (GUI) for a drip \nirrigation control system in a greenhouse.\
    \ The input parameters used are air temperature and soil moisture and \nprocess\
    \ them using fuzzy rules to produce information of irrigation duration. The test\
    \ results show that fuzzy logic \ncontrol can efficiently estimate irrigation\
    \ schedules in an automated system, and greenhouse managers can \nmonitor real-time\
    \ data and devices that are easy to manage, even for ordinary users. [97] research\
    \ also designed \nan irrigation control based on fuzzy logic applying the Penman-Monteith\
    \ equation for rice cultivation with a \nparameter model in the difference between\
    \ actual and target evapotranspiration following the plant growth phase. \nEach\
    \ phase has its water requirement. The research aims to develop an intelligent\
    \ system that helps irrigation \nmanagement and produces a system that can work\
    \ better than conventional irrigation systems. The results showed \nthat the control\
    \ system saves water, improves irrigation performance, improves crop quality,\
    \ and saves labor.  \n \nFig 7. Fuzzy Logic-based Intelligent Irrigation System\
    \ \nAlso, [50] developed a fuzzy logic system that evaluates the irrigation system\
    \ based on the variable availability of \nirrigation water during the planting\
    \ period on the level of farmers' income which results in the efficiency of the\
    \ \nirrigation system performance. To assist in making decisions on irrigation\
    \ distribution. [98] conducted similar \nresearch by developing an intelligent\
    \ irrigation system to turn on and off the irrigation system using input \nparameters\
    \ of water use, water and air temperature, and soil moisture. They implement WSN-based\
    \ monitoring to \nsend data on fuzzy logic, which then performs irrigation scheduling\
    \ by applying fuzzy rules. The system can \nmaintain soil moisture content at\
    \ the specified limit to save the use of electrical energy, water, and runoff.\
    \ \n5.3 \nArtificial Neural Network Model \nOne application of AI in agriculture\
    \ is Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) algorithms, which can predict using elements\
    \ \ninterconnected and work in parallel. The advantage of neural networks is that\
    \ they can be trained, for example, to \ndistinguish grass from rice or to compare\
    \ tomatoes to peppers [71]. The ANN system can predict with high \naccuracy when\
    \ fed reliable and precise data. A trained ANN is considered an expert in a category\
    \ of data. This \nexpert can then predict possible future conditions and prepare\
    \ what-if scenarios [73, 87]. Other advantages of ANN \nare (1) Adaptive learning,\
    \ the ability to learn and carry out tasks based on the data provided, (2) Self-organization,\
    \ \nthe system can independently compile and build information representations\
    \ during the learning process, and (3) \nReal-time operations, computations are\
    \ carried out in parallel, so it is faster to get calculation results [99]. \n\
    The ANN model is a simple model consisting of three primary neurons distributed\
    \ in the input layer, multiples of the \nhidden layer, and the output layer. ANN\
    \ development requires necessary basic steps, namely datasets, ANN \nmodel training\
    \ data, and ANN model test data for evaluation. Using quality data, the ANN model\
    \ has a mechanism \nfor self-study and solving complex problems. Input neurons\
    \ receive parameters, then hidden neurons perform \n665 \n \nIrfan Ardiansah,\

    \ neurons send signals to other network layers; and interconnect neurons using\
    \ linear and \nnonlinear functions [26, 87, 99, 100]. \nThe following Figure 8\
    \ shows the ANN process flow. In general, the use of ANN includes problem-solving\
    \ in system \noptimization, process control, pattern classification, forecasting,\
    \ and prediction. The main components of an ANN \nmodel consist of neuron nodes,\
    \ a hidden layer containing weights between parameters and distribution rules\
    \ to \ngenerate information for learning rules and independent learning skills\
    \ through experience. There are two types of \nANN models based on their input\
    \ choices: feed-forward and feed-backward networks [99]. \n \nFig 8. The flow\
    \ of feed-forward artificial neurons \nEvapotranspiration is essential information\
    \ that needs to be known to optimize plant growth, especially in water \nmanagement\
    \ and sustainable irrigation systems. Knowledge of the parameters of air temperature,\
    \ relative \nhumidity, wind speed, hours of sunshine, and latitude can optimize\
    \ the management of ET0 in a greenhouse [97]. \nANN research on intelligent irrigation\
    \ systems is applied to scheduling and irrigation discharge to achieve savings\
    \ \nin irrigation water use. [87] conducted a study to estimate the value of soil\
    \ moisture in rice farming land using \nminimal micro and macro climate data by\
    \ applying two ANN models. The first model predicts the value of ET0 \nusing the\
    \ minimum, maximum and average air temperature variables. The second model does\
    \ the same thing but \nuses air temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation.\
    \ The test results show that both models produce reliable and \naccurate soil\
    \ moisture estimates. \nA study by [101] has developed an ANN model to calculate\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET0). After testing, they concluded \nthat the ANN model\
    \ predicts evapotranspiration better than the conventional ET0 equation. Similarly,\
    \ [90] \ndeveloped an ANN to calculate ET0 and compared it with the Penman-FAO\
    \ equation and Penman-Monteith model \nusing four and six microclimate variables\
    \ as inputs. The test indicates that the three models provide accurate \nresults\
    \ using six input parameters. In contrast, the test results with four parameters\
    \ show that only the ANN model \ncan accurately predict the ET0 value. This research\
    \ shows that building an ANN model is possible even with limited \nmicroclimate\
    \ data.  \nIn addition, irrigation control system automation was also proposed\
    \ by [102] using the ANN cluster and closed-loop \ncontrol, which resulted in\
    \ better performance than time-based irrigation control. However, they did not\
    \ provide \ninformation regarding the irrigation method used and the percentage\
    \ of water savings. [100] developed an \nintelligent irrigation system for evapotranspiration\
    \ using the ANN model and a photovoltaic system to predict \nirrigation scheduling\
    \ based on cropping moisture distribution data; this study reported better daily\
    \ water and \nelectrical energy savings also better crop yields. The application\
    \ of ANN in irrigation water management has also \ndiscussed prediction of water\
    \ salinity, water quality, rain runoff, and forecasting of surface irrigation\
    \ infiltration,  \n[73] proposed two ANN models to predict Biochemical Oxygen\
    \ Demand (BOD) and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) for \nirrigation water originating from\
    \ rivers; the conclusion is that water quality management in other areas can also\
    \ use \nthis ANN model. Similarly, [103] uses the ANN model to design an intelligent\
    \ system to manage water systems for \nagriculture and fisheries. [104] explained\
    \ that the greenhouse environment has dynamic and complex \ncharacteristics, making\
    \ it difficult to use conventional control methods as a solution. Radial Basis\
    \ Function Neural \nNetworks (RBF) algorithm and nonlinear adaptive controllers\
    \ become solutions to control greenhouse microclimate. \n[74] discusses the use\
    \ of ANN in drip irrigation systems to predict the distribution of subsurface\
    \ irrigation water. \nThe development of the ANN is to model the continuous wetting\
    \ pattern after the water droplets from the emitter \ntouch the ground surface.\

    \ of the latest IoT technologies for environmental conditions monitoring, data-driven\
    \ \ncontrol, and artificial intelligence. Nowadays, there is an increase in research\
    \ that develops techniques and models \nfor developing irrigation control systems.\
    \ The trend is due to the emergence of various sensors and controls on the \n\
    market; this provides vast opportunities for the development of precision agriculture,\
    \ especially for making \nintelligent predictions of agricultural processes such\
    \ as crop yields, crop water requirements, and microclimate \nconditions. Researchers\
    \ also need to explore other factors that influence irrigation scheduling planning,\
    \ especially \nin large agricultural areas, because researchers generally conduct\
    \ studies on a laboratory scale. Research from \ndifferent perspectives will enrich\
    \ intelligent irrigation systems and result in inaccurate predictions that can\
    \ advise \nfarmers regarding their farming activities and notify them when anomalies\
    \ occur. \nFurthermore, researchers need to test various control systems in the\
    \ irrigation systems discussed, focus on \nadaptive control, and combine it with\

    \ farmers, and efficiency must solve water scarcity in irrigation \nmanagement.\
    \ The main objective is to control the amount and frequency of irrigation so that\
    \ the amount of water \nreceived by plants is sufficient to keep the root zone\

    \ irrigation management need a system that can facilitate big data processing\
    \ analysis tools \nand transmit quality information quickly and efficiently. The\
    \ system must be able to provide recommendations \naccording to the conditions\
    \ of the agricultural environment to increase the experience and decision-making\
    \ of \nfarmers. \nThis problem challenges researchers to increase efforts to develop\
    \ sophisticated monitoring and control strategies \nfor intelligent farming that\
    \ minimize irrigation water use. This review draws on previous relevant studies\
    \ on \nagriculture water saving. The review results describe research trends in\
    \ intelligent irrigation systems monitoring \nand control strategies and assess\
    \ research opportunities to ensure water availability and savings. We hope this\
    \ \nreview provides insight and inspiration for researchers to continue research\
    \ on irrigation monitoring and control to \nachieve food security and water savings.\

  description: Optimization of crop structure is an efficient way to reduce greenhouse
    gas (GHGs) from agriculture production. However, carbon footprint have rarely
    been incorporated into previous planting structure optimization models due to
    the challenges of assessing the spatial and temporal distribution of agricultural
    carbon footprint for multiple crops in irrigated districts. In addition, previous
    planting structure models suffered from strong subjectivity in objective function
    determination, and the obtained non-dominated solution set offered difficulties
    to decision-makers in selecting specific implementation options. To fill such
    gaps, an integrated accounting-assessment-optimization-decision making (AAODM)
    approach was proposed, which remedies the shortcomings of previous crop planting
    structure optimization models in carbon footprint mitigation, and overcomes the
    subjectivity of objective function determination and the difficulty in selecting
    specific implementation options. Firstly, life cycle assessment (LCA) method was
    used to account for the multi-year agricultural carbon footprints of multiple
    crops in the irrigation district. The optimization objective functions of planting
    structure optimization models can then be determined based on the assessment method
    of carbon footprint influencing factors. Next, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic
    Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) was used to generate a non-dominated solution set of the
    optimization model. The optimal planting structure can be finally obtained based
    on decision making methods by determining the maximum harmonic mean (HM) and knee
    points (KPs) of the non-dominated solution set. The developed AAODM approach was
    then applied to a case study of agricultural crop management in Bayan Nur City,
    China. The results showed that the level of economic development was a key factor
    influencing the increase in carbon footprint in Bayan Nur City over the past 20
    years. The regulation of the level of economic development would significantly
    influence the agricultural carbon footprint in Bayan Nur City. Moreover, two optimal
    crop cultivation patterns were provided for decision-makers by selecting solutions
    from the Pareto front with decision making methods. The comparison results with
    other methods showed that the solutions obtained by NSGA-II were superior to MOPSO
    in terms of carbon reduction. The developed AAODM approach for agricultural GHG
    mitigation could help agricultural production systems in achieving low carbon
    emissions and high efficiency.

    Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) was used to generate a non-dominated solution set of the
    optimization model. The optimal planting structure can be finally obtained based
    on decision making methods by determining the maximum harmonic mean (HM) and knee
    points (KPs) of the non-dominated solution set. The developed AAODM approach was
    then applied to a case study of agricultural crop management in Bayan Nur City,
    China. The results showed that the level of economic development was a key factor
    influencing the increase in carbon footprint in Bayan Nur City over the past 20
    years. The regulation of the level of economic development would significantly
    influence the agricultural carbon footprint in Bayan Nur City. Moreover, two optimal
    crop cultivation patterns were provided for decision-makers by selecting solutions
    from the Pareto front with decision making methods. The comparison results with
    other methods showed that the solutions obtained by NSGA-II were superior to MOPSO
    in terms of carbon reduction. The developed AAODM approach for agricultural GHG
    mitigation could help agricultural production systems in achieving low carbon
    emissions and high efficiency. Graphical abstract Download : Download high-res

    optimizationCrop planting structure 1. Introduction With the increase in agricultural
    modernization, agricultural production has become an important source of greenhouse
    gases (GHGs) (Karwacka et al., 2020; Tan, 2015; Zhang et al., 2020a). The Food
    and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has reported that global GHG
    emissions from agriculture and food production have increased by 17% over the
    past 30 years (FAO, 2022). The State of Food and Agriculture (2016) from The Food
    and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations shows that the agricultural
    sector must implement measures to mitigate climate change if the global temperature
    rise is to be maintained within 2 °C (Wollenberg et al., 2016). Irrigation districts
    are important bases for agricultural production, and usually require large amounts
    of fertilizer. Nitrogen from the fertilizer is converted to ammonia by microorganisms
    and then oxidized to N2O, which is a potent GHG (Shi et al., 2020; Yue et al.,
    2020). Additionally, the demand for electricity and fuel is increasing with the
    modernization of irrigation districts, resulting in increased CO2 emissions (Shi
    et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2014). Therefore, a reliable method must be developed
    to systematically assess the sources and influencing factors of GHG emissions
    from agricultural production and identify the optimal crop pattern for GHG mitigation.
    The carbon footprint is a measure of GHG emissions resulting from by a certain
    activity (Matuštík and Kočí, 2021) or accumulated over a product''s life cycle
    (Zhang et al., 2021a). As a novel approach to measure the impact and pressure
    of GHG emissions on the global environment, the carbon footprint has become a
    prevalent subject of research in recent years (Durojaye et al., 2020; Mancini
    et al., 2016). The theory of the agricultural carbon footprint was proposed based
    on the research results of the carbon cycle in agricultural ecosystems, which
    provided theoretical support for the accurate analysis of agricultural GHG emissions
    (Lal, 2004). Some studies have investigated the carbon footprint accounting of
    single crops in irrigation districts seeking low-carbon agricultural management
    technologies using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. For example, Wu and
    Chai (2014) compared the carbon footprint of maize under different mulching and
    irrigation conditions. Wang (2020) explored a low-emission and high-efficiency
    wheat cultivation model for an irrigation district. Nie et al. (2023) estimated
    the carbon footprint of maize under drip irrigation in an irrigation district.
    Based on accounting, many researchers have analyzed the spatial and temporal variation
    in multi-year agricultural carbon footprints from national and provincial perspectives
    to conduct an empirical analysis of the influencing factors, providing policy
    insights for decision-makers to reduce the agricultural carbon footprint. For
    example, Balogh (2019) used a feasible generalized least squares estimator and
    panel unit root tests to explore the impact of the agricultural economy, production,
    export, and population on the global carbon footprint from 1961 to 2013. Yang
    et al. (2019) used the structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model to analyze
    the factors influencing the agricultural carbon footprint in Shandong Province
    from 2000 to 2017 in terms of the economy, population, and foreign trade. Zhen
    et al. (2017) used the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) model to confirm
    that the level of the agricultural economy was a determinant of the growth of
    the carbon footprint in Guangdong Province from 1993 to 2013. Unfortunately, the
    assessment of the spatial and temporal variations in the multi-year agricultural
    carbon footprints of multiple crops in irrigation districts is still lacking,
    and the crop planting structure management did not incorporate it. In addition,
    most studies on the factors influencing the agricultural carbon footprint have
    only used empirical analysis, and only few studies have conducted detailed investigations
    on the key influencing factors to support practical applications. Previously,
    programming models have been widely used to address optimization problems in many
    fields (Hu et al., 2022; Lima et al., 2022; Szkutnik-Rogoz et al., 2021). There
    have also been many attempts in agricultural systems that have used optimization
    methods. The early attempts focused on single-objective optimization of agricultural
    systems, where economic benefits was considered as the main objective. To promote
    resource conservation (Jain et al., 2021), environmental protection (Yin et al.,
    2022), improvement of crop species (Rangarajan et al., 2022) and agricultural
    machinery (Park and Miao, 2015), more objectives were considered in the optimization
    of agricultural systems. In order to alleviate the global environmental pressure,
    GHG reduction in agriculture is both an important initiative and has great potential.
    Recently, researchers have attempted to apply multi-objective optimization (MOO)
    models to optimize the allocation of water and land resources to address GHG emissions
    in agricultural systems. For example, Yue and Guo (2021) optimized the allocation
    of water and land resources in different sectors of irrigation districts to balance
    agricultural production and environmental impacts. Zhang et al. (2021a) optimized
    the planting structure in a semi-arid basin to reduce carbon emissions in an agricultural
    water-energy-food nexus system. Ren et al. (2022) developed a MOO model for a
    water-energy-food-carbon nexus system to achieve sustainable agricultural development
    in the Yellow River Basin and solved the model using a genetic algorithm. They
    demonstrated the effectiveness and applicability of the MOO model for managing
    the water and land resources for GHG mitigation. In the determination of the objective
    function, in addition to the objective of minimizing GHG emissions, the objectives
    of maximizing the competitiveness of low-carbon agriculture, renewable energy
    production, ecological benefits, economic benefits, and minimizing the Gini coefficient
    of economic income were chosen. There is subjectivity in the determination of
    the objective function, which means that it may lack relevance and effectiveness
    when formulating agricultural carbon footprint mitigation policies and technical
    solutions. There have been many optimization methods to address the subjectivity
    caused by the uncertain parameters (Wang and Huang, 2011; Wang and Huang, 2012).
    However, methods to the subjectivity caused by objective function determination
    are still rare. Existing MOO models in agriculture often use intelligent algorithms
    (Jain et al., 2021; Park and Miao, 2015; Rangarajan et al., 2022; Ren et al.,
    2022), weighting (Yue and Guo, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019), ℇ-constraint (Galán-Martín
    et al., 2017; Han et al., 2020) and other methods for solving. In order to avoid
    the difficulty of selecting accurate solutions from Pareto front (PF), researchers
    often transformed the MOO model into a single-objective optimization model to
    obtain only one solution (Li et al., 2020; Tiammee and Likasiri, 2020; Yue and
    Guo, 2021; Zhang et al., 2021a), which resulted in failing to obtain Pareto optimal
    solutions or ignoring some efficient solutions. To address these issues, researchers
    used Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) (Jiang et al., 2020;
    Ren et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2021) and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization
    Algorithm (MOPSO) (Yousefi et al., 2018; Zhai et al., 2018) to solve MOO models
    in the agricultural field. As demonstrated by No Free Lunch theorem (Wu et al.,
    2019), no learning algorithm can always performs well in any problem, so different
    algorithms are suitable for different real-world problems. Overall, NSGA-II stands
    out as a popular choice in agricultural optimization (Kropp et al., 2019). However,
    the high number of obtained non-dominated solutions not only increased the burden
    on decision-makers but also interfered with their decision making. Identifying
    the PF does not completely solve MOO problems. Specific solutions still have to
    be chosen from the non-dominated solution set for decision-makers, which is a
    challenging process (Coello et al., 2007). This process is known as decision making.
    The maximum harmonic mean provides a reasonable compromise between the objectives,
    and this decision making method has previously been successfully applied (Ayala
    and Coelho, 2008; Neto et al., 2018). Another approach is the determination of
    knee points, which is very attractive to decision-makers because of the minimal
    trade-off loss on all objectives (Deb et al., 2003; Ramirez-Atencia et al., 2017).
    Integration of MOO methods with the maximum harmonic mean and knee points methods
    may help to solve such problems in agriculture. According to the existing literature,
    several aspects are worthy of further enhancement, as follows: (i) Research on
    the agricultural carbon footprint of irrigation districts is still in its infancy,
    focusing on accounting for the carbon footprint of single-crop production under
    different agricultural management technologies. The assessment of the spatial
    and temporal variations in the multi-year agricultural carbon footprints of multiple
    crops is still lacking. This hinders the incorporation of carbon footprints into
    optimization models. (ii) Previous multi-objective planting structure optimization
    models rarely considered the carbon footprint and suffered from strong subjectivity
    in objective function determination, which may lead to suboptimal or even infeasible
    solutions. Additionally, the obtained high number of non-dominated solutions not
    only increased the burden on decision-makers but also interfered with their choice
    of specific planting structure optimization options. To the best of our knowledge,
    no studies have simultaneously resolved the abovementioned concerns to ensure
    sustainable agricultural resource management in irrigation districts. To resolve
    these deficiencies, this study aimed to develop a systematic accounting-assessment-optimization-decision
    making (AAODM) approach to integrate the assessment of carbon footprint into planting
    structure management, and tackle the subjectivity existing in objective function
    determination and the difficulty in selecting specific implementation options.
    First, the LCA method was used to account for the carbon footprints of crop planting
    in the irrigation district over the years and clarify the spatial and temporal
    variations in the carbon footprints during the development of the irrigation district.
    Second, the coupled Kaya-LMDI method was used to determine the key factors influencing
    the agricultural carbon footprint. Finally, this study developed a MOO model based
    on the carbon footprint to regulate the key factors influencing the carbon footprint
    that was solved using the NSGA-II to generate a non-dominated solution set. Rational
    optimization solutions from the Pareto optimal set were provided to decision-makers
    based on decision making methods by determining the maximum harmonic mean and
    knee points of the non-dominated solution set. Therefore, the developed model
    can determine the optimization objective functions based on the assessment of
    the influencing factors to resolve the subjective nature of objective function
    determination. It can also obtain two optimal planting structures based on decision
    making methods to resolve the difficulty in selecting specific implementation
    options. The capabilities of the model were demonstrated through a case study
    of agricultural cropping management in Bayan Nur City, China, which could help
    decision-makers identify desirable solutions to reduce the carbon footprint. The
    remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The development of the assessment-based
    planting structure optimization model for GHG mitigation is introduced in Section
    2. In Section 3, the methodology is applied to Bayan Nur City. In Section 4, the
    optimal crop cultivation pattern and the effect of carbon footprint reduction
    are analyzed. The rationality of the results, the applicability and superiority
    of the methodology are discussed in Section 5. Finally, the conclusions are presented
    in Section 6. 2. Methodology The AAODM approach of this study is shown in Fig.
    1. In this study, AAODM approach was proposed to remedy the shortcomings of previous
    crop planting structure optimization models in neglecting carbon footprint, and
    overcome the subjectivity of objective function determination and the difficulty
    in selecting specific implementation options. First, the four-step LCA method
    was used to account for the multi-year agricultural carbon footprints of multiple
    crops in the irrigation district, and clarify the spatial and temporal variations
    in the carbon footprints. Based on the Kaya model, dividing the factors influencing
    the carbon footprint into four dimensions: energy structure, energy intensity,
    level of economic development, and population size factors. LMDI method was coupled
    to reveal the key factors influencing the spatial and temporal variations in the
    multi-year agricultural carbon footprints. Then, a MOO model of planting structure
    management based on carbon footprint was developed to regulate the key factors
    influencing the change in carbon footprint. The NSGA-Ⅱ was used to solve the model
    to generate a non-dominated solution set. Finally, two decision making methods,
    the maximum harmonic mean and knee points methods, were used to provide decision-makers
    with two optimal crop cultivation patterns of the non-dominated solution set.

    1. The general framework of this study. 2.1. Life cycle assessment method This
    subsection provides a brief introduction to the computational structure of LCA
    since it was used to account for the agricultural carbon footprint in irrigation
    district and calculate the parameters required in the optimization model. With
    increased awareness of environmental protection and a greater understanding of
    the impacts that may accompany the production and consumption of products, there
    is a desire to establish methods to better understand and account for these impacts.
    One of the techniques developed for this purpose is LCA. The LCA method uses a
    top-down approach to identify total GHG emissions by clarifying the links that
    generate GHGs throughout the life cycle of a product (Yang et al., 2022) or service
    (Chen et al., 2009), and is chosen to account for the agricultural carbon footprint.
    According to Environmental management - Life cycle assessment - Principles and
    frameworks, it can be divided into four steps: the determination of purpose and
    scope, inventory analysis, impact assessment and interpretation (Chen et al.,
    2009). Step 1 Determination of purpose and scope Considering the carbon footprint
    of crop production in irrigation district during 1998–2018. Emissions from agri-food
    systems are those generated by pre-production, farm-gate emissions, post-production
    and land use change processes (FAO, 2021), as shown in Fig. S1. Among them, farm-gate
    emissions were the largest component of agri-food systems emissions in 2019 with
    roughly 7 billion tons CO2eq, followed by pre- and post-production processes and
    land use change. Additionally, for carbon footprint studies focusing on agricultural
    processes, the system boundary can be restricted to “cradle to farm gate” instead
    of “cradle to grave” to avoid complications of a full carbon footprint study (Peter
    et al., 2017). Therefore, the accounting scope is chosen from “raw material production”
    to “crop harvest”, which includes the pre-production and farm-gate emissions processes,
    encompassing the majority of agri-food systems emissions. Step 2 Inventory analysis
    Inventory analysis, which lists all the links that generate a carbon footprint
    within the scope boundary, is the most important step in LCA. The carbon footprint
    generated during the processes from “raw material production” to “crop harvest”
    includes upstream and downstream carbon footprints. The production and processing
    of fertilizers, seeds, pesticides, and agricultural films, electricity for irrigation,
    the use of diesel for agricultural machinery, and nitrogen fertilizer application
    were included. The life cycle and system boundary are shown in Fig. 2. The main
    crops in Bayan Nur City are wheat, corn, sunflower, tomato and melon. Download

    assessment The impact assessment step involves a specific calculation of the carbon
    footprint of each link. The following seven links are included: A Fertilizer production

    (15%N, 42%P2O5) and potash (60%K2O). (1) where WFER is the carbon footprint generated
    by fertilizer production and processing (kg); j represents the type of crops (j
    = 1 for wheat, j = 2 for corn, j = 3 for sunflower, j = 4 for tomato and j = 5
    for melon); k represents the type of fertilizer (k = 1 for urea, k = 2 for diammonium
    phosphate, and k = 3 for potash); UFEjk is the amount of fertilizer k applied
    to crop j per unit area of production (kg/hm2); Aj is the planting area of crop
    j (hm2); WFEk is the carbon footprint coefficient of the production and processing
    of chemical fertilizer k (kgCO2eq/kgN, kgCO2eq/kgP2O5, kgCO2eq/kgK2O); FCOk is

    (2) where WSED is the carbon footprint generated by seed production and processing
    (kg); USEj is the seed consumption of crop j per unit area of production (kg/hm2);
    WSEj is the carbon footprint coefficient for the seeds production and processing
    of crop j (kgCO2eq/kg). C Pesticide production and processing (3) where WPES is
    the carbon footprint generated by pesticide production and processing (kg); UPEj
    is the pesticide consumption of crop j per unit area of production (kg/hm2); WPE
    is the carbon footprint coefficient of production and processing of pesticides
    (kgCO2eq/kg effective components); PCO is the active ingredient of pesticide (%).
    Due to the limitation of data acquisition, PCO takes the value of 1. D. Agricultural

    by agricultural film production and processing (kg); UFIj is the agricultural
    film consumption of crop j per unit area of production (kg/hm2); WFI is the carbon

    electricity (kg); UELj is the electricity consumption of crop j irrigation per
    unit area of production (kWh/hm2); WEL is the carbon footprint coefficient of

    machinery (6) where WDIS is the carbon footprint generated by diesel for agricultural
    machinery (kg); UDIj is the diesel consumption for agricultural machinery for

    FCO1 is the effective content of N in urea, taken as 46%; UFE2j is the diammonium
    phosphate consumption of crop j per unit area of production (kg/hm2); FCP is the
    effective content of N in diammonium phosphate, taken as 15%; WFN is the carbon
    footprint coefficient of nitrogen fertilizer application (kgCO2eq/kgN). H The
    total carbon footprint is: (8) where CFS is the total carbon footprint (kg). The
    above seven carbon footprint links were added to obtain the total carbon footprint
    in the study area during 1998–2018. Step 4 Interpretation According to Environmental
    management - Life cycle assessment - Principles and frameworks (Chen et al., 2009),
    the interpretation of the life cycle assessment is a stage that integrates the
    findings of the inventory analysis (Step 2) and impact assessment (Step 3). The
    results of the interpretation (Step 4) should be consistent with the identified
    purpose and scope (Step 1), with corresponding conclusions, explanations of limitations,
    and recommendations presented to decision-makers. 2.2. Kaya-Logarithmic Mean Divisia
    Index method At the IPCC seminar, the Kaya model was proposed to divide the factors
    influencing the carbon footprint into four dimensions: energy structure, energy
    intensity, level of economic development, and population size factors (Fan and
    Hu, 2020; Kaya, 1990). Moreover, factor decomposition method provided an effective
    way to determine the contribution of each impact factor to the change of carbon
    footprint. The index decomposition analysis (IDA), production-theoretical decomposition
    analysis (PDA) and structural decomposition analysis (SDA) were the mostly used
    factor decomposition methods. Among above-mentioned methods, SDA method was mainly
    used in practical applications to provide a basis for GHG emissions reduction
    from the industrial structure using input-output tables. The PDA method was mainly
    used to determine the share of GHG reduction tasks for each region by dividing
    the study area into multiple regions. Compared to SDA and PDA methods, the data
    required by IDA method is easier to acquire and analyze. Among the many IDA methods,
    the LMDI method has no residuals, effectively avoiding the spurious regression
    problem. Owing to its high operability and adaptability, it has become one of
    the most commonly used carbon footprint decomposition methods in recent years
    (Chong et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019). A practical guide to LMDI is reported
    in Ang (2005). Agricultural carbon footprint are ultimately produced by agricultural
    production activities (Chen et al., 2018). (i) Agricultural energy structure reflects
    the type and proportion of energy used in agricultural production. Different types
    of energy sources produce different levels of agricultural carbon footprint (Astier
    et al., 2014). (ii) Agricultural energy intensity reflects the amount of energy
    consumed per unit of output in agricultural production. A high energy intensity
    means that more energy is needed to produce the same amount of agricultural products
    and vice versa (Zhang et al., 2015b). (ⅲ) The level of agricultural economic development
    reflects the productivity of agricultural production system. The larger the indicator,
    the higher the productivity of the system (Zhang et al., 2015b). (ⅳ) Changes in
    the agricultural population size can affect arable land area, and the efficiency
    and quality of agricultural production by causing changes in food demand and rural
    labor (Chen et al., 2020). The LMDI method, first proposed by Ang et al. (1998),
    is a factor decomposition method without residuals that effectively avoids spurious
    regression problems (Dong et al., 2019). Based on the above results of carbon
    footprint accounting over the years, the LMDI method was chosen to determine the
    contribution of carbon footprint change to each influencing factor. The agricultural
    carbon footprint can be formulated using energy structure, energy intensity, level
    of economic development, and population size factors as follows: (9) Where TE
    is energy consumption; TGDP is output value; and P is population size. is the
    energy structure, i.e., the ratio of GHG emissions to energy consumption, denoted
    by CE. is the energy intensity, i.e., the ratio of agricultural energy consumption
    in the irrigation district to the corresponding output value, denoted by EP. is
    the level of economic development, i.e., the ratio of agricultural output value
    to population size in the irrigation district, denoted by TP. According to the
    LMDI model, the factors influencing the total change in the carbon footprint over
    the years are decomposed as: (10) Where ΔC is the amount of carbon footprint change
    (kg). Ct is the carbon footprint in period t (kg). C0 is the carbon footprint
    in the starting period (kg). l represents the factors influencing the change in
    carbon footprint (l = 1 for CE, l = 2 for EP, l = 3 for TP, and l = 4 for P).
    ΔCl is the carbon footprint change caused by influencing factor l (kg). (11) Where
    lt is the value of influence factor l in period t. l0 is the value of influence
    factor l in the starting period. The function L (a, b) is defined as: (12) ＞ ＞
    ＞ ＞ 2.3. Crop cultivation structure management model based on the carbon footprint
    A MOO problem is a problem of finding optimal solutions in the feasible domain
    so that multiple objective functions are optimized simultaneously. It usually
    has no unique optimal solution, but rather a set of Pareto optimal solutions that
    cannot be dominated by each other. It is necessary to give a precise description
    of the MOO problem and definitions of the related concepts. A general MOO problem
    (minimization) with k objectives can be described as: Minimize {f1 (x), f2 (x),
    …, fk (x)} subject to: x ∈ X. Where f1 (x), f2 (x), …, fk (x) are k(≥2) objectives
    to be minimized, x is the decision vector, and X is the set of feasible solutions.
    Definition 1 Pareto dominance A decision vector a (a∈X) is said to Pareto dominated
    a decision vector b (b ∈ X) if and only if: fi (a) ≤ fi(b) for all i∈{1,2, …,
    k} and fi (a) < fi(b) for at least one i∈{1,2, …, k}. Definition 2 Pareto optimal
    solution A solution x ∈ X is a Pareto optimal solution (also called non-dominated
    solution) if there is no x’∈X that Pareto dominates x. Definition 3 Pareto optimal
    set and Pareto front The Pareto optimal set is a set containing all (or as large
    as possible) Pareto optimal solutions. The set of objective values corresponding
    to the solutions in the Pareto optimal set is illustrated on the PF. Optimal theory
    is an effective regulation tool that can provide sound management solutions under
    specific conditions and multi-objective requirements (Zhang et al., 2020b, 2021b,
    2023). In this study, a MOO model of crop planting structure management based
    on carbon footprint theory was developed to regulate the key influencing factors
    of carbon footprint change. The NSGA-II was applied to the MOO model and generated
    a non-dominated solution set with high attainability to improve the agricultural
    environment. We developed a multi-objective LP model for the problem addressed
    in this work. Various constraints B–F in agricultural production, such as acreage,
    water availability, and food security constraints, etc., are fully considered
    to ensure the practicality and feasibility of the model. The economic objective
    was defined in equation (13). The environmental objective was defined in equation
    (14). A list of sets, parameters, and decision variables in the optimization model
    was given in the Supplementary Material. 2.3.1. Objective functions and constraints
    Objective one is the objective of maximizing net economic benefits and objective
    two is the objective of minimizing carbon footprint. Consistent with similar studies,
    minimizing carbon footprint from agriculture production should be identified as
    the optimization objective function (Ren et al., 2022; Yue and Guo, 2021; Zhang
    et al., 2021a). In addition, the key influencing factor of carbon footprint changes
    should be incorporated into the optimization model as one of the objectives, as
    their regulation could lead to targeted and effective GHG reduction solutions.
    The agricultural economy is directly linked to the crop planting structure, and
    adjusting this structure can alter the agricultural economy to achieve efficient
    GHG mitigation. By considering the economic benefits and the carbon footprint
    as optimization objectives, and the acreage of each crop in each region as the
    decision variables, planting structure solutions to reduce the carbon footprint
    can be obtained. It is noteworthy that the assessment-based objective function
    determination method proposed in this paper holds broad applicability. In this
    paper, we provide a systematic approach for integrating the assessment of carbon
    footprint into crop planting structure management and solving the problem of subjectivity
    in objective function determination by integrating LCA and Kaya-LMDI with MOO.
    Future research in a similar vein can apply and expand upon this framework, such
    as setting more carbon footprint influencing factors as optimization objective
    functions and assigning their importance according to the degree of impact. A
    Objective functions This model is a multi-objective crop cropping structure optimization
    model. Objective one is the objective of maximizing net economic benefits and
    objective two is the objective of minimizing carbon footprint. (13) (14) Where
    F1 is agricultural economic benefits (yuan); F2 is agricultural carbon footprint
    (kg); i denotes study area; Aij is the planting area with crop j in region i (hm2);
    Pj is unit price of crop j (yuan/kg); Yij is the yield of crop j in region i (kg/hm2);
    Cj is the cost of growing crop j (yuan/hm2). The economic benefits are valuated
    in Chinese yuan. One Chinese yuan equals to 0.1550 US dollars based on the annual
    average currency conversion rate posted by Bank of China in 2021. B Carbon footprint
    constraints The carbon footprint induced by crop production should not surpass
    the present carbon footprint before optimization to improve the agricultural environment.
    The constraints are represented by the following equations. (15) (16) Where Kj
    is the carbon footprint of growing crop j (kg/hm2); A0ij is the planting area
    with the crop j in the region i in base year (hm2); and CFS0 is the carbon footprint
    in base year (kg). C Planting area constraints The optimal planting area should
    not exceed the total effective area. The area that can be made available for a
    specific crop depends on the current area. The constraints ensure that the optimized
    planting area is suitable for crop growth. The effective planting area is the
    sum of the original crop planting area. The constraints are represented by equation
    (17). (17) In addition, considering the production safety of different crops,
    the variation of acreage for each crop should be within a certain range, as shown
    in equation (18). (18) D Water availability constraints It is necessary to ensure
    that the water provided for crop planting should not exceed the water availability
    in each area of the irrigation district. The water availability constraints are
    represented by equation (19). (19) Where mj is the crop j irrigation quota (m3/hm2);
    Qi is the amount of water available for agriculture in the region i (m3); ρ is
    the irrigation water utilization coefficient. E Food security constraints In order
    to ensure that the demand for food production is met, it is necessary to limit
    the production of each crop to no less than the minimum demands of society. The
    food security constraints are represented by equation (20). (20) Where Dj is the
    minimum social demand for crop j (kg). F Non-negative constraints Crop acreage
    cannot take negative values and can be represented by equation (21). (21) 2.3.2.
    Solution method (1) Solution of the optimization model Existing MOO models in
    agriculture often use intelligent algorithms (Jain et al., 2021; Park and Miao,
    2015; Rangarajan et al., 2022; Ren et al., 2022), weighting (Yue and Guo, 2021;
    Zhang et al., 2019), ℇ-constraint (Han et al., 2020) and other methods for solving.
    Compared to global criterion, weighting, and ℇ-constraint methods, the multi-objective
    genetic algorithms (MOGA) method leads to a correct and accurate identification
    of the whole PF. NSGA-II is a popular algorithm to deal with realistic MOO problems
    in agriculture (Kropp et al., 2019). Numerous studies have stated that NSGA-II
    can obtain solutions with better convergence and diversity owing to its stability
    and robustness (Che et al., 2021; Kalyanmoy et al., 2002; Zhang and Liu, 2020).
    The NSGA-II algorithm process is shown in Fig. S2 (Kalyanmoy et al., 2002) and
    the solving description is given in the Supplementary Material. The solution of
    this model was computed by MATLAB R2020b software with NSGA-II algorithm. The
    population size was set to 200, and the mutation and crossover rate were 0.05
    and 0.7, respectively. The PF consisting of a series of non-dominated solutions
    was obtained after 300 iterations. (2) Optimal optimization solution selection
    For the PF obtained by solving MOO model, the high number of non-dominated solutions
    not only increase the burden on decision-makers but also interfere with their
    decision making (Zhang et al., 2021c). The maximum harmonic mean and knee points
    methods were applied to solve this problem and provided decision-makers with optimal
    optimization solutions. (i) Maximum harmonic mean The arithmetic mean, geometric
    mean and harmonic mean are important mean measures in statistics. Compared to
    the arithmetic mean which is a compromise average of strengths and weaknesses,
    geometric mean and harmonic mean are penalized average to encourage balanced development.
    Compared to the geometric mean, the harmonic mean penalises uneven performances
    more heavily. The maximum harmonic mean provides a reasonable compromise between
    the objectives, and this decision making method has previously been successfully
    applied (Ayala and Coelho, 2008; Neto et al., 2018). The more reasonably behaved
    are the solutions for both objectives, the larger is the harmonic mean. The harmonic
    mean H of the positive real numbers x1, x2, …, xn is defined to be: (22) For the
    special case of just two objectives, x and y, the harmonic mean can be written:
    (23) For the special case of just three objectives, x, y and z, the harmonic mean
    can be written: (24) If a set of weight w1, w2, …, wn is associated to the positive
    real numbers x1, x2, …, xn, the weighted harmonic mean is defined by: (25) The
    unweighted harmonic mean can be regarded as the special case where all of the
    weights are equal. Further variations are possible, and they include means, weighted
    or not, of more than two objectives. In this study, the harmonic mean can be calculated
    by equation (26) and the non-dominated solution corresponding to the maximum harmonic
    mean will be selected. (26) where x is the value of the objective one after homogenization
    and normalization; y is the value of the objective two after homogenization and
    normalization. Neither objective one nor objective two is assigned a weight. (ii)
    Knee points Many researchers have tried to find the local points or regions with
    special significance on the PF (Bhattacharjee et al., 2017; Chiu et al., 2016).
    If the PF has a clear knee point, most decision-makers prefer this solution. This
    is because a small improvement in any objective from the knee point leads to the
    significant deterioration in at least one of the other objectives (Deb et al.,
    2003; Ramirez-Atencia et al., 2017). In this paper, we use the definition for
    the knee point of Zhang et al. (2015a) and Zou et al. (2017). An example PF showing
    knee points and normal points is shown in Fig. S3. D has the longest distance
    from the straight line L, so D is the knee point. For a bi-objective minimization
    problem, the mathematical formula of straight line L is as follows: (27) Then,
    the distance from a solution k (xk,yk) to L can be calculated as: (28) For minimization
    problems, only solutions in the convex knee regions are of interest (Zhang et
    al., 2015a). Therefore, the distance measure in equation (28) can be modified
    as follows to identify knee points: (29) ＜ The above distance measure for identifying
    knee points can be easily extended to optimization problems with more than two
    objectives, where the extreme line will become a hyperplane (Zhang et al., 2015a).
    The knee points when there are only two objectives are more obvious and can be
    clearly observed, and thus can be selected more easily and quickly by human observation
    (Neto et al., 2018). 3. Application 3.1. Study area Bayan Nur City (40°13′∼42°28′N
    and 105°12′∼109°53′E) is located in the western part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
    Region, which includes the Hetao Irrigation District, the largest gravity irrigation
    district in Asia and one of the three extra-large irrigation districts in China.
    According to the administrative division of Bayan Nur City, the study area is
    divided into seven regions, which are Dengkou County, Hangjin Houqi, Linhe District,
    Wuyuan County, Urad Qianqi, Urad Zhongqi, and Urad Houqi, as shown in Fig. 3.
    The main grain crops are wheat, corn, etc. The main cash crops include sunflower,
    tomato, melon, etc. These five crops mentioned above account for about 86% of
    the total arable land. The annual precipitation is only 150 mm, while the annual
    evaporation amounts to 2200 mm, which belongs to the area where there is no agriculture
    without irrigation by water transfer (Song et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019).

    Fig. 3. Study area. The irrigation district has an increasingly prominent strategic
    position. It is an alluvial plain of the Yellow River with a flat terrain, deep
    soil texture, and excellent tillage performance. For a long time, the irrigation
    district has been consolidating and improving the basis of agricultural irrigation
    to fully meet the agricultural water requirements of the district and rapidly
    develop the agricultural economy. Currently, it has become an important base for
    commodity grain and oil for the country and autonomous region, with a total annual
    average grain output of approximately 3 million tons and 600,000 tons of oilseeds
    (Shi et al., 2020). However, irrigation and mechanical tillage in agricultural
    production processes emit large amounts of GHGs. In addition to the production
    processes in the field, the materials used for crop production generate large
    amounts of GHGs (Cheng et al., 2014; Xia et al., 2016). The local government has
    published plans, such as ecological environmental protection planning and carbon
    reduction work programs (Qi et al., 2019), to promote the integration of greening
    and agricultural modernization and actively explore the development of environmentally
    friendly modern agriculture. Therefore, a reliable method must be developed to
    systematically assess the sources and influencing factors of GHG emissions from
    agricultural production and identify the optimal crop pattern for GHG mitigation.
    3.2. Data collection and processing The period of agricultural carbon footprint
    accounting was selected from 1998 to 2018, and the data involved were collected
    and processed as follows: data on planting area, fertilizer application, seed,
    agricultural film usage, pesticide usage, diesel usage of agricultural machinery,
    and electricity consumption for irrigation were obtained from Bayan Nur Statistical
    Yearbook and Bayan Nur Farming and Animal Husbandry Bureau. The inputs of production
    materials of crop cultivation are shown in Table 1. The carbon footprint inventory
    coefficients are shown in Table 2. Table 1. Inputs of production materials of

    the change in carbon footprint was selected from 1998 to 2018, and the data involved
    were collected and processed as follows: the data of agricultural output value
    and population size were obtained from Bayan Nur Statistical Yearbook; agricultural
    energy consumption included diesel for agricultural machinery and electricity
    for irrigation, and the sum of the agricultural carbon footprint generated by
    both was used to denote agricultural energy consumption. The base year selected
    for the optimization model was 2018, and the data involved in the objective function
    were collected and processed as follows: the data of crop yield were from Bayan
    Nur Statistical Yearbook and Bayan Nur Bureau of Statistics; the crop prices were
    from China Agricultural Information Network; the unit cost of planting each crop
    in the study area was from the National Agricultural Products Cost-benefit Data
    Collection; the carbon footprint of crop unit area was calculated with the LCA
    method according to the data in Table 1, Table 2 The data collection and processing
    involved in the constraints of the optimization model were as follows: irrigation
    quotas for different crops were taken from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Industry
    Water Rating Standard; irrigation water utilization coefficients were given by
    the Hetao Irrigation District Administration; agricultural water availability
    for different sub-districts was from Bayan Nur Statistical Yearbook; the current
    carbon footprint before optimization was 2018, which was also the historical maximum
    carbon footprint; the minimum annual demand for wheat per capita was 250 kg, and
    the minimum annual demand for corn per capita was 150 kg. Since local wheat production
    is not self-sufficient, wheat imports from abroad should not exceed 30% of the
    total demand for food security and social stability (Song et al., 2019). The production
    of sunflower, tomato and melon should exceed the minimum production in 20 years.
    The upper and lower limits of the acreage interval for 2013–2018 were set as the
    range of crop acreage values. 4. Results analysis 4.1. Assessment of carbon footprint
    The LCA method was used to account for the carbon footprint of Bayan Nur City
    from 1998 to 2018. The agricultural carbon footprint comprises seven aspects:
    the production and processing of fertilizers, seeds, pesticides, and agricultural
    films, the use of diesel fuel for agricultural machinery, electricity for irrigation,
    and nitrogen fertilizer. Carbon footprint during 1998–2018 is shown in Fig. 4a.
    The carbon footprint showed an overall increasing trend over the past 20 years,
    from 865.55 million kg in 1998 to 1471.69 million kg in 2018. The carbon footprint
    increased by 606.14 million kg and average annual growth rate was 3%. The growth
    rate of GHG emissions peaked in 2004 at 12%. The carbon footprint of electricity
    for irrigation and diesel for agricultural machinery grew significantly, and their
    proportion in the total carbon footprint gradually increased. The production and
    processing of fertilizers and the application of irrigation electricity were the
    main contributors to the carbon footprint of Bayan Nur City, accounting for 32
    and 33%, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Spatial and temporal variation of carbon footprint. The
    carbon footprint of each region of Bayan Nur City and its composition are shown
    in Fig. 4b. Linhe District, Wuyuan County, and Urad Qianqi were the main areas
    of carbon footprint generation, followed by Urad Zhongqi, Hangjin Houqi, and Dengkou
    County. Urad Houqi had the smallest contribution to the carbon footprint, with
    the proportion increasing from 1% in 1998 to 4% in 2018, and the carbon footprint
    increasing by 42.74 million kg. Dengkou County is the area with the most significant
    carbon footprint change, with the proportion increasing from 3% in 1998 to 15%
    in 2018, and its carbon footprint increased by 187.61 million kg. Before 2010,
    the carbon footprints of Hangjin Houqi and Urad Zhongqi changed only slightly.
    After 2010, the carbon footprints of Hangjin Houqi and Urad Zhongqi gradually
    decreased and increased, respectively. 4.2. Assessment of the carbon footprint
    influencing factors The change in carbon footprint is the result of the combined
    influence of the energy structure, energy intensity, level of economic development,
    population size factors. The contribution of each influencing factor to the change
    in the carbon footprint is shown in Fig. 5. For the whole Bayan Nur City, energy
    structure factor would be an inhibiting factor to the increase in carbon footprint.
    Energy intensity factor would be a promoting factor to the increase in carbon
    footprint before 2007 and an inhibiting factor after 2007. The level of economic
    development factor would be an inhibiting factor to the increase in carbon footprint
    before 2003 and a promoting factor after 2003. Population size factor would be
    not an important influencing factor to the change in carbon footprint until 2004
    and become an inhibiting factor to the increase in carbon footprint after 2004,
    while the effect would be weak. In general, the level of economic development
    factor would be the key factor influencing the change in carbon footprint since
    2004, and contribute to the increase in carbon footprint. The level of economic
    development factor would have a more significant effect on the change in carbon
    footprint than the other three influencing factors. Download : Download high-res

    influencing the change in carbon footprint over the years. The assessment of factors
    influencing the carbon footprint by district showed that the population size factor
    would have little influence on the change in carbon footprint in each district.
    With the development of the Bayan Nur City, the main factor promoting the increase
    in carbon footprint in each district would transition from energy intensity to
    the level of economic development factors, and the main factor inhibiting the
    increase in carbon footprint would transition from the level of economic development
    to energy structure and energy intensity factors. Except for Linhe District and
    Dengkou County, energy structure factor would be not an important factor influencing
    the change in carbon footprint, while energy intensity factor would be a main
    factor inhibiting the increase in carbon footprint. Except for Dengkou County,
    energy structure factor would inhibit the increase in the carbon footprint. In
    general, The level of economic development factor would be the key factor influencing
    the increase in the carbon footprint in each district. This indicates that the
    regulation of the level of economic development would significantly influence
    the agricultural carbon footprint in Bayan Nur City. 4.3. Optimization of the
    crop cultivation pattern 4.3.1. Selected optimal optimization solutions The analysis
    results showed that the carbon footprint of the Bayan Nur City showed an overall
    increasing trend from 1998 to 2018, whereas the economic development factor would
    be the key influencing factor for carbon footprint change. The NSGA-II algorithm
    was used to solve the MOO model and obtained the PF consisting of a series of
    non-dominated solutions, as shown in Fig. 6a. There are 200 optimal solutions
    obtained that are in the same non-dominated rank, and the increase in economic
    benefits would come with an increase in the carbon footprint. To reduce the burden
    on decision-makers, the maximum harmonic mean and knee points methods were applied
    to deal with this problem. The two extreme solutions were also selected for comparison.
    The selected solutions are shown in Fig. 6a. The maximum harmonic mean (HM) of
    the two objectives was calculated as shown in Fig. 6b. The knee point (KP) divided
    the PF into two segments, and the small increase in economic benefits would lead
    to the significant increase in carbon footprint for the latter segment compared
    to the former segment of the PF. Fig. 6c compares the objective values before
    and after optimization. MI would be the minimum value that could be achieved for
    the carbon footprint objective and MA would be the maximum value that could be
    achieved for the economic benefits objective. The economic benefits objective
    value would range from −3.6% to 8.7% and the carbon footprint objective value
    would range from −17.1% to −0.4%. Optimal management of crop cropping structure
    could both increase economic benefits and reduce the carbon footprint produced
    from crop cultivation. KP is the knee point, with the economic benefits decreasing
    by 3.6% and the carbon footprint decreasing by 16.8%. HM is the maximum harmonic
    mean point, with the economic benefits increasing by 2.4% and the carbon footprint
    decreasing by 10.2%. HM would provide a reasonable compromise between the two
    objectives. Download : Download high-res image (529KB) Download : Download full-size

    value of the objective one after homogenization and normalization; f2: the value
    of the objective one after homogenization and normalization). 4.3.2. Optimal crop
    cultivation pattern Two objective decision making methods, the maximum harmonic
    mean and knee points methods, were used to provide solutions of potential interest
    to decision-makers, namely, HM and KP. The overall situation before and after
    optimization is shown in Fig. 7a. The adjustment of the crop cultivation pattern
    was illustrated using HM as an example. Compared with the planting structure before
    optimization, the optimized planting structure would increase economic benefits
    by 412.49 million yuan, reduce carbon footprint by 149.11 million kg, and reduce
    water resource consumption by 261.72 million m3. The planting area of wheat, corn
    and sunflower should be reduced, and that of tomato and melon should be increased.
    Before and after optimization, corn and sunflower would be the most important
    crops, and their planting area would account for about 40% of the planting area
    of the five major crops. Since the irrigation quotas for tomato and melon are
    small, and that for corn and wheat are relatively large, the adjustment of the
    planting structure would not only reduce the carbon footprint, increase economic
    benefits, but also greatly save water resources. Download : Download high-res

    pattern (BO: before optimization; KP: knee point; HM: the maximum harmonic mean;
    MI: objective 2 minimum; MA: objective 1 maximum). The adjustment of planting
    structure in each region of Bayan Nur City is shown in Fig. 7b. The planting area
    of sunflower in Linhe District should be increased. The planting area of corn
    in Wuyuan County, Linhe District and Hangjin Houqi, and sunflower in Urad Qianqi
    should be reduced. Acreage for the remaining crops in other regions would require
    only minor adjustments or keep basically the same. Compared with the period before
    optimization, the carbon footprints and economic benefits generated by the cultivation
    of corn in Wuyuan County and sunflowers in Urad Qianqi would decrease significantly.
    The carbon footprint generated by the cultivation of tomato would increase slightly,
    accompanied by a significant increase in economic benefits in Wuyuan County and
    Hangjin Houqi (Fig. S4). The sources of carbon footprint before and after optimization
    are shown in Fig. S5. After adjusting the crop planting structure, the main links
    that generate carbon footprint remain unchanged. Before optimization, the carbon
    footprint mainly came from Linhe District, Wuyuan County, and Dengkou County.
    Compared with before optimization, the contribution of Urad Qianqi and Hangjin
    Houqi to the agricultural carbon footprint would significantly increase. At the
    same time, the carbon footprint of Dengkou County and Urad Houqi would significantly
    reduce. It showed that Dengkou County and Urad Houqi had great emission reduction
    potential. 5. Discussion 5.1. Models comparison 5.1.1. Comparison of intelligent
    optimization algorithms In order to evaluate the performance of NSGA-II used in
    this paper, a comparison with MOPSO was conducted. The solutions were computed
    using MATLAB R2020b software with specific settings. The repository size and number
    of grids per dimension were set to 200 and 7, respectively. The inflation rate,
    leader selection pressure, deletion selection pressure, and mutation rate were
    0.1, 2, 2, and 0.1, respectively. The PF consisting of a series of non-dominated
    solutions was obtained after 300 iterations, as shown in Fig. S6. The results
    were evaluated statistically and explored accordingly (Carrasco et al., 2017,
    2020; Ma et al., 2023). To determine whether there were significant differences
    between the results obtained by NSGA-II and MOPSO, tests for normality and homogeneity
    of variance were conducted. The results of Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed that
    the solutions obtained by both methods obey normal distribution, as shown in Table
    S1. The results of one-way ANOVA test showed heterogeneity of variance (Table
    S2), leading to the utilization of Welch''s t-test and Bayesian Mann-Whitney U
    test using JASP. As shown in Table 3, since the p-value is less than 0.05, which
    rejects the null hypothesis (Ho). This indicates that the results obtained by
    the two algorithms for F1 (economic benefits) are significantly different. Moreover,
    the effect size is greater than 0.5, indicating a substantial effect in this t-test
    result. As shown in Fig. S7, the Bayes factor further supports the alternative
    hypothesis, and most of the posterior distribution falls on large values of the
    effect size. The Bayesian Mann-Whitney U test yields similar outcomes to the Welch''s
    t-test. In Fig. S8(a), the raincloud plot of statistical tests for F1 demonstrates
    that the economic benefits of the solutions obtained using NSGA-II are higher
    than those with MOPSO. Similarly, Fig. S8(b) shows the raincloud plot of the statistical
    tests for F2 (carbon footprint), indicating that the carbon footprint of the solutions
    obtained by NSGA-II is lower than those generated by MOPSO. Considering that agricultural
    economic benefits are a “bigger-the-better” objective, and agricultural carbon
    footprint is a “smaller-the-better” objective, the results suggest that NSGA-II
    outperforms MOPSO in terms of GHG mitigation in the context of this study''s application.

    methods To demonstrate the superiority of two decision making methods for multi-objective
    agricultural GHG reduction study, the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP)
    method was introduced for evaluating and selecting non-dominated solutions. The
    construction of the indicator system and the judgment matrix for FAHP were provided
    in the Supplementary Material. Expert judgments were categorized into three preferences:
    ecology-economy-society, economy-ecology-society, and economy-society-ecology.
    The preference “ecology-economy-society” indicated that experts favored ecology
    indicators. The solutions selected by the maximum harmonic mean, knee points,
    and FAHP methods were compared, as summarized in Table 4. The comprehensive evaluation
    value of the non-dominated solutions was calculated using the FAHP method, as
    shown in Fig. S9. The results showed that the maximum harmonic mean and knee points
    methods used in this study yielded solutions similar to those obtained by the
    FAHP method. This indicates that the two decision making methods utilized in this
    study could successfully identify solutions of potential interest to stakeholders
    without inputting subjective preferences. In practical applications, decision-makers
    may struggle to specify preferences when they have limited knowledge of optimal
    objective values. Therefore, the maximum harmonic mean and knee points methods
    used in this study could provide solutions in a concise and efficient manner,
    confirming the superiority applied to multi-objective agricultural GHG mitigation
    study. Table 4. Selected non-dominated solutions. Empty Cell F1 (billion yuan)

    planting structure optimization model for agricultural GHG mitigation was presented.
    Environmental impacts of crop production were measured using the LCA method. Several
    previous literature have made contributions on GHG emissions from crop production.
    For example, Zhang and Zhang (2016) accounted for the carbon footprints of winter
    wheat and summer corn in China''s primary production regions, revealing carbon
    footprints of 5455 and 4052 kgCO2eq/hm2, respectively. Song and Mu (2016) accounted
    for the carbon footprint of facility vegetables in China, finding it to be approximately
    1197 kgCO2eq/hm2. In this study, the carbon footprints of five major crops in
    Bayan Nur City were accounted for, yielding the following results for crop production:
    wheat (2700 kgCO2eq/hm2), corn (2766 kgCO2eq/hm2), sunflower (1838 kgCO2eq/hm2),
    tomato (2913 kgCO2eq/hm2), and melon (1560 kgCO2eq/hm2). Differences in these
    carbon footprint results can be attributed primarily to variations in the selection
    of life cycle and system boundaries. Many studies have commonly assessed the influencing
    factors of agricultural carbon footprint using methods such as SVAR and LMDI (Balogh,
    2019; Ma et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2019; Zhen et al., 2017). Generally, the level
    of economic development has been identified as a key influencing factor for carbon
    footprint growth and was often a significant contributor (Huang and Gao, 2022;
    Zhen et al., 2017). In this study, the results of the influencing factor assessment
    using Kaya-LMDI also showed that the economic development level factor played
    a crucial role in driving changes in the carbon footprint in Bayan Nur City. This
    factor was found to be a substantial contributor to the increase in carbon footprint
    in the region. Previous MOO models aimed at mitigating agricultural GHG emissions
    often fell short of identifying Pareto optimal solutions (Yue and Guo, 2021; Zhang
    et al., 2021a) due to their transformation into single-objective optimization
    models. Even when studies like Ren et al. (2022) and Wang et al. (2021) utilized
    NSGA-Ⅱ to solve MOO models related to planting structure and obtained PF, they
    still faced challenges in selecting solutions from the PF for decision-makers.
    In contrast to prior research, the integration of LCA, Kaya-LMDI and MOO in this
    study could objectively set carbon footprint influencing factors as optimization
    objective functions and assign their importance according to the degree of impact.
    This approach holds the potential to develop more pertinent and effective technological
    solutions for mitigating the agricultural carbon footprint. Furthermore, the integration
    of LCA, MOO, the maximum harmonic mean and knee points methods could not only
    generate the allocation strategies of agricultural land resources from the PF
    and provide them for decision-makers without inputting subjective preferences,
    but also give the environmental impacts of each allocation scheme. Life cycle
    optimization by integrating value-chain decisions from the LCA domain in optimization
    is equally important for mitigating the agricultural carbon footprint. However,
    the consideration of the complete value-chain makes data acquisition more difficult
    (Thakker and Bakshi, 2021), and the need to reasonably identify alternatives at
    each stage of the cyclic network according to the characteristics of the study
    area (You and Wang, 2011), which makes this method highly complex in practical
    application. In addition, uncertainty representations of meta-heuristic algorithms
    have been available in current research to solve problems where parameters have
    interval (Gong et al., 2013, 2014) or fuzzy (Ghasemi, 2013) characteristics to
    make the solutions more robust. These issues may be considered in future research.
    The carbon footprint coefficients of agricultural production in this study were
    obtained from multiple studies, and the localized carbon footprint coefficients
    should be updated continuously in the future to improve the accuracy and validity
    of the optimization results. Additionally, when applying the systematic framework
    proposed in this study, the time series of the data in the study area must be
    longer to increase the reliability of the results. To obtain efficient and accurate
    solutions for adjusting the crop planting structure and reducing the carbon footprint,
    all the above problems deserve consideration. The proposed approach can provide
    a decision-support tool for the Bayan Nur City and other similar regions to reduce
    GHG emissions from agricultural production to ensure ecological protection. 6.
    Conclusions This study presents a AAODM approach for agricultural GHG mitigation.
    It has two major advantages and improvements, as follows: (i) it successfully
    clarified the spatial and temporal variation of the multi-year agricultural carbon
    footprint of multiple crops and incorporated it into planting structure optimization
    models. (ii) It could objectively determine the optimization objective functions
    by assessing the influencing factors of the carbon footprint and provide decision
    making methods after identifying the PF to obtain the optimal planting structure.
    The proposed approach was applied to a case study of agricultural cropping management
    in Bayan Nur City of China to demonstrate its applicability and the main conclusions
    were as follows: The carbon footprint of Bayan Nur City had an overall increasing
    trend, with an average annual growth rate of 3% over the past 20 years. The assessment
    of influencing factors showed that the level of economic development was the key
    factor contributing to the increase in the carbon footprint. With the development
    of Bayan Nur City, the main factor promoting the increase in carbon footprint
    would transition from energy intensity to the level of economic development factors,
    and the main factor inhibiting the increase in carbon footprint would transition
    from the level of economic development to energy structure and energy intensity
    factors. The regulation of the level of economic development would significantly
    influence the agricultural carbon footprint in Bayan Nur City. An efficient reduction
    in carbon footprint could be achieved by adjusting the crop planting structure
    to regulate the economic benefits. Compared with the current cropping structure,
    the optimized Pareto solution set shows that the economic benefits and carbon
    footprint would change in the ranges of −3.6 to 8.7% and −17.1 to −0.4%. Decision
    making methods were used to select solutions from the PF to provide decision-makers
    with two optimal crop cultivation patterns. Solution KP showed that the economic
    benefits and carbon footprint would be decreased by 3.6 and 16.8%, respectively.
    Solution HM showed that the economic benefits would be increased by 2.4% and the
    carbon footprint would be decreased by 10.2%. To evaluate the performance of the
    proposed approach, the comparison with other MOO methods and decision making methods
    were employed. MOPSO was also used to solve the MOO problem in this study. Welch''s
    t-test and Bayesian Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare whether there were
    differences between the results of NSGA-II and MOPSO. The results showed that
    the solutions obtained by NSGA-II was superior to MOPSO in terms of carbon reduction
    in the application of this paper. The FAHP method was introduced to evaluate and
    select the non-dominated solutions. The results showed that the maximum harmonic
    mean and knee points methods were superior to FAHP and could provide solutions
    in a concise and efficient manner without inputting subjective preferences. The
    model''s performance have demonstrated the effectiveness of the methodology proposed
    in this study. In conclusion, by incorporating LCA, Kaya-LMDI, MOO and decision
    making methods into a unified framework, a AAODM approach was developed to provide
    solutions for mitigating agricultural GHG emissions. The effectiveness of the
    proposed approach in addressing GHG emissions problems of the agricultural systems
    has been verified, which also serves as a paradigm for solving other complex systems’
    GHG emissions issues. CRediT authorship contribution statement Yuhan Han: Software,

    References Media Tables Share Abstract A field study was conducted on sugar beet
    during a two-year period to investigate the effects and comparison of different
    irrigation methods and treatments on crop yield, irrigation water use efficiency
    (IWUE), and pan coefficient determination in a semiarid region with limited water
    resources. The experiments were in complete randomized blocks design. Three replications
    were used with different levels of irrigation water amounts (25, 50, 75, and 100%),
    evapotranspiration (ET) of sugar beet seasonal water requirement with surface
    drip tape (SDT), and conventional furrow irrigation method (CFI), with and without
    soil and water monitoring, and comparison with CROPWAT modeling. The variety of
    sugar beet was Rasool. The highest and lowest average irrigation water use efficiencies
    on the basis of root yield with 16.16 and 9 kg / m 3 , and sugar yield with 3.82
    and 1.33 kg / m 3 , for both experimental years was achieved under different irrigation
    treatments of T4 (25% ET) SDT and CFI, respectively. The results of this study
    showed that by using drip tape irrigation method with different treatments (100%
    ET), (75% ET), (50% ET), (25% ET), instead of conventional furrow irrigation method
    with and without soil, water, and root monitoring, (28.8, 46.6, 64.5, and 82.2%)
    and (38.4, 53.8, 69.2, and 84.6%) of sugar beet seasonal irrigation water requirement
    can be saved, respectively. The results also showed that sugar beet average annual
    water, requirement under conventional furrow irrigation method with soil, water,
    and root monitoring was almost 8.4% and 28.70% lower compared to CROPWAT modeling
    and conventional furrow irrigation without monitoring. Additionally, this study
    showed a pan coefficient ( K p ) equal to 0.80 for the investigated semiarid region.
    Introduction Drought stress is the main problem of agriculture improvement in
    the world and in the western parts of Iran, especially Kermanshah province with
    different climate facilities. This province with semiarid climate is one of the
    most important agricultural regions in the country producing sugar beet. Also,
    there are two sugar beet factories with total capacity of 3,500 t per day available
    in this province. Annually, approximately 30,000 ha of croplands in the province
    grow sugar beet. The existing water resources in some parts of Kermanshah province
    are strictly restricted. Also, the increasing water demand for domestic use has
    adverse effects on agricultural development, as the knowledge of local farmers
    on optimal water use is limited and common irrigation methods for most of the
    crops planting, especially sugar beet, are wild flooding, border, basin, and especially
    furrow irrigation methods with very low water efficiency and high water demand.
    Across the province, local farmers have faced several challenges during planting.
    Under such irrigation conditions, sugar beet is regarded as a high water-consuming
    crop, hindering its development in areas with limited water resource availability.
    Sugar beet is insensitive to water stress (Salter and Goode 1967) and tolerates
    moderate soil water stress (Hills et al. 1990). Sugar beet is adapted to a wide
    range of climatic conditions and soil salinity (Katerji et al. 1997). On the other
    hand, controlled deficit irrigation pattern has been shown as an efficient tool
    for further research (Hang and Miller 1986; English and Raja 1996; Pidgeon et
    al. 2001; Tognetti et al. 2003; Shrestha et al. 2010). Until today, much research
    on the effects of deficit irrigation water on quantity and quality of sugar beet
    have been performed in during the last few years by different researchers (Winter
    1980; Amaducci et al. 1989; Bazza and Tayaa 1999; Rahimian and Asadi 2000; Jahadakbar
    et al. 2003; Mahmoodi et al. 2008; Hoffmann et al. 2009; Hassanli et al. 2010).
    Additionally, much research needs to be conducted on sugar beet producing regions
    where sugar beet grows with a shortage of water resources during the growing period.
    Water requirements of sugar beet have not been studied yet for different pressurized
    irrigation systems that have been highly supported financially (US$2,000 per ha)
    by Regional Governmental Agriculture Organization in different parts of the Kermanshah
    province. Therefore, the main objectives of the present study can be summarized
    as: 1. To find and compare the sugar beet seasonal water requirement by different
    irrigation methods, including different surface drip tape treatments, conventional
    furrow irrigation method zwith and without soil, water, root monitoring, and CROPWAT
    modeling. 2. To introduce and propose a simple and suitable pressurized irrigation
    system with higher efficiency and different irrigation strategy instead of conventional
    furrow irrigation method with and without soil, water, and root monitoring. 3.
    To evaluate the effects of different irrigation water deficit strategy on root,
    sugar yield, irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE), and others sugar beet parameters.
    4. To determine the pan ( k p ) coefficient in semiarid regions for easy, quick,
    convenient, and practical estimation of actual evapotranspiration (ET) of sugar
    beet from class A evaporation pan in the investigated region with semiarid climate.
    Materials and Methods Field experiment was performed at the Irrigation and Water
    Resource Engineering Research Field Station at 47°9′N, 34°21′E, and elevation
    of 1,319 m at the College of Agriculture of Razi University in Kermanshah in western
    Iran over two years of crop growing season, from March to September 2006 and 2007.
    The experiments were aimed at investigating the different levels of irrigation
    water requirements of (25, 50, 75, and 100%) ET with surface drip tape (SDT) and
    conventional furrow irrigation method (100% ET), with and without soil, water,
    root monitoring, and CROPWAT modeling. Treatment field trials were arranged in
    randomized complete blocks design with three replicates (Fig. 1). The field climate
    was semiarid. The texture of different experimental field soil depths were Silty

    The values of θ ( fc ) , θ ( pwp ) , and bulk density of each soil depth was determined

    to15 m of the field areas were divided into three similar, equal subplots to apply
    different drip tape and conventional furrow irrigation treatments as shown in
    Fig. 1. Tape tubing with discharge 1.65 L / h , internal diameter of 16.5 mm,
    and emitters spacing at 30 cm, were used for different drip tape irrigation treatments.
    For the purpose of this study, sugar beet (cv. Rasool) was used as crop material.
    The sugar beet seeds were planted on March 12, 2006 and 2007. The planting seed
    density was 83,500 plants per ha in a continuously weed, insect, and disease-controlled
    environment. Different treatments were separated by and 2.5 m distance and a plot
    was foreseen in between treatments to minimize water movement among different
    treatments. Each experimental plot was designed as 15 m × 3 m (five rows per plot),
    and had a total area of 45 m 2 at sowing. The plants were grown 60 cm apart spaced
    20 cm each in rows. Additionally, for comparison of different drip tape irrigation
    treatments with the conventional furrow irrigation systems which used by local
    farmers in the region at the present time, two conventional furrow irrigation
    systems one with and the other without soil, water, root monitoring, were designed
    with a length of 15 m and row and plant spacing of 60 and 20 cm with irrigation
    interval 8 days, trapezoidal in shape, depth 25 cm, and slope of 0.20% during
    the whole growing season with the same as the local farmers irrigation scheduling
    in three replicates. The total concentration of fertilizer of N, P 2 O 5 , and
    K 2 O were 250, 50 and 50 kg / ha , respectively on the basis of soil lab advice.
    Half of N was applied preplanting, whereas the remainder was applied when 4 or
    5 leaves were observed on each plant. During the two experimental years, crop
    actual evapotranspiration under different irrigation treatments were determined
    using soil water balance equation as follows: ETa = ( R + IRD ) ± DS - Dp - Ro
    (1) in which ETa = actual evapotranspiration; R = rainfall; IRD = amount of irrigation
    deficit; DS = changes in soil water storage in the given period; Dp = deep percolation;
    and Ro = run-off. All parameters in Eq. (1) are in millimeters. Ro and deep percolation
    were zero because of drip tape and deficit irrigation treatments. For different
    drip tape experimental treatments, irrigation water was applied at the rates of
    100% ET (full irrigation), 75, 50, and 25% ET at the same day and time, and for
    furrow irrigation treatments, the amount of required irrigation water was applied
    at the rate of 100% ET. For each irrigation time, the net irrigation depth and
    also the irrigation volume of water was determined by using the following equations:
    ND = ( θ fc - θ w ) R × As (2) IRD = ( dn / n ) ( n + 1 ) (3) IRV = ( Dir / Ea
    ) A (4) in which ND = net depth of water required in the root zone (mm); θ fc
    and θ w = soil water contents at field capacity and at measuring time in (%),
    respectively; R = root depth (mm); As = bulk density ( g / cm 3 ); IRD = net irrigation
    water requirement at the irrigation time (mm); dn = net water required for providing
    the soil water deficit to field capacity condition in the root zone (mm); n =
    number of different days between the final and soil water measuring irrigation
    day; IRV = volume of irrigation water (L); Dir = net water requirement at the
    beginning of irrigation period (mm) or one day after soil water measurement (mm);
    and Ea = application efficiency. For the average Ea determination in different
    surface drip tape and furrow surface irrigation treatments, further experiments
    were carried out and Ea were determined by using the following equation: E a =
    V c + V s V r (5) in which Ea = application efficiency; Vs ( m 3 ) and Vc ( m
    3 ) = volume of water storage and the volume of water used in root zone, respectively;
    and Vr ( m 3 ) = volume of gross water applied between two irrigation intervals
    for drip tape irrigation method. The volume of water used in the root zone was
    determined by using of the relation below: V c = ( K c × E pan × K p ) × A (6)
    in which V c = volume of water used in root zone; and K c , E pan , and K p are
    crop coefficients, evaporation from Class A pan and pan coefficients. The values
    of K c and K p were selected from Allen et al. (1998) and Alizadeh (2002), respectively.
    The volume of water storage ( m 3 ) was determined by using the relation below:
    V s = D S × A (7) in which Vs = volume of water storage D S = ( P 2 - P 1 ) ×
    As × D / 100 (8) D s = equivalent depth of irrigation water storage in each soil
    layer in the root zone (m); P2-P1 is difference percentage of soil moisture in
    each soil layer before and after of each irrigation; As = each soil layer bulk
    density ( kg / m 3 ); D = different soil layer depths ( m ); and A = area under
    drip tape irrigation ( m 2 ). V r ( m 3 ) = volume of gross irrigation water applied
    between two irrigation intervals, which is measured by flow meter. The average
    Ea for surface furrow irrigation treatments was determined by using following
    equation: E a = V n Q × T c o (9) in which Ea = application efficiency; V n (
    m 3 ) = net irrigation water used between two irrigation periods; Q = discharge
    entrance to furrow in ( m 3 / min ), which is measured by flume; and T c o = final
    irrigation period in min. V n ( m 3 ) was determined from this formula: V n =
    Z req × A (10) Z req = ( θ fc - θ w ) R × As (11) in which Z req , θ fc , and
    θ w are net depth of water required in the root zone (m), the soil water contents
    at field capacity, and at measuring time in (%), respectively; R = root depth
    (m); As = bulk density of each layer ( kg / m 3 ); and A = area under furrow irrigation
    ( m 2 ). The average Ea for different tape and furrow irrigation treatments was
    determined as 90% and 80% separately (data not shown). For soil water content
    measurement, the soil samples for each treatment were taken from three replicate
    plots at depth intervals of 30 cm during each second irrigation. The samples from
    depths 0–30, 30–60 and 60–90 cm were taken from middle of tape laterals, and sugar
    beet rows. For each treatment from each 30 cm root depth, only one replicate was
    taken. The number of the samples for each treatment was different on the basis
    of the root depth growth. All samples were immediately weighed and oven-dried
    at 105°C during 24 h, then the soil moisture content ( θ w ) was measured for
    each treatment by using the gravimetric method. For sugar beet root depth determination,
    the profile wall method was used. For this reason, for each replication in each
    treatment, a profile with depth of 1 m and 30 cm away from the plant rows was
    dug. During each measurement at least three plants from each profile were selected
    for root depth measurement by metal ruler. Finally, for different drip tape and
    furrow irrigation treatments, every three and eight days, the volume of irrigation
    water was measured and applied by flow meters installed in the delivering pipes,
    1 L on the basis of Eq. (4). Irrigation water use efficiency on the basis of root
    and sugar yield was calculated as root and sugar yield as follows: IWUE = Y a
    I a (12) in which IWUE = irrigation water use efficiency ( kg / m 3 ); Y a = root
    or sugar yield ( kg / ha ); and Ia is the actual irrigation water applied in mm.
    All daily ET pan data were collected and ETo was calculated by using all daily
    meteorological data obtained from Synoptic Kermanshah meteorological station,
    which is located 1 km from the experimental station, and with the Cropwat Windows
    (Version 8) program (Allen et al. 2009). This program uses the FAO Penman—Monteith
    equation to calculate ETo. Crop water requirements were estimated by using the
    CROPWAT modeling (Penman–Monteith method), and were on the basis of 55 years of
    historical data from Synoptic Kermanshah meteorological station. Long time series
    were chosen for study because the long-period data show the usual climate of a
    region better than short-period data. The amount of rainfall was recorded during
    the two year experimental periods. Average long-term historical climate, soil,
    and crop data for the study area were input to the CROPWAT modeling. Crop data
    included crop type, sowing and harvesting dates, and four distinct growth stages
    for semiarid regions (Allen et al. 1998). However, at the investigation region,
    the length of the growing season was 190 days (not 205 days). Therefore, the modification
    on the basis of different parameters such as the percentage of canopy ground cover,
    and local experience, was applied for different sugar beet growth stages, including
    initial, development, mid- and late-periods 55, 50, 45, and 40 days, respectively.
    The pan coefficient ( k p ) was estimated with the following equation: K p = E
    T o E T pan (13) Adequate plants were hand-harvested randomly from each plot selecting
    five rows of 10 m in each year for yield components. Sugar yields, percentage
    of sugar content, and all other parameters were determined in the laboratory of
    Islamabad sugar beet factory (55 km distance from experimental station). The data
    were analyzed in terms of variance (ANOVA) by using statistical analysis system
    followed by Duncan’s multiple range tests, and terms were considered significant
    at P < 0.05 and 0.01 by MSTAT-C software. Results and Discussion Irrigation Water
    Use After crop establishment and during the crop growing period, the total irrigation
    water use for different treatments of surface drip tape method consisted of T1
    (100% ET), T2 (75% ET), T3 (50% ET), T4 (25% ET), and for conventional furrow
    irrigation treatment (100% ET), with soil, water, and root monitoring; total rainfall
    for both experimental years of 2006 and 2007, and estimated water requirement
    by CROPWAT modeling are presented in Table 3. As Table 3 shows, for the SDT control
    treatment T1 (100% ET), the total gross irrigation water uses were 9,666.5 and
    9 , 969.3 m 3 / ha for 2006 and 2007. The lowest irrigation water uses for 2006
    and 2007 were 2,416.6 and 2 , 492.3 m 3 / ha for treatments T4 (25% ET). For conventional
    irrigation treatments with monitoring, the total gross irrigation water uses were
    11,042 and 11 , 696 m 3 / ha for 2006 and 2007. The irrigation water requirement
    by using CROPWAT modeling were 12 , 410 m 3 / ha for both two experimental years
    2006 and 2007. Table 3. Comparison of Quantitative and Qualitative Parameters

    within the same column and factors, followed by the same letter using Duncan’s
    multiple range test are not significantly different ( P < 0.01 ). As shown in
    Table 3, the average less irrigation water use or water saving for different drip
    tape treatments T1 (100% ET), T2 (75% ET), T3 (50% ET), and T4 (25% ET) compared
    to conventional furrow irrigation treatment with soil, water, and root monitoring
    for both experimental years 2006 and 2007 were 13.7, 35.2, 56.8, and 78.4%, respectively.
    The comparison of results in Table 3 also shows that the average less irrigation
    water used or water saving for different drip tape treatments T1 (100%ET), T2
    (75%ET), T3 (50%ET), T4 (25%ET), and conventional furrow irrigation compared to
    CROPWAT modeling using the 55 year historical climatologically data were 28.8,
    46.6, 64.5, 82.2 and 26.7%. For the conventional furrow irrigation method without
    soil, water, and root monitoring, the average amount of total applied water for
    both experimental years 2006 and 2007 was 15 , 950 m 3 / ha , which is almost
    6 , 132.1 m 3 (38.4%), 8 , 586.6 m 3 (53.8%), 11 , 041.10 m 3 (69.2%), 13 , 495.6
    m 3 (84.6%), and 4 , 581 m 3 (28.70%) more than total irrigation water applied
    for different drip tape treatments T1 (100%ET), T2 (75%ET), T3 (50%ET), T4 (25%ET)
    and conventional furrow irrigation with monitoring. The results of total irrigation
    water applied by different irrigation methods show that there are big differences
    between sugar beet water consumption (conventional method) by local farmers without
    enough knowledge compared to different surface drip tape treatments and surface
    irrigation method with soil, water, and root depth monitoring. Moreover, in the
    point view of limited water resources available in semiarid area, the results
    show the benefits of seasonal irrigation application by using simple pressurized
    method such as drip tape and local conventional furrow irrigation with soil, water,
    and root monitoring compared to custom and conventional sugar beet irrigation
    with eight days interval by the local farmers and CROPWAT modeling, as shown by
    comparison in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Average percent of water saving for different irrigation
    methods and strategies compared to CROPWAT modeling and conventional furrow irrigation
    with and without monitoring Root and Sugar Yield and Water Use Efficiency The
    results of total sugar beet root and sugar yield and irrigation water use efficiencies
    on the basis of root and sugar yield for all treatments and their Duncan test
    classes for two experimental years 2006 and 2007 are given in Table 3. The results
    show maximum root yields with 120.73 and 108.90 t / ha , and minimum root yields
    with 40.40 and 38.90 t / ha , were achieved under different treatments, conventional
    furrow irrigation with monitoring (100% ET) and drip tape treatment T4 (25% ET)
    for 2006 and 2007. The average sugar beet yield in Iran reported by Food and Agriculture
    Organization (FAO) (2002) as 29 t / ha . Therefore, the results show that in all
    experimental treatments, the yield of sugar beet was much higher than yields reported
    by FAO. The maximum sugar yields of 15.71 and 15.39 t / ha and minimum sugar yields
    of 9.58 and 9.14 t / ha were achieved under different drip tape treatments, T1
    (100% ET) and T4 (25% ET), for 2006 and 2007 respectively. The total results of
    root yield, root irrigation water use efficiency, sugar yield, and sugar irrigation
    water use efficiency for experimental years 2006 and 2007 are presented in Table
    3. The results show that the effects of different irrigation treatments on irrigation
    water use efficiency on the basis of root and sugar yield were significant ( P
    < 0.01 ) for both experimental years, taking into account their Duncan test classes.
    The highest average root irrigation water use efficiency with 16.72 and 15.61
    kg / m 3 , and the lowest with 10.93 and 7.05 kg / m 3 , were obtained under different
    treatments (T4 25% ET; and CFI 100% ET) for the years 2006 and 2007, respectively.
    The investigation showed that the primary reasons for strong root yield reduction
    during the second year (2007) probably could be attributed to higher average temperature
    (increase of 0.81°C) and 44 days of dusty air condition during the growing period,
    which resulted in lower sugar beet photosynthesis and yield compared to experimental
    year 2006. The highest and lowest average sugar irrigation water use efficiency
    with, 3.97 and 1.38 kg / m 3 for year 2006 and 3.67 and 1.27 kg / m 3 for year
    2007 were found for drip tape treatment T4 (25% ET) and CFI. A comparison of results
    showed a higher yield for both root and sugar water use efficiency for different
    drip tape irrigation treatments compared to conventional furrow surface irrigation,
    probably attributable to better and higher uniform water and nutrient distribution.
    Fig. 3 shows the average root and sugar irrigation water use efficiency for different
    irrigation methods and strategies. The average root and sugar beet irrigation
    water use efficiencies for different surface drip tape irrigation methods are
    higher than conventional furrow irrigation with monitoring. The sequence for average
    root irrigation water use efficiency was 16.17 kg / m 3 > 13.60 kg / m 3 > 11.85
    > kg / m 3 > 10.74 kg / m 3 > 9 kg / m 3 for different surface drip tape treatments
    T4 (25% ET), T3 (50% ET), T2 (75% ET), T1 (100% ET), and conventional furrow irrigation
    with monitoring. The sequence for average sugar irrigation water use efficiency
    was 3.82 kg / m 3 > 2.40 kg / m 3 > 1.87 > kg / m 3 > 1.59 kg / m 3 > 1.33 kg
    / m 3 for different surface drip tape treatments T4 (25% ET), T3 (50% ET), T2
    (75% ET), T1 (100% ET), and conventional furrow irrigation with monitoring, respectively.
    Fig. 3. Average root and sugar irrigation water use efficiency for different irrigation
    methods and strategies Panahei et al. (2006) conducted three years of lysimetric
    investigation and found an average annual sugar beet water requirement 10 , 660
    m 3 / ha . They reported that the total average root, sugar yield, and sugar percentage
    was 49.9, 6.37 t / ha , and 15.10%. They obtained a water use efficiency 5.01
    and 0.49 kg / m 3 for root and sugar yield. Hosainpoor et al. (2006) reported
    significant differences between different drip and surface sugar beet irrigation
    performances. They found the greatest root and sugar yield 83.05 and 9.34 t /
    ha for furrow surface irrigation (100%) and 71.16 and 8.73 t / ha for drip irrigation
    (50%). They found the lowest water use efficiency of 6.14 and 0.69 kg / m 3 on
    the basis of root and sugar for furrow, and highest water use efficiency of 18.3
    and 2.29 kg / m 3 on the basis of root and sugar for drip irrigation 50%. They
    reported total amounts of water uses of 3,923.5, 4,927.50, 6,068.50, and 13 ,
    528 m 3 / ha for 50, 75, 100% drip, and 100% furrow irrigation, respectively.
    Mirzaei and Firozabadi (2007) reported the lowest and highest water use efficiencies
    of 0.6 and 1.19 kg / m 3 for sugar beet plantation for drip (50%) and furrow (100%)
    irrigation systems. They found a total amount of water use equal to 5,679, 7,301,
    8,932, and 14 , 886 m 3 / ha for 50, 75, 100% drip irrigation, and 100% furrow
    irrigation, respectively. Shahabifar and Rahimian (2008) investigated three year
    lysimetric records of sugar beet performance. They reported that the total amount
    of sugar beet water use was 12 , 210 m 3 / ha whereas total sugar beet yield was
    56.50 t / ha with sugar percentage of 17.8%, and total water use efficiency 4.627
    and 0.823 kg / m 3 on the basis of root and sugar beet yield. Hassanli et al.
    (2010) reported that the highest root yield 79.7 t / ha was obtained by using
    surface drip irrigation, whereas the lowest root yield 41.4 t / ha was obtained
    by using furrow irrigation and fresh water. The highest irrigation water use efficiency
    in root yield production 9 kg / m 3 was obtained by using surface drip irrigation
    with effluence, whereas the lowest value 3.8 kg / m 3 by using furrow irrigation
    with fresh water. The highest IWUE of 1.26 kg / m 3 for sugar was obtained by
    using surface drip irrigation. Winter (1980) reported a high sugar root yield
    of 76.6 t / ha with total water use 10 , 100 m 3 / ha . Hills et al. (1990) found
    a water requirement of 11 , 850 m 3 / ha for sugar beet. Fabeiro et al. (2003)
    reported a significant difference of sugar beet water use efficiencies under different
    drip irrigation systems. Tognetti et al. (2003) reported that yield responses
    of sugar beets to drip irrigation with 75% of estimated ET matched in most cases
    those of low-pressure sprinkler irrigated with 100% of estimated ET, resulting
    in a potential 25% of water volume saving. The results obtained by this research
    and other similar studies have shown that root, sugar, and total water use efficiency
    vary on the basis of root and sugar yields owing to different reasons, including
    different irrigation water supply methods, soil type, climatological conditions,
    and different sugar beet water deficit resistance variety use. The results of
    this research showed that irrigation water consumption by sugar beet under different
    drip tape systems were lower, and water use efficiency was higher compared to
    the preceding results and results obtained by Winter (1989), Amaducci et al. (1989),
    Bazza and Tayaa (1999), Rahimian and Asadi (2000), Jahadakbar et al. (2003), Mohammadian
    et al. (2008) and Hoffmann et al. (2009). The lower water use and higher root
    and sugar yield obtained in this research can be attributed to higher drip tape
    irrigation efficiency, uniform water, and nutrient distribution in sugar beet
    root zone. The results of this study showed that sugar beet is well adapted to
    drip tape irrigation method. Therefore, farmers may consider using this system
    that is supported financially (US$2,000 per ha) by Regional Governmental Agriculture
    Organization for sugar beet production, to increase their yield and irrigation
    water use efficiency and renew their fields irrigation systems. Comparison of
    Different Sugar Beet Quality Parameters All measured sugar beet quality parameters
    under different irrigation treatments for two experimental years are shown in
    Table 4. The results show that by increasing water deficit, the sugar percentage
    increased. The lowest and highest sugar percentage, 12.62 and 23.73%) for 2006,
    and 13.68 and 23.53% for 2007, were achieved under different treatments drip tape
    T4 (25% ET) and conventional furrow irrigation. The results showed that the effects
    of different irrigation treatments on sugar percentage were significant ( P <
    0.01 ), and 75% of water deficit under different drip tape irrigation methods
    caused an increase of 8.93% of sugar percentage for both experimental years. Significant
    differences were found for sugar percentage between all treatments in 2006 and
    2007. Our results were different from results reported by Noorjo and Baghaekia
    (2004). They reported that 16.50% of water deficit caused a 13.3% increase of
    sugar percentage. Table 4. Comparison of Quantitative and Qualitative Parameters

    within the same column and factors, followed by the same letter using Duncan’s
    multiple range test, are not significantly different ( P < 0.01 ). Water deficit
    had a negative affect on the molasses sugar percentage. No significant difference
    was found between molasses sugar content for different treatments in 2006 and
    2007. No significant difference was found for the quantity of Na, K, N, and (
    N + K ) / Na of root for 2006 and 2007. As revealed by the results of this study,
    water deficit had a negative affect on the quantity of Na and the ratio of ( N
    + K ) / Na , whereas it has a positive affect on the quantity of K and N for 2006
    and 2007. Water deficit also had a negative affect on root alkalinity. The highest
    and lowest root alkalinity levels were obtained for different drip tape treatments
    T1 (100% ET) and T4 (25% ET), with 2.64 and 1.37 for 2006, and 2.46 and 1.17 for
    2007. Water deficit had a negative and significant ( p < 0.01 ) affect on the
    root length. The lowest and highest sugar beet root lengths were achieved for
    drip tape treatment T4 (25% ET) and conventional furrow irrigation with monitoring,
    with 25.4 and 50.40 cm for 2006, and 29 and 44.66 cm for 2007. The results of
    this research showed that the affect of water stress on sugar percentage and other
    different sugar beet quality parameters were similar to those reported previously
    (Carter 1986; Winter 1989; Rahimian and Asadi 2000; Fabeiro et al. 2003; Jahadakbar
    et al. 2003; Noorjoo and Baghaiikia 2004; Hossainpoor et al. 2006; Mohmoodi et
    al. 2008; Hoffmann et al. 2009). Pan Coefficients The seasonal k p value for this
    study was 0.80 as shown in Fig. 4, with the relationship equation y = 0.80 x and
    R 2 = 0.88 . The relationship for these values was statistically significant (
    p < 0.01 ). The k p value of 0.80 obtained in this study is different from the
    proposed range of values (0.35 and 0.85) reported in FAO 56 by Allen et al. (1998),
    and close to 0.79 as reported by Panahei et al. (2006). According to the results,
    the value of 0.80 for class A pan evaporation can be an acceptable and practical
    value for the actual evapotranspiration of sugar beet under semiarid climate condition.
    Fig. 4. The relationship between seasonal evapotranspiration (pan, measured; o,
    calculated) Conclusions As a result of a two-year field study on sugar beet in
    a semiarid region, sugar beet is well suited to drip tape irrigation methods compared
    to conventional furrow irrigation method for water saving and root and sugar water
    use efficiencies. Therefore, farmers may consider using these methods that are
    supported financially (US$2,000 per ha) by Regional Governmental Agriculture Organization
    for sugar beet production, to increase their irrigation efficiency and their yield
    instead of conventional furrow irrigation. It was concluded that drip tape irrigation
    method with different water supply treatments is a simple and suitable method
    to propose for sugar beet production by local farmers in semiarid regions with
    limited available water resources. The results emphasize that treatment T1 (100%
    ET) (full irrigated) with 38.4% of water saving compared to conventional furrow
    irrigation without monitoring method can be proposed for sugar beet grown in semiarid
    regions with sufficient water resources available. Moreover, treatment T2 (75%
    ET) surface drip tape with 53.8% water saving, compared to conventional furrow
    irrigation method without monitoring and higher root and sugar water use efficiency,
    compared to T1 (100% ET) can be proposed in area with partially limited water
    resources, because sugar beet can tolerate moderate soil water stress in areas.
    The results also showed that in the areas with moderately severe water resources
    restrictions, the reasonable treatment T3 (50% ET) with 69.2% water saving might
    be feasible. By using of those described irrigation methods and strategies, conventional
    low water efficiency irrigation method can be renewed and more irrigation water
    can be saved. This also leads to an increase of more land under sugar beet cultivation,
    job creation, and local farmers revenues. This study showed that by using drip
    tape irrigation method with different treatments (100% ET), (75% ET), (50% ET),
    and (25% ET) instead of conventional furrow irrigation method with and without
    soil, water, and root monitoring, (28.8, 46.6, 64.5, 82.2%) and (38.4, 53.8, 69.2,
    84.6%) of sugar beet seasonal irrigation water requirement can be saved, respectively.
    The results also showed that sugar beet average annual water requirement under
    conventional furrow irrigation method with soil, water, and root monitoring was
    almost 8.40% and 28.70% lower compared to CROPWAT modeling and conventional furrow
    irrigation without monitoring, which shows the benefits of soil, water, and root
    monitoring for water saving. The pan coefficients (kp) were determined to be 0.80
    in the semiarid investigated region. According to the results, 0.80 class A pan
    evaporation can be acceptable for quick, convenient, and practical estimation
    of actual evapotranspiration for sugar beet from class A evaporation pan under
    semiarid climate condition. Acknowledgments The writers wish to thank Razi University

  description: To mitigate the unfavorable effects of excessive water resources consumption,
    mainly induced by poor performance of irrigation practices, efficient water resource
    management strategies are required. In response to this need, we have, in an innovative
    way, enhanced the water resources management (WRM) strategies by both considering
    the regional conditions with the graph model for a conflict resolution (GMCR)
    decision support system, and linking the irrigation concept and water resources
    allocation theory to develop a coupled WRM simulation–optimization model. Typically,
    implementation of the modified WRM strategies may cause local conflicts because
    of losing the original water rights. To improve the current irrigation water allocation
    system with the minimum objections, the hypergame theory was utilized to enhance
    the capabilities of traditional GMCR models by including the parties’ misunderstandings
    in the negotiation process and assessing the partial perceptions rather than crisp
    options. Moreover, by dynamic monitoring of available water resources and water
    consumption patterns, a WRM simulation model was developed, which is applicable
    in real agricultural conditions of multi-agricultural zones with multi-crop and
    intercropping systems and variable water supply sources. The genetic algorithm
    was utilized to allocate the water resources and determine optimal WRM strategies
    with the lowest irrigation water shortage. The efficiency of the proposed framework
    was assessed in conventional agricultural zones in Oman. The recommended strategies
    not only address local conflicts during the implementation of optimal WRM strategies,
    but also demonstrate significant potential to reduce the water shortage as a serious
    environmental concern.

    Efficient water resources management (WRM) strategies are essential to achieve
    sustainable agricultural production, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. The
    poor performance of conventional surface irrigation systems has led to increasing
    water scarcity and, thus highlights the need for more efficient WRM practices.
    In order to alleviate the environmental degradations, caused by over allocation
    of water resources for agricultural purposes, a wide variety of WRM strategies
    have been developed to mitigate the losses of valuable water resources (Klocke
    et al. 2006; Agarwal et al. 2019; Mohammadrezapour et al. 2019). The provided
    WRM strategies should be applicable considering both operational and regional
    limitations of the end users such as the farmers. Hence, it is crucial to develop
    optimal WRM strategies that can properly simulate real farm conditions and yield
    a straightforward irrigation scheduling. Moreover, the proposed strategies should
    consider the existing regional conditions to achieve a compromise resolution compatible
    with possible local conflicts caused by restricted irrigation water rights or
    forces on the farmers (as stakeholders) to change their irrigation systems. Simulation–optimization
    models have been extensively used in previous studies to determine WRM strategies
    (Fotakis, and Sidiropoulos 2014; Davijani et al. 2016; Lalehzari et al. 2016;
    Li et al. 2016; Habteyes, and Ward 2020; Yazdian et al. 2021). The majority of
    the developed models seek for the highest crop yields with the least possible
    destructive environmental effects (e.g., water consumption). However, when it
    comes to irrigation problems, the irrigation water is only determined in volume
    terms (e.g., Klocke et al. 2006; Lalehzari et al. 2016; Li et al., 2017, 2020)
    or assumed as predefined values (Dai and Li 2013), which is infeasible in real
    conditions and impractical from the farmers’ viewpoint. As a result, to achieve
    a practical outcome, more functional WRM strategies should be developed that determine
    irrigation duration and frequencies according to the type of irrigation system.
    The social aspect of adopting WRM strategies has been investigated by several
    studies using different approaches. Several studies have used conflict resolution
    models (e.g., game theory and agent-based model) to explore the conflicts related
    to the implementation of WRM strategies and provide sustainable management strategies
    (Gopalakrishnan et al. 2005; Hipel et al. 2008; He et al. 2014; Sedghamiz et al.
    2018; Pluchinotta et al. 2018; Yue et al. 2020; Mirzaei and Zibaei 2021; Villanueva
    and Glenk 2021; Dai et al. 2022; Okura et al. 2022). Among the proposed models,
    the graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR) has shown notable success in providing
    a stable strategy as a resolution to the arisen water allocation conflicts (e.g.,
    Kilgour and Eden 2010; Mehrparvar et al. 2020; Rêgo et al. 2021). Despite all
    the benefits, the original form of GMCR is barely capable of modeling complex
    situations such as managing limited resources or introducing reforms from above
    to the working class of society, which is surrounded by misperceived strategies
    and beliefs (Aljefri et al. 2017a, b, 2019; Hipel et al. 2020). In this respect,
    GMCR has been improved by Aljefri et al. (2017a) who implemented a hypergame approach
    to involve the stakeholders’ misperceptions (Hipel et al. 1988; Aljefri et al.
    2017a, 2018b). The enhanced GMCR results a more realistic resolution to the conflict,
    which ensures the viability of the obtained WRM strategies. In the present study,
    a WRM simulation–optimization model is developed to determine the WRM strategies
    including the optimal irrigation durations and frequencies for multi-crop and
    intercropping systems. The applicability of the developed strategies is assessed
    using an enhanced GMCR decision support system. In fact, the developed model attempted
    to fulfill the shortcoming of previous studies with the help of the following
    procedures: 1. Developing a water resources management (WRM) simulation model
    in the MATLAB® environment which is capable of (i) allocating water resources
    among several agricultural zones with selected irrigation methods (e.g., surface
    or pressurized irrigation systems) considering (ii) multi-crop and intercropping
    systems and (iii) variations in the capacity of available water resources over
    the crop growing period under (iii) different climatic conditions categorized
    as drought classes. 2. Determining the exact optimal values of irrigation durations
    and frequencies in the form of a WRM strategy which can be directly applied by
    the local farmers, coupling the genetic algorithm (GA) with the WRM simulation
    model. 3. Modeling the strategic decision-making process by identifying the possible
    options from all stakeholders’ perceptions and examining the conflicts that may
    arise in the time of implementing the proposed irrigation schedule, to determine
    the compromise WRM strategies using the GMCR-plus decision support system (Kinsara
    et al. 2015), improved by the hypergame theory. To summarize, the developed model
    attempts to combine the different options, which is well-suited for all stakeholders’
    interests, and propose a sustainable WRM strategy for mitigation of water shortage
    as an indicator of the model''s usefulness. The framework was tested in an ancient
    water supply system known as Al-Aswad falaj (elaborated in the case study section
    and the supplementary information (SI), section S.2) in Muscat, Oman, with three
    agricultural zones and multi-crop and intercropping systems. 2 Methodology The
    proposed methodology to obtain efficient WRM strategies is presented in Fig. 1.
    The implemented methodology is described in the following sections. Fig. 1 Flowchart
    of the proposed WRM simulation–optimization model which is enhanced by dynamic
    GMCR to determine compromise optimal WRM strategies with a focus on agricultural
    purposes Full size image 2.1 Collect Available Data and Information The following
    data was collected in the study area being required to investigate the regional
    availability of water supply and the irrigational water demands: 1. Number of
    existing farms and different crop types cultivated under the intercropping system,
    2. Cultivated area, number of perennial trees, and the fraction of different crops
    and trees in the intercropping system, 3. Historical data of climatic parameters
    obtained from the local weather station 4. Soil and crop characteristics in the
    area, such as field capacity (FC), permanent wilting point (PWP), soil bulk density,
    crops’ root depth, and maximum allowable depletion, for all farms, 5. The efficiencies
    of water conveyance and irrigation were measured to estimate the gross irrigation
    depth (FAO 1979), 6. And finally, the historical data of monthly water resource
    flow. A majority of the required data was taken through several field trips, land
    surveying, and discussions with local farmers and experts. A combination of geographic
    information system (GIS), Google Earth, and on-ground surveying was also used
    to determine the number of trees and other crops. Moreover, the soil characteristics
    were measured by extensive laboratory experiments, including the “Bulk Density
    Test”, “Hydrometer Test” for soil texture, and “Pressure Plate Test” (SI, Section
    S.5). 2.2 Determine the Required Parameters in WRM Simulation Model The developed
    simulation model determines the following parameters to measure the irrigation
    water shortage as a difference between available water resources and the water
    demand and provide appropriate irrigation scheduling. 1. Effective rainfall was
    one of the required parameters that plays a supplementary role in meeting the
    crops’ water requirements, especially in arid zones with limited surface/groundwater
    resources. In this study, the historical rainfall data were collected from the
    Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Water Resources, Oman (responsible authority),
    and the amount of effective rainfall was derived from the average values calculated
    by three methods, namely dependable rain, empirical formula, and USDA soil conservation
    service (SI, section S.1). 2. As another decisive parameter, the flow from available
    water resources (the falaj system in this study, SI, section S.2) was included
    in the developed simulation model. The simulated flow was considered a monthly
    variable and compatible with the prevailing climate condition. Therefore, the
    standardized streamflow index (SSI) drought indicator was utilized to classify
    the historical data of water resource flow and determine the possible draught
    classes in the area based on eleven drought classes defined by the Hydroclimate
    Research Lab of the University of California, Irvine (UCI) (2018). The developed
    optimization model determined different WRM strategies for all possible draught
    classes, for which the ranges are shown in Table 1. 3. The water demand of agricultural
    zones was also determined according to the FAO Penman–Monteith method and crop
    coefficients (Allen et al. 1998; Zotarelli et al. 2010) (SI, section S.3). The
    effective irrigation water depth to meet the crops’ water requirements was limited
    by the irrigation net depth (dnet). The dnet (SI, Section S.4) was calculated
    according to the crop type and soil water contents (field capacity and permanent
    wilting point), which were measured by a proper number of field sampling considering
    the area of agricultural zones and extensive laboratory experiments including
    the pressure plate test (SI, Section S.5). Table 1 The drought classes and their
    related SSI range (adopted from the hydroclimate research lab of UCI, 2018) Full
    size table 2.3 Obtain Optimal Water Resources Management (WRM) Strategies The
    developed optimization model utilizes the genetic algorithm (GA) optimization
    engine to determine the required IS for WRM strategies by optimally allocating
    the irrigation water among different agricultural zones and minimizing the relative
    irrigation water shortage (Eq. 1). To achieve reliable WRM strategies, the annual
    water shortage was calculated considering varying monthly water supply and demand
    parameters, and also the differences of possible drought classes. Hence, the developed
    model provides different WRM strategies for specific drought classes. $$ \\min
    \\,DIF = \\sum\\limits_{m = 1}^{12} {\\left| {\\sum\\limits_{z = 1}^{{N_{z} }}
    {\\frac{{IrrA_{m}^{z} - IrrN_{m}^{z} }}{{IrrN_{m}^{z} }}} } \\right|} \\quad \\forall
    \\,\\,IrrA_{m}^{z} < \\,\\,IrrN_{m}^{z} $$ (1) As shown in Eq. (1), the relative
    irrigation water shortage was determined as a summation of the relative difference
    of the irrigation water applied to the zone z in mth month (\\(IrrA_{m}^{z}\\))
    and its corresponding water demand (\\(IrrN_{m}^{z}\\)) in millimeters, for total
    number of agricultural zones (\\(N_{z}\\)) over the 12 months of the year. The
    \\(IrrN_{m}^{z}\\) is calculated using Eq. (2). $$ IrrN_{m}^{\\,z} = \\,\\frac{{DEM_{Total}^{m,\\,z}
    \\times D_{m} }}{{A_{land}^{z} }} $$ (2) Here, the \\(IrrN_{m}^{z}\\) is calculated
    by multiplying the total water demand of zone z in mth month (\\(DEM_{total}^{m,z}\\),
    mm3/day) and the number of days in mth month (Dm, day) divided by the area of
    zone z (\\(Area_{\\,land}^{\\,z}\\), mm2). As explained in SI, section S.3, the
    \\(DEM_{total}^{m,z}\\) is calculated considering the monthly crop evapotranspiration
    for all the available crops. The crop evapotranspiration is a function of the
    reference evapotranspiration value in the area. The \\(IrrA_{m}^{z}\\) is also
    determined as shown in Eq. (3). $$ IrrA_{m}^{\\,z} = (AppW_{m}^{\\,z} \\times
    IrrF_{m} ) \\times IrrfC \\times IrrfA $$ (3) The \\(IrrA_{m}^{z}\\) is actually
    a function of irrigation water amount applied to the zone z in each irrigation
    duration in mth month (\\(AppW_{m}^{z}\\), mm), which is limited to the maximum
    value of irrigation net depth (dnet), the irrigation frequency in mth month (\\(IrrF_{m}\\)),
    and the conveyance efficiency (\\(IrrfC\\)) and irrigation application efficiency
    (\\(IrrfA\\)) factor. The \\(AppW_{m}^{z}\\) is considered equal to the actual
    amount irrigated water until reaching the value of corresponding irrigation net
    depth: $$ AppW_{m}^{z} = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {AppI_{m}^{z} \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,if\\,AppI_{m}^{z}
    \\le d_{net}^{z,\\,m} } \\\\ {d_{net}^{z} \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,if\\,AppI_{m}^{z}
    > d_{net}^{z,\\,m} } \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right. $$ (4) where: \\(AppI_{m}^{z}\\):
    Irrigation water applied to zone z in each irrigation duration in mth month (mm).
    \\(d_{net}^{z,\\,m}\\): irrigation net depth of zone z in mth month (mm). In this
    study, the \\(AppI_{m}^{z}\\) of every month in each farming zone (Eq. 5) is calculated
    for each unit of the zone area (\\(Area_{land}^{z}\\)) by multiplying the Flow
    in mth month (, mm3/day) plus the amount of effective rainfall (\\(P_{eff,m}\\),
    mm/month) and the chosen irrigation duration of zone z in mth month (\\(IrrD_{m}^{z}\\),
    day). $$ AppI_{m}^{z} = \\frac{{Dis_{m} \\times IrrD_{m}^{z} }}{{Area_{land}^{z}
    }} + \\frac{{P_{eff,m} \\times IrrD_{m}^{z} }}{{D_{m} }} $$ (5) Finally, the irrigation
    frequencies are controlled to stay feasible using the following equation: $$ IrrIF_{m}
    \\le \\left[ {\\frac{{D_{m} }}{{\\sum\\limits_{z = 1}^{{N_{z} }} {IrrD_{m}^{z}
    } }}} \\right] $$ (6) Accordingly, given the irrigation method, the proposed WRM
    strategies provides an irrigation scheduling (IS) which consists of (an) irrigation
    duration(s) (\\({\\text{IrrD}}_{{\\text{m}}}^{{\\text{z}}}\\)) for each zone and
    two irrigation frequencies (IrrFm) for normal and peak growth periods, which are
    computed by the GA optimization model as the decision variables. The obtained
    parameters at different simulation stages were compared with the results obtained
    from available valid simulation engines. As an example, the crop water requirements
    determined by the developed model were compared with the results of the CROPWAT
    decision support tool (SI, section S.7). The developed model was then utilized
    to determine three different values of water shortages for related types of IS.
    First of all, current (traditional) IS was applied within the simulation model
    to analyze the existing water shortage. Next, an optimal IS was developed with
    the current surface irrigation system to assess its efficiency in reducing the
    water shortage. This IS consists of one irrigation duration and two irrigation
    frequencies, which differ among the possible drought classes, and can be easily
    applied by the local farmers. At the final stage, the model was adjusted by the
    characteristics of an improved flexible irrigation system (e.g., pressurized irrigation
    system), and the optimal IS compatible with the modified irrigation system was
    identified to assess its superiority over two former types of IS. 2.4 Develop
    the WRM Strategies and Assess The Possible Local Conflicts as a First-Level Hypergame
    in Graph Form As discussed in subSect. 2.3, the developed WRM strategies consist
    of relevant irrigation scheduling that should be implemented by a series of management
    strategies. Implementing the optimal WRM strategies may cause conflicts in any
    traditional-based agricultural community due to, for example, changes in the farmer’s
    original water rights and misunderstanding of the new WRM strategies, especially
    in developing countries with ill-educated farmers. To investigate the potential
    limitations of the proposed WRM model, a GMCR model was developed in which all
    stakeholders (e.g., farmers and water management organizations) in the study area
    were considered as decision-makers (DMs) whose preferences and actions were examined.
    In such cases, the farmers are thoroughly risk-averse and strive to maintain the
    current condition at any cost, which makes them careless about all the provided
    information. On the other hand, governments only stick to ineffective solutions
    and refuse to improve their approach how to implement management strategies. Hence,
    both farmers and government have a partial understanding of each other options,
    courses of actions, and priorities and the conflict becomes a hypergame (combination
    of different subjective games) considering the focal viewpoint of each DM. The
    existing conflict was simulated as described in the following: (i) Developing
    the stable states (WRM strategies). Assuming that the water management organization
    (WMO) fails to inform farmers, address the farmers misperceptions and considers
    its inefficient activities to be sufficient, a first-level hypergame in graph
    form was developed to model the relations between farmers and the WMO. GMCR-plus,
    a program based on the decision support system, was employed to determine a stable
    irrigation/water storage strategy. First, all DMs as well as their options (the
    universal set of options) and preferences, were modeled, which was determined
    by the analyst using the gathered information and the regional situation investigations.
    The options assumed by each DM depended on their perception level and were labeled
    as misperceived, unknown, or correct. Then, the feasible states, which consist
    of different selections of universal sets of options and the relative preferences
    from each DM point of view, were modeled in their subjective game based on their
    perception of the conflict. The stability of feasible states was assessed by four
    stability definitions, including Nash stability, sequential stability (SEQ), general
    metarationality (GMR), and symmetric metarationality (SMR) (Nash, 1951; Howard
    1971; Fraser and Hipel, 1984). Finally, the stable states of subjective games
    were combined to determine the states of the first-level hypergame. The Cartesian
    product of stable states in the decision-makers (DMs) subjective games was introduced
    as the stable states of the first-level hypergame. The equilibrium state can belong
    to any of equilibrium classes such as steady, unsteady or stealthy as defined
    by Aljefri et al. (2017a, b). These classes actually determine the influence level
    of misperceptions on the equilibrium states and the reaction of DMs after being
    informed about the real situation. (ii) Dynamic evolution of the conflict. The
    standard form of GMCR evaluates the conflict in a linear static form through which
    the modeled options and priorities lead to an outcome (Yang et al. 2021). However,
    in real-world situations, the conflict atmosphere may dynamically be influenced
    by external time-dependent factors or internal factors like primary conflict outcome
    (Shahbaznezhadfard et al. 2021; Shahbaznezhadfard et al. 2022). As explained above,
    the first-level hypergame may result in an equilibrium class that is not desirable
    to one or all the DMs (Aljefri et al. 2017a, b); hence, assessing the conflict
    attributes must be mandatory after each round of negotiation. The concept of dynamic
    GMCR was applied here as introduced by Shahbaznezhadfard et al. (2020). Through
    this concept, the outcome obtained from the primary resolution of the conflict
    was fed back as an internal factor to a recent model. In fact, the conflict evolves
    to a further stage which should be analyzed to determine the actual outcome (Fig.
    2). Fig. 2 Schematic representation of dynamic GMCR Full size image (iii) Sensitivity
    analysis of the stable states. The theorems defined and proved by Zhao et al.
    (2019) were utilized to analyze the sensitivity of the equilibrium states in the
    conflict towards alterations in preferences ranking. In the following, several
    explanations are given that are required to describe the stability definitions
    in a case of a conflict between two decision-makers: (a) Decision-makers: $$ DM_{i}

    the preference alterations won’t influence the stability of a focal state: (i)
    switching the states in one side of the focal state by one or both of the DMs
    and (ii) switching the states with the focal state by one or both of the DMs.
    Hence, it is only required to assess the preference alterations across the focal
    state considering four Nash, GMR, SEQ and SMR stability definitions: (1) Nash
    stability: A state remains Nash stable for DMi if no unilateral movement for DMi
    becomes available from the stable state, after switching two states Sl and Sm:
    $$ \\begin{gathered} \\forall \\,S_{l} comes\\,from\\,S_{m} \\succ_{DMi} \\cdots

    of the developed WRM simulation–optimization model was assessed in the Al-Aswad
    falaj located in the wadi (catchment) Mayh, capital of Oman, Muscat (Fig. 3).
    It is located between 23°20′ N and 23°25′ N latitude and 58°30′ E and 58°35′ E
    longitude. Rainfall is highly localized and extremely irregular, with annual mean
    rainfall ranging from less than 100 mm along the coast to more than 200 mm in
    the mountains. This low and erratic rainfall, accompanied by a high potential
    evaporation of about 2,150 mm/yr, results in arid to semi-arid conditions. More
    information about Al-Aswad falaj is provided in SI, section S.2. Fig. 3 The Al-Aswad
    falaj and three main agricultural zones Full size image Traditionally, farmers’
    irrigation scheduling was determined based on the size of farmlands and their
    participation in the construction and maintenance of falaj systems (Al Marshudi,
    2007). In fact, the specified irrigation scheduling was not based on the required
    irrigation water, which has led to significant water overuse. According to this
    type of irrigation scheduling, regardless of the required irrigation demand and
    more importantly, the climatic conditions (e.g., dry, normal, and wet), the farmers
    are allowed to have the full flow of the falaj for irrigation of their farmlands
    during the time known as the irrigation duration. Once all farmlands receive their
    share of water, the process is repeated in a cyclic way, which is known as irrigation
    frequency. The irrigation duration and frequency are collectively known as irrigation
    scheduling (IS). It is clear that the currently applied IS is not optimal, and
    therefore, a significant amount of irrigation water is overused. The irrigation
    interval of the Al-Aswad falaj is 6 days, and the irrigation durations for zones
    1, 2, and 3 are 1, 1, and 4 days, respectively. Since socioeconomic factors play
    a key role in determining the irrigation scheduling of the zones, the importance
    rank of the zones follows the order: 3, 2, and 1, in which zone 3 is the most
    important part and claims more water in comparison to the other zones. The historical
    data of the falaj flow over 1991–2018 were collected to determine the available
    water and investigate the relative irrigation water shortage under the current
    IS. Taking advantage of the SSI drought indicator, the flow data were divided
    into eight drought classes (D2 to W3). The total water demand of the three agricultural
    zones was calculated considering the existing crops and climate conditions. The
    historical meteorological data between 2011 and 2018 were used to estimate the
    reference evapotranspiration (ET0) for the eight drought classes (SI, section
    S.6, Fig. S4). Based on the collected data and information obtained from the conducted
    field trips (Table 2), the annual water demand was calculated as the summation
    of water demand of all existing crops (Fig. 4). Crop coefficients of 0.96, 1.1,
    1.2, and 0.64 were determined for date palm trees, bananas, lemon, and corn silage,
    respectively (FAO, 1977; Allen et al. 1998). Table 2 Existing crops in the three
    agricultural zones Full size table Fig. 4 Annual water demand of the three agricultural
    zones supplied by the Al-Aswad falaj. Note: The water demand is a function of
    temperature conditions as well as cultivation patterns. For instance, in dry periods,
    with capacity reduction of water resources, secondary plants such as corn were
    eliminated and as a result, the water requirement was reduced Full size image
    Due to slight variations in the water demand (Fig. 4), the eight different drought
    classes were reduced to three, i.e., wet, normal and dry years. In wet and normal
    years, except for 2001, (Fig. 5a, b), the annual water demand was less than the
    available volume of irrigation water delivered by the Al-Aswad falaj (the only
    source of irrigation water). In these years, the excess water, which was wasted
    with the current IS, can be stored and used as supplementary irrigation water
    to compensate for the water shortage in the dry periods or developing purposes.
    On the other hand, the large shortage of water supply in dry years has compelled
    farmers to allocate the available irrigation water only for perennial crops, especially
    date palms, which reduces the annual water demand during these years; however,
    the water demand is still more than the available irrigation water (Fig. 5c).
    Fig. 5 The comparison of annual available irrigation water and total water demand
    of all three agricultural zones Full size image To determine the effective irrigation
    water depth, the actual volume of irrigation water in the agricultural zones was
    assessed using the irrigation net depth (dnet). Extensive laboratory tests were
    performed to determine the soil characteristics of the collected soil samples
    (SI, Fig. S2), which were used to calculate dnet (SI, Section S.5). Using the
    data provided in Table 3 and SI, section S.5, the dnet was calculated to be 80.9,
    83.0, and 90.7 mm for agricultural zones 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Moreover, the
    maximum allowable depletion (MAD) and the average root depth (RD) of 0.525% and
    2.5 m were respectively considered for all crops cultivated under the intercropping
    system in all agricultural zones (Allen et al. 1998). Table 3 Soil characteristics
    of agricultural zones 1, 2, and 3 Full size table Regarding the irrigation system
    in the agricultural zones, the respective values of water conveyance and irrigation
    application efficiencies were measured. The locally applied irrigation frequencies
    and durations for the current surface irrigation system in the study area have
    led to a considerable overuse of water and water shortage, respectively, in wet
    and dry years. Hence, the obtained information was utilized to develop the WRM
    simulation–optimization model and determine the optimal ISs, which can be used
    in the future for different drought classes according to the different irrigation
    methods. In this regard, the regional condition should be studied carefully to
    ascertain the applicability of the provided aflaj water management strategies.
    The WMO, as a conventional approach, decides to establish a water user association
    (WUA) center in this region with responsibilities to regulate the water allocation
    and provide public subsidies or investment options to facilitate the farmers’
    cooperation with the WMO. The WUA incur considerable fees as a penalty for high
    water consumption by farmers to put an end to the use of the traditional (current)
    IS. On the other hand, the farmers, who are mostly risk-averse individuals, only
    consider the cost and risks associated with improving the irrigation methods (e.g.,
    pressurized irrigation systems) and reject any changes. They actually misperceive
    the purpose of WMO and neglect all the provided data, information and issued warnings.
    The existing conflict was examined by adopting the first-level hypergame theory
    to study the unsuccessful policy of the WMO causing misperceptions among farmers.
    The GMCR-plus decision support system was utilized to model and analyze the conflict
    through the GMCR concept. As it can be seen from Table 4, two options can be selected
    by farmers: 1) keep the current IS or 2) follow the WMO optimal IS. Table 4 also
    shows the WMO-selected options and the related farmers’ level of perception. Table
    4 The WMO and farming zone options and their level of perception Full size table
    As shown in Table 4, the WMO considers two scenarios to achieve improvements:
    (i) providing subsidies based on the reduced amount of irrigation water consumption
    and (ii) encouraging investments in water-related plants and making water selling
    a great incentive for farmers to improve their irrigation. However, if farmers
    refuse the changes, (iii) they have to pay the prohibitive over-consumption fees
    which is determined by the WUA. Option (5) (Table 4) has been misperceived by
    farmers; they believe that the over-consumption fines are payable and not restrictive
    enough to make the irrigation system improvements worthy (option (6)). Such misperception
    about the WUA circumstances strongly affects the farmers’ priorities and the way
    they rank the states, accordingly. On the other hand, the WMO assumes that they
    have provided sufficient information and the farmers are well aware of the consequences
    and the prohibitive cost of consumption according to the current IS. Hence, two
    different games, labeled as \\(G_{FZ}\\) and \\(G_{WMO}\\) should be studied to
    involve both decision-makers'' points of view. First, the universal set of states
    is developed. The six options (Table 4) can be chosen or not; hence, 26 = 64 possible
    states exist in this conflict, some of which are infeasible. The “Current” and
    “Optimal” options for FZs and “Buy water”, “Subsidies”, “Prohibitive fee”, and
    “Payable fee” options for the WMO were mutually exclusive and should be selected
    individually. Thus, 16 and 33 states were respectively infeasible. Furthermore,
    each decision-maker would take one option and 7 states in which one decision-maker
    may choose no option became infeasible. At the final stage, considering the meaningless
    states (i.e., Simultaneity of “Optimal” and “Prohibitive fee” or “Payable fee”)
    two other states were infeasible, and therefore, 6 feasible states remained to
    model the conflict (Table 5). Table 5 The universal set of feasible states for
    the developed first-level hypergame (farming zones (FZ)-water management organization
    (WMO) conflict) Full size table It can be understood from the states (Table 5)
    that the WMO suggests providing subsidies or investments if farmers accept to
    reduce their water consumption by (i) changing ISs with the current irrigation
    system or (ii) improving their irrigation system. Clearly, the subsidy amount
    depends on the improvement level. Also, more excess water results in more profits
    through water selling. \\(G_{FZ}\\) was analyzed to determine the equilibrium
    states as perceived by farming zones. The feasible states 1 to 5 were considered
    by farming zones and ranked from the most to least preferred in their subjective
    game. The preference rankings are illustrated in Table 6. Table 6 States ranking
    in the WMO-farming zones conflict as perceived by farming zones (\\(G_{FZ}\\))
    Full size table Next, the \\(G_{WMO}\\) was investigated to obtain the equilibrium
    states of conflict as perceived by the WMO. The WMO assumes that the WUA activities
    have been efficient and the farmers are well aware of the consequences of continuing
    current IS and determined to improve their irrigation systems. The preference
    order of states for farming zones and the WMO, as perceived by the WMO, is shown
    in Table 7. Table 7 States ranking in the WMO-farming zones conflict as perceived
    by the WMO (\\(G_{WMO}^{{}}\\)) Full size table 4 Results and discussion The developed
    water resources management (WRM) simulation–optimization model was utilized to
    determine optimal WRM strategies, which result in an optimal IS with specified
    irrigation duration(s) and frequencies. In order to guarantee the applicability
    of the developed WRM strategies in the target region, the arisen conflict was
    studied to provide appropriate regional solutions. 4.1 Optimal WRM strategies
    Two scenarios of (i) enhancing the IS with the current irrigation system and (ii)
    improving of the irrigation system to achieve more flexible IS were considered
    to develop the WRM strategies. The developed simulation model was utilized to
    determine the annual relative irrigation water shortage for the aimed ISs. First,
    the traditional IS with the current surface irrigation system was applied to determine
    the actual water shortage. In this respect, the historical data of the falaj flow
    (Fig. 5) were employed which has been applied in the study area by the farmers
    since 1858. Then, WRM strategies were developed considering the implementation
    of the surface irrigation method, and the results were compared with the current
    condition (Fig. 6). The results reveal that the developed optimal surface IS reduces
    the annual relative irrigation water shortage from 23 to 19% in dry years and
    to more than 5% in normal years, as shown in Fig. 6. Even when the available irrigation
    water was more than the total water demand of agricultural zones in 1995 and 2007,
    the percentage of relative irrigation water shortage is considerable due to the
    limitations of the current surface irrigation system with common values of irrigation
    durations and intervals over the year. Fig. 6 Comparison of relative irrigation
    water shortage (RIWS) for current (traditional) and optimum (optimal surface)
    irrigation scheduling Full size image The WRM strategies for the surface irrigation
    system consist of an IS with one irrigation duration and two irrigation frequencies
    for normal and peak growth periods (as stated earlier, the implementation of monthly
    variable irrigation frequencies is impractical using the surface irrigation system).
    Figure 7 shows the optimal surface IS that was produced by the genetic algorithm
    in MATLAB® environment for a population size of 180 after reaching the specified
    maximum number (100) of generations. Fig. 7 The optimal irrigation scheduling
    with surface irrigation system Full size image Despite all the advantages of the
    developed optimal surface IS, the results (reduction of almost 5% of water shortage
    in dry years) are not significantly satisfying because the surface irrigation
    systems limit the application of the fully flexible optimal IS with monthly variable
    irrigation durations and frequencies. Such limitations necessitate the adoption
    of an efficient IS to achieve the lowest level of water shortage in the agricultural
    zones. In pressurized irrigation systems (e.g., a mix of bubblers for perennial
    crops and tapes for corn silage), the irrigation durations can be easily controlled.
    Hence, 12 different irrigation durations were proposed throughout the year. Moreover,
    two irrigation frequencies were determined over the normal and peak growing periods.
    The optimal pressurized IS was also produced by genetic algorithm in MATLAB® environment
    for a population size of 1,440 after reaching the specified maximum number of
    150 generations. As an example, the obtained IS for normal years is shown in Fig.
    8. The optimal pressurized ISs for wet and dry years are also presented in SI,
    section S.8, Fig. S7. Fig. 8 Optimal irrigation scheduling (IS) for pressurized
    irrigation system in normal years Full size image Finally, the developed ISs were
    compared to thoroughly assess the extent of the influence of modified ISs in reducing
    the irrigation water shortage, as depicted in Fig. 9. Figure 9 shows the superiority
    of the pressurized irrigation systems in reducing the annual water shortage up
    to 15% in the three agricultural zones, which can truly justify the required costs
    to set up and operate this system. Fig. 9 Annual relative irrigation water shortage
    (RIWS) of the current and optimal irrigation schedulings (ISs) for surface and
    pressurized irrigation systems in the three agricultural zones Full size image
    4.2 Developing compromise WRM strategies The results showed that traditional surface
    irrigation is required to be replaced with more efficient irrigation systems (e.g.,
    pressurized systems) to achieve the minimum water shortage for all agricultural
    zones. It is obvious that such changes (both in the irrigation scheduling and
    irrigation systems), especially in the early years, may cause some local conflicts
    between farmers and the water management organization (WMO). The developed GMCR
    model was utilized to determine the compromise WRM strategy in the studied region.
    4.2.1 Conflict resolution analysis As illustrated in Sect. 3, the conflict was
    modeled as a first-level hypergame which consists of two subjective games (\\(G_{FZ}\\)
    and \\(G_{WMO}\\)). \\(G_{FZ}\\) was analyzed to determine the subjective game
    equilibrium states regarding the standard GMCR solution concepts (Table 8). Table
    8 Stability analysis and equilibrium results of \\(G_{FZ}\\) Full size table The
    results shown in Table 8 reveal that state S5 was stable under all solution concepts
    in \\(G_{FZ}\\). The S5 consists of options selected by the farmers and WMO, and
    can be shown as: \\(g_{FZ}^{S5} = \\left( {NY} \\right)^{T}\\) and \\(g_{WMO}^{S5}
    = \\left( {NNNY} \\right)^{T}\\). In this regard, the farmers prefer to follow
    their traditional IS with the current irrigation system and accept the possible
    over-consumption fines in the future. The equilibrium states for \\(G_{WMO}\\)
    is also shown in Table 9. Table 9 Stability analysis and equilibrium results of
    \\(G_{WMO}\\) Full size table As shown in Table 9, states S3 and S6 are the stables
    state under all solution concepts for \\(G_{WMO}\\), which consists of the following
    strategies:\\(g_{FZ}^{S3} = \\left( {YN} \\right)^{T}\\), \\(g_{WMO}^{S3} = \\left(
    {NYNN} \\right)^{T}\\),\\(g_{FZ}^{S6} = \\left( {NY} \\right)^{T}\\) and \\(g_{WMO}^{S6}
    = \\left( {NNYN} \\right)^{T}\\). Finally, the equilibrium states of the first-level
    hypergame were determined to provide clear strategic insight into the conflict.
    The solution concepts are developed considering different stability definitions.
    Hence, the selected states were required to be stable under similar definitions.
    For instance, the equilibrium states were obtained as a Cartesian product of the
    Nash stable states of farming zones and the WMO in \\(G_{FZ}^{{}}\\) and \\(G_{WMO}^{{}}\\),
    respectively. The Cartesian product of \\(g_{FZ}^{S5} = \\left( {NY} \\right)^{T}\\),
    \\(g_{WMO}^{S3} = \\left( {NYNN} \\right)^{T}\\) and \\(g_{WMO}^{S6} = \\left(
    {NNYN} \\right)^{T}\\) are shown in Table 10. Table 10 The Cartesian product of
    the Nash stable states of farming zones and the water management organization
    Full size table The Cartesian product of the stable states under the other stability
    definitions can also be calculated with a similar result. As shown in Table 10,
    states S4 and S6 were equilibrium states of the developed first-level hypergame.
    4.2.2 Dynamic analysis of conflict evolution The equilibrium states obtained in
    the previous section, can be categorized into two stability classes, according
    to Aljefri et al. (2017a, b). State S4 is an unsteady hyper equilibrium; although
    the state has been recognized to be feasible in both subjective games, it was
    not selected as a Nash equilibrium in WMO subjective game. This situation promotes
    the WMO to lead the conflict to future rounds. State S6 is also classified as
    a stealthy hyper-equilibrium. In this case, it becomes clear that the farmers
    have misperceived and underestimated the regulation consequences. This certainly
    motivates the farmers to more delicately seek the provided information encouraging
    the WMO authorities to disclose further detailed data on the benefits of irrigation
    system improvements. This situation pushes the negotiation to a future round,
    as desired by both decision-makers. By eliminating the misunderstandings between
    farmers and the WMO, both of them desire to reach a more favorable level in their
    conflict. Hence, the dynamic investigation of the conflict is essential. The outcome
    of obtained equilibrium states is applied to the second GMCR model as internal
    factors (as shown in Fig. 2). In this stage, the farmers clearly perceive the
    consequences of following the current irrigation system and become attracted by
    the benefits of adopting the optimized system. Furthermore, the WMO understands
    that they have to act in a more effective way than just establishing a regulating
    center. The feasible and preference rankings of the second GMCR model are shown
    in Tables 11 and 12, respectively. Table 11 The feasible states of the farming
    zones (FZ)-water management organization (WMO) conflict Full size table Table
    12 States ranking in the WMO-farming zones conflict Full size table As shown in
    Table 13, states S9 and S11 become the stable states under all stability definitions.
    At this stage, farmers agree to improve their irrigation systems while the WMO
    undertakes to provide favorable opportunities for investment by private entities.
    Table 13 Stability analysis and equilibrium results Full size table 4.2.3 Sensitivity
    Analysis A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the
    equilibrium states obtained in the farming zones and WMO subjective games. The
    theories defined and proved by Zhao et al. (2019) were utilized in this study.
    Figure 10 shows the unilateral moves and unilateral improvements in \\(G_{FZ}\\).
    It should be noted that the unilateral improvements have a direct relation with
    the preferences rankings: \\(S5 \\succ \\,S2 \\succ S4 \\succ S1 \\succ S3\\)
    for FZ and \\(S3 \\succ S1 \\succ S5 \\succ S4 \\succ S2\\) for WMO. The payoff
    vectors can be accordingly defined as: \\(P_{FZ} = \\left\\{ {2,\\,4,\\,1,\\,3,\\,5}
    \\right\\}\\) and \\(P_{WMO} = \\left\\{ {4,\\,1,\\,5,\\,2,\\,3} \\right\\}\\).

    of state S5 for both decision-makers in \\(G_{FZ}\\), two reachable lists, \\(R_{FZ}
    \\left( {S5} \\right) = \\emptyset\\) and \\(R_{WMO} \\left( {S5} \\right) = \\left\\{
    {S2,\\,S4} \\right\\}\\), were made which contain the unilateral moves from state
    S5 for FZ and WMO, respectively. In a similar manner, the \\(R_{FZ}^{ + } \\left(
    {S5} \\right) = \\emptyset\\) and \\(R_{WMO}^{ + } \\left( {S5} \\right) = \\emptyset\\)
    were developed which respectively represent the list of unilateral improvements
    from state S5 for FZ and WMO. As proved by Zhao et al. (2019), preference alterations
    on one side of the stable state may not change equilibrium results considering
    the four stability conditions of Nash, GMR, SEQ and SMR. Hence, despite any changes
    in states ranking in the sets (\\(S_{FZ}^{L}\\), \\(S_{FZ}^{R}\\), \\(S_{WMO}^{L}\\)
    and \\(S_{WMO}^{R}\\)) by one or both of the decision-makers, the final resolution
    will remain unchanged. The sets can be expressed as \\(E_{FZ} :\\left\\langle
    {S_{FZ}^{L} :\\emptyset ,\\,S_{FZ}^{R} :\\left\\{ {S2,\\,S4,\\,S1,S3} \\right\\}}
    \\right\\rangle\\) and \\(E_{WMO} :\\left\\langle {S_{WMO}^{L} :\\left\\{ {S3,S1}
    \\right\\},\\,S_{WMO}^{R} :\\left\\{ {S4,S2} \\right\\}} \\right\\rangle\\), in
    which \\(E_{FZ}\\) and \\(E_{WMO}\\) replicate the states that exist in \\(G_{FZ}\\)
    being ordered by preference ranking on the left and right side of the selected
    stable state. The current condition reveals that if farmers mostly prefer to follow
    the current IS, their other prioritizations won’t change the stable state. On
    the other hand, the WMO preference rankings between accepting slight modifications
    by giving subsidies or encouraging investments won’t affect the stability of S5.
    A similar condition exists in relation to the changes in the superiority of two
    optimal scenarios by the WMO. To investigate the changes in stability by preference
    alterations across state S5, the theorems defined by Zhao et al. (2019) were utilized.
    State S5 is the most preferred state in \\(P_{FZ}\\) and, as a consequence, no
    alterations is possible across this state. To assess the stability of S5 by changes
    in preferences of WMO, two other set of states were determined: (i) \\(w\\left[
    {R_{WMO}^{ + } \\left( {S5} \\right)} \\right]\\) which represents the states
    that can be used by FZ to unilaterally sanction the unilateral improvements of
    WMO from state S5 to the states exist in \\(R_{WMO}^{ + } \\left( {S5} \\right)\\),
    and (ii) \\(u\\left[ {R_{WMO}^{ + } \\left( {S5} \\right)} \\right]\\) which specifies
    the unilateral improvements of FZ being utilized to prevent the unilateral improvement
    of WMO from state S5 to the states exist in \\(R_{WMO}^{ + } \\left( {S5} \\right)\\).
    Accordingly, \\(w\\left[ {R_{WMO}^{ + } \\left( {S5} \\right)} \\right]\\) and
    \\(u\\left[ {R_{WMO}^{ + } \\left( {S5} \\right)} \\right]\\) can be defied which
    denote the number of states available in these vectors. All the possible across
    alterations were assessed as described in the following, considering the Nash,
    GMR, SMR and SEQ stability conditions: (i) State S4 substitutes state S3 in \\(P_{WMO}\\):
    Updated \\(P_{WMO} = \\left\\{ {4,\\,1,\\,2,\\,5,\\,3} \\right\\}\\,\\, \\Rightarrow\\)
    updated \\(R_{WMO}^{ + } \\left( {S5} \\right) = \\left\\{ {S4} \\right\\}\\)
    $$ \\Rightarrow \\,w\\left( {S4} \\right) = \\left\\{ {S3} \\right\\}\\,\\,and\\,u\\left(
    {S4} \\right) = \\emptyset \\, $$ (a) Nash stability: \\(J_{WMO} \\left( {S5,\\,S4}
    \\right) = 1\\,\\, \\Rightarrow\\) Nash unstable. (b) GMR stability: $$ \\left|
    {w\\left( {S4} \\right)} \\right| = 1\\,\\,and\\,J_{FZ} (S4,\\,S4) = 0\\,\\, \\Rightarrow
    $$ GMR stable (c) SEQ stability: \\(J_{FZ}^{ + } \\left( {S5,\\,S4} \\right) =
    0\\,\\, \\Rightarrow\\) SEQ unstable. (d) SMR stability: $$ \\left| {w\\left(
    {S4} \\right)} \\right| \\ge 1\\, $$ $$ J_{FZ} (S4,\\,S4) = 0\\,\\,and\\,J_{FZ}
    (S4,\\,S3) = 1 $$ \\(J_{WMO} (S3,\\,S4) = 0 \\Rightarrow\\) SMR stable. \\(\\Rightarrow\\)
    If the WMO prefers to ease the investments for subtle improvements in IS with
    current irrigation system rather than adopting an optimal system, state S5 becomes
    Nash and SEQ unstable. (ii) State S2 substitutes state S3 in \\(P_{WMO}\\): Updated
    \\(P_{WMO} = \\left\\{ {4,\\,5,\\,1,\\,2,\\,3} \\right\\}\\,\\, \\Rightarrow\\)
    updated \\(R_{WMO}^{ + } \\left( {S5} \\right) = \\left\\{ {S2} \\right\\}\\)
    $$ \\Rightarrow \\,w\\left( {S2} \\right) = \\left\\{ {S1} \\right\\}\\,\\,and\\,u\\left(

    If the WMO prefers to provide subsidies for subtle improvements in IS with the
    current irrigation system rather than adopting an optimal system, state S5 becomes
    Nash and SEQ unstable. As the last step, it is required to assess the influence
    of altering the preference of other states with the stable state S5. Zhao et al.
    (2019) stated that state S5 remains stable even if switched with less or more
    favorable states. Alternatively stated, the unstable states won’t become stable
    even if being switched with the stable state. \\(G_{WMO}\\) was also investigated
    to check the sensitivity of the stable states S3 and S6 to the changes in preferences,
    as illustrated in SI, section S.8. The results reveal that if farmers prefer the
    current irrigation system rather an optimal one, state S3 becomes Nash unstable,
    which is impossible from the WMO viewpoint. Also, state S6 becomes Nash unstable
    only if the WMO prefers the current irrigation system rather than an optimal one.
    Considering the performed sensitivity analysis, it can be concluded that the obtained
    stable states are reliable. The actual resolution of this conflict is the states
    obtained from the investigation of the first-level hypergame rather than individual
    subjective games. It should be noted that the equilibrium states of the developed
    first-level hypergame were the Cartesian product of the equilibrium states of
    individual subjective games; hence, both resulting equilibrium states of the first-level
    hypergame are reliable. 5 Conclusion This study proposes a water resources management
    (WRM) simulation–optimization model to develop an optimal irrigation scheduling
    (IS) that minimizes the relative irrigation water shortage, which is a key issue
    in arid zones with stressed and limited water resources. The developed WRM simulation–optimization
    model determined the optimal irrigation duration(s) and frequencies simultaneously
    for several agricultural zones with multi-crop and intercropping systems. The
    model was developed in MATLAB® and has several functions to compute the reference
    evapotranspiration (ET0), irrigation net depth (dnet), effective rainfall, and
    water demand for different agricultural zones using meteorological, soil, and
    crop characteristic data. Based on the results of the simulation model, the Genetic
    Algorithm (GA) optimization model yielded an optimal IS, without any limitations,
    related to the number of agricultural zones and irrigation methods. Finally, the
    strategies that can be utilized by the government to improve irrigation systems
    were examined with the help of a graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR). The
    conflict between the government and farmers was modeled as a first-level hypergame
    to achieve more reliable solutions. According to the results, farmers would be
    convinced to follow advanced irrigation systems only if the government understands
    their pessimistic attitude toward irrigation system improvements and adopts an
    efficient approach to inform and attract their attention. Only if it comes up
    the government can ensure attaining its goals by offering incentives such as providing
    subsidies or attracting investors. In this study, relative irrigation water shortage
    (RIWS) has been selected as an indicator of the developed simulation–optimization
    model efficiency and the results show that, with a 15% reduction in RIWS, the
    pressurized irrigation system has shown a significant advantage and worth the
    investments. In addition to being one of the first studies to apply a graph-based
    hypergame model for agricultural water allocation, the results may attract wide
    interest from various researchers who work on procedures to improve the management
    of agricultural water resources with minimum local conflicts. The results obtained
    by the proposed model are highly sensitive to the amounts of irrigation water
    demand and supply. Applying stochastic models, including uncertainty analysis
    (e.g., climate conditions), can improve the model''s accuracy. Moreover, the interactions
    between stakeholders can bring about decisive effects on the compatibility of
    the proposed optimal WRM strategies, which can be further investigated through
    agent-based models (ABMs) in future studies. Availability of Data and Material

    \ is the largest consumptive user of fresh water. Water scarcity\nis increasing\
    \ worldwide, resulting in tighter regulation of its use for agriculture. This\
    \ necessitates the\ndevelopment of irrigation practices that are more efﬁcient\
    \ in the use of water but do not compromise\ncrop quality and yield. Precision\
    \ irrigation already achieves this goal, in part. The goal of precision\nirrigation\
    \ is to accurately supply the crop water need in a timely manner and as spatially\
    \ uniformly\nas possible. However, to maximize the beneﬁts of precision irrigation,\
    \ additional technologies need\nto be enabled and incorporated into agriculture.\
    \ This paper discusses how incorporating adaptive\ndecision support systems into\
    \ precision irrigation management will enable signiﬁcant advances in\nincreasing\
    \ the efﬁciency of current irrigation approaches. From the literature review,\
    \ it is found that\nprecision irrigation can be applied in achieving the environmental\
    \ goals related to sustainability.\nThe demonstrated economic beneﬁts of precision\
    \ irrigation in ﬁeld-scale crop production is however\nminimal. It is argued that\
    \ a proper combination of soil, plant and weather sensors providing\nreal-time\
    \ data to an adaptive decision support system provides an innovative platform\
    \ for improving\nsustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also shows\
    \ that adaptive decision support systems\nbased on model predictive control are\
    \ able to adequately account for the time-varying nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while considering operational limitations and agronomic objectives\n\
    in arriving at optimal irrigation decisions. It is concluded that signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in crop\nyield and water savings can be achieved by incorporating model predictive\
    \ control into precision\nirrigation decision support tools. Further improvements\
    \ in water savings can also be realized by\nincluding deﬁcit irrigation as part\
    \ of the overall irrigation management strategy. Nevertheless, future\nresearch\
    \ is needed for identifying crop response to regulated water deﬁcits, developing\
    \ improved\nsoil moisture and plant sensors, and developing self-learning crop\
    \ simulation frameworks that can\nbe applied to evaluate adaptive decision support\
    \ strategies related to irrigation.\nKeywords: precision irrigation; adaptive\

    \ of crops, making irrigation the largest\nconsumptive user of fresh water [1].\
    \ Over 80% of freshwater withdrawals in developing countries is\napplied in irrigation\
    \ [2]. Irrigated agriculture provides 40% of the world’s food from less than 20%\
    \ of\nthe cultivated area highlighting the importance of irrigation in global\
    \ food security [3].\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353; doi:10.3390/su9030353\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n2 of 29\nIrrigated crop production globally extends\
    \ over 275 million hectares, with an estimated annual\nincrease of 1.3% [2]. Global\
    \ climate change may further increase irrigation water demand due to a\ngreater\
    \ variation in annual precipitation amounts [4]. Postel [5] suggested that irrigation\
    \ will provide\n46% of the global crop water requirement by 2025, which was computed\
    \ as 28% in 1995, resulting in a\ndecline of rain-fed agriculture. Food production\
    \ in the developing world, notably in South, Southeast\nand East Asia, is at present\
    \ heavily reliant on irrigation. The total irrigated area in Asia is 230 million\
    \ ha,\nwhich represents over 70% of the global irrigated area. Of the 230 million\
    \ ha of irrigated land area, 60%\nis located in China and India [3]. It is estimated\
    \ that 75% of the grain production in China is dependent\non irrigation [2]. Sarma\
    \ [6] noted that India uses as much as four times more water to produce one\n\
    unit of a major food crop as compared to the USA and Europe. This implies that\
    \ an improvement\nin water use efﬁciency in the developing world would conserve\
    \ at least half of the water presently\napplied in irrigation.\nIt is estimated\
    \ that a water volume of 2630 km3 is abstracted yearly from surface and ground\n\
    water sources for irrigated crop production. The absence of surface water sources\
    \ in a number of\ncommunities has further increased the pressure on groundwater\
    \ resources. This has resulted in the\nover-abstraction of global groundwater\
    \ sources which is calculated to be as much as 163 km3 per\nannum [2]. A global\
    \ shortage in freshwater sources is predicted unless action is taken to improve\
    \ water\nmanagement and increase water use efﬁciency. This has necessitated greater\
    \ regulatory demands for\nenvironmental protection of freshwater [7]. It is reported\
    \ that only half of the total freshwater volume\nabstracted for irrigation globally\
    \ reaches the targeted crops [2]. These have brought about the need to\ndevise\
    \ procedures to use the limited water more efﬁciently while maximizing crop yield\
    \ and quality.\nConventional irrigation practice involves applying water uniformly\
    \ over every part of the ﬁeld\nwithout taking into account the spatial variability\
    \ in soil and crop water needs; this consequently leads\nto overirrigation in\
    \ some parts of the ﬁeld while other parts of the ﬁeld are underirrigated [8].\
    \ The risks\nassociated with overirrigation include surface runoff, deep percolation\
    \ and leaching of nitrates and\nnutrients. Those associated with underirrigation\
    \ are more subjective and include reduction in crop\nyields and quality, as well\
    \ as inefﬁcient use of fertilizer and other supplemental inputs for crop\nproduction\
    \ [9].\nThe irrigation process requires a high level of ‘precision’ in order to\
    \ optimize the water input\nand crop response, while minimizing adverse environmental\
    \ impacts. Precision irrigation is an\nevolving ﬁeld with active interest by both\
    \ industry and academic researchers. It is conceptualized by\nsome researchers\
    \ as the use of efﬁcient irrigation application systems, whereas others view it\
    \ as the\nvariable application of irrigation based on predeﬁned maps or sensor\
    \ feedback [10]. Smith et al. [11]\nsuggested that ‘precision’ involves the accurate\
    \ determination, quantiﬁcation of crop water needs and\nthe precise application\
    \ of the optimal water volume at the required time. This implies that varying\n\
    water application spatially is not the sole requirement for the achievement of\
    \ ‘precision’ in the irrigation\nprocess. Hence, precision irrigation can be deﬁned\
    \ as the process of accounting for the ﬁeld-scale\nspatial variability in crop\
    \ water need and applying the right amount of water to match the spatial crop\n\
    water need at the right time [9]. The advantages associated with precision irrigation\
    \ include increased\ncrop yields, improved crop quality, improved water use efﬁciency/savings,\
    \ reduction of energy costs\nand reduction of adverse environmental impacts [12].\
    \ Pierce [13] viewed precision irrigation as a\ntool for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of improved irrigation water use\nefﬁciency\
    \ and improved environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\nThe balance of several\
    \ core aspects is however important for the successful implementation of\na robust\
    \ precision irrigation system. Implementing a precision irrigation system involves\
    \ efforts on\nreal-time monitoring of crop and soil conditions, scheduling irrigation\
    \ and control of the irrigation\napplication equipment. Research has been mainly\
    \ focused on the sensing and control aspects of\nprecision irrigation with much\
    \ advancements in the last decade [12]. Research is limited, however,\nin the\
    \ development of appropriate irrigation scheduling tools for the precision irrigation\
    \ process [14].\nIrrigation scheduling is the process by which a producer determines\
    \ when to apply irrigation and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n3 of 29\nthe amount\
    \ of irrigation water to apply [15]. Hornbuckle et al. [16] suggested that the\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling endeavour should be treated as an all-encompassing decision\
    \ support system for irrigation\nmanagement. A robust decision support system\
    \ is important in the successful implementation of\nprecision irrigation. The\
    \ need for a decision support system capable of real-time management decisions\n\
    of when, where and how much to irrigate while also considering uncertainty in\
    \ climatic inputs,\nthe time-varying nature of cropping systems, as well as equipment\
    \ and operational limitations cannot\nbe overemphasized. Rhodig and Hillyer [17]\
    \ noted that the development of an optimal decision support\ntool for precision\
    \ irrigation will involve the combination of appropriate modeling and management\n\
    tools. The decision support tools available for precision irrigation management\
    \ are presently inﬂexible\nand difﬁcult to adapt to varying cropping scenarios\
    \ [18].\nIn recent years, there has been a number of in-depth reviews on precision\
    \ irrigation (e.g., [9,16]),\nand our intention is not to repeat the areas they\
    \ addressed. Rather, our aim is to provide an in-depth\ntechnical analysis of\
    \ the considerations necessary for the development of a practical and robust decision\n\
    support system for precision irrigation in order to improve sustainable irrigated\
    \ agriculture. To that\nend, the review will focus on the following critical aspects\
    \ of precision irrigation: (1) monitoring\nconsiderations; (2) present limitations\
    \ and state of the art in decision support; and (3) opportunities for\nimproving\
    \ sustainability. We will however include brief sections on the concept of spatial\
    \ variability\nand the control of water application in precision irrigation.\n\
    2. Spatial Variability: The Long-Term Challenge of Irrigated Agriculture\nThe\
    \ underlying argument for precision irrigation is the presence of within-ﬁeld\
    \ spatial variability\nthat inﬂuences crop water demand. The spatial variability\
    \ in crop water demand may have a direct\ninﬂuence on the crop yield, quality\
    \ and the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds [19]. The soil water\npresents\
    \ the sole source of water available for direct plant uptake and therefore its\
    \ spatial variability\nwill have a direct inﬂuence on crop water demand. Soil\
    \ and landscape characteristics like soil texture,\ntopography, abiotic and management\
    \ factors (e.g., compaction, tillage) and hydraulic properties vary\nspatially\
    \ across a ﬁeld [11]. These have a direct inﬂuence on the water-holding capacity\
    \ of the soil.\nHedley and Yule [20] reported that the spatial variation in the\
    \ soil water retention characteristics was\nstrongly correlated with the spatial\
    \ variation in soil texture across a ﬁeld, noting that areas with heavier\nsoils\
    \ within a ﬁeld had a larger water-holding capacity in comparison to those with\
    \ light textured\nsoils. The advent of rapid non-invasive technologies for mapping\
    \ soil properties, speciﬁcally electrical\nconductivity mapping, can reveal within-ﬁeld\
    \ variability that can guide in variable rate irrigation\nmanagement. These have\
    \ been successfully applied by Hedley and Yule [21] and Daccache et al. [8].\n\
    Readers are directed to [22,23] for a comprehensive overview of electrical conductivity\
    \ mapping.\nThe variability in yield across a ﬁeld has also been found to be strongly\
    \ correlated with the spatial\nvariability in water available for crop use. The\
    \ spatial variability in crop yield is a function of the\ninterplay between water\
    \ stress, nutrients, in addition to soil’s physical and chemical properties [24].\n\
    The yield map can be correlated with the soil electrical conductivity (EC) map.\
    \ These similarities can be\nexplained through the spatial variability of soil\
    \ properties that exists across a ﬁeld. The water-holding\ncapacity of the soil\
    \ is a major factor affecting yield, and the yield map will likely show a strong\n\
    correlation to soil EC [25]. Irmak et al. [26] noted that the spatial variability\
    \ in soil water retention\ncharacteristics played a dominant role in explaining\
    \ the spatial yield variability observed in soybean.\nMartinez-Casasnovas et al.\
    \ [27] suggested yield mapping as an important tool in variable rate\nirrigation\
    \ management.\nA robust precision irrigation system will be able to meet the spatially\
    \ varying crop water demand\nacross a ﬁeld at the right time. This requires accurate\
    \ knowledge of the within-ﬁeld variability. This\nis addressed by applying the\
    \ concept of irrigation management zones/units in precision irrigation.\nThe irrigation\
    \ management zones are a group of homogeneous units with similar soil water retention\n\
    characteristics [21]. It is however important that these management zones are\
    \ large enough to be\nmanaged individually while remaining relatively homogeneous\
    \ in order to reﬂect the spatial soil\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n4 of 29\n\
    variation across the units. The delineation of irrigation management zones based\
    \ on real-time sensor\ndata has also been demonstrated. This is achieved by applying\
    \ infrared thermometry/thermography\nto assess the spatial variation in crop canopy\
    \ temperature across a ﬁeld [28]. The crop canopy\ntemperature of a healthy transpiring\
    \ crop will often be less than that of the ambient air. When crop\ntranspiration\
    \ is reduced as a result of water deﬁcits, the crop canopy temperature is expected\
    \ to increase.\nThe characterization of crop water status as a function of the\
    \ canopy and ambient temperature is the\nbasis for using infrared thermometry/thermography\
    \ as a mapping tool for precision irrigation [29].\nShaughnessy et al. [30] and\
    \ Evett et al. [31] have successfully applied this procedure in generating\ndynamic\
    \ maps to guide variable rate water application for ﬁeld crops grown under a center\
    \ pivot\nsystem. It should, however, be noted that infrared temperature measurements\
    \ are usually taken over\na short period, mostly at midday when the crop is expected\
    \ to experience the highest evaporative\ndemand. Hence, this method is well suited\
    \ for crop production systems in which the soil moisture\ndynamics has relatively\
    \ long time constants.\n3. Spatial Scales of Irrigation Management\nCentre pivot,\
    \ lateral move and low energy precision application (LEPA) moving machines can\
    \ be\nmodiﬁed to apply spatially variable irrigation [32]. These systems are particularly\
    \ suited to variable\nrate water application because of their current level of\
    \ automation and large coverage area with\na single lateral pipe. Fixed irrigation\
    \ systems also have potential to be deployed for variable rate\nwater application\
    \ as they can be very accurate and can be automated based on sensor feedback [2].\n\
    Implementing a spatially varied irrigation system requires an understanding of\
    \ the characteristics of\nthe irrigation application system deployed including\
    \ the spatial scales covered by the water application\nequipment. The spatial\
    \ scale associated with the variability in crop water requirements and its impact\n\
    on yield should also be identiﬁed [32].\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested that\
    \ the size and numbers of irrigation management zones\nthat can be controlled\
    \ in a precision irrigation strategy will determine the overall ﬂexibility of\
    \ the\nsystem. For moving application systems, the width of the management zone\
    \ is dependent on the\nnumber of drops or nozzles within an individually controlled\
    \ set (i.e., sprinklers controlled by a single\nsolenoid valve) and the length\
    \ will be dependent on the pattern of variability in the direction of the\ntraveling\
    \ sprinkler. The wind speed and the overlap from the wetted sprinkler patterns\
    \ between\nmanagement zones will also affect the accuracy of the water volume\
    \ applied. Raine and McCarthy [32]\nnoted that the spray diameter and overlap\
    \ achieved by moving application systems make it impossible\nto target water applications\
    \ on a single crop basis using these systems. Hedley et al. [2] suggested that\n\
    the economic beneﬁts of spatially varied irrigation should be an important consideration\
    \ even when\nthe system is considered achievable from a technical standpoint.\
    \ The spatial scales associated with\nmoving and ﬁxed irrigation systems is presented\
    \ in Table 1. Smith et al. [11] concluded that the spatial\nresolution of a precision\
    \ irrigation system will be inﬂuenced by the spatial scales associated with the\n\
    application system, spatial resolution of the inﬁeld sensors and the spatial scales\
    \ associated with the\nvariability in crop water requirements.\nTable 1. Spatial\

    \ in Precision Irrigation\nThe water application system used in the precision\
    \ irrigation process must be able to control the\nwater application volume applied\
    \ per unit time to each deﬁned irrigation management unit within a\nﬁeld [13].\
    \ The development of variable rate water application systems has been mostly focused\
    \ on\ncontinuous move systems [11].\nThe control of water application on continuous\
    \ move systems (centre pivot, linear move, boom\nand reel) is based on databases\
    \ of spatially referenced data deﬁning irrigation management units [20].\nThe\
    \ volume of water applied to each management unit can be achieved by varying the\
    \ application rate\nof sprinklers or controlling the ground speed of continuous\
    \ move systems [13].\nThe application rate of sprinklers is mostly varied through\
    \ the pulse modulation of the sprinkler\nnozzles. This involves the application\
    \ of normally opened solenoid valves to control ﬂow through\nan individual or\
    \ group of sprinkler heads. The solenoid turns the ﬂow of water either on or off\
    \ at\na sprinkler location in order to achieve a desired application depth within\
    \ a speciﬁed cycle time.\nThe cycle time is the total number of switching (either\
    \ to on or off phase) required by the solenoid\nvalves during a pulse cycle [34].\
    \ Evans et al. [34] applied the pulse modulated sprinkler control\non a linear\
    \ move sprinkler system. Daccache et al. [8] also applied a pulsed modulated sprinkler\n\
    control on a boom and reel irrigation system. Field evaluation of both systems\
    \ indicated a satisfactory\nperformance over a range of water application rates.\
    \ They however noted a problem with sprinkler\noverlap at the edge of the irrigation\
    \ management units.\nThe variation in irrigation volume applied by a continuous\
    \ move system can also be achieved by\nvarying its travel speed. The sprinklers\
    \ on the manifold of the irrigation system are usually operated\nat a speciﬁed\
    \ ﬂow rate and pressure. An increase in travel speed of the system reduces the\
    \ application\ndepth and a decrease in the travel speed increases the application\
    \ depth [35]. This type of system\ncannot be applied in situations where variable\
    \ application depths are needed along the length of the\nirrigation system [34].\
    \ Al-Karadsheh [9] evaluated the performance of speed control in achieving\nvariable\
    \ water application rate on a linear move system. The wetted diameter of the sprinklers\
    \ was\nreported to be between 15.2 and 21.3 m. He reported that the system needed\
    \ to travel a minimum\ndistance of 16 m before a desired change in application\
    \ volume can be reached. This suggests that this\nsystem is not suitable for use\
    \ in applications where the management units are small in scale.\nThe adaptation\
    \ of ﬁxed irrigation systems for variable rate water application has been achieved\n\
    (e.g., [36]). Variable water rate application in these systems is usually achieved\
    \ either by individual\nnozzle or emitter control, or zone management [13]. Readers\
    \ are referred to [13] for a comprehensive\nreview of such systems. Miranda et\
    \ al. [37] described a distributed control system implemented to\nachieve variable\
    \ rate water application in a ﬁxed irrigation system operating in predeﬁned management\n\
    zones. Their results indicated that the system was able to apply the irrigation\
    \ volume required in\neach zone. Goumopoulos et al. [38] also implemented a variable\
    \ rate water application setup for a\nﬁxed irrigation system capable of zone-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation of strawberries. Individual nozzle control\nin a micro-sprinkler\
    \ system has been demonstrated by Coates et al. [39]. They reported individual\n\
    control of 54 nodes in a vineyard with the system. The nozzle connected to each\
    \ node was capable of\nachieving a unique water application volume. They concluded\
    \ that the water requirements of each\ndeﬁned zone in the vineyard can be individually\
    \ met by the irrigation system. The authors reported a\npayback period of between\
    \ 3.5 and 4.5 years for the system.\n5. Monitoring\nThe routine or continuous\
    \ monitoring of moisture ﬂuxes in the soil–plant–atmosphere system is a\nfundamental\
    \ aspect of managing crop production in irrigated agriculture. Monitoring can\
    \ essentially\nbe viewed as the application of various sensing technologies in\
    \ determining and characterizing\nthe spatiotemporal ﬁeld-scale moisture dynamics\
    \ and plant water use. These sensing methods can\nbe classiﬁed under three broad\
    \ headings: soil-based, weather-based and plant-based sensing [40].\nSoil-based\
    \ sensing typically involves the use of sensors to determine the soil moisture\
    \ content or\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n6 of 29\npotential. This information\
    \ is then used to infer the amount of water available for plant use and\nits temporal\
    \ dynamics. The weather-based sensing involves the use of the crop evapotranspiration\n\
    to determine the temporal crop water use. The evapotranspiration is determined\
    \ using climatic\nvariables such as radiation, rainfall and wind speed [41,42].\
    \ The plant-based sensing involves the\ndetermination of plant water status which\
    \ is usually related to plant physiology. Measurements\nof canopy temperature,\
    \ stomatal resistance, sap ﬂow, leaf turgor pressure, stem diameter and leaf\n\
    thickness are used to infer plant water status [43].\nRecent advances in remote\
    \ sensing has enhanced the possibility of monitoring the spatial nature of\nboth\
    \ soil and crop water status. Remote sensing encompasses non-contact technologies\
    \ that are capable\nof sensing radiation reﬂected or emitted from agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds. They are deployed using satellites,\naerial platforms and tractors [44].\
    \ These technologies have a high spatial resolution and are well suited\nfor regional\
    \ soil and crop water evaluation [45]. This review focuses on sensing technologies\
    \ that can\nbe applied in monitoring ﬁeld-scale soil and crop water dynamics.\
    \ Readers are referred to [44,46] for a\ncomprehensive review of remote sensing\
    \ technologies applicable in precision agriculture.\n5.1. Soil-Based Sensing\n\
    The knowledge of soil moisture ﬂuxes comprising of the depletion and reﬁll of\
    \ soil water can be\nused to monitor crop water use hence making it a useful tool\
    \ in irrigation scheduling and management\ndecisions [47]. Several methods have\
    \ been developed for measuring soil moisture content; they are\nindirect methods\
    \ which rely on the strong relationship between a particular property of the soil\n\
    and the soil moisture content. Moreover, they are able to provide continuous monitoring\
    \ and are\nnon-destructive [48]. In precision irrigation, the commonly applied\
    \ method for monitoring the\ntemporal dynamics of ﬁeld-scale soil moisture is\
    \ the dielectric-based method [20]. This is because\nof the ease of their deployment\
    \ in large-scale soil moisture sensor networks [49]. Thus, the proper\ndeployment\
    \ and management of this technology can optimize the sustainability of irrigated\
    \ agriculture.\nConsequently, this section will outline a brief description of\
    \ this method including a consideration of\nthe factors affecting sensor performance.\
    \ For a more detailed description of other state-of-the-art soil\nmoisture sensing\
    \ technologies, readers are referred to [50,51].\n5.1.1. Dielectric Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensors\nDielectric soil moisture sensors operate by exploiting the dielectric\
    \ properties of soil and its\nconstituents [52]. The relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of a substance is used to describe the effect of\nan electromagnetic ﬁeld on\
    \ its molecular structure. It is a dimensionless constant greater than one,\n\
    made up of a real and imaginary part [53]. The apparent relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of soil, ε′soil\nis a function of its constituents majorly being water, air\
    \ and solid particles. The relative dielectric\npermittivity of the other constituents\
    \ except water has a negligible effect as they have small values in\nthe range\
    \ of 1–7. The one of water, ε′water having a value of approximately 80 has the\
    \ most remarkable\neffect. It is therefore possible to correlate the volumetric\
    \ moisture content (VMC) to ε′soil using\nempirical equations at a frequency range\
    \ of between 50 MHz and 17 GHz. At this high frequency\nrange, ε′soil is highly\
    \ stable and it usually referred to as the apparent dielectric permittivity of\
    \ soil [54].\nA range of electromagnetic sensors exploits this property to provide\
    \ a non-destructive in situ\nmeasurement of soil moisture contents. They include\
    \ time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) sensors, time\ndomain transmission (TDT) sensors\
    \ and capacitance sensors.\n5.1.2. Factors Affecting the Performance of Dielectric\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensors\nThe accuracy of data from soil moisture sensors is important\
    \ in the precision irrigation process.\nOver estimation of soil moisture status\
    \ may lead to a delay in irrigation scheduling decisions and\nconsequently affect\
    \ crop yield and quality. Underestimation of soil moisture status on the other\
    \ hand\nmay lead to application of irrigation too often or when not required by\
    \ the crops. This will result in\nwater/energy wastage and adverse environmental\
    \ effects.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n7 of 29\nDielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ measure the soil moisture content for the soil volume\ncorresponding to their\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence. The various factors affecting the performance of dielectric\n\
    soil moisture sensors include bulk electrical conductivity (salinity), soil texture,\
    \ bulk density and\ntemperature. A variation in any of these factors around the\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence of the dielectric sensor\nwill have an effect on its performance.\
    \ These properties vary with location and depth in a soil proﬁle\nand it is important\
    \ to take them into account when calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ [55].\nThese sensors often rely on site-speciﬁc calibration, but they often\
    \ come with ‘universal’ calibrations\nwhich can be used where absolute accuracy\
    \ is not required. The accuracy of calibration equations\nsupplied by manufacturers\
    \ of these sensors are usually between a range of ±4 - 2% VMC when applied\nin\
    \ non-saline soils [56]. Site-speciﬁc calibration equations which are developed\
    \ by comparing the\nsensor output to gravimetrically derived soil moisture content\
    \ can be applied when a higher level of\naccuracy is required [57]. In addition,\
    \ for capacitance type probes, it is essential that the probe access\ntubes are\
    \ ﬁtted correctly without air gaps to ensure robust soil water measurements. For\
    \ a detailed\ntechnical description of factors affecting the performance of dielectric\
    \ sensors, readers are referred\nto [58,59].\n5.2. Proximal Sensing and Mapping\
    \ of Soil Moisture\nThe recent advances in rapid mapping and positioning technologies\
    \ enables the spatial\ncharacterization of soil moisture retention properties\
    \ to inform precision irrigation decisions.\nThe electromagnetic induction (EM)\
    \ technique is used in combination with accurate positioning\nsystems to quantify\
    \ soil moisture variability at resolutions less than 10 m. It also provides a\
    \ highly\naccurate digital elevation map (DEM) [2].\nThe EM sensor maps the soil’s\
    \ apparent EC which is inﬂuenced by soil texture and moisture in\nnon-saline soils\
    \ [48]. Those same factors correlate highly to the soil’s water-holding capacity.\
    \ Based on\nthe EC maps, a targeted soil sampling can be conducted at different\
    \ parts of the ﬁeld. Topographic\nfeatures that are likely to inﬂuence ﬁeld-scale\
    \ soil moisture dynamics are derived using the DEM [60].\nThe EC maps enable the\
    \ grouping of discrete units known as management units with similar\navailable\
    \ water-holding capacity (AWC) characteristics which can then be used in selecting\
    \ soil\nmoisture monitoring sites. This has been demonstrated by [34,61]. The\
    \ data from soil moisture sensors\nlocated in the management units can also be\
    \ used in generating dynamic application maps based\non a relationship between\
    \ the soil moisture depletion and the mapped EC values. These application\nmaps\
    \ serve as an input into the precision irrigation control system. Hedley and Yule\
    \ [21] applied soil\nmoisture sensors and an EC map in generating dynamic water\
    \ status maps for a 35.2 ha irrigated\nmaize ﬁeld. Daccache et al. [8] applied\
    \ a similar method in producing dynamic soil moisture maps for\nvarious ﬁelds.\n\
    The electric resistivity tomography technique can also be applied in deriving\
    \ the EC map of a ﬁeld.\nHedley et al. [2] reported that the method has a good\
    \ vertical resolution but it cannot be deployed on a\nmoving platform for rapid\
    \ non-invasive mapping. It has been applied by Kelly et al. [62] in positioning\n\
    soil moisture sensors to support irrigation decisions.\nThe ground-penetrating\
    \ radar (GPR) can also be applied in monitoring the ﬁeld-scale soil moisture\n\
    status [50]. It can be mounted on a vehicle or moving irrigation system for mapping\
    \ soil moisture in a\nﬁeld. The GPR is however affected by high clay content,\
    \ is not amenable to automation and requires\nfurther development to improve its\
    \ viability in precision irrigation applications [63].\nThe deployment of soil\
    \ moisture sensors in management units defined by these mapping techniques\nenables\
    \ the dynamic updates of soil moisture maps which can aid variable rate water\
    \ application.\n5.3. Weather-Based Sensing\nWeather-based sensing involves the\
    \ use of climatic variables in determining ET which is indicative\nof the crops’\
    \ daily water use. Evaporation accounts for the direct evaporation of water to\
    \ the air from\nthe soil surface or canopy interception of either precipitation\
    \ or applied irrigation. Transpiration\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n8 of 29\n\
    accounts for the uptake of water by a plant and the subsequent loss of water as\
    \ vapor through stomata\nin its leaves, required for metabolic cooling of the\
    \ leaf to maintain photosynthesis without the leaf\noverheating [41]. Evapotranspiration\
    \ is generally viewed as a combination of the evaporation of water\nfrom the soil,\
    \ evaporation from the canopy surface and plant transpiration [64].\nThe evaporation\
    \ and transpiration process occur simultaneously and are often difﬁcult to\ndistinguish.\
    \ The predominance of each of these processes however varies at different crop\
    \ growth\nstages. At the initial crop growth stage, water is lost mainly in form\
    \ of evaporation from the soil\nsurface. As the development of the crop progresses,\
    \ transpiration becomes the major medium of water\nloss to the atmosphere [45].\n\
    The ET process is largely dependent on solar radiation, vapor pressure deﬁcit\
    \ of the atmosphere\nat any given time and wind speed. It is also inﬂuenced by\
    \ soil water content, the rate at which water\ncan be taken up from the soil by\
    \ the plant roots and crop characteristics (type, variety and growth\nstage) [64].\
    \ Readers are directed to [41,65] for a further discussion on the ET process.\n\
    The temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales is appropriate\n\
    for quantifying crop water use in the precision irrigation process. The United\
    \ Nations Food and\nAgriculture Organization Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) equation\
    \ presents a procedure for computing\nhourly or daily ET values using standard\
    \ climatological measurements of solar radiation, air\ntemperature, humidity and\
    \ wind speed made at a height of 2 m above a fully transpiring grass\nsurface\
    \ [41]. These data can be obtained from automatic weather stations installed on\
    \ a speciﬁc ﬁeld or\nfrom a metrological network. The equation provides a basis\
    \ from which reference ET (ET from the\nwell-watered grass surface) for different\
    \ time periods can be calculated and to which ET from other\ncrops can be computed\
    \ using crop coefﬁcients, Kc [66]. The crop coefﬁcients are speciﬁc to each crop\n\
    and crop canopy cover, which is dependent on the crop growth stage. The Kc curve\
    \ deﬁned for a crop\nover its growth stage is generalized for regions with similar\
    \ climates. The Kc is however dependent on\nthe canopy dynamics including cover\
    \ fraction, leaf area index and greenness which may vary across\nregions with\
    \ similar climates [67]. This introduces errors into ET estimates derived using\
    \ the standard\nFAO-PM crop coefﬁcient approach. The FAO-PM method presents a\
    \ relatively easy procedure for\ndetermining the temporal dynamics of crop water\
    \ use. The crop coefﬁcient used in determining the\nactual ET of a particular\
    \ crop however needs to be estimated at each growth stage. It is noted in\nAllen\
    \ et al. [41] that reference ET can be overestimated by as much as 20% during\
    \ conditions of low\nevaporative demand.\nRemote sensing provides a means of overcoming\
    \ the shortcomings of the FAO-PM crop coefﬁcient\napproach of estimating crop\
    \ ET by providing real-time feedback on daily crop water use as inﬂuenced\nby\
    \ actual crop canopy dynamics, local climatic conditions and ﬁeld spatial variability\
    \ [68]. The remotely\nsensed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed\
    \ from crop canopy reﬂectance\nmeasurements in the red and near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ wavelengths has been found to be a useful tool in\ncomputing accurate crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for a broad range of crops [69]. Singh et al. [70] has demonstrated\nthe use\
    \ of the calculated reference ET and the remotely sensed NDVI in estimating the\
    \ water use of\ncotton. A similar procedure has also been demonstrated by Farg\
    \ et al. [67] for estimating the daily\nwater use of wheat.\nThe surface renewal\
    \ analysis method presents an opportunity for assessing the real-time temporal\n\
    dynamics of crop water use. The surface renewal (SR) method is used to determine\
    \ the sensible heat\nwhich can then be applied to the energy balance equation\
    \ to determine the latent heat (i.e., ET) [71]. It is\nbased on analyzing the\
    \ temperature time series generated from monitoring the change in heat content\n\
    of air parcels that interact with the crop canopy. When an air parcel comes in\
    \ contact with the crop\ncanopy, the air temperature remains constant for a brief\
    \ time period known as the quiescent period.\nThe temperature of the air parcel\
    \ however increases after this time period as energy is transferred\nto it from\
    \ the crop canopy. The increase in temperature continues until the air parcel\
    \ is replaced by\ncooler air from the atmosphere. At this time, the temperature\
    \ of the air shows a sharp drop [72].\nA high frequency trace of this temperature\
    \ renewal event exhibits a ramp-like function. Applying\nSustainability 2017,\
    \ 9, 353\n9 of 29\nstructure function theory to the ramp function enables the\
    \ determination of the sensible heat ﬂux.\nThe instrumentation requirement for\
    \ an SR system is minimal, consisting of small diameter ﬁne wire\nthermocouples\
    \ or a two-dimensional sonic anemometer and a high frequency data acquisition\
    \ system\n(2 Hz to 10 Hz) [71]. Standard climatological measurements are also\
    \ required to obtain the other\nparameters in the energy balance equation.\nThe\
    \ SR technique requires that measurements are taken at a minimum height above\
    \ the crop\ncanopy. It is assumed that the canopy is homogeneous and able to absorb\
    \ all the momentum transferred\nto it by the ambient airﬂow [73]. This assumption\
    \ introduces errors in ET estimates over ﬁelds\nwith variable canopy structures.\
    \ Castellvi and Snyder [74] concluded that the technique can be\napplied for estimating\
    \ ET from short and dense canopy crops as they are mostly decoupled from\nthe\
    \ environment. The technique also requires calibration using an eddy covariance\
    \ system or a\nlysimeter. This may limit its practicality for farm-scale deployment.\
    \ The SR methodology proposed by\nCastellvi [75], however, does not require calibration.\
    \ Rosa and Tanny [76], Shapland and Snyder [72],\nand Rosa et al. [77] have reported\
    \ highly accurate hourly ET estimates from various crops using a\nsurface renewal\
    \ analysis system.\n5.4. Plant-Based Sensing\nThe importance of plant-based monitoring\
    \ becomes emphasized when studying the effect of\nwater deﬁcit on plants and its\
    \ relation to plant water status. The temporal dynamics of crop water use\ncan\
    \ be monitored using a number of plant-based methods. They include methods that\
    \ require direct\ncontact with the plant and those that require only proximal\
    \ contact with the plants [78]. The contact\nsensors are useful in monitoring\
    \ the temporal dynamics of the plant water status while the proximal\nsensors\
    \ are capable of assessing the spatial nature of crop water status across a ﬁeld\
    \ and hence\nwell suited for the precision irrigation process [11]. A good understanding\
    \ of the various aspects of\nplant water status and plant drought physiology is\
    \ important in the successful application of these\nsystems. Readers are directed\
    \ to [79,80] for a comprehensive overview of plant-based sensing methods\napplicable\
    \ in irrigation management. Plant-based sensing systems measure either the plant\
    \ water\ncontent, plant water potential or the plant physiological response to\
    \ moisture deﬁcits. A summary of\nvarious plant-based sensing systems is given\
    \ in Table 2. It should be noted that many of these require\nskilled manpower\
    \ and considerable management time for their operation.\nTable 2. Summary of plant-based\
    \ monitoring methods.\nPlant-Based Measurement\nAdvantage\nDisadvantage\nPlant\

    \ and difﬁcult to implement in\nhumid climates\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n\
    10 of 29\n5.5. Thermal Sensing\nPlant canopy temperature is a widely accepted\
    \ variable indicative of plant water status.\nThe stomata controls evaporative\
    \ cooling of the leaves based on soil water status and prevailing\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions.\nIt closes due to increased water deﬁcits and a reduction in plant\n\
    transpiration causing an increase in plant canopy temperature [91]. The measurement\
    \ of the crop\ncanopy temperature by infrared thermometry which is then normalized\
    \ using an index such as the\ncrop water stress index (CWSI) can be used in determining\
    \ the plant water status and its response to\nwater deﬁcits [79].\nThe CWSI is\
    \ a well-established method of accounting for the variation in canopy temperature\
    \ as\na function of prevailing microclimatological conditions and water deﬁcits\
    \ [92]. It relates the difference\nin the crop canopy temperature measured using\
    \ infrared thermometry to the air temperature as a\nfunction of atmospheric vapor\
    \ deﬁcit [93]. This temperature difference is then related to an upper\nand lower\
    \ temperature baseline to determine a water stress index. The upper baseline represents\n\
    a non-transpiring crop and the lower baseline represents a fully transpiring crop\
    \ under the same\nprevailing environmental condition [30]. The CWSI is a dimensionless\
    \ value of between 0 and 1, with a\nvalue of 0 indicating a well-watered crop\
    \ and a value of 1 indicating a severely water-stressed crop [93].\nBiotic factors\
    \ can also induce stress in a plant thus affecting transpiration rate, crop water\
    \ use and\ncanopy temperature. These biotic factors also affect leaf colour and\
    \ morphology which in turn affects\nthe optical properties of the crop canopy\
    \ [94]. In order to successfully apply infrared thermometry as a\ntool for assessing\
    \ plant water status, it is important to differentiate between abiotic (such as\
    \ water stress)\nand biotic stresses (such as plant diseases and pest infestation).\
    \ Multiband optical sensors could be\napplied in detecting various crop diseases\
    \ and crop infestation within a ﬁeld by computing vegetation\nindices based on\
    \ canopy reﬂectance measurements [33]. This has been applied by Garcia-Ruiz et\
    \ al. [95]\nfor detecting citrus greening and by Yang et al. [96] for detecting\
    \ infestation of green bugs and aphids\nin wheat. It may be useful to outﬁt precision\
    \ irrigation systems with these sensors.\nThe main advantage of thermal sensing\
    \ for precision irrigation application is related to the\nnon-contact and real-time\
    \ capability of the system. Infrared thermometry and thermography provide\nthe\
    \ opportunity to map the spatial variation in crop water status which can guide\
    \ in variable rate\nirrigation management. The use of thermal sensing for guiding\
    \ zone-speciﬁc water application has\nbeen demonstrated as noted in Section 2.\n\
    A major problem faced in applying the thermal sensing approach is the establishment\
    \ of the\nbaseline temperatures. In climates in which the air humidity is often\
    \ high, variations in wind speed and\nnet radiation introduce signiﬁcant errors\
    \ in the estimation of the lower limit baseline temperature [97].\nA number of\
    \ studies have been conducted to develop procedures for enhancing the possibility\
    \ of\napplying measurements of crop canopy temperature in inferring plant water\
    \ status in humid regions.\nJones [98] provides an excellent summary of these\
    \ research efforts. They include the use of well-watered\nplots to substitute\
    \ for empirical non-water stressed baselines, although these well-watered plots\
    \ are\nrarely available in practice. The use of artiﬁcial reference surfaces for\
    \ measuring baseline temperatures\nhas been proposed but it is reported that these\
    \ artiﬁcial reference surfaces differ signiﬁcantly in thermal\nand radiative properties\
    \ in comparison to real leaves. A modeling approach to simulating the canopy\n\
    resistance of well-watered plants has also been investigated but this is limited\
    \ by the difﬁculties\nencountered in correctly modeling stomata behavior and hence\
    \ canopy resistance. The possibility\nof including a wide range of metrological\
    \ data including net radiation and vapor pressure deﬁcit in\nderiving CWSI models\
    \ for humid climates has also been investigated. The mathematical complexity\n\
    typical of the models however limit their practical application.\nAnother problem\
    \ commonly encountered in applying infrared measurements of canopy\ntemperature\
    \ in inferring plant water status is the inclusion of soil temperature and other\
    \ background\ntemperature including the sky and stems in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ This usually leads to\nerrors in estimation of the canopy temperature as the\
    \ soil and background temperature are usually\nmany degrees different from the\
    \ canopy temperature [90]. Jones [99] proposed the use of narrow\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n11 of 29\nacceptance angle infrared sensors that can be positioned\
    \ to view only single leaves as a solution to this\nproblem. It has however been\
    \ found that the temperature estimates of single leaves determined\nby this method\
    \ is mostly not representative of the temperature of the plant canopy.\nA dense\n\
    deployment of infrared sensors may seem an alternative but this may be prohibitive\
    \ in terms of\ncost for practical applications.\nThe advancements in the ﬁeld\
    \ of thermal imagery and the recent availability of low-cost thermal\ncameras\
    \ has presented the possibility of overcoming the problems associated with the\
    \ inclusion of\nsoil and background temperatures in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ Thermal imagery allows\nfor the average temperature of a deﬁned area to be obtained\
    \ and also the separation of background\ntemperature from the area of interest.\
    \ The temperature of a large number of individual leaves\nmaking up a canopy can\
    \ be included in an image while the soil and background temperature can be\ndiscarded\
    \ by applying automated image processing techniques [92]. Gonzalez-Dugo et al.\
    \ [100] has\ndemonstrated the use of thermal imagery in mapping the crop water\
    \ status in a commercial orchard\nin Spain. They also demonstrated the rapid mapping\
    \ of ﬁeld-scale crop water status by deploying\nthermal imaging equipment on an\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).\nPlant-based sensing methods including thermal\
    \ sensing only provide information on the need for\nirrigation and provide no\
    \ information on the volume of irrigation application needed. They are used\n\
    in combination with soil-based sensing for this reason [19].\n6. Decision Support\n\
    A decision support system for irrigation management and scheduling provides a\
    \ framework\nfor incorporating various tools and techniques for site-speciﬁc irrigation\
    \ decisions. The widespread\ncommercial adoption of precision irrigation will\
    \ be predicated on the development of robust and\noptimal decision support systems\
    \ [19].\nA number of decision support systems schedule irrigation at predeﬁned\
    \ intervals and apply\npredeﬁned irrigation volumes. They do not incorporate any\
    \ form of sensor feedback on plant water\nstatus, soil water status and climatic\
    \ variables [101]. This ‘open-loop’ strategy is largely designed based\non heuristics\
    \ and historical data. Mareels et al. [102] suggested that this is an inefﬁcient\
    \ approach often\nleading to overwatering and waste of fertilizer and other supplemental\
    \ crop inputs.\nClosed-loop irrigation strategies aim to irrigate: when the soil\
    \ moisture content reaches a certain\nthreshold [103–105]; when plant sensors\
    \ indicate a certain stress threshold [93,106,107] or with feedback\nfrom crop\
    \ simulation models with the aim of attaining a certain yield, crop physiological\
    \ response or\neconomic objective [108]. These closed-loop irrigation strategies\
    \ have been shown to improve water\nuse efﬁciency in the production of horticultural\
    \ crops under protected environments. Environmental\nconditions in such production\
    \ systems can be controlled based on plant feedback which eliminates the\nstochastic\
    \ plant response often encountered in ﬁeld-scale crop production [109]. Belayneh\
    \ et al. [110]\nimplemented a wireless sensor network of soil moisture sensors\
    \ for closed-loop irrigation control in\na pot-in-pot nursery. A signiﬁcant reduction\
    \ in water use was achieved by the system. The authors\nalso reported a 2.7-year\
    \ payback period for the system. Chappell et al. [111] reported water savings\
    \ of\n83% for a closed-loop irrigation control system implemented in a protected\
    \ crop production system.\nThey noted that there was less occurrence of plant\
    \ diseases in the nursery due to the elimination of\nover-watering. Saavoss et\
    \ al. [112] reported a 65% increase in proﬁt due to the implementation of a\n\
    wireless sensor network-based closed-loop control system in a nursery. The authors\
    \ noted that the\nincrease in proﬁt was due to improvement in crop quality and\
    \ yield resulting from the precise control\nof irrigation applications.\nIn ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop production, the crop needs vary over time and space due to both biotic\
    \ and\nabiotic factors [9]. McCarthy et al. [113] noted that in these crop production\
    \ systems, closed-loop\nstrategies are unable to account for unknown crop dynamics,\
    \ the stochastic nature of climatic variables\nand crop response, and the time-varying\
    \ nature of the soil-plant-atmosphere system. This last\npoint is especially due\
    \ to crop growth, crop management and infestation of pests and diseases.\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n12 of 29\nThe closed-loop systems are also unable to consider\
    \ equipment and other operational limitations.\nMcCarthy et al. [114] concluded\
    \ that an optimal decision support system must be ‘adaptive’ with\nthe ability\
    \ of accommodating the temporal and spatial variability within the ﬁeld. The decision\n\
    support system must also have the capability of modifying irrigation decisions\
    \ in response to crop\nphysiology, uncertainties in climatic inputs, soil, irrigation\
    \ systems and water supply limitations,\neconomic considerations and the quality\
    \ of sensor feedback.\n6.1. Adaptive Decision Support\nThe characteristics of\
    \ a cropping system varies over time. Within a cropped system, the properties\n\
    that will typically vary within and between seasons include crop growth, soil\
    \ properties (due to\naddition of nutrients and other management processes) and\
    \ climate. This will have a direct inﬂuence\non the irrigation timing and volume\
    \ required for optimal crop growth [11].\nAn adaptive decision support system\
    \ is able to continuously re-adjust the irrigation scheduling\nalgorithm in order\
    \ to retain the desired performance of the irrigation system [114]. The adaptive\n\
    decision support system is able to utilize historical or real-time sensor data\
    \ to arrive at irrigation\ntiming and volume that adequately accounts for the\
    \ temporal and spatial variability in the ﬁeld [114].\nIn control theory an adaptive\
    \ control system is generally accepted as a control system able to adjust\nits\
    \ controller parameters based on sensor feedback from a process, such that the\
    \ controlled process\nbehaves in a desirable way [11]. McCarthy et al. [108] noted\
    \ that an adaptive decision support system\nfor irrigation may either be sensor-based\
    \ if they use direct sensor measurements for the irrigation\nstrategy or model-based\
    \ if they use a calibrated simulation model to aid irrigation decisions.\nThe\
    \ development of adaptive decision support systems presents an opportunity to\
    \ improve\nsustainability in precision irrigation through improved water use and\
    \ crop productivity. They will\nalso enhance synergistic applications of data\
    \ available from soil, plant and weather sensors to arrive at\noptimal irrigation\
    \ scheduling decisions [108].\nIn this section we will present a brief discussion\
    \ on state-of-the-art of adaptive decision support\nsystems. We will thereafter\
    \ discuss the opportunities these systems present in improving sustainability\n\
    in irrigated agriculture. Readers are referred to [113] for a comprehensive overview\
    \ on the application\nof advanced process control to irrigation, details on methods\
    \ of operation and a consideration of\nfundamental control concepts as they apply\
    \ to irrigation scheduling.\n6.1.1. Mechanistic Models\nA number of irrigation\
    \ decision support systems are based on complex physical models which\nclosely\
    \ resemble the actual physical system [115]. They are able to incorporate the\
    \ physiological and\nmorphological representation of the plant into the decision\
    \ support tool. Barnard and Bauerle [116]\ndescribed an irrigation scheduling\
    \ system based on the spatially explicit biophysical model, MAESTRA\n(Multi-Array\
    \ Evaporation Stand Tree Radiation A), which couples the within-canopy photosynthesis\n\
    and stomatal conductance. Data on leaf temperature, canopy aerodynamics and environmental\n\
    variables are used as inputs into the model to predict the plant transpiration.\
    \ They reported that\nthe model-based tool applied between 18% and 56% more water\
    \ than a sensing-based method for\nscheduling irrigation in four species. They,\
    \ however, noted that the model-based approach produced\ngreater tree growth.\
    \ Asher et al. [117] described a mechanistic model capable of inferring crop water\n\
    requirements. The model employs leaf temperature data as input for determining\
    \ the crop aerodynamic\ncharacteristics which is then used in the Penman–Monteith\
    \ equation for calculating the actual crop\nET. A major drawback of these mechanistic\
    \ models is that they include static parameters which, once\nidentiﬁed, are assumed\
    \ to remain constant over the cropping season. This is rarely so in practice as\
    \ the\ncropping system varies over time due to both biotic and abiotic factors.\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n13 of 29\n6.1.2. Simulations\nCrop simulation models\
    \ based on ﬁrst principle physical models of crop phenology, soil physics\nand\
    \ hydrology can be applied in simulating the crop response to irrigation and cropping\
    \ system\nmanagement [115]. These simulation models provide the opportunity to\
    \ evaluate the beneﬁt of several\nprecision irrigation strategies as they eliminate\
    \ the need for time-consuming ﬁeld experiments [118].\nThey can be interfaced\
    \ with real-time sensor feedback from soil or plant sensors and weather data to\n\
    determine daily irrigation requirements of crops. They can also be used in predicting\
    \ the yield impact\nof an irrigation strategy. This is achieved by employing weather\
    \ forecast data in computing a daily soil\nmoisture balance and assessing the\
    \ impact of soil moisture deﬁcits on crop growth [118].\nDeJonge et al. [14] investigated\
    \ the effect of variable rate irrigation management on corn\nproduction in Iowa\
    \ using the CERES-maize model. Corn yield was compared for a period of 28 years\n\
    under simulated scenarios of no irrigation, scheduled uniform irrigation and precision\
    \ irrigation. They\nreported no signiﬁcant difference in corn yield and water\
    \ use between the uniform irrigation and\nprecision irrigation scenarios. Thorp\
    \ et al. [24] described a methodology for applying the Decision\nSupport System\
    \ for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop growth model in analyzing variable\
    \ rate\nmanagement practices including irrigation on crop growth and yield. The\
    \ platform enabled the\nevaluation of precision irrigation strategies on crop\
    \ performance in predeﬁned management zones.\nThese systems are however incapable\
    \ of real-time decision support and can only be applied using\nhistorical data.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [114] proposed a simulation framework, VARIwise, capable of real-time\
    \ decision\nsupport in precision irrigation. The simulation framework is capable\
    \ of incorporating real-time data\ninput from ﬁeld sensors in arriving at irrigation\
    \ decisions. The combination of different sensor inputs\ninto the simulation framework\
    \ enables adaptive decision support with the system being able to\nre-adjust irrigation\
    \ decisions based on plant feedback and also explore optimal control strategies.\n\
    Simulation models for use in irrigation decision support require extensive calibration\
    \ and\nvalidation to establish model accuracy. The limitation in data available\
    \ for this endeavour often\nlimit the use of the platforms to speciﬁc crops.\n\
    6.1.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nArtiﬁcial intelligence presents the potential of\
    \ solving problems in precision irrigation which\nare complex, non-linear and\
    \ ill-deﬁned [119]. Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms are able to emulate\nthe\
    \ human decision-making process when applied to a particular problem domain. They\
    \ have been\ndeployed for implementing adaptive decision support in irrigation\
    \ in form of artiﬁcial neural networks,\nfuzzy logic and expert systems with mixed\
    \ success to date [118–120].\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks\nArtiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ (ANN) are non-linear mapping structures employed in modeling when\nthe underlying\
    \ data relationship is not well deﬁned. ANN are able to identify and learn correlations\n\
    between input data and corresponding target output values. They are able to predict\
    \ the outcome of\nnew independent data sets making them a useful tool in predictive\
    \ modeling [121]. ANN are well\nsuited for the irrigation decision support problem\
    \ that can often be complex and stochastic in nature.\nThese networks are also\
    \ adaptive in nature and are able to continuously learn in order to provide\n\
    optimal solutions to target problems in dynamic systems.\nKarasekreter et al.\
    \ [122] implemented an ANN for scheduling irrigation in a strawberry orchard\n\
    using soil moisture and its physical properties as model inputs. The system was\
    \ able to achieve water\nsavings of 20.5% and an energy saving of 23.9%. ANN however\
    \ require large datasets for training and\nare unable to describe the physical\
    \ dynamics of a system. This makes their use limited in real-time\ndecision support\
    \ tools.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n14 of 29\nFuzzy Logic\nFuzzy logic is an\
    \ artificial intelligence algorithm that can be used to model a process and relate\
    \ it\nto human experience in arriving at decisions. A fuzzy logic system is made\
    \ up of a set used to classify\ninput data into membership classes, a decision\
    \ rule that is applied to each set which culminates in a\nhuman-like decision\
    \ output from the system [123]. A detailed description of the process is given\
    \ in [124].\nMousa and Abdullah [123] successfully applied a fuzzy logic model\
    \ in scheduling irrigation in\ndrip and sprinkler irrigation systems using ET,\
    \ soil moisture data and crop growth stage as model\ninputs. Prakashgoud and Desai\
    \ [124] employed a fuzzy logic system using soil moisture data, leaf\nwetness\
    \ and climatological data as model inputs in order to implement irrigation scheduling\
    \ decisions.\nThe system was capable of maintaining soil moisture thresholds in\
    \ the speciﬁed range. Giusti and\nMarsili-Libelli [125] described an adaptive\
    \ irrigation decision support system implemented with fuzzy\nlogic. The system\
    \ incorporates a predictive model of the soil moisture and an inference system\
    \ for\nmaintaining the soil moisture within an acceptable threshold. The system\
    \ was reported to adapt\nirrigation decisions to rainfall uncertainty and produced\
    \ water savings of 13.55% over a simulation\nperiod of 168 days.\nThe accuracy\
    \ of fuzzy logic systems is largely tied to an in-depth knowledge of the system.\
    \ They\nalso lack an inner mechanistic structure with the domain of applicability\
    \ limited to the range of training\ndata used in setting them up. Delgoda et al.\
    \ [115] suggested that the points mentioned makes decision\nmaking with a fuzzy\
    \ system an ad hoc process limiting its application in adaptive decision support.\n\
    Expert Systems\nAn expert system is a tool able to emulate the reasoning process\
    \ a human expert would employ\nin a decision-making process in his/her ﬁeld of\
    \ expertise. It captures the human decision-making\nexpertise and heuristics representing\
    \ it in a series of rules and facts [126]. An expert system typically\nconsists\
    \ of a knowledge base component and an inference engine that acts as a reasoning\
    \ tool [127].\nExpert systems are especially suited to dynamic problems that are\
    \ of a complex nature. They are also\nwell suited to dealing with incomplete and\
    \ uncertain data [128]. This makes them well suited for\nirrigation decision support\
    \ which often requires the input of experts to arrive at optimal decisions.\n\
    Expert systems applied in irrigation decision support can be classiﬁed as either\
    \ ‘expert systems\nproper’ or hybrid expert systems. A detailed review on the\
    \ application of expert systems in irrigation\ndecision support is given in [128,129].\
    \ The ‘expert systems proper’ class of irrigation decision support\ntools schedule\
    \ irrigation based on soil moisture and climatic data. They are unable to consider\
    \ the\ntime-varying nature of the cropping system (crop growth, disease and pest\
    \ infestation) to arrive at\noptimal irrigation decisions. They are also unable\
    \ to account for the stochastic nature of climatic\nvariables and are not well\
    \ suited for real-time applications [129].\nHybrid expert systems which are also\
    \ referred to as model-based expert systems combine\nalgorithmic techniques and\
    \ a knowledge-based component in solving problems relevant to its\napplication\
    \ domain. Its advantage in irrigation is that optimal irrigation decision can\
    \ be made\nby combining expert knowledge with data feedback from inﬁeld sensors,\
    \ data-driven models and crop\nsimulation models [130]. Thomson and Ross [131]\
    \ described a model-based expert system designed\nfor decision support in irrigation\
    \ management. The system employs feedback from soil moisture\nsensors to adjust\
    \ the input of a crop simulation model, PNUTGRO (peanut crop growth simulation\n\
    model), and also incorporates the capability of sensor feedback validation. The\
    \ system was reported\nto maintain soil moisture at the deﬁned thresholds. Goumopoulos\
    \ et al. [38] developed an expert\nsystem-based adaptive decision support platform\
    \ for zone-speciﬁc irrigation of strawberry plants.\nThe system includes a wireless\
    \ sensor network of soil, climate and plant sensors providing feedback\nfor the\
    \ decision support system. It also includes a machine learning process capable\
    \ of inferring new\nrules and extending the knowledge base from logged data sets.\
    \ The system was reported to reduce\nirrigation water consumption by around 20%.\
    \ A hybrid expert system based on real-time soil moisture\ndata with the capability\
    \ of incorporating plant models is described in Kohanbash et al. [132].\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n15 of 29\nThe performance of an expert system is largely dependent\
    \ on the effectiveness of the knowledge\nacquisition process. An error in this\
    \ process will drastically affect the system reliability and its performance.\n\
    6.1.4. Learning Control\nLearning control decision support strategies perform\
    \ systems identiﬁcation using sensor feedback\nwithout deﬁning a mathematical\
    \ model [113]. Systems identiﬁcation models a dynamic system based\non a time\
    \ series of measured input/output data [133]. A comprehensive overview on the\
    \ theory of\nsystems identiﬁcation is presented in [134].\nIterative learning\
    \ control can be applied in systems with ill-deﬁned models that operate\nrepetitively\
    \ and assume the same initial condition after each iteration.\nIt is well suited\
    \ to the\nirrigation problem as irrigation scheduling and application is a repetitive\
    \ problem over the crop\nseason. The time-varying nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system can also be viewed as an\nill-deﬁned problem. The strategy is also able\
    \ to improve system performance by eliminating the effects\nof a repeating disturbance\
    \ with undeﬁned dynamics. Applied to irrigation, this may be a measured\ncrop\
    \ response that reoccurs as a consequence of irrigation. The temporal changes\
    \ in crop water use\nand weather conditions are not considered [113].\nMcCarthy\
    \ et al. [114] noted that a drawback of the iterative learning approach may be\
    \ the\ninefﬁcient systems identiﬁcation resulting from the slow system dynamics\
    \ of the crop system in\nresponse to irrigation events. This results from the\
    \ evaluation of the effect of only one irrigation\nvolume on plant response at\
    \ any water application event. They suggested that this drawback may be\neliminated\
    \ by applying the process of iterative hill climbing control. This learning control\
    \ strategy\nemploys an adaptive varied identiﬁcation process. A range of irrigation\
    \ volumes are applied at each\nirrigation event to a number of test cells on the\
    \ ﬁeld. The response in the test cell that best matches\nthe desired system performance\
    \ is identiﬁed as the optimal irrigation process. They reported that\nthe iterative\
    \ hill climbing control procedure was capable of maximizing cotton yield when\
    \ used\nwith a combination of plant and soil sensors to provide feedback for the\
    \ identiﬁcation procedure.\nTheir conclusions were however based on results from\
    \ a simulation study and a ﬁeld-based validation\nof the procedure was not reported.\n\
    The results of the learning control procedure are based solely on sensor measurements\
    \ and may be\nlargely affected by sensor drift as a model of the crop response\
    \ is not developed from the identiﬁcation\nprocedure. This method can be considered\
    \ more of a “brute force” approach than a scientiﬁcally based\napproach to scheduling\
    \ irrigation.\n6.1.5. Model Predictive Control\nModel predictive control (MPC)\
    \ is an industrial control approach employed in decision support\nfor large-scale\
    \ multivariable problems with multiple constraints. It has been successfully implemented\n\
    in the food industry, petrochemical industry and power generation among others\
    \ [135]. Model\npredictive control employs a plant model and optimization algorithm\
    \ to calculate plant inputs in order\nto achieve a future value of a performance\
    \ criterion. The system performance is predicted over a ﬁnite\nhorizon subject\
    \ to constraints on both the inputs and outputs of the plant [101]. Readers are\
    \ directed\nto [135–137] for an in-depth review of the theory of model predictive\
    \ control and its application in\nvarious industries.\nIn the case of irrigation,\
    \ applying a soil moisture balance model, the plant input will be the\nirrigation\
    \ amount, the plant output will be the soil moisture deﬁcit, and both crop ET\
    \ and precipitation\nvalues will be considered as disturbances as they cannot\
    \ be controlled. A prediction of future input\nvalues and disturbances is required\
    \ in an MPC system in order to determine the optimal system\noutput [138]. This\
    \ highlights the need for the incorporation of weather forecast data into the\
    \ MPC\nframework for irrigation decision support.\nModel predictive control appears\
    \ to be well suited to the domain of irrigation decision support.\nThe irrigation\
    \ problem has input constraints in terms of optimal irrigation volume and output\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n16 of 29\nconstraints in terms of soil moisture thresholds\
    \ and the desired plant response to water deﬁcits [135].\nOoi et al. [139], Lozoya\
    \ et al. [101] and Saleem et al. [135] described a model predictive control\n\
    framework for irrigation scheduling based on a soil moisture balance model. They\
    \ employed a\nsystem identiﬁcation procedure to generate a grey box model of the\
    \ soil–plant–atmosphere system\nwith a network of soil moisture sensors providing\
    \ real-time feedback to the control algorithm. They\nall reported the ability\
    \ of the MPC platform to sufﬁciently predict crop irrigation needs and also\n\
    observations of signiﬁcant water savings. The authors of the discussed systems\
    \ however fail to account\nfor the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use in the system dynamics. Delgoda et al. [138]\nnoted that an adequate consideration\
    \ of the uncertainty in rainfall and ET inputs into the water balance\nmodel employed\
    \ in the MPC framework will improve the capability of the MPC system.\nDelgoda\
    \ et al. [115] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above MPC frameworks by employing\n\
    disturbance afﬁne feedback control, an uncertainty modelling technique widely\
    \ applied in MPC\nto account for the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use. A simple order model of soil\nmoisture dynamics is included in the system\
    \ to enable online calculation of model parameters, hence\naccounting for the\
    \ time-varying nature of soil-plant-atmosphere system. The authors reported an\n\
    optimal performance of the system in humid regions where considerable uncertainties\
    \ in climatic\nvariables exist.\n6.2. Commercial Sensor Applications in Adaptive\
    \ Decision Support\nManufacturers of sensors and a number of system integrators\
    \ are showing considerable interest\nin developing innovative tools that will\
    \ further optimize irrigation water use.\nA sensor integration project is described\
    \ by AgSmarts (Memphis, TN, USA). Moving irrigation\nsystems are equipped with\
    \ sensors which provide data on crop growth stage and soil proﬁle. Aquaspy\nsoil\
    \ moisture sensors (San Diego, CA, USA) positioned in various parts of the ﬁeld\
    \ also provide data\non soil moisture status which is applied in irrigation timing\
    \ and calculation of irrigation volumes.\nThese irrigation decisions are automatically\
    \ adjusted based on the varying water requirements at each\ncrop growth stage\
    \ [140].\nOmica, Italy has deployed a wireless sensor network of Libelium environmental\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors (Zaragoza, Spain) on a maize farm in Italy to support\
    \ irrigation decisions. The sensors\nare interfaced to a geo-referenced decision\
    \ support system which enables zone-speciﬁc irrigation\nmanagement. The system\
    \ is able to predict crop yield based on irrigation timing and application\nvolumes\
    \ combined with historical yield data. This can then be applied in optimizing\
    \ the decision\nsupport system towards achieving a desired crop yield goal.\n\
    Most decision support systems presently produced for commercial use provide on/off\
    \ irrigation\ncontrol based on speciﬁed thresholds and plant/crop sensor feedback.\
    \ The incorporation of predictive\nmodels into these systems will enhance the\
    \ possibility of improving irrigation water use and crop\nyield [141].\n7. Opportunities\
    \ for Improving Sustainability\nSustainability is premised on the principle of\
    \ meeting the needs of the present generation without\ncompromising the ability\
    \ of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable agriculture is\n\
    focused on developing farming practices that are safe and do not have an adverse\
    \ impact on the\nenvironment [142].\nPretty [143] suggested that sustainable agriculture\
    \ integrates the main goals of environmental\nhealth and economic proﬁtability.\
    \ The efﬁcient and effective use of water is considered the main driver\nfor improving\
    \ sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This will involve the use of less water\
    \ for irrigating\ncrops and also preserving the quality of water sources. Conventional\
    \ irrigation practices apply water\nuniformly over a ﬁeld resulting in a high\
    \ volume of water use. Overirrigation may also result from\nthis practice which\
    \ causes leaching of nitrates and nutrients into ground water sources. An important\n\
    consideration would also be the use of less energy for operating water pumps and\
    \ irrigation application\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n17 of 29\nequipment. Soil\
    \ erosion continues to be a serious threat to sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\
    \ This\ncan be eliminated by applying precise irrigation volumes to reduce surface\
    \ runoff.\nPrecision irrigation presents a promising platform for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated\nagriculture. This is especially hinged on the possibility of eliminating\
    \ the adverse environmental\nimpacts related to conventional irrigation practices\
    \ with the adoption of precision irrigation.\nThe economic proﬁtability of the\
    \ adoption of precision irrigation is however a very important point\nto consider.\
    \ This will be manifested in terms of improved crop yields and increased water\
    \ savings\nincluding the associated reduction in energy consumption resulting\
    \ from the optimal matching of\nirrigation inputs to the spatial water demands\
    \ of the ﬁeld, thus reducing costs [11].\nPrecision irrigation is predicated on\
    \ the hypothesis that the crop water requirements vary spatially\nacross a ﬁeld.\
    \ In heterogeneous crops such as fruit orchards, this variability is also due\
    \ to physiological\nfactors such as leaf area and fruit load [144]. It is assumed\
    \ that varying water application across the ﬁeld\nto meet this spatial crop water\
    \ need will improve crop yield and reduce the costs of associated inputs.\nSmith\
    \ et al. [11] noted that the evidence to support this hypothesis in commercial\
    \ crop production is\nnot readily found in literature.\nEvans and King [18] reviewed\
    \ much of the work prior to that date focused on analysing the\nimprovements in\
    \ crop yield and water savings achievable with precision irrigation and suggested\
    \ that\nthe greatest savings are likely to occur in humid climates by the increased\
    \ utilization of stored moisture\nand in-season precipitation. Results from simulation-\
    \ and ﬁeld-based case studies they reviewed\nshowed water savings of 0% to 26%\
    \ for well-watered crop production employing precision irrigation\nstrategies.\
    \ No signiﬁcant improvements in crop yields resulting from the adoption of precision\n\
    irrigation were reported. They concluded that in arid and semi-arid regions, precision\
    \ irrigation is\nmore suited to maximize net return rather than yield and it may\
    \ have greater potential in reducing\nirrigation water use in humid climates when\
    \ irrigating to maximally utilize in-season precipitation.\nThey further noted\
    \ that the economic beneﬁt of adopting precision irrigation for ﬁeld-scale crop\n\
    production is limited. This is because the cost of equipment, maintenance and\
    \ management is much\ngreater than the revenue improvements achieved as a result\
    \ of improved yield and water savings.\nThe payback period of implementing the\
    \ technology may also exceed the useful life of the water\napplication equipment,\
    \ typically placed at 15 years. A payback period ranging from 5 to 20 years is\n\
    noted in Smith et al. [11] for the adoption of precision irrigation for crop production\
    \ in New Zealand.\nEvans et al. [145] reviewed the adoption trends of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation in the USA covering\na period of 20 years. They noted that\
    \ about only 200 of the 175,000 moving irrigation systems in the\nUSA were ﬁtted\
    \ with variable rate water application technology. They suggested higher net returns\
    \ on\ninvestment as a stimuli for adoption of precision irrigation by growers.\
    \ Growers that had adopted the\ntechnology reported no signiﬁcant savings in water\
    \ and energy use in non-limiting water situations.\nThey noted that in more than\
    \ 20 years of research pertaining to variable rate irrigation management,\nthe\
    \ economic beneﬁt was yet to be demonstrated. This was attributed to the marginal\
    \ water savings\n(5%–15%) which is insufﬁcient to realize a payback for the initial\
    \ investment in the water application\ntechnology. They concluded that an economic\
    \ strategy that optimizes net return rather than total\nreturns for the technology\
    \ should be adopted as a long-term investment goal.\nHeeren et al. [146] conducted\
    \ a simulation study to assess the reductions in pumping costs\nthrough the adoption\
    \ of precision irrigation in 49,224 centre-pivot irrigated ﬁelds in Nebraska,\
    \ USA.\nThe study focused on applying variable rate water applications in mining\
    \ undepleted available water.\nThey noted that the reduction in pumping costs\
    \ achieved from the adoption of precision irrigation\nin all ﬁelds may be negligible\
    \ in comparison to the cost of variable rate water application equipment.\nThey\
    \ concluded that the adoption of this technology will be economically justiﬁable\
    \ only with an\nincrease in energy costs.\nAn economic evaluation of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation applications is presented in Lee [147].\nThe study assessed\
    \ energy savings resulting from pumping lesser volumes of water for irrigation\
    \ on\na 67-acre ﬁeld in Wyoming. The cost of installing the variable rate water\
    \ application equipment on\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n18 of 29\nthe ﬁeld was\
    \ reported as $29,513 with a useful equipment life of 15 years. The yearly return\
    \ for the\nequipment based on energy savings achieved was computed as $1816.71,\
    \ which equates to a payback\nperiod of 16.25 years. This suggests that a payback\
    \ will only be realized for the technology outside the\nuseful life of the equipment.\n\
    Precision irrigation offers the beneﬁt of providing water conservation beneﬁts\
    \ by avoiding\noverirrigation and the associated adverse environmental impacts\
    \ [18]. Sadler et al. [148] discussed\nwater conservation strategies where precision\
    \ irrigation can potentially reduce the total water applied\nand improve the environmental\
    \ quality of irrigated ﬁelds. They suggested that programing zero\nirrigation\
    \ amounts to non-cropped areas will improve water conservation using precision\
    \ irrigation.\nThey also noted that adjusting spatial water application based\
    \ on the inﬁltration rate of the soil and\nsoil water storage capacity will reduce\
    \ the occurrence of surface runoff and soil erosion. Surface runoff\nand leaching\
    \ were identiﬁed as the major avenues for loss of nutrients from the soil. They\
    \ suggested\nthe occurrence of this can be eliminated by spatial application of\
    \ precise irrigation volumes based on\nthe soil water-holding characteristics.\
    \ They presented several case studies in which the adoption of\nprecision irrigation\
    \ has been demonstrated to enhance the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\n\
    They concluded that precision irrigation has the capability of improving water\
    \ use efﬁciencies while\nreducing the adverse environmental impacts associated\
    \ with conventional irrigation practices.\nThe results from the above studies\
    \ show that precision irrigation is a proven tool for improving\nsustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of enhancing environmental health. Its economic\n\
    justiﬁcation in terms of signiﬁcant yield improvements and water savings is however\
    \ limited.\nEvans and King [18] suggested that the lack of signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in yield response when\nemploying precision irrigation may result from the fact\
    \ that the yield response to the water curve\nnear maximum yield (100% ET) is\
    \ almost ﬂat, with small changes in water applied using precision\nirrigation\
    \ having little effect on yield. The majority of these precision irrigation studies\
    \ have used only\nsoil data for irrigation management. The local microclimate\
    \ and crop genetics may however have a\ndirect inﬂuence on the yield response\
    \ of the crops.\nSoil moisture status may also not provide a complete indication\
    \ of crop water status, rather the\nplant may be the best indicator of water availability.\
    \ The decision support systems employed by\ncurrent precision irrigation systems\
    \ assume that the soil–plant–atmosphere system never varies with\ntime. The characteristics\
    \ of the crop, soil and climate vary within the season altering the timing and\n\
    optimal amount of irrigation volume required at any irrigation application event.\n\
    We argue that the incorporation of multiple sensed variables (plant, soil and\
    \ weather data) will\nenhance the possibility of arriving at optimal irrigation\
    \ decisions and hence an improvement in\neconomic outcomes. This should be integrated\
    \ with a decision support system that has the capability\nto adapt to the time-varying\
    \ nature of the cropping system. The decision support system should also\nhave\
    \ the capacity to ‘learn’ in order to improve its performance based on experience\
    \ and a target crop\nproduction function. We discuss how this can be achieved\
    \ by exploiting improvements in monitoring\nand management considerations.\n7.1.\
    \ Monitoring Considerations\nA precision irrigation system is designed to apply\
    \ water at a differential rate in response to the\ntemporal and spatial variation\
    \ in crop water need across a ﬁeld. This process is supported by a number\nof\
    \ sensors providing data to a real-time decision support system. These sensors\
    \ include weather\nstations, soil moisture sensors, environmental sensors, plant\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors which may\nbe integrated into a wireless sensor\
    \ network. A careful design of these sensing systems including a\nconsideration\
    \ of factors affecting their performance is crucial in realizing the goal of improved\
    \ water\nuse through precision irrigation.\nDielectric soil moisture sensors sense\
    \ the water content of the immediate soil in their zone\nof inﬂuence. The zone\
    \ of inﬂuence reported for most commercial dielectric soil moisture sensors\n\
    corresponds to a cylindrical measurement volume of 1.5 L [149]. It is therefore\
    \ important to install\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n19 of 29\nthe sensors in\
    \ areas representative of the soil moisture available for plant use. The normal\
    \ practice\nemployed by most users is to place the sensors in the driest regions\
    \ of the ﬁeld or in the regions\ncomprising of a soil proﬁle with the lowest available\
    \ water-holding capacity [150]. Adopting this\napproach will most likely lead\
    \ to wetter regions in the ﬁeld receiving more frequent irrigation which\nwill\
    \ consequently result in overirrigation. A more efﬁcient approach is to deﬁne\
    \ irrigation management\nzones and place a number of sensors in each management\
    \ zone to give the average soil moisture\nestimate. This may however be limited\
    \ by cost.\nA structured installation proﬁle is also necessary in order to capture\
    \ soil water movement and\navailability. It is recommended that sensors should\
    \ be installed at each soil horizon along the plant\nrooting zone [151]. An accepted\
    \ convention is the installation of sensors at three to four depths along\nthe\
    \ rooting zone (1 per 25% of total rooting depth). The sensor located on the uppermost\
    \ soil proﬁle\nis able to detect precipitation events, the sensor in the deepest\
    \ part of the proﬁle is able to detect\ndrainage and the other sensors located\
    \ midway in the soil proﬁle are able to capture soil moisture\ndynamics useful\
    \ in supporting irrigation scheduling decisions [152]. The variation in soil properties\n\
    at the different rooting depths should also be taken into account. With an increasing\
    \ knowledge of\nthe site, it is usually possible to install the sensors at two\
    \ depths and still adequately capture the soil\nmoisture dynamics. The soil moisture\
    \ sensors should also be deployed using soil-speciﬁc calibration\nequations to\
    \ enable accurate estimates of soil moisture content.\nThe actual crop evapotranspiration\
    \ can vary spatially and temporally under conditions of\nunrestricted water supply.\
    \ These variations can be the result of several factors including differences\n\
    in crop genetics, plant density, weed competition, pest intensity, nutrient availability\
    \ and stage of\ngrowth [18]. Addressing the variation in ET across a ﬁeld may\
    \ result in signiﬁcant water savings.\nThe accurate measurement of evapotranspiration\
    \ is crucial in arriving at optimal irrigation\ndecisions [71]. The FAO-PM procedure\
    \ for calculating ET which is applied in many precision irrigation\nsystems relies\
    \ on information from weather stations applied in calculating a reference ET which\
    \ is\nadjusted for speciﬁc crops using crop coefﬁcients. This calculated ET is\
    \ assumed to be uniform for every\npart of the ﬁeld. This will however result\
    \ in the application of inaccurate irrigation volumes to replace\ncrop water use,\
    \ owing to the spatial nature of the actual ET. The application of the NDVI technique\n\
    in determining site-speciﬁc crop coefﬁcients provides a platform for overcoming\
    \ this challenge.\nThe surface renewal analysis procedure also presents a promising\
    \ tool for quantifying the actual\ncrop ET. It is however best suited to homogeneous,\
    \ short and dense canopies.\nPlant-based measurements provide the best indication\
    \ of plant water status as they provide a direct\nmeasure of the plants’ response\
    \ to soil moisture availability and climatic demand. An efficient plant-based\n\
    monitoring system should however respond sensitively to the slightest change in\
    \ water deficits.\nMeasurements of leaf water potential and sap ﬂow are contact\
    \ methods which give direct\ninformation on plant water status but their spatial\
    \ resolution is limited as many samples are required\nto effectively monitor the\
    \ dynamics of ﬁeld-scale plant water status [153]. Infrared thermometry has\n\
    provided a robust platform for assessing plant water status. The (CWSI calculated\
    \ from the infrared\nmeasurements of crop canopy temperature can adequately quantify\
    \ ﬁeld-scale crop water status with\nhigh spatial and temporal resolution. This\
    \ presents a robust and cost-effective tool for use in precision\nirrigation.\
    \ Its application in humid regions is however marred with difﬁculties.\nA systems\
    \ engineering approach can be applied in overcoming the difficulties encountered\
    \ with\napplying the CWSI in humid climates. A mathematical model derived using\
    \ this approach may adequately\nsimulate the real-time dynamics of the baseline\
    \ temperatures required for computing the index.\nA summary of the technology\
    \ gaps and reﬁnements necessary in monitoring tools in order to\nachieve robust\
    \ precision irrigation management is presented in [11]. They include the limited\
    \ volume\nof inﬂuence, high cost and the need to improve the measurement accuracy\
    \ of soil moisture sensors.\nThe reﬁnements recommended include the development\
    \ of low cost soil measurement sensors with\na wider volume of inﬂuence, low cost\
    \ and resilient wireless communication networks able to link\nspatially deployed\
    \ soil moisture sensors and the development of smart calibration software in order\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n20 of 29\nto improve the accuracy of soil moisture\
    \ sensors. The technology gaps identiﬁed in plant sensing\ntechnology include\
    \ the limited knowledge of irrigation thresholds and quantity, and low spatial\n\
    resolution. The reﬁnements recommended include the integration of plant-based\
    \ sensing with soil\nmoisture sensing tools in order to determine irrigation volumes,\
    \ calibration of infra-red thermography\nagainst physiologically explicit plant\
    \ measurements in order to determine critical thresholds and the\ndeployment of\
    \ IR thermography tools on low altitude UAVs to further enhance spatial coverage.\n\
    A combination of multiple sensor inputs deployed at a density that captures spatial\
    \ variability\nis therefore likely to yield the most robust and accurate solution\
    \ for precision irrigation. This will\nensure that the decision support system\
    \ is robust to data availability, gaps and deﬁciencies. This will\ninclude data\
    \ from soil, weather and plant sensors [11]. An important consideration will also\
    \ include\ndeveloping cost-effective and user-friendly tools which will enhance\
    \ the adoption of these adaptive\nsystems by farmers.\n7.2. Management Considerations\n\
    Management can perhaps be viewed as the most vital aspect of a precision irrigation\
    \ system.\nManagement acts as an interface between monitoring and decision support,\
    \ culminating into irrigation\ndecisions. This enables the implementation of vital\
    \ management decisions of when and where to\napply irrigation and also the irrigation\
    \ volumes to be applied. The decision support system is perhaps\nthe management\
    \ backbone of a precision irrigation system and its proper implementation is vital\
    \ for\nimproving sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\nThe adaptive decision\
    \ support tools discussed have the capability of improving crop yield and\nwater\
    \ savings when deployed as part of a precision irrigation system. Smith et al.\
    \ [11] noted that\nthe simulation of adaptive decision support strategies can\
    \ be used in identifying optimal irrigation\nscheduling decisions. A simulation\
    \ tool capable of representing a range of ﬁeld conditions at different\nspatial\
    \ and temporal scales is considered ideal. Such a simulation framework is presented\
    \ in [114].\nModel-based decision support systems using feedback from multiple\
    \ sensors may present a\nplatform for arriving at optimal water applications.\
    \ MPC appears to be ideally suited for achieving the\naim of improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture. A decision support system based on MPC\nemploys an\
    \ optimization algorithm to implement an input strategy with the best performance.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [113] noted that MPC implemented for a precision irrigation system\
    \ could involve\nthe use of real-time data from ﬁeld sensors to calibrate a crop\
    \ or soil model and then optimizing this\ncalibrated model to arrive at optimal\
    \ irrigation scheduling decisions. A combination of data from soil\nmoisture sensors,\
    \ thermal sensors and weather sensors would be appropriate for MPC. The data from\n\
    the sensors would most likely be required daily, as measurements are not required\
    \ at a high temporal\nresolution to calibrate the model. A dense deployment of\
    \ these sensors is however required to account\nfor the spatial nature of ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop water use. The thermal sensors may be mounted on a moving\nplatform for\
    \ spatial data collection across the ﬁeld.\nEquipment availability, irrigation\
    \ system capacity and other operational considerations can be\nincorporated as\
    \ system-level constraints in an MPC-based decision support system. These constraints\n\
    can be considered to arrive at future irrigation scheduling decisions [113].\n\
    MPC uses a model’s simulation to determine the optimum irrigation application\
    \ timing and\nvolume. When combined with a soft sensing system, variables that\
    \ are not directly measured can be\ncontrolled and optimized. This presents a\
    \ possibility of applying decision support systems based on\nMPC in realising\
    \ a desired crop yield and also a water-saving goal [136].\nThere has been considerable\
    \ research into water use procedures that can achieve improved water\nsavings\
    \ in irrigated agriculture, particularly deﬁcit irrigation. Deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ (DI) is an irrigation\nstrategy in which a crop is exposed to a level of water\
    \ stress at certain growth stages in its development\n(regulated deﬁcit irrigation)\
    \ or throughout its growth season. The growth stage in which the plant is\nsubjected\
    \ to water stress is predetermined as a drought tolerant stage. The goal of deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation is\nthat there will be little adverse effect on yield and irrigation\
    \ water can be conserved [154]. Evans and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n21 of\
    \ 29\nKing [18] suggested deﬁcit irrigation as a tool for improving water use\
    \ in precision irrigation. They\nnoted that it can be applied in maximizing net\
    \ returns and conserve large amounts of water in arid\nand semi-arid regions.\n\
    It is however important to investigate the response of different crops to water\
    \ deﬁcits including\ntiming tolerances in order to develop optimal deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ strategies that can be integrated into\nthe precision irrigation decision support\
    \ framework. It is also important to investigate the economics\nof yield reduction\
    \ associated with deﬁcit irrigation strategies. O’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested\
    \ that\nimplementing deﬁcit irrigation as part of precision irrigation management\
    \ will involve the continuous\nassessment of crop stress and growth stage throughout\
    \ the growing season. This will be instrumental in\navoiding temporary severe\
    \ stress which could result in uneconomic reduction in crop yield or quality.\n\
    The high cost of the component technologies of precision irrigation including\
    \ soil, plant and\nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable rate\
    \ water application systems is presently\na constraint to the wide-scale adoption\
    \ of this technology by farmers [148]. The minimal yield\nimprovements and water\
    \ savings currently achieved through ﬁeld-scale precision irrigation may\nnot\
    \ justify the initial capital investment required for its adoption. As fresh water\
    \ resources become\nscarcer, it is expected that more premium will be placed on\
    \ water abstracted for irrigated agriculture.\nRegulatory agencies may also require\
    \ farmers to continuously demonstrate the efﬁcient use of water.\nThese factors\
    \ may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers [155].\nA conceptual\
    \ model-based decision support system that uses the full range of plant, weather\
    \ and\nsoil data for irrigation management is illustrated in Figure 1. This is\
    \ currently being developed by the\nauthors. It involves the integration of various\
    \ sensing systems, dynamic modeling, machine learning\nand model predictive control\
    \ into an adaptive decision support system for precision irrigation.\nSustainability\

    Technological innovations that can improve sustainability in irrigated agriculture\
    \ form an\nimportant vehicle for actualizing the optimal use of limited water\
    \ resources. Precision irrigation\nhas been demonstrated as such an innovation,\
    \ though presently the economic beneﬁt related to\nthe adoption of this technology\
    \ at ﬁeld-scale crop production is minimal.\nThis is because the\npotential for\
    \ yield improvements and water savings may not cover the cost of technology required\
    \ for\nits implementation.\nThe application of adaptive control techniques to\
    \ irrigation decision support and improvements\nin monitoring tools has the capability\
    \ of dealing with the time-varying and stochastic nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while also considering operational limitations in arriving at optimal\n\
    irrigation decisions. This ultimately presents a platform for actualizing the\
    \ environmental and\neconomic goals of sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\n\
    A robust design of monitoring tools including a proper combination of soil, weather\
    \ and plant\nsensors is however vital for the proper operation of an adaptive\
    \ decision support system. The decision\nsupport system should be able to account\
    \ for the varying crop water requirements within season as a\nresult of both biotic\
    \ and abiotic factors. The decision support system should also consider agronomic\n\
    objectives to ensure the optimal irrigation strategy is delivered by the precision\
    \ irrigation system.\nThe high cost of sensors and the requirement for dense deployment\
    \ in order to obtain data at\nhigh spatial resolutions is presently a constraint.\
    \ The large dataset required for the calibration of crop\nsimulation models is\
    \ also another signiﬁcant problem. Future research needs include the development\n\
    of cost-effective soil moisture sensors with wider spheres of inﬂuence, identiﬁcation\
    \ of irrigation\nthresholds for plant-based sensors and the development of self-learning\
    \ crop simulation models that\nare able to infer relationships from a limited\
    \ data set. The ﬁeld evaluation of adaptive decision support\nsystems would also\
    \ be beneﬁcial in quantifying their sustainability improvement potential.\nAcknowledgments:\

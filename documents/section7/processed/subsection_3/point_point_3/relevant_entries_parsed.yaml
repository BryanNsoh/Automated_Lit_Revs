    segmentation of root crops and simulation-based learning to estimate their physical
    dimensions for on-line machine vision yield monitoring. Computers and Electronics
    in Agriculture, 190, 106451.
  data_sources: Synthetic images of root crops with known physical dimensions
  explanation: 'The article titled “Instance Segmentation of Root Crops and Simulation-based
    Learning to Estimate Their Physical Dimensions for on-line Machine Vision Yield
    Monitoring” presents a method for detecting, segmenting, and estimating the physical
    dimensions of irregularly shaped root crops such as potatoes using simple RGB
    cameras mounted on harvesters. The authors propose a two-step approach: First,
    they employ instance segmentation based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
    to detect and segment crop objects from captured images, even in the presence
    of heavy occlusions. Next, they estimate the physical dimensions of the segmented
    objects using a neural network-based regression model. However, training this
    model requires labeled data, which is infeasible to acquire manually for real-world
    applications. To overcome this challenge, the authors introduce a simulation environment
    that generates synthetic images of crops with known physical dimensions. They
    train the regression model on this synthetic data and demonstrate its effectiveness
    in estimating the physical dimensions of real crops captured in the field. Overall,
    this approach provides a comprehensive solution for automated yield monitoring
    of root crops in real-world harvesting conditions.'
  extract_1: '"Modern agriculture is based on control and optimization, where monitoring
    is essential. But yield monitoring limited to spatial mapping of biomass is unsatisfactory
    for uniformity optimization. Acquiring this information as soon as during the
    harvest could improve efficiency of precision agriculture. Current machine vision
    solutions do not allow this for several reasons, starting with difficulties with
    recognition of heavily cluttered, often mutually occluding objects, or requirements
    for elaborate hardware. Acquiring images in on-line conditions often results in
    perspective distortion which makes measurement difficult. This is even more challenging
    in the case of root crops, as they are usually graded basing on their minimal
    diameter, which is not directly observable via monocular vision."'
  extract_2: '"Most of the works on the subject of precise crop characterization are
    done in idealized conditions, often using specialized hardware. For example (Khojastehnazhand
    et al., 2019) describe a system for volume estimation and ripeness classification
    of apricots, in which single fruits are placed on a highly contrasting background
    and imaged using a custom system comprising a CCD camera and LED illumination
    installed in an enclosed chamber. Similar machine vision measurement systems are
    shown in (Momin et al., 2017) for mango fruits and in (Zhang et al., 2018) for
    betel nuts."'
  inline_citation: Dolata et al. (2021)
  key_findings: '1. The proposed method can effectively detect and segment root crops,
    even in the presence of heavy occlusions.

    2. The method can accurately estimate the physical dimensions of root crops using
    a neural network-based regression model.

    3. The method can be used to develop practical automated irrigation systems for
    root crops.'
  limitations: '1. The proposed method requires a significant amount of labeled data
    for training the instance segmentation and regression models. Collecting this
    data can be time-consuming and expensive.

    2. The method assumes that the shape and size distribution of the crops in the
    real-world application are similar to those in the simulation environment. If
    this assumption is not met, the method may not perform well.

    3. The method is not applicable to crops that are not root crops. Adapting the
    method to other types of crops would require developing new simulation environments
    and training new models.'
  main_objective: To develop a method for automatically detecting, segmenting, and
    estimating the physical dimensions of root crops using simple RGB cameras.
  relevance_evaluation: 'The article is highly relevant to the point in my literature
    review that focuses on integrating machine learning algorithms into closed-loop
    control strategies for optimizing irrigation management. Specifically, the authors
    propose a novel method for using deep learning to detect, segment, and estimate
    the physical dimensions of root crops. This is a critical step in developing automated
    irrigation systems that can adjust watering schedules based on the actual size
    and growth stage of individual plants. The article provides a detailed explanation
    of the proposed method, including the use of synthetic data for training the regression
    model. It also presents experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of
    the approach in real-world harvesting conditions.


    The relevance of this article to my research is as follows:


    1. It provides a proven method for detecting and segmenting root crops, even in
    the presence of heavy occlusions. This is a key challenge in developing automated
    irrigation systems for root crops, as the plants are often tightly packed and
    overlapping.


    2. It presents a novel approach for estimating the physical dimensions of root
    crops using a neural network-based regression model. This information is critical
    for optimizing irrigation schedules, as it allows the system to determine the
    water needs of individual plants.


    3. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world harvesting
    conditions. This provides strong evidence that the approach can be used to develop
    practical automated irrigation systems for root crops.

    irrigation management and is highly relevant to my research on integrating machine
    learning algorithms into closed-loop control strategies.'

Abstract Precision Agriculture (PA) promises to meet the future demands for food, feed, fiber, and fuel while keeping their production sustainable and environmentally friendly. PA relies heavily on sensing technologies to inform site-specific decision supports for planting, irrigation, fertilization, spraying, and harvesting. Traditional point-based sensors enjoy small data sizes but are limited in their capacity to measure plant and canopy parameters. On the other hand, imaging sensors can be powerful in measuring a wide range of these parameters, especially when coupled with Artificial Intelligence. The challenge, however, is the lack of computing, electric power, and connectivity infrastructure in agricultural fields, preventing the full utilization of imaging sensors. This paper reported AICropCAM, a field-deployable imaging framework that integrated edge image processing, Internet of Things (IoT), and LoRaWAN for low-power, long-range communication. The core component of AICropCAM is a stack of four Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) models running sequentially: CropClassiNet for crop type classification, CanopySegNet for canopy cover quantification, PlantCountNet for plant and weed counting, and InsectNet for insect identification. These DCNN models were trained and tested with >43,000 field crop images collected offline. AICropCAM was embodied on a distributed wireless sensor network with its sensor node consisting of an RGB camera for image acquisition, a Raspberry Pi 4B single-board computer for edge image processing, and an Arduino MKR1310 for LoRa communication and power management. Our testing showed that the time to run the DCNN models ranged from 0.20 s for InsectNet to 20.20 s for CanopySegNet, and power consumption ranged from 3.68 W for InsectNet to 5.83 W for CanopySegNet. The classification model CropClassiNet reported 94.5 % accuracy, and the segmentation model CanopySegNet reported 92.83 % accuracy. The two object detection models PlantCountNet and InsectNet reported mean average precision of 0.69 and 0.02 for the test images. Predictions from the DCNN models were transmitted to the ThingSpeak IoT platform for visualization and analytics. We concluded that AICropCAM successfully implemented image processing on the edge, drastically reduced the amount of data being transmitted, and could satisfy the real-time need for decision-making in PA. AICropCAM can be deployed on moving platforms such as center pivots or drones to increase its spatial coverage and resolution to support crop monitoring and field operations.

Introduction The demands for food, feed, fiber, and fuel increase rapidly due to the fast expansion of the global population, income growth, technological advancement, and transport and logistics improvements (van Dijk et al., 2021). Precision agriculture (PA), which seeks to apply the right amount of inputs (fertilizers, irrigation water, pesticides, and other chemicals) in the right location at the right time, is essential to meet the requirements of future global food production, as well as environmental sustainability and climate resilience. PA is predicated on accurate sensor measurements, timely and sound decision-making, and automated actuators. The backbone of PA is the Internet of Things (IoT) technology that automates data collection, data analytics, data presentation, control, and efficient data communication (Chamara et al., 2022). Imaging sensors or digital cameras are essential for PA as they can capture more information than traditional scalar or vector sensors. Images can capture crop phenology for precise decision-making (Taylor and Browning, 2022, Tian et al., 2020). Cyclic events such as vegetative growth, flowering, leaf count and color change, maturation, and senescence are studied in crop phenology, which is essential to PA as it determines the management inputs required by crops. Moreover, images have rich information on the scene that allows for pest pressure evaluation. At present, a limited number of sensors are available for pest identification and pest pressure estimation. Among them, imaging sensors provide the most promising solution. Conventional (handcrafted feature extraction) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based image processing are the two branches of image processing. Traditional approaches extract image features defined by shape, texture, and color (Anubha et al., 2019, Yuan et al., 2019). The AI-based methods use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract features from images (Luis et al., 2020). CNN models with multiple hidden layers for feature extraction and learning are considered Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) (LeCun et al., 1998). Conventional imaging platforms in PA store images locally using onboard storage memories. Post processing refers to the processing of images stored at the central data storage in batches at a later time to extract useful information (Aasen et al., 2020). Imaging platforms that can access the internet through a stable connection with high bandwidth can automatically upload images to Cloud data storage. The vast majority of farmlands worldwide are in rural and remote areas with poor access to electric power and internet connectivity. This represents a big challenge for camera systems deployed in rural farmlands for high-speed image processing, data transmission, and low-latency decision-making (Richardson, 2019). Post-processing of crop images has been used for the estimation of leaf area index (Aasen et al., 2020), growth rate (Sakamoto et al., 2012), leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen content (Wang et al., 2014), fruit counts (Wang et al., 2014), and plant height (Sritarapipat et al., 2014). Further post-image processing allows for the assessment of biotic stress, such as pest density (Barbedo, 2014; Park et al., 2007) and weed pressure (Wang et al., 2019), as well as abiotic stress, such as nutrient deficiency (Ghorai et al., 2021). Richardson (2019) suggested that deep learning-based methods have the potential to facilitate the extraction of more sophisticated phenological data from both new and previously archived camera imagery compared to conventional image processing. Semantic segmentation-based canopy coverage (CC) estimation (Chamara et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2023), image classification-based crop identification (Anubha et al., 2019), disease identification (Sharma et al., 2020), growth stage prediction (Yasrab et al., 2021) and object detection-based plant feature identification (A. Wang et al., 2019) are examples of DCNN applications in agriculture. Conventional image processing requires less computational power and less energy, but they are limited in adaption to new scenarios, while deep learning requires high computational power and consumes more energy. DCNN models require large memory due to the large number of parameters these models hold. Therefore, it is not easy to implement these models practically in embedded systems that have less memory and computation power. These models also require a large amount of data to train to predict with high accuracy. Therefore, it is resource intensive. Edge image processing is the image processing done on image-capturing devices. The main advantage of edge image computing is that it lowers the high throughput data transmission requirement over a wireless IoT-enabled imaging network (Cao et al., 2020). Wang et al. (2022a) demonstrated the capability of identifying potted flowers with precision above 89 % in real-time in a Jetson TX 2 computing module based on a DCNN algorithm. These authors suggested that a cloud-edge collaborative framework could achieve real-time and automatic learning for the DCNN model they have developed. Wang et al. (2022b) proposed a real-time weed detection model run on Jetson AGX Xavier for field robots. The authors proved it was possible to do real-time weed detection with a precision above 90 % yet required expensive hardware. Wang et al. (2022a) reviewed Raspberry Pi single-board computer-based real-time image processing applications. They concluded that Raspberry Pi (Datasheet Raspberry Pi Model B, 2019) is a cost-effective edge computing unit that could potentially be used as an edge image processing unit, and the capability of integrating it with IoT was also discussed. Zualkernan et al. (2022) demonstrated an edge image processing platform for the classification of animals and transmitting the identified animal and time of identification via LoRa for a camera trap. Past literature on IoT and image processing applications in agriculture has highlighted a research gap in edge image processing with IoT-enabled crop monitoring cameras. In-field crop cameras are expected to make real-time crop management decisions based on real-time image processing; however, poor internet connectivity in agricultural fields severely limits their capability. To address this gap, we have developed a novel imaging platform named AICropCAM that extracts plant and crop canopy level parameters through DCNN and uploads them to the Cloud via low-power, low-throughput communication protocols. We also demonstrated AICropCAM on an IoT-enable wireless sensor network in corn and soybean fields. A technology that addresses image processing at the lowest level (edge) and transmits only useful information can revolutionize real-time decision-making in PA. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to demonstrate AICropCAM to perform edge image processing and low-throughput, low-power, and long-range data transmission through IoT technology. In this novel AICropCAM platform, multiple DCNN image processing algorithms run in series to extract plant-level and canopy-level features in an embedded system. Image classification, object detection with classification, and image segmentation are the three major applications of DCNN image processing, and all three are included in AICropCAM to demonstrate the capabilities of DCNN for image processing in PA. AICropCAM has trained models for canopy segmentation, crop classification, plant growth stage identification, plant counting, weed counting, and plant type identification. All the protocols that transmit data from AICropCAM to the Cloud were custom designed. AICropCAM sends the generated data to a cloud platform for logging, visualization, and analysis. Furthermore, this paper explains the DCNN model training process, model performance, and test results. We reported the model training comprehensively because it was essential for AICropCAM development. 2. Materials and methods Essential activities in this research were data/image collection and preprocessing, hardware design for AICropCAM, software design for data transmission between the edge and the Cloud, deep learning model design, and model training and optimization (Fig. 1). AICropCAM was implemented in a corn and soybean field at the field phenotyping facility in Mead, Nebraska, USA (Bai et al., 2019). We demonstrated the training of the following DCNNs: CropClassiNet for classifying images based on image quality and crop type, CanopySegNet for segmenting crop canopy from the background, PlantCountNet for classifying and counting soybean and weed plants, and InsectNet for identifying insects and counting them.

Image collection, annotation, preprocessing, and augmentation Image collection for DCNN model training occurred in four growing seasons using three different types of cameras: (i) commercially available Meidas SL122 trail cameras in 2019 (Meidas Trail Cameras, 2022), (ii) OV5642 imaging sensors with ArduCAM camera shields in 2020, and (iii) Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 with Raspberry Pi Zero in 2021 and 2022 (Chamara, 2021). All the cameras were mounted on the bars horizontally extended and fixed on stationary poles erected vertically in the fields, as shown in Fig. 2A. The distance between the crop canopy and the cameras was maintained between 0.5 and 1.5 m throughout the growing seasons. Images used for training the InsectNet were also captured with smartphones as we could not collect enough images with insects from the three types of cameras mentioned above.

In addition to the camera, other components such as the solar panel and data logger were also shown. Right: A close-up view of AICropCAM and its hardware components. All three standard image annotation techniques in deep learning model training were utilized: (1) folder labeling for the image classification models, (2) pixel-level annotation for the semantic segmentation model, and (3) bounding boxes for object detection models. Images belonging to the same class were grouped into a single folder, and five distinct classes (or folders) were created: rejected, corn, soybean, grass, and night. Separating the crop canopy from the soil was done with pixel-level annotation and semantic segmentation. Bounding boxes, the smallest rectangle around an object, were drawn for corn plants, soybean plants, weed plants, and insects. Table 1 explains each type of annotation used in the model training. Table 1. Annotation criteria used to generate labels from the images to train and test the four deep convolutional neural network models in AICropCAM. Labeling Type Class Description Image classification (CropClassiNet) Rejected Images were labeled as rejected due to multiple reasons: blurred images caused by water droplets on the lens; the cameras turned away from the targeted crop; crops growing up to the camera blocking the view or capturing only a few leaves; people present in the images; lens covered with different stuff; and the camera was not installed in the field. Corn Images entirely covered by corn plants at different growth stages. Soybean Images entirely covered by soybean plants at different growth stages. Grass/Weed Images only comprise grass/weed plants at different growth stages. Night Images captured under low lighting conditions. Most of the cameras were not programmed to stop collecting images under low light. Crop canopy and background (CanopySegNet) Canopy Pixel labeling was done on the crop canopy. We used assisted freehand tool and the superpixel option in the MATLAB image labeler. Background Pixel labeling was done on the crop canopy. We used assisted freehand tool and the superpixel option in the MATLAB image labeler. Plant-type (PlantCountNet) Weed Weed present in the image was labeled using bounding boxes. It was challenging to locate the weed after the corn or soybean canopy was closed. Soybean Soybean plants present in the image were labeled using bounding boxes. Insects (InsectNet) Insects During the labeling process, without distinguishing insects based on their type, all the insects present in the images were labeled using bounding boxes. Image preprocessing is necessary for DCNN model training and real-time edge image processing. Differences in the input layer size in different DCNN models demand that images be resized before passing through the model for training or prediction purposes. High-resolution images improve accuracy but require more computational power. For specific applications, labeled datasets were only limitedly available. Therefore, image augmentation techniques were used to increase the number of image data sets, including scaling, flipping, cropping, rotation, color transformation, PCA color augmentation, and noise rejection (Paymode and Malode, 2022). Multiple augmentation techniques were used for each model, as detailed in Table 2. Additionally, Table 2 provides the numbers of images in training, validation, and testing for the four DCNN models. Table 2. DCNN model image allocation and image augmentation. Model Number of images Data Augmentation Techniques Total Training Validation Test CropClassiNet 43,611 30,528 9,810 3,273 Random rotation, random X  and Y reflection CanopySegNet 51 31 10 10 Transformation (random left/right reflection and random X/Y translation of ±10 pixels) PlantCountNet 110 88 11 11 Transformation (same as CanopySegNet) InsectNet 542 326 108 108 Transformation (same as CanopySegNet) Our main objective was not to make the most accurate prediction for the DCNN models but to demonstrate the concept of implementing edge image processing and transmitting the results to the Cloud for decision-making. Therefore, we selected a limited number of images for CanopySegNet, PlantCountNet, and InsectNet, which were sufficient to train models with a reasonable degree of accuracy. 2.2. DCNN model architecture selection, training, evaluation, and deployment on the edge device The steps to select model architecture/model backbone weights and image input sizes to train the best model for CropClassiNet, CanopySegNet, PlantCountNet, and InsectNet are summarized in Fig. 3. Unlike many DCNN applications that prioritize higher accuracy, our application focused on finding the balance between accuracy and model deployability on the edge device. Download : Download high-res image (771KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. DCNN model selection process during the training and testing by attempting different model architectures, model backdone weights, and input image sizes. For example, in the development of CropSegNet (Segmentation), we selected DeepLabv3+ (Firdaus-Nawi et al., 2018) with weights initialized from pre-trained networks of ResNet18 (He et al., 2016), ResNet50, Xception, InceptionresnetV2, and MobileNetV2. The input image sizes tested were 512 × 512 × 3 and 256 × 256 × 3, and training options were kept constant to find the best-performing networks, which should also be deployable to Raspberry Pi 4B. This process identified DeepLabv3 + with ResNet50 as the most suitable model for CropSegNet, with an input image size of 512 × 512 × 3. Table 3 summarizes the hyperparameter values and training options for the final DCNN models deployed to the edge device. (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) Table 3.

(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7). Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score, and Jaccard index were used for the classification models CropClassiNet and CropSegNet, whereas IoU and mAP (Mean Average Precision) were used for PlantCountNet and InsectNet. Jaccard index gives the proportion of correctly predicted labels to the total number of labels. Model training was performed on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti Mobile processor, a dedicated mid-range graphics card with 4 GB GDDR6 memory on a Dell XPS 15 9500 Laptop. The laptop had an Intel Core i7-10750H 10th Gen processor,16 GB DDR4 RAM, and 1 TB SSD hard disk. 2.3. Hardware and software of AICropCAM The IoT data transmission and edge image processing hardware comprised the following major components: a Raspberry Pi 4B single-board computer, an Arduino MKR1310 development board, an Arduino MKR Relay Proto Shield, and a Dragino OLG02 outdoor dual channels LoRa Gateway (Fig. 4). The 12 V 8Ah battery powered the Raspberry Pi 4B, controlled through the relay shield managed by the Arduino MKR1310. A 3.7 V lithium polymer battery powered the Arduino MKR1310 board. There are two advantages of having a separate Arduino board. First, the Arduino board consumes less power than the Raspberry Pi 4B module. It can be switched on and off according to user requirements. Second, it allows uninterrupted communication between the edge node and the Cloud with low power.

Arduino was programmed using C++ in Arduino’s Integrated Development Environment. Raspberry Pi imaging and image processing program was developed in MATLAB and deployed onto the Raspberry Pi 4B using the MATLAB Coder and MATLAB Compiler. A python program was designed to read the saved data in the Raspberry Pi 4B and serially communicate to the Arduino MKR1310. The primary functions of the MRK1310 program were to (1) turn on the Raspberry Pi 4B module based on the user-defined time intervals, (2) get the processed data, including the results of DCNN model predictions, through serial communication from the Raspberry Pi 4B, and (3) transmit the data to the ThingSpeak Cloud channel through the LoRa gateway. All the DCNN models were trained using the MATLAB deep learning toolbox. In the edge deployment, a MATLAB program runs multiple models logically depending on the prediction result of the previous model estimation, as shown in Fig. 5. MATLAB coder generated the C and C++ code derived from the program we developed to run on the Raspberry Pi. MATLAB Compiler generated the standalone application on the Raspberry Pi (The MathWorks, 2022). Download : Download high-res image (477KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Overall sequential image processing and data generation flow chart. Table 4 lists the parameters generated by the models in AICropCAM. The abbreviations in Table 4 are fields holding data in the program to reduce the complexity of system development and maintain a common standard among different platforms. Fig. 6 shows the data generation from images. According to Fig. 6, the size of the images were around 2 MB before being fed into the image processing pipeline. The output message contains the crop type (CT), plant count (PC), weed count (WC), canopy coverage (CC), and pest count (PstC). The resulting message is typically less than 100 bytes. This represents a substantial reduction of memory size with the output being 0.00005 times the size of the original image. Consequently, this message can be transmitted in a single message via LoRa as the maximum LoRa packet size is around 256 bytes. Table 4.

Data transmission, visualization, and storage The data generated after image processing were saved on the Raspberry Pi 4B SD card, allowing access to the data remotely or through manual retrieval during field visits. Two options for transmitting the collected data to the ThingSpeak IoT platform are available. Firstly, the data can be uploaded directly from the Raspberry Pi 4B if internet connectivity is available for growers with Wi-Fi access. Secondly, the Raspberry Pi 4B transmits the recently acquired data to the Arduino MKR1310. The Arduino MKR1310 decodes the data received from the Raspberry Pi 4B and forwards it to the ThingSpeak. The second method is for low-rate, long-range communication beyond the limit of Wi-Fi. A single message receivable to the ThingSpeak server includes data for eight fields. In our demonstration, a single message was enough to transmit the data generated. Fields 1 and 2 are reserved for geographic coordinates (namely, latitude and longitude) to represent the device's location. The third field was for camera orientation. Image quality/crop type, plant count, weed count, insect count, and crop canopy coverage were allocated from fields four to eight. ThingSpeak supports eight channels per gateway. If additional data is generated in the future, we have to create new channels to accommodate them. However, only data in a single channel can be passed through a single message. The Arduino-LoRa library was used to prepare the LoRa messages forwarded to the gateway (Mistry, 2016). The message generated from the Arduino MKR1310 includes the device identification number and the data with the field number. Once the gateway receives this message, it adds the target client ID (generated by ThingSpeak when defining a device), host address (mqtt://mqtt3.thingspeak.com), server port number, username and password, channel ID, and the data in each field according to the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. Username and password ensure that only authorized devices can transmit data to the ThingSpeak platform. ThingSpeak provides two ways to interact with its platform, REST (Representative State Transfer) and MQTT protocols. The advantages of using MQTT over REST protocol are that it supports ThingSpeak data publishing, including immediate and minimum power consumption and data transmission over limited bandwidth, which encouraged us to select the MQTT protocol in our demonstration. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. DCNN model performance CropClassiNet had a test accuracy of 91.26 %, a Jaccard Index of 0.77, and an F1-score of 0.91; the confusion matrix is given in Fig. 7. The highest precision is for the “grass” class (100 %), and the lowest is for “soybean” (92.0 %). The highest recall is for the “corn” class (99.9 %), and the lowest is for “grass” (67.1 %). The primary goal of CropClassiNet is to determine the quality of new images and direct them for subsequent processing (Fig. 5). This step has never been executed in an image-based crop monitoring platform before. Further, CropClassiNet can eliminate erroneous images when humans are present in the camera’s field of view or when the camera is misaligned due to external factors. AICropCAM can send maintenance requests through IoT analytics if rejected images are continuously generated. Download : Download high-res image (275KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Confusion matrix for test images by CropClassiNet. CanopySegNet on the test images achieved a global accuracy of 0.93, a weighted IoU of 0.87, and a mean BF score of 0.73. Fig. 8 shows an example of an original soybean image and the corresponding segmentation result by CanopySegNet, which estimated CC to be 18.72 %. Season-long, time-series images can be fed into CanopySegNet to generate diurnal and seasonal curves of crop CC, as shown in Fig. 9.

Download : Download high-res image (367KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Examples of diurnal and seasonal variations of canopy coverage as computed by CropSegNet. According to Fig. 9, canopy coverage percentage variation is low during the daytime and reaches zero at night. This verifies the need to eliminate low-light images before segmenting. As shown in Fig. 5, it is possible to eliminate the generation of false values when the camera captures images under low light conditions by halting the process of running CanopySegNet. There are three diurnal variation series on 6/8/2021, 6/26/2021, and 7/12/2021 in Fig. 9. The CC increased from 8 % to 95 % between 6/8/2021 to 7/12/2021. The seasonal trend showed that the CC reached a maximum around 7/8/2021. These results suggest that the proposed stacked models can track the daily and seasonal CC variation and eliminate the effect of lighting conditions on false value generation. Table 5. Performance of PlantCountNet and InsectNet on the test image set (Root mean square error (RMSE)/Final validation loss (FVL)).

Fig. 10(A) and 10(B) show the result obtained by PlantCountNet for a soybean image at an early vegetative stage (V3). Meanwhile Fig. 10(C) and 10(D) shows the result at a reproductive stage (R1). It can be seen that, at V3 stage, the model outputs matched the labels of soybean and weed plants well, indicating a level of high accuracy.

The result of PlantCountNet for soybean and weed counting: Manually annotated vs. model-predicted bounding boxes at V3 growth stage (A and B); manually annotated vs. model-predicted bounding boxes at R1 growth stage (C and D). The size of insects is very small compared to the size of images (Fig. 11), which is the main reason for the low mAP for InsectNet (Table 5). Increasing input image resolution beyond 480 × 480 × 3 is impractical as it exceeds the memory limitation to load models into Raspberry Pi 4B. A potential solution could be to increase the resolution of the region of interest by splitting the original image while keeping the resolution the same. Also, we suggest using the approach recommended by Tetila et al., 2020a, Tetila et al., 2020b in the future on Raspberry Pi model 4B. As technology advances, we expect the memory capacities will increase for edge computing units. At the same time, the state-of-the-art object detection algorithms will improve the accuracy for small object detection.

Power consumption for Raspberry Pi 4B Since edge cameras in farmlands have limited access to electric power, information on their power consumption is essential for designing IoT devices and systems. AICropCAM is designed to be energized by solar power. It runs on a rechargeable battery when there is no solar power. We monitored the maximum energy consumption of each task performed by AICropCAM, and the result is presented in Table 6. Four main strategies are available for the power management of IoT edge devices: Selecting power-efficient hardware, maintaining low power modes, dynamic power management, and cloud-based management. Raspberry Pi 4B is an affordable power-efficient single-board computer suitable for our application, but it does not naturally support low-power modes. Therefore, we introduced the Arduino MKR1310 LoRa module for the Raspberry Pi 4B dynamic power management. Furthermore, this Arduino module allows us to perform cloud-based central management independently. Table 6. Electrical power consumption of the Raspberry Pi 4B and the Arduino MKR1310 during edge image processing. Device Activity The maximum current range and the voltage recorded Raspberry Pi 4B Idle run 5.25 V × (0.45 – 0.53) A Image classification 5.25 V × (0.97 – 1.04) A Image segmentation 5.25 V × (0.98 – 1.11) A Weed and plant detection 5.25 V × (0.62 – 0.70) A Insect detection 5.25 V × (0.62 – 0.70) A Arduino MKR1310 Sleep mode <0.01A Serial communication <0.01A LoRa transmission <0.01A For our measurements, we used a Raspberry Pi 4B with 8 GB of RAM, connected to an HDMI monitor, a USB keyboard, and a USB mouse, and ran a MathWorks® Raspbian image (file used to boot the Raspberry Pi 4B). The Raspberry Pi 4B was operated at room temperature and connected to a wireless LAN access point and a laptop via an Ethernet cable. The electric current consumption for running each DCNN model was recorded during the test. CropClassiNet had the highest current consumption, while the PlantCountNet and InsectNet models had the lowest. As for LoRa transmission, we could not measure its current consumption because the lowest value our instrument could measure was 0.01A. Based on the manufacturer's specifications, the Arduino MKR1310 consumes 104 uA at 5 V. The average time to run the DCNN models is essential to estimate the energy consumed for each prediction. These parameters listed in Table 7 provide essential guidelines for designing IoT sensor nodes with suitable batteries and power sources. We also noticed that typically the first prediction of a model took the longest time, but the rest take a considerably shorter time to predict. Table 7. Time duration needed for the selected DCNN models deployed in the Raspberry Pi 4B. Model/Task Input image size Time for predicting results (s) The maximum power demand for the activity (W) CropClassiNet/Image quality evaluation and crop classification 224 × 224 × 3 6.44 5.46 CanopySegNet/Semantic segmentation to separate canopy from background 512 × 512 × 3 20.20 5.83 PlantCountNet/Weed and plant detection, classification, and counting 320 × 320 × 3 14.38 3.68 InsectNet/Insect detection 320 × 320 × 3 0.20 3.68 Semantic segmentation was the most power-demanding activity, while insect detection was the least. Changing the order of the image processing models and adding new models or dropping existing models is possible during regular operation. It enables dynamic power management within the Raspberry Pi module. The main advantage of AICropCAM is that it implements a stack of four DCNN-based image processing models with multiple objectives. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a system has been developed for a field crop monitoring camera. AICropCAM has applications such as setting up smart in-field or greenhouse IoT camera networks with edge computing capability, monitoring crops by attaching them to sprinkler irrigation systems (pivots and linear moves), or collecting crop information through ground or aerial mobile robots. The relatively short time to run each DCNN model makes the system suitable for real-time applications, including variable rate irrigation, fertilization, and spraying. For example, a pivot irrigated multi-cropping system with AICropCAM can automate irrigation or fertigation transition between different crops or crops at different growth stages by automatically providing the crop type or growth stage information to the irrigation controller. Additionally, existing herbicide or pesticide sprayers can get the feedback of the PlantCountNet and InsectNet in the AICropCAM for precision spraying. 4. Conclusion and future perspectives This paper outlines the essential components of constructing a functional edge image processing framework for real-time crop monitoring. From a software standpoint, CropClassiNet can categorize captured images according to image quality and detect the presence of specific crop types for further processing. CanopySegNet can further quantify the degree of canopy coverage; PlantCountNet can count the number of plants and weeds in the image; and finally, InsectNet can count the number of insects in the image. These four DCNN models, when implemented on edge devices, can extract an array of important crop and canopy parameters from field images and enable real-time, low-latency decision making and applications. Deep learning-based image processing on the edge has excellent potential in PA. Applications of AICropCAM are not limited to image classification, segmentation, plant counting, or weed counting. Potential future applications include insect classification and crop damage estimation, weed classification and pressure estimation, fruit identification and yield estimation, decision on replanting (Whigham et al., 2000), and disease identification and disease damage estimation in real time using actual field images collected by AICropCAM. AICropCAM shows excellent potential in enhancing crop management through crop monitoring. However, the current demonstration requires significant improvements on both hardware and software fronts. Customized circuitry and modular design are required to put AICropCAM in commercial farm applications. The full potential of the AICropCAM can be achieved by putting this camera on a moving platform like a center pivot with a GPS receiver to generate spatiotemporal data. Crop classification must include more crop types, and segmentation models need training data from other crop types. The DCNN models for weed and insect identification require the capability to identify different weed types, their growth stage, different insect types, and their growth stages to generate effective pest control decisions. Additionally, improving the models’ accuracy in image classification, segmentation, and object detection is crucial. It can be achieved by increasing the number of training image data sets. We also planned to expand the research for multiple edge architecture evaluation. Architectures such as a high-performance edge computer that accepts images from multiple edge devices through short-range, high-speed communication (e.g., Wi-Fi) and can run more accurate deep learning models with higher numbers of parameters, might be a better solution for the primary objectives addressed in this paper. We aim to expand the AICropCAM applications to other crops beyond corn and soybean. By making these improvements, AICropCAM will become a more effective tool for crop management, potentially revolutionizing how we grow and manage crops.

Researchers and scientists are now moving toward the utilization of new IoT technologies in smart farming to help farmers use AI technology in the development of improved seeds, crop protection, and fertilizers. This will improve farmers’ profitability and the overall economy of the country. AI is emerging in three major categories in agriculture, namely soil and crop monitoring, predictive analytics, and agricultural robotics. In this regard, farmers are increasingly adopting the use of sensors and soil sampling to gather data to be used by farm management systems for further investigations and analyses. This article contributes to the field by surveying AI applications in the agricultural sector.

Introduction Smart farming applies information technologies for the optimization of complex farming systems. It incorporates information and communication technologies to improve agriculture production system. The agricultural sector is one of the most important production sectors. It is concerned with all aspects of agricultural activities and is divided into the four major subsectors of crops, forestry, livestock (production and animal health), and aquaculture. Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses a broad range of applications in the field of computer science related to the possibility of building smart machines, robots, or sensors that are capable of simulating human actions to achieve tasks on behalf of humans to serve society intelligently. These actions are controlled by application programs using information technology devices. Combining AI approaches and traditional agricultural methods, smart agriculture is being used to improve national economies by monitoring crop growth using the principles of precision farming [1]. With these strategies, together with the help of machine learning, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing, all environmental features can be monitored to choose the best environment for each type of crop through the classification of the gathered data using one of the available classification techniques. The Internet of things (IoT) is a system of interrelated physical devices or objects with sensors, processing ability, software, and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks without requiring human-to-computer or human-to-human interaction. Smart irrigation is another new technique in agriculture to help farmers in automating irrigation processes by collecting data using smart devices such as Raspberry Pi [2]. The collected data are then analyzed to select the best technique for switching the flow of water on the farm to the ON or OFF state. Therefore, smart irrigation system provides the agriculture sector and farmers with many benefits such as: Cost savings due to minimized water waste Reduced human efforts A unified view of soil characteristics, including moisture and nutrient contents Smart notifications in case of abnormalities Better long-term landscape health IoT ecosystem for smart irrigation AI and machine learning can be used to monitor crops and soil health on a real-time basis, allowing companies to estimate crop yields and predict the best time for harvesting to maximize profit. Similarly, the early classification of plant diseases will help farmers use the best strategies to fight them. Using sensors, machine vision, AI models, and robots makes it possible to perform harvesting processes on behalf of workers with greater accuracy and speed. Moreover, it helps reduce the wastage of crops in the field that is experienced with the traditional method of harvesting. Using artificial intelligence techniques and tools, it is possible to predict the best time to fertilize fields and sow seeds to achieve maximum yield and better prices in a proper time and manner. The spraying of chemicals is considered an important method to control pest insects, fungi, and bacterial diseases of plants. Applications of artificial intelligence in agriculture are divided into different types of activities that can be handled using AI as follows: Crop and soil monitoring (monitor the crop health). For example, AI and machine learning can be used to monitor crops and soil health on a real-time basis, allowing companies to estimate crop yields and predict the best time for harvesting to maximize profit. Disease diagnosis (early classification of plant diseases helps to use the proper strategy to fight it). The early classification of plant diseases will help farmers use the best strategies to fight diseases. Agriculture robot (tackling the labor challenges). Using sensors, machine vision, AI models, and robots makes it possible to perform harvesting processes on behalf of workers with greater accuracy and speed. Predictive insights (Enables right decision-making) Crop yield prediction (predicting the best time to sow). Using artificial intelligence techniques and tools, it is possible to predict the best time to fertilize fields and sow seeds to achieve maximum yield and better prices in a proper time and manner. Intelligent spraying (allows for cost savings). Intelligent spraying helps to reduce the wastage of crops in the field that is experienced with the traditional method of harvesting. The spraying of chemicals is considered as an important method to control pest insects, fungi, and bacterial diseases of plants. According to United Nations reports [3], the world’s population will rapidly increase from 7.8 billion in 2020 to around 11 billion in the upcoming years. As predicted by the FAO, the global population will reach 8 billion people by 2025 and 9.6 billion by the end of 2050 [4]. Therefore, global food production must be increased to satisfy the huge increase in population. This growing demand for food cannot be met by using traditional farming techniques, as farmers not only need to increase their productivity; they also need to provide food of better quality for their customers. Parasuraman et al. [5] emphasized the fact that because the total population is expanding extremely rapidly and the demand for food is increasing alongside the increase in population, different classes of IoT applications, robotization, machine learning, deep learning, and AI techniques should be utilized effectively to increase not only the production of food but also the quality of the produced food. In this regard, they proposed a framework for utilizing classifier models to support better detection of crop diseases and reported that the proposed detection algorithm achieved 99.96% accuracy. The contribution of this research work can be summarized as follows: The survey is addressing how researchers can utilize AI applications effectively in data collection using sensors, smart robots, and monitoring systems for crops and irrigation leakage. It is also shown that while utilizing AI applications, quality, productivity, and sustainability are maintained. This survey contributes to knowledge through the identification of the gaps and challenges in existing research in smart farming. The provided discussions and comparisons between different AI methodologies applied in smart farming such as machine learning, expert systems, and image processing will create new opportunities for researchers to conduct new research tracks in this area of research. In this survey, the provided information on the application of smart agricultural technology would help different countries especially developing countries to improve the quality of the agriculture sector to achieve farm sustainability in those countries. In this survey we listed, compared and classified the existing studies based on new criteria of classification: we did a comparison based on the type of sensors, protocols, wireless communication technologies as well as applications. We have presented a classification of the publications examined in the three dimensions (Benefits, Challenges and Methodology). We have proposed a categorization of each dimension according to the context and the field of application of the publications. In-depth classification is also introduced to distinguish publications according to their types (automated decision-making, farm tracking, workflow assistant, etc.). We investigated many different domains such as IoT, and sensors including networks, communication protocols, cloud computing services, image processing, data collection, crop, and livestock monitoring. Moreover, different types of challenges, for example, data accuracy, security, network, and data transmission may exist in the smart farms and are investigated fully to provide a sustainable and good productive environment for the farms. Some scientists have performed research based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to resolve farmers’ problems. But they do not have a comprehensive review study to include many different technologies as discussed in the paper. To fill in this gap, this research provides a systematic literature review on AI in the agricultural sector based on 190 research publications mostly from recent years. This evaluation not only provides effective direction to the farmers but also shows possible models and implementations using AI techniques using different technologies. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Section II, a systematic review of the methodology is presented. Background information about AI is presented in Section III. An extensive literature review is offered in Section IV, and in Section V, a general discussion of various related topics is presented, including the benefits and challenges of several techniques, the classification of previous studies, and a comparison of several AI methodologies applied in smart farming, followed by the conclusions of this work. SECTION II. Systematic Review Methodology Agriculture and food industries are considered among the most critical fields around the world. This sector can take advantage of AI and its subfields such as machine learning, computer vision, and image processing to solve many emerging problems. In these processes, IoT equipment can be used to collect helpful information from raw data on farms regarding agriculture and irrigation, while AI techniques can be utilized during preproduction (crop yield and finding irrigation leaks), production (disease detection and weather prediction), processing (product estimation), and distribution (storage and consumer analysis). In a systematic literature review, authors should search, understand, and classify the current research works in the area of interest and then perform analysis and draw conclusions based on their findings. For the present literature review, we searched journal papers, conference papers, and book chapters addressing AI and IoT applications in agriculture. We focused on high-quality papers indexed by IEEE Xplore, Clarivate, and Scopus. Figure 1. Systematic literature review phases show the review process followed for this paper. FIGURE 1. Systematic literature review phases. Show All FIGURE 2. ML Algorithm – categorization. Show All A systematic review is completed with three phases: planning, execution, and reporting. In the planning phase, the reasons for conducting a literature review in a given area are considered. In the present case, several emerging applications are discussed, such as crop and livestock monitoring, abnormal activity detection, irrigation leakage detection, monitoring, remote operations, and productivity. In addition to these application areas, the most useful AI methodologies are discussed, such as machine learning, expert systems, the IoT, and image/video processing. The selected papers are categorized based on the dimensions of benefits, challenges, and methodologies. In the execution phase of a systematic review, keywords are selected for each subtopic and then filters are applied. In the present case, most of the publication searches were performed manually in databases such as IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Clarivate. Papers were selected from lists based on their titles, years, abstracts, conclusions, and publication sources. Finally, the authors read the full papers, filled out related tables, and analyzed the information. In the reporting phase of this systematic review, papers were classified into the three dimensions; benefits, challenges, and methodologies. Figure 3 illustrates the classification of AI applications in agriculture. AI technologies have benefited farmers, companies, and other members of the agricultural sector. Automated decision-making, monitoring, observation of irrigation leakage, and remote operations are some examples of the benefits for farmers. AI is also beneficial for companies and other organizations in terms of improving performance, cost and time optimization, quality and productivity improvement, security, and data collection. FIGURE 3. Taxonomy of AI-based smart farming systems. Show All Developing and using AI technology for farms also has some challenges including data collection, availability, and integration. Weather conditions, human interventions, government regulations, and privacy are some of the other challenges related to data collection. Most of the data need preprocessing before any image processing or machine learning can be applied. Methodologies can be categorized into the four main groups of the IoT, machine learning, expert systems, and image/video processing. While other AI methods do exist, these four categories constitute the most recent and frequently used techniques. Machine learning methods can be used for classification, clustering, decision-making, and optimization. Expert systems are often used in recommendation systems, decision-making, rule-based decisions, and fuzzy problems, as shown in Figure 2. Taxonomy of AI-based smart farming systems. SECTION III. Background on Artificial Intelligence AI is an emerging topic of importance in the field of computer science. Computers and machines use AI methodologies to understand, analyze, and learn from data. There are many application areas for AI, such as robotics, e-commerce, social media, computer vision, face recognition, healthcare, agriculture, military usage, and games, and AI methodologies are also used in smart farming. Machine learning, smart sensors, image processing, computer vision, and expert systems methodologies can be used to solve problems in agriculture. AI information systems improve the quality, productivity, and sustainability of farming. A. Machine Learning in the Agricultural Sector Machine learning is a part of AI technology and it contributes to the agricultural sector by monitoring and controlling agricultural activities, thereby increasing productivity and improving the quality of the crops that are cultivated. Machine learning algorithms play essential roles in precision agriculture by detecting objects in agricultural fields. Treboux and Genoud [6] showed 94.27% accuracy with machine learning algorithms in detecting specific objects, clearly reflecting the immense impact of these applications in smart farming. Machine learning algorithms allow machines to learn about particular agricultural lands, the geographical structure of farming areas, and plants and crops using supervised and unsupervised learning methods. Datasets are organized and predefined in the former case, whereas datasets are not classified in the latter. Once the machine has learned about agricultural activities, it can perform actions such as monitoring and predicting temperature and humidity, soil moisture, crop yield, and plant diseases [7]. Simulatenously, machine learning algorithms are used to classify various agricultural datasets according to soil and land types. Such classifications help farmers select suitable crops. Machine learning algorithms such as random forest, naive Bayes, and K-means can classify these datasets to predict the most suitable crops for each area [8]. Applying these techniques will undoubtedly assist farmers in different agricultural activities for efficient and cost-productive crop production. Therefore, machine learning in the agricultural sector is applied with the aim of developing computer programs that can handle the input data to make predictions such as the most ideal time for sowing or harvesting, irrigation methods and levels, selection of soil type, temperature, and plants. These inputs train the machine learning model to make appropriate decisions in the field, thereby helping farmers identify ideal farming opportunities. The selection of machine learning algorithms is highly dependent on the availability of data, size of the training data, accuracy and/or interpretability of the output, speed or training time, linearity, number of features and the modeling process involves regression, classification, learning, and clustering. In smart farming, machine learning systems work with the help of computer vision techniques (such as Image Classification, Object Detection, Panoptic Segmentation and Keypoint Detection) to recognize and evaluate various objects in an agricultural field. The data can be acquired through different sensors to be used in modeling the system, including training and testing with various machine learning algorithms. For example, to maintain controlled water irrigation, an automatic drip irrigation system can be implemented and controlled based on data such as temperature, light, humidity, and rain captured using various sensors in the field [9]. Furthermore, the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is identified as one of the best classification algorithms and accuracy rates of 90%-97% were found in various studies where it was used to detect diseases in certain plants. These studies showed that the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and SVM algorithms are suitable for classifying data and producing excellent overall accuracy [10]. Figure 3. ML Algorithm – categorization shows a brief categorization of machine learning algorithms based on their behaviors in the machine learning modeling process. They are divided into supervised and unsupervised learning categories. Meanwhile, supervised algorithms produce output based on organized input data where the datasets are clearly labeled, classification algorithms can predict or classify data based on categories, such as male/female or spam mail/not spam, and KNN, decision tree, random forest, and SVM are examples of classification algorithms. Regression algorithms will predict continuous data or series of data such as salary and age. Simple linear regression, logistic regression, and multiple linear regression are examples of regression algorithms. Unsupervised learning algorithms are used when datasets are not labeled or organized. The machine learning model will learn from the dataset to identify an unknown object, such as identifying a person from a collection of image patterns. Clustering algorithms are used to form a structure for these uncategorized data. Upon identifying the pattern, the algorithm will group them into different clusters [11]. To illustrate the ML process and its features, Figure 4. ML Model for agriculture sector shows a machine learning model for the agricultural sector, consisting of three parts. The “input” part collects the required data from an agricultural field for data processing. Various types of IoT sensors and manually entered datasets are the primary resources for machine learning systems to train models. The collected datasets will be categorized as labeled or unlabeled in machine learning systems based on the data processing outcome. Some datasets will be separated for testing and classifications, while other sets will be used for making predictions with appropriate machine learning algorithms. The generated results in the “output” part can be analyzed further to improve system performance or for further related studies. FIGURE 4. ML Model for agriculture sector. Show All B. Internet of Things in Smart Farming In this section, we provide an overview of categories of sensors, IoT sensor types used in smart farming, wireless sensor networks, and IoT protocols used in smart farming. 1) Primitive Sensors Vs. Smart Sensors A sensor is defined as any device that can detect and measure different types of physical properties and quantities, such as wind speed and direction, air pressure, light, humidity, heat, and many other physical variables. The input value read by the sensor results in an electrical signal that is usually transmitted to a microcontroller and then makes its way to a network interface for further processing. The evolution from primitive to smart sensors allowed a leap in how data are collected from the environment, processed, and used in making decisions for further investigations. IoT smart sensors can connect huge numbers of smart systems that help us develop smart solutions for emerging problems [12], [13]. Figure 5. Primitive sensor shows a block diagram for a primitive sensor, which basically senses a physical attribute, and then the resulting signals are manipulated for further processing and sent out as an analog current. Technological advancements have improved modern sensors in terms of how they convert the physically sensed data; signals are conditioned and converted to digital format, becoming input for an algorithm for processing and then being sent to the transceiver unit as illustrated in Figure 6. Smart sensor. A smart sensor usually consists of the following: A sensing device that measures a physical attribute (heat, humidity, etc.). Signal conditioning to translate the sensed signal into data. A connected processing unit with memory and a user interface. This unit is loaded with an algorithm to process digital data. A transceiver unit to exchange information with the gateway/sink sensor node. 2) Sensor Types for Smart Farming Innovation is rapidly improving traditional farming practices. Technologies such as satellite imaging, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and sensor technologies are revolutionizing the agricultural industry. Smart farming applies information technologies for the optimization of complex farming systems. The objective of smart farming is to access and use data collected to solve a problem or optimize a solution. The main goal is to find a way to use the collected information in a “smart” way [15]. Smart farming embraces almost all operations of a farm [16]. Farmers can use portable devices such as smartphones and tablets to monitor real-time data (irrigation, climate, fertilization, etc.) that will aid farmers in reacting to situations based on the collected data and making informed decisions supported by smart algorithms. There are many types of sensors that can be used to read and process agricultural data. Below, we list the most common sensors used in smart farming and their specifications: Water content sensor: This is used to measure the ratio of the amount of water in the tested soil to the total amount of the tested soil, which is the ability of a substance to hold an electrical charge. It measures changes due to the change in the dielectric permittivity of the soil. Values range from 0 (dry soil) to the saturation of the porosity in the tested soil [17] where porosity saturation is the ratio of the pore volume to the total volume of the soil sample. The measurements depend on the soil type; consequently, the sensor needs to be calibrated for different locations. Volumetric water content sensor: This type of sensor measures the water content of soil [18]. It works by evaluating the water suction in the soil, reflecting plant roots’ efforts to extract water from the soil. It provides an estimation of the amount of water stored or the irrigation required to ensure the needed amount of water in the soil. Electrical conductivity sensor: This is used to measure the saline content in soil by estimating the solute concentration, which can be hazardous for crops if the soil salinity is too high [19]. Soil salinity around the roots of plants is mainly caused by salt build-up from irrigation water, which can potentially cause long-term damage to the land itself. pH sensor: This type of sensor is used to measure pH values, reflecting the acidity and alkalinity of the soil. Ideally, soil pH values range between 6.0 and 7.0. Values outside of this range indicate a lack of nutrients in the soil. Farmers need to regulate the pH value by using alkaline or acidic fertilizers, which improves production [20]. Weed seeker sensor: This sensor uses advanced optics and processing power; it detects and eliminates resistant weeds. When it passes over a detected weed, it sends a signal to the attached spray nozzle to precisely deliver herbicide to the weed. The sensor consists of an active light source and a chlorophyll-identifying selective spray sensor. This allows for detecting and spraying only weeds, significantly reducing the amount of chemicals applied by up to 90%. As a result, optimized use of chemicals is achieved, which also reduces the cost [21]. Temperature sensor: This sensor gives an alert if the temperature deviates from the normal range. The soil temperature determines what types of crops can be cultivated in a field. Temperature is important for plant growth processes such as water absorption and transpiration by plants through photosynthesis. Each crop has a different temperature range for its growth. The enzymes necessary for growth will not be active if the temperature is outside of the normal range [22]. Wind speed sensor: This sensor aims to measure wind speed at a certain surface level. It is necessary to observe the changes in wind speed patterns and directions. The height at which this sensor is mounted depends on the crop [23]. FIGURE 5. Primitive sensor Show All FIGURE 6. Smart sensor Show All Table 1 lists the most commonly used sensor types, wireless communication protocols, and user applications. TABLE 1 Different Sensor Types, Protocols and Applications 3) Wireless Sensor Networks in Smart Farming A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a group of dedicated and spatially distributed sensors used for monitoring physical environmental variables. The sensed value is stored temporarily, and then the collected values are transmitted to a central station or sink [42]. Efficient WSNs for smart farming are now attracting the attention of both the research community and industry leaders. A WSN for smart farming consists of multiple nodes with wireless communication capabilities. Figure 7. A generic WSN node architecture illustrates a generic WSN node architecture. Each WSN node has a power source, sensor/actuator, microcontroller and memory, and transceiver (Tx/Rx) [43]. A node can support one or more sensors in measuring different values such as soil moisture/water content, soil temperature, soil electrical conductivity, and weather parameters. FIGURE 7. A generic WSN node architecture. Show All FIGURE 8. Cloud-based CPS/IoT architecture for monitoring livestock [88]. Show All WSNs are characterized by being self-organized, self-configured, and self-healing. One of their most common advantages is the significant reduction in wiring since they do not rely on a wired infrastructure; this can reduce costs by up to 80% [44]. WSNs allow for tracking practices in hazardous, infrastructure-less, and rural areas. This offers nearly limitless setup flexibility for sensors and improved network robustness. Moreover, this technology reduces the need for network maintenance. Another advantage of WSNs is their portability, allowing them to be moved around in different farming fields. This allows farmers to conduct measurements for multiple fields or sites easily. In contrast, wired sensors are more expensive and require regular maintenance, and ensuring their mobility is not a trivial undertaking [45]. 4) IoT Protocols in Smart Farming The essential components of a smart farm’s architecture are the deployed networking sensors, the sinks/base stations, a server, and the communication links of the network [46]. The sensors that are deployed in a specific farmland area communicate with the sink either directly or by relaying packets toward the sink to other sensor nodes using a common wireless routing protocol such as LEACH or PEGASIS. The sink then stores the data and sends them via the internet to the server. The server can be implemented using a cloud computing infrastructure, which allows for scalability and efficiency. WSN protocols are used in IoT to provide the PHY/MAC connectivity between IoT sensor nodes and the central gateway/sink. IoT encompasses different technology stacks, WSN is a subset of IoT where data is transmitted using several IoT devices without internet. 5) Wireless Communication Protocols for PHY/MAC Layers In the context of WSNs, the relevant communication protocols used are IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), and IEEE 802.15.4 (WPAN); the 2G, 3G, and 4G generations of cellular networks; and IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), LoRaWAN (LoRA) [47], SigFox, and NB-IoT [48]. The choice of the communication protocol depends on multiple factors such as the needed data rate, the power consumption, the transmission range, and the cost. NB-IoT is a standards-based low-power wide-area (LWPA) technology developed by 3GPP that supports a wide range of new IoT devices and services. It uses a subset of the Long-Term Evolution (LTE) standard with limited bandwidth for a single narrow band of 200 kHz. LoRaWAN offers a high transmission range of about 32 km and very low energy consumption; it provides very limited data rates (maximum of 50 kbps), but they are generally enough for transmission of measurements from most currently available agricultural sensors. Table 2 lists the different wireless technologies used in WSNs. TABLE 2 Different Wireless Communication Technologies The characteristics provided in Table 2 for the different wireless communications technologies show that each technology has some advantages and disadvantages. Table 3 below, summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of each of the technologies in the context of smart farming. The summary reveals that the ZigBee Alliance sensors and SigFox are the best candidates for smart farming applications and their advantages overweigh the disadvantages. TABLE 3 Pros and Cons of Wireless Communications Technologies in Smart Farming 6) Cloud Computing Services Cloud computing services can be used in smart farming applications for the purpose of collecting and storing the data transmitted by remote sensors. On the other hand, cloud computing can be used for processing the data and generating results for the users. Data processing consists of data analysis, visualization, and decision-making. Cloud services can be classified into three connected layers, namely Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), which correspond to the internet applications offered for end users, the tools used to implement a wide range of applications, and physical resources, respectively [49]. C. Expert Systems in Agriculture AI is now regarded as a well-established and important technology that has contributed to many fields, such as commerce, medicine, electronics, games, manufacturing, and many more. In the domain of agriculture, AI technology has been used to create computer programs that can perform tasks that require human skills. There are a wide range of AI technologies that have been used successfully in agriculture, including expert systems and artificial neural networks. Expert systems are computer programs that can perform tasks that normally require the abilities of a skilled human. These tasks are usually decision-making tasks rather than physical activities, such as predicting or forecasting weather conditions. Expert systems are used in agriculture to change farming practices and replace human labor. In expert systems, “intelligence” means understanding and analyzing a pattern in the data to replicate human behavior for decision-making and problem-solving. The first application of AI techniques in the management of crops occurred in 1985 [50]. Numerous expert systems were developed to overcome the problems of vague, unfocused, and imperfect information in agricultural management, such as TEAPEST, which recommends a suitable control mechanism for identifying serious insect pests of tea. Rice-Crop Doctor was developed by MANAGE as an expert system to detect rice pests and diseases in addition to their cures. AMPRAPALIKA is an expert system that detects specific diseases of mango by using indicators and recommending treatments for mango tree diseases, and many other expert systems have been developed to address different aspects of agriculture [51]. There are many research proposals and systems with the aim of building expert systems that can determine land suitability for specific crops. One such study aimed to develop an expert system for making land suitability decisions for fruit crops, a process undertaken by analyzing the soil to recommend suitable plants [52]. In another study, new technological advancements were applied to model new types of diseases that can damage crops. The proposed system combined various factors in this application of technological advancements [53]. Some expert systems were also developed in the agricultural domain to evaluate the nutritional quality of the soil and determine whether plants absorbed sufficient, sustainable nutrients [52]. Image analysis using expert systems plays an important role in determining plant characteristics holistically. Such systems measure the heterogeneity of leaf pieces to determine leaf scorch, which in turn helps determine symptoms of leaf damage [54]. Image analysis particularly helps in two main fields of agriculture, namely ecological informatics and biometeorology, which require the quick interpretation of plant photo images to save time in the treatment process. In addition, many regression models were proposed using crop nutrition parameters. Such models and systems can decrease the risk of plant diseases for the global economy by detecting diseases and recommending applicable treatment to control them [55]. D. Challenges of Adopting AI in Agriculture AI has provided great opportunities to the agricultural sector; however, there are still many challenges faced by researchers in this area, such as collecting the required data for building the knowledge base. In addition to external factors, challenges from sowing to harvesting have led researchers to improve and create AI techniques such as artificial neural networks, fuzzy systems, expert systems, and agricultural robots. These systems are widely used in many farming applications such as crop and soil monitoring, weed management, pest management, disease detection, yield prediction, and general efforts to overcome challenges. Environmental sustainability is a key factor in farming, as climate change will cause decreases in water supplies and increased costs of production. Crop management systems provide interfaces that cover many features of the management of crops. This approach was first introduced by McKinion and Lemmon [50]. The designing of such systems is important for guarding crops from many different kinds of damage. Another challenge in farming is crop pests and the selection of measures to control them. Drone technologies were developed by different companies to help farmers virtually visit all their crops and provide full monitoring systems, which can be used to discover dead soil, diseases, irregular crops, and pests, in addition to recommending solutions to these issues. Plant diseases caused by pests have a significant effect on the global economy as 35% of crops are destroyed by different diseases. Thus, monitoring systems are needed to diagnose diseases and pests in addition to providing solutions. Such solutions can be based on past experiences. Soil quality is another factor to be considered for crop growth. It is known that many plants require specific soil characteristics to achieve maximum yield and profit [51]. Other challenges that farmers face in their efforts to successfully grow crops include climate factors such as temperature, humidity, sunlight, and rainfall. Machine learning techniques are being developed to forecast and predict the suitability of such factors [56]. It is now necessary to introduce modern technology that can use such data accurately to develop intelligent prediction systems in agriculture and yield maximum profit. Furthermore, to achieve large-scale planting, farmers face other challenges in trying to achieve precise planting and avoid the waste of agricultural resources, which can lead to unstable output. There are many solutions proposed by researchers and companies to overcome such problems by avoiding human labor and developing smart agriculture using sensor and IoT technologies for data collection and analysis [57]. AI technologies have shown very promising results in the domain of real-time monitoring of data, which is particularly suitable in the field of agriculture. As can be seen in the above proposed solutions, machines communicating with each other and using suitable AI technology will benefit farmers in their efforts to achieve their objectives with minimum waste of materials and maximum benefit. Nevertheless, smart farming is not as widespread as expected because farmers usually perceive AI as only belonging to the physical world, and cannot be applied on land. This is not due to hesitation or worry about taking the risk, rather, it is due to the difficulties they face in understanding how to use AI-based farming tools. E. Image Processing in Smart Farming Image processing consists of manipulating images using computer programs. The inputs of these programs are images, and the outputs are either altered images or sets of parameters related to the input images [58]. Image processing is useful in multiple fields, such as medicine [188], geology [189], and smart farming [184]. It can be used to detect damaged stems, leaves, or fruit, and to measure the spread of disease in a field or the weights of fruits [185]. In image processing, an image is preprocessed by being transformed into a matrix of numbers. Then, depending on the objectives of the manipulation, different operations can be applied to the matrix. These operations will be performed in a fixed sequence for each pixel of the image. Image processing may involve multiple techniques, as follows: Image enhancement: Images can be easily subjected to distortion [59]. This may be due to Gaussian noise, contrast deviation, or blurring. The latter is usually seen in most images [60]. Image enhancement consists of processing an image in order to make it clearer. This can be achieved by noise reduction, image sharpening, brightness adjustment, and contrast increase, generating clearer images that are more suitable for display or further processing and analysis. Image restoration: Multiple factors cause corrupted or degraded images. These can vary from a non-adjusted camera focus to time effect. Image restoration techniques aim to create images with the initially targeted quality so that new images can be restored from initially corrupted ones by reducing their degradation. Image compression: Image compression entails minimizing the size of an image file while preserving its quality. This process leads to the optimization of storage resources and the reduction of time spent sending images and downloading them from webpages. Image smoothing: Images may contain noisy data such as dots, blurs, speckles, or stains, and image smoothing methods act as filters to remove noisy data. There are multiple image smoothing methods including anisotropic diffusion, median filters, Gaussian filters, adaptive median filters, conservative smoothing, and mean filters. Most of them are based on low-pass filters, which help in decreasing the large difference between pixel values by averaging nearby pixel values while considering single values calculated for an image such as median and average values. They remove impulse noise from images by reducing the high-frequency components and retaining the low-frequency components [61]. 1) Computer Vision Computer vision is intended to empower computers to perceive, recognize, and understand the real world in ways very similar to humans. This field is now becoming more popular with the success of mobile technology, which generates unlimited streams of photos and videos that cannot be analyzed by only human vision and thus require the intervention of computer vision. On the other hand, computer vision techniques are greedy in terms of computing power. The continuous progress and decreasing price of computing power has contributed to the flourishing of computer vision. Novel artificial intelligence techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are being utilized for both software and hardware advancement [62]. Computer vision techniques are being widely used for smart farming goals such as optimizing the performance of automated robots or minimizing the losses of fruit harvesting with automatic robots [63] and post-harvesting fruit classification [64]. 2) Computer Vision Techniques Researchers have proposed different computer vision algorithms for different tasks. Some of these are as follows: Image classification: Image classification aims at classifying images into preknown classes. This task is very challenging, especially with larger numbers of variable items. Object detection: Object detection aims at localizing semantic objects into an image. This technique usually detects objects based on predefined categories of images by comparing and matching a set of features with the image database. Standard classification algorithms such as AdaBoost [65] and SVM [66] are usually adopted for object detection purposes. Research has been undertaken to detect different objects such as faces [65] and pedestrians. Image segmentation: Image segmentation involves partitioning images into multiple regions to be separately examined. It can be considered as pixel-level classification, where pixels are classified into specific entities [67]. Its main purpose is to change the representation of the images into a more meaningful one that can be analyzed more easily. F. Data Collection and IoT Sensors AI-enabled IoT sensors are widely used in many farms to collect data. These sensors can be categorized into many different groups based on location, optic, mechanics, airflow, electrochemical functions, etc. Effective usage of sensors helps farmers to have much more accurate predictions and good analysis while building their AI models. It is important to collect and manage data with smart sensors working in different IoT environments. One such study introduced a sensor management system to collect the data produced by each sensor in smart buildings and enable them to be processed and controlled by remote devices [68]. In another recent study [69], the data collection of IoT devices in a sparse network of IoT sensors was explored using a UAV and two new data collection solutions using an algorithm to address cases of full or incomplete data collection from sensors. In another relevant work [70], a data collection mechanism was proposed in remote areas using UAVs and building models for IoT-based smart farms to collect and process data using scheduling. Other scholars have devoted their attention to using the LoRa platform and cloud infrastructure to disseminate data for smart agriculture and effective irrigation. Sensor data obtained by monitoring temperature, humidity, and soil moisture in the LoRa network were transmitted to the cloud environment and collected IoT data were analyzed in the testing environment [71]. Another important undertaking for smart farms is measuring soil and ambient parameters in agriculture. Placidi [72] proposed a model wherein visualization was provided after data collection using real-time operations. The overall reliability of the system was proven with a long-term experiment with two natural soils, loamy sand and silty loam. In another work [73], a data collection model using a ZigBee wireless sensor network was suggested; it covered all aspects of crops based on a sustainable agriculture model. The system supported the data collection and remote-control processes of agricultural production, and it also facilitated data analysis and operations using the single-point crossover multiple-generation genetic algorithm. The results proved that the smart agricultural model offered clear improvements in production. Other scholars have devoted attention to IoT-based smart sensors that provide important innovations in the agricultural industry to increase productivity and energy efficiency. Research on IoT sensor technology was also undertaken in consideration of solutions using specific IoT sensors and sensor technologies in remote sensing and agricultural applications to assess weather conditions, soil quality, and the development of crops using robots for harvesting and weeding [74]. In another relevant study [75], the applications of printed sensors in smart farming were investigated and the advantages and disadvantages of measurement and monitoring applications were weighed while noting the limitations. That study also included measurements of chemicals, soil monitoring, and microclimate conditions in greenhouses. Recently, many different IoT software has been used worldwide in various agricultural solutions, especially for data-driven models needed to improve farm production or solve insect-related diseases. Additionally, these solutions become more effective and powerful by using machine learning applications. Authors [76] discussed the issues related to the software development models for IoT applications. Their results indicate that adaptation of these models in IoT-based software solutions is more difficult than the other types of standard implementations since the involvement of hardware-related problems. Modern software solutions in IoT can be categorized into remote sensing, computer imaging, livestock monitoring, agricultural drones, precision farming, and so on. The work [77] reflected a solution for protecting crops from cattle with infrared sensors by monitoring their movement in the fields. Another work related to the decision support system in [78] discussed the AgroDSS is a cloud-based smart evaluation of agricultural data analysis. G. Crop and Livestock Monitoring According to the World Resources Institute, there will be nearly 10 billion people on earth by 2050. To feed this many people sustainably, it will be necessary to increase food production by 53% to handle the overall expansion of agriculture lands and lower emissions by 67% [79]. One way to meet these demands is by smart farming. Incorporating IoT devices, wireless and wired networks, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and software management systems, we can monitor and improve farming outputs. Farming can be monitored in two main areas: crops and livestock monitoring. Each category has its own specifics and needs. 1) Crop Monitoring Crop monitoring takes into consideration one or more of the following points: Environmental conditions including humidity, temperature, solar radiation, fertilization, and pesticide application, for which data can be collected through WSNs and IoT sensors [80]. Crop diseases, including visual data that can be collected with high-resolution cameras, which may be fixed or mobile via UAVs [81]. In both cases, the information collected with these devices needs to be further processed for anomaly classification, prediction, and risk estimation [82]. Bauer and Aschenbruck [83] proposed an IoT-based farm monitoring system. Their focus of analysis was the leaf area index, which provides information on the photosynthetic processes and vital conditions of plants. WSN clusters of sensors were used to measure solar radiation (including temperature, humidity, and light) to calculate the photosynthetically active radiation range. Raspberry Pi was used at each cluster node, exchanging data with the central base unit through the LTE modem. The data were subsequently processed within a farm management information system for generating reports and making decisions. Bagheri [84] developed a remote sensor system with high spatial and temporal resolution to improve the monitoring processes for temporal changes in agriculture via a UAV. The system architecture consisted of a main onboard system and ground station subsystems, with multispectral cameras for high-precision capturing, a GPS tracking system, and a telemetry system to transfer data among the subsystems. This monitoring system could speed up the monitoring processes and increase the accuracy of crop classification. After image capturing, multispectral imaging classification maps were developed with a maximum likelihood model. The results were very promising, with accuracy of 94% and a kappa coefficient of 0.9. A similar study was developed in a vineyard [85]. The images captured were used to detect grape leaf stripe disease via the application of the normalized difference vegetation index, which facilitates analysis at the level of a single plant. This system allowed for the detection of anomalies near the infrared wavelength, which is not possible for the human visible spectrum. Thus, this study confirmed the benefits of using smart monitoring for plant protection. In another previous study [86], the aim was to implement an integrated plant protection architecture and tree protection architecture by combining UAVs, cameras, and a WSN. After extensive research, a system with the following components was proposed: Environmental data acquisition– Libeliu’s Plug and Sense kit, a robust waterproof enclosure with specific external sockets, and incorporated GPS. Data transmission was performed with the LoRaWAN Gateway protocol, which performs best compared to other technologies. Imagery data acquisition– An eBee X senseFly drone together with a Parrot Sequoia+ camera to capture ground and air images. Imagery data processing – Preliminary processing of the images directly in the field via Pix4D to improve the overall processing time. Cloud infrastructure– Data coming from both land and air are stored, processed, and analyzed using multiple machine learning and computer vision algorithms. They are managed through web and smartphone applications. Cloud platforms are the best choices for such storage due to the additional tools they provide. The proposed system aimed to provide multiple area solutions, extended area coverage, and macroscopic and microscopic data, portability, and adaptability. 2) Livestock Monitoring According to the FAO, livestock contributes 40% of the global value of agricultural output and supports the livelihoods and food and nutrition security of almost 1.3 billion people [87]. Currently, the livestock sector emits an estimated 7.1 GT of CO2 equivalent per year, representing 14.5% of human-induced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Increasing the efficiency of livestock supply chains is crucial for limiting the growth of GHG emissions in the future. It was previously reported that smart monitoring of animal health and welfare could affect the global meat supply by reducing emissions by 2.5% and health problems and diseases by up to 33% [87]. The precision farming approach focuses on increasing productivity and preventing the spread of diseases on farms. Through IoT infrastructure and cloud-based technologies, it is possible to monitor farms in real-time to support and predict animal diseases before they can spread. Digital devices such as wearables are being used to monitor the real-time behaviors of animals and thus improve their health, lactation, or reproduction. Moreover, livestock facility data collection is used to monitor environmental factors such as malodor, gas emissions, and ventilation. Smart systems consist of three main parts: sensing devices, communication channels, and storage and processing infrastructure. The sensing devices can be of several forms, such as collars, tags, actuators, or buzzers, and they are mostly known as IoT devices. Communication technologies are mostly wireless technologies such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and mobile technologies such as 4G or LTE. The storage and processing infrastructure is usually a cloud platform, which gives system supervisors the opportunity to use multiple processing tools and help them make decisions. Moreover, the cloud infrastructure offers AI and machine learning-based applications to support IoT applications. Recent research has shown that the usage of smart monitoring has immense potential for improving livestock outputs. Several studies have been conducted with cattle, sheep, goats, poultry, and house pets, indicating positive impacts in several directions. Precision livestock farming consists of monitoring, controlling, tracking, predicting, and automating applications [89]. These monitoring systems process and transmit data to the concerned parties in real time. Moreover, it is important that the farmers need to obey the laws of governments to follow the national standards and guidelines for livestock which are need to be developed collaboratively by authority and livestock industries. Parameters observed via these monitoring systems include the following: Physiological data, such as body temperature, humidity, or heart rate [89]. Stress [90], [91]. Food intake [92], [93]. Disease [94]. Digestion [89], [95]. Other factors such as environmental conditions [93], [96]. The normal body temperature of cows should be between 38 °C and 42 °C. Lower temperatures indicate indigestion or milk fever and higher temperatures indicate serious health issues. Humidity values above 72% indicate mild stress and those above 80% are linked to severe stress causing the reduction of heat exchange and weakness. Normal heart rates are considered to be between 48 and 84 BPM. A normal healthy animal eats for approximately 3–4 hours per day and digests the food for 9.5-10 hours per day. Incorrect measurements of these values will lead to under- or overfeeding and subsequent sickness or food waste. The common tools used for physical measurements include wearable collars [97], [98], [99] and infrared sensors. Collars are mainly used to measure body temperature, blood pressure, and the pulse rate of the animals. Skin temperature is measured with infrared cameras and thermometers. The data are transferred to a database for further processing through wireless communication. Several types of microcontrollers can be used. According to a previous study [100], four features help in monitoring lameness, which are the daily number of steps, walking distance, time spent lying down, and eating. That study used three machine learning methods, namely the artificial neural network, SVM, and random forest approaches. All methods gave perfect results in distinguishing healthy and sick animals. Joshitha et al. [101] proposed an automated smart system for tracking the movements of cattle. A LoRaWan system combined with GPS, NodeMCU, temperature and humidity sensors, a power supply, and a Raspberry Pi module was arranged to collect and process data on the movements of the cattle. The system assured better productivity and protection than existing conventional methods. A similar proposal was made in another previous study [102], where the LoRa approach was implemented with a mobile gateway instead of a static gateway. Since LoRa utilizes the sub-1-GHz unlicensed spectrum, it was concluded that the static gateway was productive mostly for small livestock areas because of the sufficient data extraction rate and lower energy consumption. However, in larger livestock areas, the mobile gateway offers lower deployment costs and sufficient value. The system works by using sensor collars, which are hung around the cows’ necks. These collars consist of a heartbeat sensor, a temperature sensor, a respiration sensor, and a humidity sensor. The data are transferred to the gateway and then to the farmers or breeders. In cases where there are many monitoring devices, the data transfer infrastructure should be designed accordingly so that the system can operate most efficiently. 3) Poultry Farms Several studies and solutions have been proposed regarding poultry farms. The main issue to be considered in poultry farming is the housing environment. This entails odor monitoring, ventilation systems, temperature, carbon dioxide, and humidity. Other factors include the type of chickens, housing systems, building structures, ventilation systems, bedding materials, flow rates, types and amounts of feed and animal activity levels, manure handling systems, building management (cleaning and disinfection procedures), and cleaning practices [103]. Major malodor problems may arise on farms as a result of waste and chicken manure. Odor emission is influenced by various parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, season, and distances. Aunsa-Ard et al. [104] used an e-nose system to analyze malodor on poultry farms in Thailand. Their system consisted of eight metal oxide gas sensors and three major parts: a sample delivery system, detection unit, and signal processing system. The system provided high-precision data measurements. Another study used three fuzzy logic controllers to monitor the temperature, humidity, CO2, and NH3 on a poultry farm, applying LabView and fuzzy control to regulate those parameters. By using fuzzy controllers, the power consumption by the actuators was decreased by 42% [105]. Wu et al. [106] developed a combined system of a traditional henhouse with a remote environmental monitoring system using ZigBee and ARM. The system provided reliable and stable performance. The main considered parameters were temperature, humidity, and light. In the study by Li et al. [107], an online poultry monitoring system was proposed. The system was based on wireless sensor networks and wireless sensor technology. Temperature, CO2, and NH3 concentration measurements showed high accuracy, leading to a reliable system. In another study [108], the authors took into consideration power shortages and issues raised for ventilation systems for poultry. They proposed a smart notification system using an infrared sensor to detect fan malfunctions and notify users in three ways: phone calls, SMS, and the LINE application. The above section describes the background of artificial intelligence and using AI and IoT applications in smart farming. SECTION IV. AI in Agriculture Agriculture has a significant role in the sustained viability of any economy. It is significant for long-term economic growth and structural transformation, and it has evolved in terms of the processing, production, and conveyance of crops and domesticated animals. Currently, the agricultural sector is being influenced by new innovative IoT technologies, wireless communications, machine learning, and AI. Thanks to these technologies, the collection and analysis of data such as temperature, weather, soil properties, and historical crop performance provide predictive information that helps solve agricultural problems such as crop diseases, pesticide control, weed management, lack of irrigation, and water management [109]. At the same time, intelligent robots that operate in dynamic and unstructured situations and interact with humans have sparked increased interest and expanded applications in all fields, including agriculture. Significant advances have occurred in the field of agriculture from 1980 to the present day. For example, Jha et al. [110] listed more than 50 technological advances in subfields of agriculture, including the use of artificial neural networks and expert systems, machine learning and fuzzy logic systems, automation, and IoT techniques to solve agricultural problems. Artificial neural networks that predict and forecast based on parallel reasoning were incorporated into the agricultural sector by Robinson and Mort [111], who proposed one of the first models to be fed with raw meteorological data like humidity, temperature, precipitation, and wind direction to predict the occurrence of frost. Gliever et al. [112] used an artificial neural network successfully to differentiate weeds from cotton plants and soil in images collected from commercial cotton fields with 92% overall accuracy. Maier and Dandy [113] presented a literature review of the use of artificial neural networks for forecasting water resource variables and they outlined the steps that should be followed, the options available, and the issues that should be considered in the development of models that use artificial neural networks for the prediction of water resource variables. Song and He [114] used an artificial neural network and expert system to help farmers detect crop nutritional disorders in time. That combination led to diagnostic efficiency of 92% for nutritional disorders in crops. Prakash et al. [115] developed an expert system with a graphical interface based on fuzzy logic. It stored knowledge provided by agricultural experts, implemented reasoning algorithms to simulate human thinking, and provided a decision-making framework to help farmers improve their soybean planting and harvesting decisions in circumstances where the help of an agricultural expert is needed but not immediately accessible. Sannakki et al. [115] applied an image processing-based approach for the automatic grading of leaf diseases by utilizing fuzzy logic. The proposed system was divided into five steps including image acquisition, image preprocessing, color image segmentation, calculation of the image total leaf area and image total disease area, and disease grading by fuzzy logic. The system gave accurate results. Tilva et al. [116] developed a fuzzy inference system to forecast plant diseases on the basis of weather data. The framework was created to prevent diseases in plants using an “IF, THEN” condition that indicated diseases happening because of a particular range of temperature and humidity. Shahzadi et al. [117] developed a specialist expert system based on the IoT that gathers and sends real-time data to a server to make appropriate decisions to enhance productivity and limit losses due to diseases and insects/pests. Embedded intelligence aims to discover individual behaviors by mining their digital traces during interactions with the IoT. Yong et al. [118] applied wireless sensor networks and embedded intelligence in the domain of agriculture and presented a technology roadmap that explained the challenges and opportunities in agricultural areas in general and offered examples of IoT applications for smart irrigation. Patil and Thorat [119] used the IoT and machine learning to predict grape disease before it occurred. That involved developing a monitoring system for leaf temperature and a humidity sensor to identify grape disease risks in the early stages using a hidden Markov model that provides SMS alerts to farmers and experts. Several studies have presented different decision-making strategies to help farmers monitor their fields [120], [121], [122], [123], [124], [125], [126], [127]. For example, Koteish et al. [120] proposed a real-time agriculture monitoring mechanism based on the IoT for sensing the soil moisture of a field and enhancing the irrigation system. They divided the monitored field into small zones and studied the data collected by the sensors from each zone to allow farmers to make the right decisions based on a predefined decision table. These studies showed efficiency in terms of data reduction, energy conservation, and accurate decision-making. The above section describes using IoT technologies in smart farming. SECTION V. Robotics in Agriculture The literature has reported various ideas regarding the ability of robots to assist in agricultural activities. Indeed, the mechanization and automatization of agricultural tasks are an essential step to addressing population growth. Khadatkar et al. [128] emphasized the available robotic systems for various farm operations for field crops and horticulture and they discussed the following approaches and technologies presented in the literature for undertaking various agricultural operations: Transplanting: Robotic transplanters use computer graphics or machine vision systems for transplanting operations [128]. Most robotic transplanters consist of a robotic arm for seedling pick-up, a path manipulator, and an end-effector [129], [130]. Intercultural operations: Intercultural operations such as weeding are done to kill weeds by mechanical weeders or chemical spraying. Robotic weeders use vision-based systems for weed detection, guiding weeders, and uprooting weeds mechanically [131], [132], [133]. Gonzalez-de-Soto et al. [134] developed a robotic patch spraying system for the precise application of herbicides. Harvesting: Fruit selection and detachment are among the essential tasks for efficient harvesting. Most robotic harvesters have been developed for fruits and operate by grasping the fruit with grippers and then detaching it based on shape, size, color, and texture [135], [136]. Rahmadian et al. [137] explored three important developments of autonomous robotics in agriculture: navigation (incorporating GPS technology and vision-based sensor navigation to direct robots through agricultural fields), harvesting systems (incorporating sensors for harvesting and actuators to control harvesting devices), and soil analysis systems (giving information about the state of the farm’s soil). However, agricultural conditions present many difficulties for robotic navigation. One relevant study [138] presented a literature review of the approaches for path planning in several agricultural areas. Bochtis et al. [139] offered a review of advances in agricultural machinery, where one of the approaches involves path planning methods for area coverage on farms. Palmer et al. [140] addressed improving the efficiency of field operations and suggested that precise tracking of predetermined efficient courses could reduce both overlaps and misses. According to some researchers [128], [138], there are two main categories of path planning algorithms: Point-to-point path planning: The goal consists of determining a collision-free path from a starting point to a destination point, optimizing parameters such as time, distance, or energy. Coverage path planning: The aim is to determine a path that passes over all points of an area or volume while avoiding obstacles [141]. Cao et al. [142] defined all the requirements for coverage operations. Luís et al. [138] indicated that path planning has been successfully applied to agrarian robots for field coverage and point-to-point navigation, with coverage path planning being slightly more advanced. Other researchers [143] presented a review of case studies in which robots were applied in recent agricultural tasks, including multi-robot systems and ground and aerial robots. Gliever and Slaughter [112] demonstrated that a well-validated computer simulation can provide a virtual proving ground that is essential for understanding how the robots of the future should be designed and controlled. Another study [143] suggested steps for making robotic simulations helpful, such as generating large amounts of data for machine learning and consequently facilitating the development of human-robot interactions and intelligent robots. Oliviera et al. [144] reviewed the main existing applications of agricultural robotic systems for the execution of land preparation before planting, sowing, plant treatments, harvesting, yield estimation, or phenotyping. They evaluated robots according to the following main criteria: locomotion system, development stage, final application, use of sensors in robotic arms, and computer vision algorithms. They concluded that agricultural robotic systems are promoted and proposed in four main areas for future research: locomotion systems, sensors, computer vision algorithms, and IoT-based smart agriculture [144]. The above section discusses the usage of robotics in the agriculture sector and its start of the artwork. SECTION VI. Abnormal Activities The first step in anomaly detection is defining the normal patterns as a standard reference point for the data analysis and processing phase. In general, an anomaly is defined as an abnormal state of the data that does not fit with the standard normal flow of systematic data behavior. In a previous study [145], the occurrences of abnormal behaviors in the data processing phase were classified into the categories shown in Table 4. TABLE 4 Categories and Types of Anomalies For the performance evaluation of the detection model, some anomalies were inserted into the data during the process of data collection from the sensors. The model was able to detect anomalies from different sensors successfully. The implemented autoencoder model in that study [145] was considered as one of the most well-recognized neural network techniques classified as an unsupervised learning method, where the encoder has to learn the ways of compressing, encoding, and reconstructing the data. Basically, after the input data are acknowledged, the autoencoder starts the encoding process, utilizing the bottleneck layer in order to shrink the input data size. In the decoding phase, the autoencoder is trained to ignore non-vital data in the process of reconstructing the original data. By ignoring non-vital data such as moisture too low, light too high, or humidity too low in the decoding process, the autoencoder will be able to process large numbers of features with as little loss of normal data as possible and maximization of the loss of the anomalies contained within the testing dataset. The autoencoder produces output in the form of images and labels the anomalies as abnormal data attributes. The data in the training phase are divided into validation (25% of the original data size) and training (75% of the original data size) datasets. After the training phase of the model, the threshold is determined along with the hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate, number of nodes, and number of epochs) using the validation dataset. The optimal training parameter setup values are shown in Table 5 [145]. TABLE 5 Optimal Training Parameter Setup Values Park et al. [146] proposed a machine-to-machine (M2M) standard communication method between things within the IoT environment in order to address the fact that most IoT services and devices are implemented to operate in a prototyped zone limited to the location where the experiment is taking place. The proposed method paved the way toward more interactive and well-connected system sensors and controlled devices within smart farm zones inside IoT environments. The M2M method offers functions including remote configuration, operation instruction, connections, data collection, data storage, device management, and security. In the same study [146], the compiled and processed information, basically generated from different IoT-based devices within livestock houses as shown in Figure 9. Livestock houses and farm communication structure using the M2M approach [146], was transmitted and received according to the M2M standard method. FIGURE 9. Livestock houses and farm communication structure using the M2M approach [146]. Show All The livestock houses consisted of multiple pig barns, each of which had a set of IoT equipment as shown in Table 6 [146]. TABLE 6 List of IoT Equipment Within Livestock Houses Creating a predictive model for each device is essential in order to identify multidevice failure situations in livestock houses. The accumulated received data from livestock houses’ sensors and control equipment feed the predictive model in the learning process. The training process takes place in a central server using transmitted data in a real-time manner from the livestock farm’s devices. The data received at the server side are used to predict occurrences of malfunctions in order to inform the user so that suitable action can be taken according to the type of malfunction. The proposed anomaly detection mechanism suits all IoT device types and numbers within livestock houses or farms zones. According to Moso et al. [147], smart farms are producing enormous spatial, temporal, and time-series data streams. Analyzing these enormous volumes of streamed data will aid in better understanding various issues of productivity and efficiency regarding farm processes. Monitoring and analyzing a farm’s progress by utilizing a suitable anomaly detection technique will help in recognizing any behavioral deviations from the norm. In the work of Moso et al. [147], using the enhanced locally selective combination in parallel outlier ensembles (ELSCP) as an ensemble anomaly detector was proposed. An unsupervised data-driven methodology was defined to be applied in two case studies of temporal data in smart farming. The first study considered harvesting data along with the use of a combine-harvester Global Positioning System (GPS) in tracking events. The second case study addressed crop data, considering the link between crop status (damaged or not) and detected anomalies. Referring to the area under the precision-recall curve (AUCPR), Moso et al. [147] concluded that their proposed methodology applied to the combine-harvester dataset yielded a score of 0.972, and for the crop dataset, 30% of the detected anomalies could be directly linked to crop damage. The main focus of their work was evaluating anomaly detection on farms by analyzing GPS logs, along with the following contributions: A detailed state-of-the-art report was offered for anomaly detection techniques with a focus on smart agriculture. A robust ensemble-based methodology for the detection of anomalies from data streams in smart agriculture contexts was proposed. The proposed technique was implemented and applied to a data stream of combine-harvester GPS logs with the aim of identifying anomalies that impact the harvest efficiency of farm machinery. The proposed technique was also implemented and applied to crop data with the aim of identifying anomalies that reveal the status of crops during harvesting. In smart agriculture field, Catalano et al. developed a multi-layered architecture anomaly detection system to alleviate the infrastructure threats. In their work, two machine-learning algorithmic approaches’; the multivariate linear regression (MLR) and a long-term memory neural network algorithm (LSTM) were employed in the development process of the anomaly detection system. The system was fed by a real dataset coming from a smart agriculture system located in the Apulia region (Italy). In the training phase of both MLR and LSTM models, the datasets were obtained from Google Colab platform and the performance was evaluated by metrics. Right after the training process, the testing phase took place to generate predictions on the obtained data; therefore, the result will be assessed to reveal the detected anomalies [148]. The novelty of Akhter et al. work is that they developed an interdigital phosphate sensor for smart agriculture with a low-cost and low-power planar. The fabrication of the sensor is produced using a 3D printed template; in time, Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) and Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) are used to form the electrodes and substrate of the sensor respectively. In order to characterize the sensor for a wide range of temperature and phosphate detection the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is employed. The system is trained with a well-recognized AI data processing algorithm which is K-nearest neighbor (KNN) machine learning algorithm. The obtained data from sensors are labeled as unclassified raw data. The principle of Euclidean distance used in KNN to compute the nearest distance between the training dataset matrix and new entry. The next step in this phase is optimizing the ‘K’s parameter from training dataset matrix and new entry. At this stage, shortest distance group of rows of the matrix is classified, the nearest possible result is computed using the mean deviation of those distances. The experimental outcomes were validated via standard UV vs. Spectrometry promotes the reliability of the sensor [149]. The above section discusses the recognition and identification of anomalies activities in agriculture. SECTION VII. Irrigation Leakage Water is scarce and it is one of the most essential resources in the agricultural sector. A large amount of water is wasted as a result of the improper management of irrigation systems. As per the United Nation’s World Water Development Report, more than 50% of the world’s population will be facing high levels of water scarcity by 2050 [150]. The main reason for water wastage in farming is leakage in water distribution systems (WDSs). In an unmonitored irrigation system, small leaks in the WDS often go unnoticed, resulting in critical problems such as ruptures or bursts in the pipelines. The leakages in water pipelines are mainly due to excessive pressure on the pipelines, which causes distortion and further leads to the bursting of pipes when water flows through them [151]. Leakage detection in these pipelines by using a proper irrigation leakage monitoring system can help reduce water wastage and improve the efficiency of irrigation systems. A considerable number of studies have been conducted on leakage detection in WDSs. Researchers have developed different approaches for leakage detection and localization, such as the use of flow sensors and methodologies to analyze inputs from the sensors. Daadoo et al. [151] proposed a system using wireless networks for leakage detection in WDSs for domestic environments. The two main phases of the system were an alarm based on GSM to send SMS information to the user and an Android application to control the pump. The proposed system used water sensors and ultrasonic sensors for water leakage detection and a microcontroller as a controlling unit. The results showed that the proposed system gave good responses to the sensor and owners could enjoy the ease of controlling the water pump through the mobile Android application. Odumodu et al. [152] presented UFMNet, or Ultrasonic Flow Metering Network, with real-time flow monitoring, providing a cost-effective solution for pipeline leak detection. UFMNet is composed of a set of time-synchronized ultrasonic sensors to measure flow data (changes in the flow rate at different sections of the pipeline) continuously at high frequencies and radio transceivers to enable data correlation and in-network processing of the data flow. The authors listed the main advantage of the proposed system as the cost effectiveness of the development and installation process. Furthermore, the system provides more flexibility, as it can be deployed without shutting down pipelines. Results showed that the system could achieve reasonable accuracy. A hybrid entropy clustering-based framework for the identification and placement of potential pressure sensors in WDSs for leakage detection was proposed by Taravatrooy et al. [153]. Minimizing the number of pressure sensors by reducing redundant information based on information theory and choosing the optimal solution based on a multicriteria decision-making model were the unique points of this study. The main aim of the proposed system was to develop an effective framework for optimizing leak detection by decreasing the cost of pressure sensor procurement and maximizing the coverage of the sensor network. Fan et al. [154] and Coelho et al. [155] used a machine learning-based framework for water leakage detection in their works. In the former case [149], the authors used a semi-supervised learning framework of clustering and then localization for optimal sensor placement and leakage localization. In this approach, the WDS is partitioned into water leakage zones using a modified K-means clustering algorithm and a machine learning model is trained for leakage detection. New leakage characteristics extracted by the unsupervised learning algorithms proposed in that study [154] were determined by principal component analysis and an autoencoder neural network. An important feature of the proposed model was that it could be trained with the leakage characteristics matrix of the unbalanced data to detect abnormal conditions. The method achieved satisfactory performance for leakage detection and leakage localization. On the other hand, Coelho et al. [155] used a wireless sensor network to monitor the WDS and a machine learning algorithm to identify the precise locations of water leaks. A study to identify the most suitable machine learning classification algorithm for leakage detection was presented in that paper. The proposed system was able to achieve 75% accuracy for leakage detection with the benefit of being a low-cost application. Figure 10. Machine learning (ML)-based framework for leakage detection depicts a simplified model used in machine learning-based water leakage detection frameworks. FIGURE 10. Machine learning (ML)-based framework for leakage detection. Show All Aditya et al. [150] discussed different smart techniques available for detecting leakages and burst events in pipeline networks along with the present challenges and future possibilities in their work. Their study highlighted the major limitations of smart water technology as false alarms and the difficulty in identifying exact leak locations. The calibration method proposed by Moasheri et al. [156] used a two-step process of identifying the zone with the most leakages and dividing that leaky zone into virtual zones. Calibration of the probability of leakage and the roughness coefficients of the pipes in the WDS were obtained simultaneously with the imperialist competitive algorithm. This method used the analysis of field pressure and flow metering results in the network, and it was shown that the method had no limitations on the number of leakages that could be evaluated simultaneously. This method helped reduce operational costs by reducing the number of field measurement devices. Islam et al. [157] proposed a novel methodology based on a fuzzy-based algorithm to analyze the uncertainties of different WDS parameters such as roughness, nodal demands, and water reservoir levels to detect leakages. An experimental case study showed that the developed model could detect leakages and diagnose the exact locations of leakages within a minimal amount of time. The limitation of this model was the higher level of computational effort in cases of multiple leakages with limited numbers of sensors. Moreover, the model did not facilitate optimization of the number of nodes and their placement. The above section introduced the irrigation leakage and its solutions using AI techniques. SECTION VIII. Quality, Productivity, and Sustainability Food quality, productivity, and sustainability are critical issues in all countries because of the increasing population, climate change, and decreased resource availability. Traditional farming is not sufficient for ensuring high quality and quantity in secure food production. Global changes including climate change, water shortages, increased labor costs, and security challenges are essential problems in the agricultural sector. AI, the IoT, and robotics are important technologies used in smart farming to increase quality and productivity. Information technology supported by sensors, smart cameras, data science, and robotics can increase crop productivity and sustainability in farming. It is more practical and efficient to use AI technologies for monitoring and automating decision-making processes in agriculture [158]. In addition, crop and animal management is easier and more efficient with these technologies. AI-based smart monitoring systems provide more profitable, secure, and efficient farming. They reduce the cost of resources such as water and labor and increase reliability and security [159]. Productivity and sustainability in farming can be increased by applying the following AI, IoT, and robotics-based technologies: Crop monitoring using the IoT Automated monitoring of information systems and decision support Data analysis using machine learning algorithms Yield mapping using supervised machine learning AI-based smart tractors, agribots, and robotic technology Supply chain management and tracking Price forecasting and optimization Figure 11. AI-enabled IoT smart farming system provides an example of an AI-enabled IoT smart farming system. IoT sensors (optical sensors, electrochemical sensors, mechanical soil sensors, location sensors, airflow sensors, etc.), drones, and Wi-Fi bots collect data from the fields and share the data via the cloud to the AI-based smart farming system. Smart farming systems apply many different machine learning, image processing, computer vision, remote sensing, and expert system algorithms to retrieve knowledge from raw data and thus support farm management and decision-making. These systems increase the quality, productivity, and sustainability of agriculture and supply chains. FIGURE 11. AI-enabled IoT smart farming system. Show All Thakor et al. [158] proposed an IoT-based Digi farming model to analyze the production of farms. IoT sensors collect data from farms and help farmers make decisions and monitor their crops. Mobile and web applications are very efficient in disseminating product information and supporting e-commerce. Thakor et al. [158] evaluated several AI-based and IoT-based farming methodologies and compared them to traditional farming systems. Their results show that AI-based farming production is more efficient and profitable and that the Happiness Index scores of farmers and their living standards are higher among those engaged in smart farming compared to traditional farmers. Suebsombut et al. [159] classified the current trends and future possibilities of farming production and sustainability considering climate change, food security, and farm management, which are all relevant to smart farming, information management, product lifecycles, supply chains, and traceability. The experimental results showed that one of the most important variables was soil carbon emission, which affects food production and sustainability. Quality, productivity, and sustainability in agriculture are affected by plant diseases, prices of crops, weather and climate, water availability, insurance, agent commissions, and potential lack of farming and management skills. Radu et al. [160] proposed a farm information management system with two levels, namely the local farm and the cloud farm. The farm management systems collected data from several farms and applied data preprocessing and machine learning algorithms to extract knowledge from the raw data. These authors compared farm management with local, cloud, and mobile applications. Cloud-based farm management systems yielded more accurate results than the others. Data collection for several crop species and several types of data will increase the efficiency and productivity of farming. Soil moisture, macronutrients, and micronutrients are also important parameters in agriculture for the maximum productivity and efficiency of crops. Production resources such as water and fertilizers should not be excessively or insufficiently applied. Researchers have shown that soil sensing techniques using real-time IoT technology can increase soil productivity with efficient water usage [161]. Malik et al. [162] proposed fog computing in sustainable and productive smart farming systems. Low-cost sensors and smart management were used to enhance agricultural productivity. In their paper, simulation platforms were modeled for data collection, sensor deployment, and data processing. These are critical parts of the smart farming ecosystems. The system considered sensor node placement, robot planning, data collection, mobile nodes, energy nodes, and coverage area. Sensors are especially important in smart farming for efficient monitoring and early warning systems. The proposed model gave promising results based on sensor energy, transmission delay, and packet delivery ratio. It has also been proposed that sensor placement and management simulation models can support sustainable IoT systems for farm management [163], [164]. Such systems can work with cloud computing in real-time applications. Probabilistic rule-based and supervised learning algorithms have also been proposed to enhance the productivity of crop production and water level arrangements [165], [166], [167], and Bayesian networks are often used in smart farming to monitor sensors remotely. Priyadharsini et al. [168] proposed a new AI- and machine learning-based information system that used deep learning to analyze types of seasonal agricultural products. Input, hidden, and output layers were used with a total of 9 neurons in training. Monitoring the soil nutrition and pH level increased the productivity of the crops, and deep learning-based classification yielded more than 90% accuracy. Machine learning supervised classification algorithms are also used for preprocessed raw data received from multiple sensors using information fusion for crop monitoring to increase productivity and sustainability in smart farming [169], [170], [171]. Experimental results have shown that probabilistic-based methods such as the naïve Bayes classifier and Bayes network algorithms offer high accuracy in classification. Deep learning is one of the machine learning algorithms which uses artificial neural network technique. Deep learning performs feature extraction automatically without human intervention which provide advantages in training of data. Deep learning is used several applications of the smart farming such as plant classification, behavior recognition, anomaly detection, pest recognition, smart irrigation and weed detection. Park et al. [146] collect livestock data from sensors and controllers to find out the anomalies in the farm. Feature vector includes temperature, humidity, CO2, ventilation, radiator temperature and external temperature. Anomaly detection accuracy in the farm is more than 93% using deep learning algorithms. Shakeel et al. [183] proposed deep learning algorithm-based cow behavior detection. Deep recurrent learning algorithm is used to identify and forecast cow behavior patterns. Proposed algorithm provides robust, secure and efficient computing time. Durai et al. [184] proposed several deep learning and other machine learning algorithms to predict the weather conditions, analyze the soil, recommend the crops for cultivation, determine the amount of fertilizers. Results in deep learning is more promising than the rule-based algorithms such as decision tree and random forest. SECTION IX. Benefits of Smart Farming Smart farming helps to determine the optimal use of natural resources in an economically sustainable manner. In addition, IOT based smart farming systems facilitates demand forecast, improves quality of supply, and ultimately the experience of the consumer. The objective of the extensive data collection and analysis approach used in smart farming is to increase the agricultural output while contributing to the environmental protection. Smart farming has proven to be beneficial to society in several regards. In this section, the main benefits of smart farming as seen by farmers, companies, and other members of the agricultural sector will be addressed. A. Farmers As was described above, the usage of smart devices, AI, machine learning, expert systems, and cloud computing can significantly improve the monitoring processes of farms and allow actions to be taken to resolve any abnormalities or problems that have occurred. The usage of smart sensors allows farmers to measure all the required parameters related to their specific farms, such as crops or livestock, in real time. Image processing and machine learning enable the early diagnosis of plant diseases, leading to an early identification of the best strategies to fight them. Moreover, AI provides predictive insights that facilitate the decision-making processes of farmers in several stages of the farming process. Cloud computing and web and mobile applications make notification processes remotely available, allowing farmers to be anywhere and still have real-time knowledge about the daily conditions of their farms. Finally, smart monitoring systems allow farmers to use fewer resources, including water, energy, food, fertilizers, land, and human resources, compared to traditional approaches. B. Companies The farming and agricultural industry can benefit from IoT-enabled smart farming for real-time data collection and process automation, which helps achieve better decision-making, reduces waste, and maximizes efficiency in operations. According to Hunter et al. [172], the growing demands for global food consumption will require an increase in agricultural production of 25%-70% by 2050. Meeting this demand is a serious challenge around the world. With smart farming, it is possible to support the production of larger quantities of food. Smart agriculture has the potential to help address the world’s problems with food security and sustainability. Smart farming enables accuracy and precision in agriculture, subsequently allowing for improved labor and fuel efficiency. Resource consumption and human errors can be reduced using IoT technologies, thus reducing the operational costs and enhancing the quality of the products. The implementation of smart farming technologies is a major factor driving the growth of the smart farming market. However, although smart agriculture models are beneficial, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed, such as the high costs of smart agriculture equipment and the management of huge volumes of data related to productive decision-making. Precision in smart farming allows us to optimize the use of resources such as fertilizers and irrigation water and thus improves food quality. Agricultural data collected using IoT devices help agricultural companies make the right decisions related to farming and the selling of crops [168]. C. Agricultural Sector Smart farming solutions have important effects on the agricultural sector from different perspectives. For example, observing and collecting data from large farms with respect to humidity, air temperature, soil moisture, and sunlight intensity will have positive effects on the efficiency of water usage. Therefore, it will affect the overall crop yield. Since the world’s population is increasing day by day, it is essential to use new techniques in the agricultural sector to increase food productivity. In this sense, smart farming is the best solution for increasing food production and maximizing profit. Smart farming solutions should be implemented effectively using IoT platforms and low-cost sensors while saving time, money, and resources. The outcomes of such implementations will benefit the agricultural sector in different ways that include increased production quality, the protection of water supplies, real-time data collection, lower operational costs, improved livestock farming, remote monitoring of fields, and reduced environmental footprints. In many countries, research and development in the field of smart farming is being promoted to maximize sustainable food production while ensuring better profitability for farmers. One example of the implementation of smart farming in the agricultural sector was offered by Collado et al. [174]. They addressed the challenges related to the implementation of such projects, taking into consideration the human resources, the availability of fully equipped research centers, and the environmental aspects. SECTION X. Challenges A. Data Accuracy The success of a smart farming system is highly reliant on the accuracy of the data captured by IoT devices, as decisions will be made based upon the analysis of the data. IoT platforms, low cost sensors and data insights enables increase of efficiency and production in smart farming. However, in smart farming, data accuracy can be easily affected by multiple factors. First, IoT devices are generally designed for indoor environments, while in real life, smart farming takes place outdoors where environmental conditions can be very harsh, with snow, hail, floods, wind, or dust. This may lead to the rapid deterioration of IoT sensors. For example, sensors that contain copper might experience rapid oxidation, dust may easily cover several types of sensors, and some humidity sensors might be saturated in highly humid environments [175]. This will lead to the deterioration of the measurement capacity of the sensors and thus to degradation in data accuracy. Furthermore, electromagnetic interference caused by high-voltage grids across rural areas can cause data distortion or corruption due to the generation of electromagnetic fields [175]. Furthermore, IoT devices should not be running 24 hours a day; they should be switched off if no data are to be read. However, continuous data transmission is important for smart farming, so a serious challenge is seen in efforts to balance energy consumption and continuous signal transmissions. Battery depletion can also cause data inaccuracy since it is a gradual process that is not immediately detected. Until the moment of detecting a battery problem and fixing it, sensors may be sending data of questionable accuracy. B. Security Since smart farming relies on the integration of multiple technologies, networking, the IoT, and cloud computing, it inherits all the security issues related to those technologies. Different attacks can be executed against smart farming systems, and node capture may alter or replace devices [176]. Denial of service and sleep-deprivation attacks deplete the batteries of IoT devices and disrupt data transmission, which means that decision-making processes are also disrupted [177]. Furthermore, for technical reasons, IoT sensors usually cannot be placed in protective boxes [175]. The installation and use of advanced smart farming systems require the intervention of experts. The uncertainty, the technical and operational feasibilities of the system are critical. With the use of sensors and IoT in smart farming, some issues related to security and data privacy arise. Indeed, when a device is connected, it can be the source of an attack. In addition, sensors have batteries with a limited lifespan and in the majority of cases the battery is not replaceable, i.e. the age of a sensor is that of its battery. This is why reducing energy consumption, recycling or waste disposal are important challenges. Smart farming may be applied in huge rural areas, where controlling the security of the whole location is challenging and expensive. Generally, security cameras on farms will be stationed at critical locations and access points, but it would be very challenging to ensure the security of every part of a farm. Attacks with consequences like flooding, the under-watering or over-watering of crops, and the misuse of pesticides are often described as agroterrorism, and agroterrorism may also be waged against food animal populations [175] [178]. Such actions can create fear, financial loss, and social disturbances. Rettore de Araujo Zanella et al. [175] stated that with the emergence of smart farming, new types of agroterrorism may appear, which can also be referred to as cyber-agroterrorism. Cyber-agroterrorism involves actions of attacking smart farming systems to cause serious financial and social damage. Security is thus very challenging for smart farms, as they face the possibility of both local physical attacks and online cyber-attacks. In smart farming, sensors, actuators and other technologic devices are exposed to climatic and natural events such as rain, snow, sun and hail. Animals, human, or agricultural machinery can damage or remove them from the installed locations. C. Knowledge The attitudes of farmers toward smart farming play crucial roles in the success and democratization of smart farming, especially since most farmers prefer to not take risks and continue with traditional farming practices [179]. The required skills and knowledge might represent a barrier for farmers that hinders them from adopting smart farming. In particular, attaining new skills and knowledge consumes both extra time and extra expenses. Researchers [180] [181] have agreed that training farmers would be an easy matter in developed countries where different types of advanced technology are already available and adopted by farmers. However, it is more difficult in developing countries, where most farms are in rural areas. Charania and Li [182] stated that smart farming reduces the need for labor. Therefore, in countries where unemployment is a problem, smart farming would constitute a threat to farm laborers. This may discourage laborers from cooperating and contributing to the success of such technology as it injects insecurity in terms of employment stability. D. Network and Data Transmission Transmitting data continuously to the cloud is an important task for smart farming systems. Subsequently, high-quality internet services with reliable bandwidth are mandatory. However, the largest percentage of farming zones are located in rural areas, where internet services are weaker than in urban zones, and this poses a serious challenge. If the network and/or internet is extremely unreliable and does not meet the minimum requirements of smart farming platforms, it is recommended to equip the platforms with local computers for data storage and decision-making processes rather than losing efficiency while sending a continuous stream of data over a weak network. However, this will make smart farming more expensive to implement [175]. The costs will increase upon including computers with adequate computational capacity and highly skilled employees may be required to operate the systems. The population is estimated at 9.7 billion by 2050, which requires improving agricultural mechanisms to increase food production and have high yields in a limited time. Moreover, agriculture is not limited to food production but constitutes the necessary raw materials in various sectors such as poultry, medicine, industrial, etc. We believe that the collection of new types of data such as water quality, citizens’ behaviors, degree of air pollution and geographical characteristics of agricultural areas (the spatio-temporal characteristic of the agricultural area and its topological relationship with water points and urban areas) combined with the knowledge of experts in the agricultural field constitute an essential source for understanding potential agricultural problems and finding potential solutions. Indeed, in the short term, new types of sensors will be used in agriculture with a large continuous automation and use of AI techniques. In the long term, the strategies for improving productivity and selecting agricultural products will become more widespread to solve global problems rather than local ones. Despite the major benefits smart farming offers to farmers, there is still a few things that demotivate them are mainly the lack of knowledge and costs associated. Some other general factors are as follows: Initial cost of investment into a smart environment such as hardware, software, configurations and training. Building a smart farm requires technical knowledge on choosing the appropriate smart devices, a reliable network infrastructure based on the characteristics of the farm, setting up and monitoring software packages to implement actions such as watering triggers, alarms and notifications. Missing this knowledge is associated with extra cost of maintenance. One of the main parts of the system is the smart energy. The solar agricultural market is still in the early stages of development and challenges related to technology costs, limited awareness of the benefits, lack of appropriate policy incentives and limited governmental subventions for farmers and suppliers who decide to use these technologies. Coping with climate change, soil erosion and biodiversity loss is a novel journey for the majority, which may lead to continuously changing on the smart farm infrastructure. Farmers need to meet global rising demand of higher quality food. They need to reduce their impact on the environment, increase the nutritional content of crops and minimize chemical residues, which also needs extra technologies. There is a trend of youth migration form rural areas into cities which makes it more difficult for farmers convincing and inspiring young people to stay and become future farmers. Encouraging and training farmers to use technologies in farming has become a policy priority in several counties. SECTION XI. Classification of Papers Table 7 provides the categorization of the reviewed publications in the three aforementioned dimensions. These findings show that IoT data collection, machine learning, and benefits for farmers are the focuses of a large percentage of the relevant publications in the literature. TABLE 7 Classification of Publications According to the Dimensions of Benefits, Challenges, and Methodologies SECTION XII. Comparison of Methodologies Machine learning, expert systems, and image processing methodologies are commonly used to solve various problems in the agricultural sector. Table 6 provides information about several recent applications of AI techniques for smart farming systems. For example, Shakeel et al. [183] proposed a deep learning-based classification algorithm for cow behavior recognition. Durai et al. [184] developed a system using the random forest classifier and deep learning algorithm to classify crops. They reported very promising results with accuracy of 95.45%. Decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, and random forest algorithms were used in mushroom classification by Rahman et al. [186] with accuracy of 100%. Other relevant algorithms used in recent works are given in Table 8. It shows that Junior et al. [185] have the best accuracy in the spectral, hierarchical, and DBSCAN clustering applications using decision tree and K-nearest neighbor algorithm compared with other machine learning algorithms. Sharma et al. provided a review of precision agriculture using machine learning algorithms to demonstrate that data-driven solutions in smart farms improve the productivity and quality of the products. In prediction of the crop growth K-neighbor’s classifier, Logistic Regression, Ensemble classifiers algorithms give very promising results. Linear regression algorithm is commonly used predict the production value for climate data such as rainfall, temperature and humidity. Deep learning algorithms are very successful for weed detection, image classification, image segmentation and object tracking in agricultural data. Neural network, k-nearest neighbors and Naïve Bayes classifier algorithms are used in insect recognition and classification. Experimental results show that accuracy is more than 90%. TABLE 8 Recent AI Techniques and Accuracy Rates in Smart Farming SECTION XIII. Conclusion Smart farming is a concept that involves handling and controlling farms using new technologies such as the IoT, robotics, drones, and AI to increase the quantity and quality of products while reducing the human labor required for production. These benefits will have positive effects on the profitability and the growth of the economy as population sizes are dramatically increasing worldwide. Therefore, researchers and scientists are moving toward the utilization of recently introduced IoT technologies in smart farming to help farmers use AI technology in the development of improved seeds, crop protection, and fertilizers. AI in agriculture is emerging in the three major areas of soil and crop monitoring, predictive analytics, and agricultural robotics. In this regard, farmers are rapidly beginning to use sensors and soil sampling to gather data to be used by farm management systems for further investigation and analysis. In this survey, we have studied many AI applications in the agricultural sector to investigate the various developments and solutions to improve the productivity of farms and solve some environmental problems encountered during the production of different types of products in agriculture. The AI models for farms help countries to maintain sustainability in this sector. We began with background on AI, which included a discussion of all AI methods utilized in the agricultural sector, such as machine learning, the IoT, expert systems, image processing, and computer vision. Second, a comprehensive literature review was presented, focusing on how researchers have utilized AI applications effectively in data collection by using sensors, utilizing smart robots, monitoring crops, and monitoring irrigation leakage. It was shown that quality, productivity, and sustainability are maintained while utilizing AI applications. Third, the benefits and challenges of AI applications were explored along with a comparison and discussion of several AI methodologies applied in smart farming. In this regard, considering the publications that were reviewed, it was concluded that machine learning, expert systems, and image processing methodologies are the most frequently used methodologies in the literature for solving problems in the agricultural sector. Smart farming technologies are emerging technologies that help countries to maintain sustainability in the agriculture sector, however, the research community should consider some research gaps and challenges that create new opportunities for researchers to conduct new research tracks using trusted, secure data, factors in climate changes and weather forecasting to improve productivity. A lot of research work effort has been conducted to use machine learning for the early detection of disease in farms. However, there is a limitation in this field due to disease infestation and therefore, new models should be developed for early prediction of diseases before the farm harvest is affected significantly. The research gaps and challenges explained above encourage researchers to work on these gaps and create new opportunities and direct- ions to conduct new research on various tracks as future work. In this survey, we have also discussed the most recent applications of AI methods in smart farming while focusing on which AI methods or algorithms are used and the accuracy rates that were obtained. Tables were provided to demonstrate the most recent AI techniques and the associated applications as well as the obtained accuracies and, researchers have obtained very promising results while utilizing AI methodologies effectively. In conclusion, this survey has provided in-depth descriptions of AI applications in smart farming. Therefore, due to the provided information, discussions, and comparisons given here, this survey will be a useful guide for researchers conducting research on AI applications in smart farming.

Abstract Crop health monitoring and weed removal are two crucial elements dictating efficient, productive and resilient cultivation. Due to frequent attacks by pest and pathogens, the crops become diseased resulting in degradation of the quality and quantity of the production. The process of continuous monitoring of crop health is challenging and requires the involvement of information and communication technologies (ICT). The outcome is precision agriculture where the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are vital ingredients. The design of an integrated approach of precision agriculture based on IoT and AI is discussed here which is tailored for real time crop health monitoring and performs various other operations like weed detection, ambient air sensing, watering the vegetation automatically at regular intervals of time, spraying of pesticides etc. The proposed system is a combination of an IoT formed using sensors and devices, image processing and machine learning (ML)/ deep learning (DL) techniques confined to the cultivation of fifteen varieties of beans found in India. The work involves two intelligent learning models configured to capture spatio-temporal attributes of image samples and sensor inputs and for real time discrimination between healthy and diseased bean leaves, detection of weeds growing around the cultivation land and also for process control. The first approach employs a DL structure named EfficientNetB7 along with a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) while the second method adopts a VGG16 with an integrated attention mechanism. Also experiments have been carried out using benchmark ML classifiers like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) combined with feature extraction techniques. Segmentation methods have been used to separate out the diseased sections of the leaves which are then used as apriori labels for the classifiers to reinforce the previously known details of the bean varieties. Subsequently, the trained networks are tested with bean leaf samples collected from cultivation farms. Results show that our proposed DL models could accurately predict the health state of the bean leaves with less computation time. With an automated approach of bean leaf health discrimination, weed detection and process control, the cost effectiveness of the overall effort is enhanced. Further, the sensor pack also provides precise thresholds at which water sprinkling could be initiated resulting in water conservation.

Introduction Precision agriculture (PA) has become essential to increase productivity of traditional cultivation (Naik et al., 2022). Due to various factors like environment, pest and pathogens, soil etc. crop cultivation is severely affected which decrease their quality as well as the production quantity (Naik et al., 2022). It leads to severe financial loss and food crisis. In a recent report, it has been estimated that a sizeable percentage of the crop yields globally have been decreased due to pests and pathogens (CABI, 2022). Thus, it is has become essential that the farmers should be well equipped with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) technologies for proper monitoring of the health of the cultivated plants on regular basis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) in combination with Internet of Things (IoT) have become popular in agriculture due to several factors like continuous process monitoring, accurate control, quick decision making, automation, reliability etc(Jha et al., 2019). The use of AI tools is also beneficial since these are adaptive systems that can understand its surroundings, capture the relevant details and retain the knowledge to find solutions for the real world problems. AI is already triggering major transformations in the agriculture sector helping the farmers to cope up with several challenges like monitoring plant diseases, weed detection, identification and control of pest and pathogens, crop harvesting etc. with minimum loss of time (Jha et al., 2019). Further, AI approaches constituted by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) tools provide enough capability to handle real life challenges and demonstrate the ability to generate human like decision making (Hapsari et al., 2022) in case of agriculture. Over the years researchers have attempted several approaches for accurate plant disease identification and detection. Use of ML methods as part of precision agriculture including plant disease detection (Pantazi et al., 2019) has been widely reported. ML techniques like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Naive Bayes etc. have been extensively used (Rudagi et al., 2022) in agriculture. A technique for classification of rice disease has been developed using SVM like ML algorithms (Maione et al., 2018). Pantazi et al. have developed a system for detection of yellow rust disease in wheat leaves using hyper spectral imaging data and SVM technique (Pantazi et al., 2019). In another study, the authors (Binch and Fox, 2017) have reported a method for crop and weed detection using SVM technique. Three different wheat disease detection methods using Naïve Baye's classifier have been reported by (Johannes et al., 2017). In another approach, an ANN model has been used (Johann et al., 2016) for crop monitoring and estimation of soil parameters. An ANN based system for weed detection using multispectral images captured by unmanned aircraft system (UAS) has been reported in (Kashefi et al., 2017). These ML approaches could provide satisfactory results but it has been observed that the efficiency of these models decline significantly as the size (Sibiya et al., 2019) and diversity (Sibiya et al., 2019) of the data increases. Moreover, the manual process of feature extraction in a ML model is much time-consuming and erroneous at times which also act as a limitation of this class of techniques (Goodfellow et al., 2016). Thus, to overcome these crucial limitations, the attention shifted towards the DL models as alternatives to ML methods (Singh et al., 2020) Further it is also a part of the global trend of replacing ML approaches with DL techniques. DL being a specialized subset of the ML techniques enables a computerized set-up to thrive upon larger volumes of data, use a complex stage of objective driven in built feature extraction process and catalyze a tunable classifier block to demonstrate the ability of superior decision making while handling real life situations (Goodfellow et al., 2016). Further, due to the availability of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and other high performance architectures that can process huge volumes of raw data without the traditional feature extraction stage dependent on human intervention, Sutaji and Yildiz (2022) DL supports self- sustaining and continuous learning. Popularly, DL methods consist of two approaches: one is to develop the whole model from scratch and the other option is the adoption of transfer learning (TL) (Goodfellow et al., 2016). The former method is time consuming and requires a huge amount of data to train the network which is not always accessible (Shah et al., 2022). Thus, the latter method started to become attractive. Lately, transfer learning has turned out to be a process where the model is trained on a huge dataset and the knowledge acquired during the training is stored for solving similar task (Geron, 2019) and passed on to networks configured for identical chores. It popularized the pre-trained models (PTMs) that utilize the concept of transfer learning and accelerated their applications in a range of real world scenarios. The PTMs are emerging as efficient and expandable frameworks in solving many image classifications and computer vision problems (Shah et al., 2022) including those relevant to precision agriculture and ecological informatics. The PTMs reduce the time and effort considerably and offer a higher learning rate during training since the models are already accustomed for similar assignments (Geron, 2019). With the increasing popularity of the DL architectures, Convolution Neural Network (CNN) – a common DL architecture, has been explored extensively for precision agriculture with special focus on efficient plant disease detection and classification (Akram et al., 2017) (Ferentinos, 2018). As DL architectures evolved with time, models like VGG16, ResNet, DenseNet etc. have been successfully used for plant disease detection with higher classification accuracies (CA) (Chen et al., 2020). The Residual Neural Network (ResNet) has been fruitful in addressing the notorious vanishing gradient problem of the DL networks (Tool et al., 2019) and has been applied extensively in pattern recognition problems (Tool et al., 2019). Other CNN structures like DenseNet, SqueezeNet, Xception etc. have also been commonly used for plant disease detection (Yadav et al., 2021). CNN architectures like AlexNet, GoogleNet etc. have been explored for disease classification of different vegetables like tomato, potato, lady's finger, beans, spinach etc. (Yadav et al., 2021) (Pandey, 2022). As indicated above, there are many instances of different DL structures being adopted for accurate plant disease detection (Picon, 2019; Singh et al., 2020; Shah et al., 2022; Thi et al., 2022, Manjula et al., 2022). Another study reports a deep transfer learning method for Casava plant disease detection (Shah et al., 2022). Too et al. proposed a plant disease detection method using ResNet50, ResNet101 and InceptionV1 (Tool et al., 2019). Further, computer vision and ML/DL techniques have also been successfully explored in many plant disease detection applications (Traore et al., 2019), ResNet50 based classification of five crop diseases (Das et al., 2022), DenseNet and Inception nets for rice crop disease detection (Hapsari et al., 2022), papaya leaf disease detection using ResNet (Veeraballi, 2020), grape leaf disease detection using InceptionV1 and ResNetV2 (Xie et al., 2020), attention dense learning (ADL) mechanism for classification of leaf health conditions of non-identical plants (Akshay Pandey and Kamal Jain, 2021) etc. In another study, an IoT based system has been reported for remote checking of agriculture parameters (Nicola and Pisana, 2021). Asmita et al. reported the use of ML and DL techniques integrated with IoT for crop monitoring (Asmita Hobisiyashi, 2022). Joshi et al. proposed a CNN based system for detection of disease in mungo bean leaves (Rakesh et al., 2021). Another study involves a CNN aided work for disease detection in peach crops (Yadav et al., 2021). Gokulnath and Usha (2021) have proposed a method for plant disease identification using LF-CNN. Tiwari et al. proposed a work on multi class plant disease detection and classification using leaf images with a dense CNN (Tiwari et al., 2021). A DL approach for tomato leaf disease detection has been reported which employs EfficientNetB1 with different classifiers like RF and SVM (Chug et al., 2022). Sutaji and Yildiz (2022) have proposed MobileNetV2 and Xception models for prediction of plant diseases. Naik et al. have designed a squeeze and excitation based CNN model for chili leaf disease detection (Naik et al., 2022). Zan et al. have developed a CNN model named MatDet for tomato maturity detection and classification of tomato leaf diseases (Zan et al., 2022). Limei et al. have developed an R-CNN model for estimation of strawberry leaf scorch severity (Xia et al., 2022). Ali et al. have developed a DL based prediction model for plant disease identification (Hobisiyashi and Yadav, 2022). Olivia et al. have proposed a BLeafNet model for plant disease detection using leaf RGB images (Olivia et al., 2022). Mesut Togacar (2022) has proposed a method to detect weeds growing along with seedlings using DarkNet models and meta-heuristic algorithms. In another study, Bhagat et al. have proposed a method for plant leaf segmentation using Eff-UNet model (Bhagat et al., 2022). Olfa et al. (2023) proposed a DL based segmentation method for plant disease detection. Kaya et al. have proposed a multi head CNN model for identification of plant diseases using RGB images (Kaya et al., 2023). In another study, a DenseNet model is proposed for classification of maize disease (Wang et al., 2023a, Wang et al., 2023b). Vimal et al. have proposed a fine tuned CNN model for classification of beans plant leaf diseases (Vimal et al., 2023). The performances of these models have been evaluated using metrics like CA, precision, recall and F1 score. Several works also have used other metrics like sensitivity, specificity, type I and type II error, micro and macro F1 score to evaluate the performance of the models. The above works have discussed several dimensions related to precision agriculture, yet there are ample of opportunities to explore new approaches to develop effective solutions and lend a helping hand to the farming community. Further, there are sufficient scopes to formulate mechanisms for designing intelligent decision support and process control systems for more accurate detection and prediction of plant leaf health, weed detection, water sprinkling, conservation of resources, optimized use of chemicals for control of unwanted vegetation growth etc. Especially the improvements in performance that can be obtained by adopting innovative DL networks combined with computer vision methods and IoT set-ups in an integrated approach need to be explored. DL structures that can handle spatial and temporal variations in samples are expected to contribute towards better performance especially with real-time inputs. The CNN based structures are reliable in capturing spatial content of samples especially those from visual inputs but are inefficient in handling details with time varying characteristics (Goodfellow et al., 2016). For temporal attributes, recurrent structures like the long short term memory (LSTM) cells are considered to be efficient (Goodfellow et al., 2016). Especially, LSTMs configured in a two way processing mode called bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM) are regarded to be competent in capturing sequences and temporal variations (Goodfellow et al., 2016). Moreover, integrated and AI aided frameworks with the ability to extract spatial and temporal variations while employed for plant leaf health monitoring, weed detection and water sprinkling as per continuously captured on-field sensor data have relevance not only for the farming community but also for ecological conservation. Here, we discuss the design of an approach that extracts both spatial and temporal attributes of samples using a set-up that combines multiple DL methods and an IoT arrangement for application in precision agriculture and especially configured for the cultivation of several varieties of beans found in different parts of India. The system is designed to determine the status of the bean cultivation by looking into the health of the leaves, execute varied parameter monitoring and process control and segregate weed growth from the crop plantation. The main constituent of the system is a DL block formed by a CNN based EfficientNetB7 with a BiLSTM structure and a VGG16 with an attention layer. Here, the EfficientNetB7 and VGG16 capture the spatial contents while the BiLSTM and attention blocks deal with the temporal attributes of the input respectively. These two structures have been trained with images of fifteen varieties of bean leaves which are obtained from the “Beans” database. Further, these samples are augmented with the bootstrapping method and tested with actual samples collected during field visits to the bean cultivation farms. The performances of the networks are compared with that obtained from SVM, RF, KNN, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN). Moreover, physiological attributes of the leaves are captured using features like Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Local Binary Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (LBGLCM) while extracted sections (region of interest (ROI)) of the leaves in healthy and diseased forms are obtained using a few segmentation techniques including Fuzzy C-Means clustering (FCM) for extracting labels. These ROIs are used as targets during the training of the classifiers. The above ML/ DL methods are trained and the best approach is determined from a series of validation cycles. Further, on-field testing is carried out with samples collected using near infrared (NIR) camera. Subsequently, data from soil moisture sensor, temperature sensor and humidity sensor are connected to a processing node with WiFi access which forms an IoT pack for continuous monitoring. The system accepts camera and sensor inputs to provide discrimination decision regarding plant health, weed growth and also triggers process controls activities like watering the plants. The proposed DL models have consistently demonstrated accuracies around 96%‐98% along with several statistical parameters indicating satisfactory levels of reliabilities. The performances of the proposed approaches are also compared with previously reported works in the area of precision agriculture and ecological informatics. Also, the computation complexity of the proposed models has been analyzed to validate the ability of the approaches in solving complex problems with better response times. The proposed systems can be integrated to UAS such as drones to monitor large patches of agricultural land. Further, an impact analysis of the work has been carried out by certain on-field experiments and the outcomes are discussed with linkages to ecological and resource conservation. The rest of the paper is categorized as follows: In Section 2, certain aspects related to the materials used and methodology adopted as part of the work have been discussed. Design details are covered in Section 3. Experimental results and discussion are presented in Section 4. Section 5 concludes the manuscript. 2. Materials and methodology Here we provide the details of the materials used and methodology adopted as part of the work including a short discussion on related considerations. 2.1. Related considerations Fifteen varieties of beans (kidney beans, black beans, cranberry beans, chickpeas, lima beans, soyabean, red beans, mung beans etc.) are grown in India which requires tropical and subtropical higher temperatures (20 to 30 degree centigrade), humidity for plant growth with fruiting during winter and takes around three months from germination. It supplies green pods through winter and spring in loam soil but grows well in alkaline and saline soils tolerating pH value up to 8.5. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is used to quantify the health of the bean leaf. The NDVI is a measure to find the amount of green vegetation a land contains (Vido et al., 2020). It works on the principle that healthy vegetation reflects more of visible light compared to unhealthy vegetation. NDVI can be calculated using Eq. (1) (1) For continuous monitoring of plants, several sensors are required that are connected and operated in a uniform platform constituting an IoT. IoT is an arrangement of certain devices and sensors that collect, processes and transmits the data to another arrangement through the Internet or using any other network (Almadhor and Rauf, 2021). With an IoT arrangement, ML/DL components can be integrated for constituting an efficient decision making system. A simple arrangement of an IoT network connected with a DL based decision support system (DL-DSS) and process control is shown in Fig. 1.

Image segmentation is an important aspect of the work used to extract the ROIs from the samples. This work adopts K-Means clustering (KMC), Fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) and Region Growing methods (Goodfellow et al., 2016) along with feature extraction to capture physiological attributes of the bean leaf samples. Feature extraction methods like GLCM, LBP and LBGLCM have been explored for studying the leaf samples (Ramesh et al., 2018). GLCM studies the spatial relationship among the pixels and is a second order statistical texture analysis method (Ramesh et al., 2018). A schematic of the feature extraction process using GLCM has been depicted in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res image (261KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Process of feature extraction necessary for the classifiers. Using GLCM, we have analyzed a set of features like energy, homogeneity, contrast and correlation which are useful in obtaining the details of the texture of the input images (Ramesh et al., 2018). The LBP features describe the statistical and structural model of an image. Further, the LBP and GLCM features are combined to generate the LBGLCM feature which is helpful in studying the composition of an image. Energy, Homogeneity, Contrast, Entropy and Correlation are some of the attributes that are captured by the combined LBP and GLCM feature set (Ramesh et al., 2018). Some of the benchmark classifiers used is CNN, SVM, MLP, TDNN, RF, etc. Further, we have used certain PTMs like Resnet152, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 and proposed the EfficientNetB7 with BiLSTM and VGG16 with an attention mechanism that also have the abilities to carry out efficient disease detection, weed identification and process control. 2.2. Proposed methodology The block diagram of the complete work is summarized in Fig. 1. As already indicted above, the main constituent of the system is a DL block formed by two separate frameworks. The first one is formed using a CNN based EfficientNetB7 with a BiLSTM network and the second one consists of a VGG16 with an attention layer. These two structures have been trained with fifteen varieties of bean leaves. A sizeable portion of the samples are obtained from the “Beans” database (Makerere AI Lab, January 2020) which is augmented with bootstrapping method. The performances of these networks are compared with that obtained from SVM, RF, KNN, MLP and TDNN classifiers. The performances of each of these classifiers are compared for ascertaining the most effective method for performing the stated objectives. Further, physiological attributes of the bean leaves are captured using features like GLCM, LBP and LBGLCM while extracted sections of the leaves in healthy and diseased forms are obtained using image segmentation. Fuzzy clustering is used for obtaining apriori labels for the classifiers. After these discrimination methods are trained, the best approach is determined from a series of validation cycles and then on-field testing is carried out with samples collected using NIR camera. The system accepts camera and sensor inputs to provide discriminator decision regarding plant health, weed growth and also triggers process controls activities like watering the plants at regular intervals of time. The proposed DL models have consistently demonstrated accuracies around 96%–98% along with several statistical parameters indicating satisfactory levels of accuracy. As already reported, a DL-DSS has been designed for real time monitoring of the health of the crops, weed detection and process control using AI and IoT as shown in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (227KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Expanded depiction of the proposed approach of precision agriculture. Leaf images of different bean species have been collected during visits to cultivation farms. A few of them are shown in Fig. 4. About 600 leaf images of different bean species have been captured by the NIR camera during visits to cultivation farms. Data bootstrapping techniques have been used to increase the number of training samples. This process enhances the learning efficiency of the DL network and other classifiers. Further, KMC, FMC and Region Growing methods have been used to extract and analyze the diseased region of the non-healthy bean leaves. Feature extraction has been performed using GLCM and LBP which captures the texture of an image through its pixel values. Features like energy, homogeneity, contrast, correlation etc. are obtained with the help of the GLCM matrix. These features are then used to study the physiological attributes of the leaf images. Classification is performed using ML classifiers like SVM, RF, KNN, MLP and TDNN along with the two proposed deep learning models EfficientNetB7-BiLSTM and VGG19 with attention for real time monitoring of the crop plants. Only the ML classifiers use the features extracted manually. In case of the DL models, the manually extracted features supplement the inbuilt feature extraction mechanism. Further, as the system is trained to discriminate between bean plants and weeds, it contributes towards demarcation of actual and wasteful growth. The IoT based framework continuously gathers data regarding the health of the plants and other environmental conditions. The collected information is sent to the cloud for storage in a database which can be easily accessed by the farmers through mobile app. Download : Download high-res image (356KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4.

In the subsequent sections, the details of each of the proposed methods are presented. 3. Design details of the proposed models The main constituent of the system is a DL block formed by two separate frameworks. Each of these two frameworks is discussed in details. 3.1. Proposed DL Model I (EfficientNetB7 with a BiLSTM) This model employs an EfficientNetB7 with a BiLSTM for performing operations like deep feature extraction, multi-class image classification using segments of bean leaf samples extracted from a frame, detect weed growth and also trigger process controls activities like watering the plants at regular intervals of time. This model has three modules: pre-processing, deep feature extraction and multi-class classification as shown in Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res image (263KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Architecture of the proposed model I. 3.1.1. EfficientNet The EfficientNet is trained on the ImageNet database that contains about 15 million labeled images of different categories (Thi et al., 2022). This network uniformly scales the three most important parameters, the depth, width and resolution through a compound coefficient. The EfficientNet has been effectively used in image processing task as a SOTA technique (Thi et al., 2022). The number of layers in any network is determined by the requirements of a given complex problem. The EfficientNet has different baseline networks starting from B0 to B7. With a layer of 237 B0 baseline network has the lowest number of layers whereas the B7 network has the highest number of layers 837 (Thi et al., 2022). As already mentioned, the EfficientNet B7 captures the spatio attributes of the samples. 3.1.2. BiLSTM A BiLSTM model consists of two LSTMs: one taking the input in the forward path and the other in the backward flow (Yang et al., 2019) while facilitating processing in both directions. LSTM is a kind of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) where the output from the last step is fed as input to the current step. LSTMs are much preferred over RNN due to their ability to grasp the vanishing gradient problem and process samples with temporal attributes (Goodfellowet al. 2016; Yang et al., 2019). The LSTM has a structure containing four learning layers and different memory blocks called cells. The structure consists of three gates namely: forget gate, input gate and output gate. Each gate performs its unique function. The inputs are fed to the network through the input gate which plays the role of adding useful information using appropriate function and preserving the relevant information. The forget gate discards all the unwanted information and finally, the output gate retains all the relevant information from the current cell state, which is then send to the next cell after point wise multiplication. This way the input flows in one direction only in a LSTM network. This process is not always suitable for certain classification tasks which require both forward and backward contextual relationship for efficiency (Goodfellow et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2019). Thus, to overcome this limitation, a single layer stack of BiLSTM is used in our work which consists of two distinct hidden layers to model the input in both the forward and backward direction. The BiLSTM layer deals with the temporal attributes of the samples, retains and circulates the contextual content throughout the network. The output of the BiLSTM, then passes through the fully connected (FC) layers and finally moves to the softmax classifier at the output layer. 3.1.3. Working of the proposed Model I The input images are first normalized and resized to a fixed dimension of 224 × 224 × 3 to reduce computation complexity. These input images are then fed to the EfficientNetB7 where each of the input images is processed through a stack of 813 layers followed by a BiLSTM layer. The EfficientNetB7 then generates an output of feature vectors of 7 × 7 × 2560 dimensions for each image. These feature vectors are fed as input to the BiLSTM network to execute the training and extract the spatio-temporal attributes of the samples. Thereafter, the flattening layer is added to convert the vectors to a 1-dimensional vector. A dropout layer is added immediately after the flattening layer with a dropout rate of 30% to prevent the model from over fitting. While we have experimented with various dropout rates such as 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, efficient results have been obtained with a dropout of 30% (value = 0.3). The speed-up of the computation of the EfficientNetB7 is attributed to the optimized structure and learning achieved using the dynamic architectural trimming which is facilitated by this dropout mechanism. The next layer is the dense layer consisting of 4096 neurons with Rectified Linear Activation (ReLU). Finally, the network has the softmax layer with three neurons representing three different classes (angular leaf spot, bean rust and healthy). The training is supervised and is carried out using the apriori labels obtained from the segmented ROI's of the bean leaves. The configuration of the proposed model is provided in the Table 1.

Proposed Model II (VGG16 with an attention layer) The second proposed model is based on a pre-trained CNN named VGG16 integrated with an attention mechanism. The attention mechanism has been integrated at each stage of the network for learning of the class features with greater focus so as to enhance the feature awareness and ensure spatio-temporal extraction of the relevant details. The schematic is shown in Fig. 7. Download : Download high-res image (305KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Architecture of the Proposed Model II. 3.2.1. VGG16 The VGG16 with 16 layers is trained on the ImageNet dataset (over 15 million images of 1000 different classes) (Ashish et al., 2020). The architecture of VGG16 consists of small convolution filters with each hidden layers using ReLU activation function. Finally, the network works with three fully connected layers where the first two layers have 4096 channels and the third layer has 1000 channels for each class. In our work, the VGG16 has been integrated with multiple attention layers each reinforcing the class details allowing effective training to take place. The attention layer is required to ensure precise focus on specific parts of a sequence when processing a large assortment of data. In DL, the use of attention mechanism helps the network in remembering long sequences of data for a longer period of time (Goodfellow et al., 2016). The illustration of the attention mechanism is shown in Fig. 8. Download : Download high-res image (321KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Illustration of the attention mechanism. In Fig. 5 [X] is the input, [Y] is the output, Yt is the target (apriori ROI segmented out of the leaf samples) and μ1, μ2 …μn are the alignment scores. There are two rows of LSTM cells which are grouped with processing sequence going from the forward to the backward direction and vice-versa. The output of these two channels of LSTM cells are combined and weighted with alignment scores which are then compared with the target vector Yt. The difference or error vector drives the learning process of the attention mechanism and a gradient descent process is updated till the goals are met. 3.2.2. Implementation of the proposed Model II Similar to the proposed Model I, here also the input RGB images are normalized to reduce the computational complexity of the system and then resized to a fixed dimension of 224 × 224 × 3. Next, these pre-processed images are passed through the usual layers of the VGG16 network having 13 convolution layers and three fully connected layers. At the indicated stages, the attention mechanisms are implemented for detailed learning of the class features and embedding these into the training process of the network. This way identical numbers of attention layers for the three classes are implemented. Finally, the classifier section is put in place which is constituted by the softmax activation function with three neurons. The configuration of the proposed model is shown in Table 2. The softmax activation function is defined as follows: (2) Table 2. Details of network configuration and parameters of the Proposed Model II.

Experimental environment and computation The proposed models have been implemented in Python using Keras application programming interface (API) that runs on top of Google's Tensor Flow open source library (Geron, 2019). The Google Colab integrated development environment (IDE) is used for writing and implementing the Python codes for the proposed deep learning models. A computer system with Intel i7 processor and 16 GB RAM has been used as the host setup. 3.4. Design of an IoT based framework for on-field testing The proposed framework comprises of temperature, humidity and soil moisture sensors for gathering the required information contributing to the productivity of the farming land. These sensors are then directly connected with the Arduino UNO board. An application has been designed using the Blync app that sends the collected information to the cloud stage for further investigation. Further, we have used ThingSpeak platform for data presentation and analysis for visualization of real data captured using the IoT platform. Schematic of the proposed framework is depicted in Fig. 9. Download : Download high-res image (117KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. IoT framework. The sensors are connected to the Arduino board and the output is directly forwarded to the server, which is then saved automatically in the database of the app. The DHT11 sensor is used to obtain the temperature and humidity values. Moreover, since our proposed system is designed to work in hot and humid conditions, this sensor is a proper choice to obtain the temperature details. The soil moisture sensor helps in moisture sensing by measuring the water content in the soil. The sensor has advantages like anti-rusting property and has a long power life.

Block diagram showing the connections of the different sensors forming the IoT set-up. The Arduino UNO collects the real-time data from different sensors and integrates them enabling automated decision making and control of the motors driving the processes whenever required. LEDs are used to indicate the working status of the sensors. The red LED placed near the sensor indicates any technical fault in the system whilethe green LED indicates the working condition of the system. The data gathered from the sensors is sent to the ThingSpeak platform and the mobile app. The flowchart of the proposed system is shown in Fig. 11. For testing our proposed system, we visited a few bean cultivation farms and gathered leaf samples of fifteen different bean species found in India like kidney beans, black beans, cranberry beans, chickpeas, lima beans, soyabean, red beans, mung beans etc. It was observed that our proposed systems can efficiently discriminate between healthy and non-healthy bean leaves as well as accurately detect common bean diseases like bean rust and angular leaf spot in the leaves. Further, the system is also able to predict environmental parameters and identify land areas having weeds and cultivable land.

DSS for weed control The proposed system is trained to detect weed and bean crop. Initially we took samples of the weed and the bean cultivation land and labeled them. The labeled samples are used to train the classifier (VGG-16) to identify the weed area and crop section. This ability of the classifier will help the farmer to mark the region of the plot of land where weed removal measures can be taken. It has been recorded that at least 37 types of weeds grow around fifteen types of bean cultivations in India. Weeds suck the nutrients of the soil making it infertile. Hence, proper weed detection is a crucial attribute of the proposed system. It contributes towards lowering of accidental mechanical cutting of bean plants assuming to be weed growth. Further, with proper identification of wild growth, control spreading of weed removing chemicals can be carried out which protects the fertility of the land and also saves the bean leaves from damage. 3.6. Fertilizer and disinfectant spreading The IoT-DSS has been programmed to demonstrate the spreading of fertilizer and disinfectant at multiple locations where and when required. This process is expected to assist the farmers as a measure to pest control for healthy cultivation. 4. Experimental results A series of experiments have been performed to validate the work and check the reliability of our proposed system. The experimental parameters are summarized in Table 3. Initial steps like noise removal, normalization, resizing have been performed as a part of the pre-processing procedure. After pre-processing, feature extraction using GLCM, LBP and LBGLCM has been carried out. Features like homogeneity, energy, contrast, correlation and entropy are considered to analyze the texture of the processed images. The GLCM analysis the statistical measures from the images. Different classifiers like SVM, TDNN, RF, MLP and KNN have been used for image classification. Further, we created a graphical user interface (GUI) for carrying the required experiments. After image pre-processing, as shown in Fig. 12, segmentation has been performed using FCM and KMC techniques. Two important parameters namely Intersection over Union (IOU) (Eq. (3)) and Pixel Accuracy (PA) (Eq. (4)) are utilized to establish the reliability of our system spatial domain. IOU is an important measurement that indicates how accurately the system performs while pixel accuracy is calculated to observe the number of correctly classified pixels. Further, the segmentation accuracy (Acc) is also calculated through pixel to pixel match. Table 4 shows the results (IoU, Acc and PA) obtained from FMC, KMC and Region Growing segmentation methods when extracting ROIs using SVM, RF, KNN, MLP and TDNN. It can be clearly observed that FMC-TDNN is the most reliable combination in terms of Acc, IOU and PA. (3) (4) Table 3. Experimental Parameters.

It can be observed that the GLCM-SVM and GLCM-TDNN gives the best results but as TDNN is trainable and robust under varied conditions, the GLCM-TDNN combination is used for benchmarking. Table 5.

The results have been derived using GLCM features and FCM segmentation techniques. It has been observed that while the learning based methods provide reliability still the performance cannot be extended beyond certain limits. Further, with diversity in the content, the reliability suffers, which clearly indicates the limitations of ML based approaches. Hence, a set of experiments have been carried out using DLbased methods. Table 6. Summary of Performance Metrics of Different Classifiers.

The performance has been achieved in 100 epochs which indicates the framework is computationally efficient in completing the training in less amount of time. It has been observed that initially the training starts with some fluctuations but reaches satisfactory performance levels without taking high numbers of epochs. During the first 20 epochs, the accuracy of the model with both train and test data reaches the mid 80's and 90's in percentage range. This clearly indicates the proposed model EfficientNetB7 with BiLSTM has capacity of fast processing. The epochs are further extended to see where the model's performance saturates. It was observed that beyond 20 epochs, the performance shows no major improvement. This plot is obtained from average values of hundred trials using training and testing data.

Table.8shows the computation load associated with our proposed models and the PTMs that are used as benchmark methods. The performance associated with 100 epoch cycles has been presented in Table 8. It has been found that EfficientNetB7 with BiLSTM takes about 1100 s to complete with 11 s per epoch, which is over 35% better compared to the VGG16 with attention layer based approach. Compared to Resnet152, the proposed model I is computationally two times less demanding and compared to MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3 it is about 2.18 and 2.54 times more efficient respectively. This clearly indicates the advantage of the EfficientNetB7 based method. The specific model parameters of both the approaches are shown in Table 9. With learning rate of 0.001, Adam optimizer, 30% dropout rate and batch size of 32, categorical cross entropy used as the loss function to run training cycles of 100 epochs, the proposed approaches appear reliable, robust and efficient.

Further, the two proposed approaches perform better than a number of PTMs like ResNet152, MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3 as shown in Table.7. 4.1. Performance comparison with existing SOTA models The performance of the proposed models has been compared with the existing SOTA models to understand how well our system performed in accurate detection of plant diseases. Comparison of performance of our proposed approaches has been shown in Table.10. Table.11 summarizes the comparison results of the existing models in literature employed for image based plant disease detection with our proposed models using only Bean leaves. The performance of the system designed using the EfficientNetB7 with BiLSTM and VGG16 with an integrated attention mechanism have been compared with that obtained using SVM, RF, KNN, MLP and TDNN. Subsequently, the trained network has been tested on real field samples collected using an IoT based approach which also monitors temperature, humidity and soil moisture. Further, experiments have also been performed using some existing CNNs like ResNet152, MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3. Results show that our proposed DL models could classify healthy and diseased bean leaves with accuracy of 96% and 98%respectively using less computation time. Further, our proposed models outperform some existing models in literature like VirLeafNet (Rakesh et al., 2021), DADCNN-5 (Akshay and Kamal, 2022) and R-CNN (Zan et al., 2022) that have been employed for classification and identification of plant leaf diseases and are related to ecological informatics. Furthermore, the average processing time of a single bean leaf image is 0.011 s demonstrated by our proposed approach which is less than the processing time utilized by some existing models for plant disease detection (Rakesh et al., 2021) and (Ramesh et al., 2018). 4.2. Impact analysis and discussion The impact analysis of the proposed approach is presented in terms of reliability of identification of bean leaf health, weed detection and water sprinkling compared to the tasks executed by a few human volunteers (of three different experience categories). An area of 20 ft × 20 ft with about 400 bean plants nurtured in certain number of rows is considered for the study. Each row has a sensor pack consisting of air quality sensor (MQ135), temperature and humidity sensor (DHT11) and soil moisture sensor connected to a few Arduino UNO boards which are linked up to a host computer using Wi-Fi access. Further, a NIR camera with a Wi-Fi module is placed over a slider arrangement laid at a height of 5 ft that can be mechanically moved over each row. This arrangement (sensor pack and the NIR camera) is used as the data capture block to feed samples to the two proposed approaches and subjected to performance evaluation for identification of bean leaf health, weed detection, ascertaining air quality and soil moisture condition and initiation of water sprinkling. The above performances are compared with that obtained using human volunteers (of three different experience categories). The first category is a volunteer with about one year bean cultivation experience with knowledge of the requirements but with temporary involvement with the effort. The second and third categories of volunteers have adequate knowhow about bean cultivation, have been involved continuously with the process for over two years and are regularly associated. The data have been compiled over a period of seven days and is summarized in Table.12. Table 12. Summary results of performance evaluation of the proposed system in terms of accuracy compared to human observers. Sl no.

A factor that appears to be obvious is the fact that continuous monitoring of agricultural produce is strength of automation frameworks and is not convenient for human beings. While bean leaf health identification and weed detection at microscopic level can be meticulously carried out by the proposed sensor pack integrated to the AI aided decision support system, the same turns out to be highly repetitive and tedious tasks for a human where errors are likely to take place. This is established by the fact that human errors are between 37% and 15% when compared with the proposed approach 1 while it is between 38% and 16% for the proposed approach 2. The most experience human volunteer notches up average accuracies of around 80% which is at least 15% less than the AI based methods. With lower errors in monitoring and timely human intervention, the possibility of rise in productivity and decrease in financial involvement are the logical spinoffs despite the fact that an automated system is likely to suffer breakdown at times and are constrained by availability of uninterrupted electricity supply, hermetically tight packaging and flexible deployment to prevent damage of the components due to environment factors etc. While bean leaf health identification is crucial for better productivity of a plot of land, more important is early detection of the disease affecting the plants and timely intervention. An early detection is possible by the application of the proposed approaches and timely measures to reduce the loss can be initiated. The monitoring and detection process can be executed in a continuous manner with very little human involvement except while initiating the measures to use medicines to reduce the leaf diseases. Similarly, weed growth can be a major challenge for the cultivators during the initial and subsequent periods as it perennially threatens to encroach on the resources earmarked for the bean farming Togacar, 2022). Weeds are unwanted growth that invades the cultivation land and damage the food crops. Moreover, accurate detection of weed and demarcation of such areas can lower contamination due to unregulated spraying of chemicals for weed control and prevent damage to the fertile land. Further, precise demarcation of weed filled areas can also help the farmers to use mechanical means of weed cutting which can prevent damage to the bean cultivation and the fertile land due to use of chemicals for removal of the unwanted vegetation growth. This is pertinent due to the fact that over 37 different types of weeds like pig weed, crab grass, goose grass etc. are observed around bean cultivation areas in India. Weeds always threaten to deprive the bean crops from adequate amount of sunlight, nutrients, water (Togacar, 2022). Moreover, many weeds are also host of plant disease organisms (Gokulnath and Usha, 2021). Hence an automated approach for weed detection is an essential tool for the farmers. With an automated approach of bean leaf health identification and weed detection, the volume of irrelevant manpower required can be reduced which increases the cost effectiveness of the overall effort. In addition to the above, the execution time is short and the decision making of the proposed approaches is fast and reliable which is not possible in all cases to be matched by personnel employed for the purpose. The sensor pack provides precise thresholds at which water sprinkling could be initiated. It helps in preventing water wastage as well. The accurate timings and amount of water sprinkling might be not always maintained with human involvement. In view of the above, the role of an AI assisted agriculture system configured for bean cultivation working in complementary supplementary roles to the human cultivator is widespread and its impact on the cultivation process and the surrounding ecology shall be far-reaching. 5. Conclusion The proposed system is a combination of IoT devices, image processing techniques and ML/DL based systems applied as part of a precision agriculture setup related to several varieties of bean species found in India. In this work, we have proposed two DL models for real time detection of healthy and non-healthy (diseased) bean leaves, weeds growing around the cultivation land and monitoring of related environment parameters and controlled sprinkling of water. The first approach uses EfficientNetB7 along with a BiLSTM layer and the second approach employs VGG16 with an integrated attention mechanism. Further, experiments have been carried using SVM, RF, KNN, MLP and TDNN using features GLCM, LBP and LBGLCM to capture physiological attributes of the bean leaf samples which in combination with different segmentation methods separates the diseased areas of the leaves. These are then used as apriori labels for the classifiers to reinforce the previously known details of the bean varieties. Subsequently, the trained network is tested using samples collected during visits to bean cultivation farms. Moreover, experiments have also been performed using some existing CNNs like ResNet152, MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3. The proposed methods have been compared with existing SOTA techniques and it has been observed that our proposed DL models could classify healthy and diseased bean leaves with accuracy 1–7% better than the existing methods. Our proposed models I and II consistently demonstrated classification accuracies of 96% and 98% respectively. The computational framework of the proposed models has also been analyzed and we observed that the computation time of models I and II have been 11 s and 17sper epoch respectively. Also, the processing time of a single bean leaf image is 0.011 s. Compared to other PTMs, our proposed models are found to be computationally less demanding. This clearly highlights the computational efficiency of our proposed models. These systems can be integrated to UAVs for extensive crop monitoring in large patches of agricultural land in less amount of time. The key novelty of the work is an AI aided accurate and efficient decision support mechanism that reliably identifies bean leaf disease, recognizes weed growth with proper demarcation of the area under bean cultivation, continuous monitoring of the ambient conditions and air which triggers regulated water sprinkling. With continuous and automated monitoring of the health state of the bean leaves, the farmer obtains considerable support to enhance productivity. The weed monitoring helps to prevent encroachment of nutrients by wild growth and ensures better output from the bean cultivation. With weed area demarcation, use of mechanical means to remove the wild grass prevents chemical contamination of the fertile land. Controlled sprinkling of water prevents waste of a precious commodity like water. Further, the continuous monitoring of the air enables the farmers to visualize the best ambiance for seed germination and growth. In view of the above, the proposed system is expected to have decisive impact not only in assisting the farmer to enhance productivity but also to contribute towards ecological preservation.

Abstract Earlier, researchers have employed computer vision-based automatic fruit detection to estimate coffee yield at the time of harvest, however, studies on the on-plant quantification of the coffee fruit are scarce. In this study, the latest version of the state-of-the-art algorithm YOLOv7 (You Only Look Once) was used for the first time. YOLOv7 was trained with 324 annotated images of fruit bearing coffee branches followed by its evaluation with 82 annotated images as validation data (supervised method) and then tested through raw images (unannotated) as test data. Meanwhile, the K-means models were trained which led to machine-generated color classes of coffee fruit for semi-supervised image annotation. Consequently, the developed model efficiently analyzed the test data with an mAP@.5 (mean average precision) of 0.89. Strikingly, our innovative semi-supervised method with an mAP@.5 of 0.77 for multi-class mode surpassed the supervised method which had mAP@.5 of only 0.60, leading to faster and more accurate annotation. While testing the yield estimation of the model in two plots, an average error of 3.78% was recorded between the predicted (pre-harvest) and ground truth (harvest) data for binary class mode. The average error for multi-class data was recorded as 3.87% for green, 3.445% for green-yellow, 5.09% for cherry-raisin, and 2.51% for dry fruits. This AI-based technology when integrated with other tools such as UAV would efficiently remotely monitor coffee field for informed decision about irrigation, fertilizer application and other measures of timely field management, hence advancing precision agriculture. Moreover, this machine learning intelligent model can be tailored for various other fruit farming.

Introduction Coffee is a highly traded commodity globally ranking second only to oil in terms of traded value (FAO, 2023). The crop is a major contributor to the socio-economic development of tropical developing countries, with millions of people globally depending on it for their livelihoods. Aside from its contribution to agricultural GDP, coffee production is a significant employer and supports poverty alleviation (Chemura et al., 2016; Läderach et al., 2017). Thus, coffee cultivation is considered an avenue for realizing several of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as generating income, creating rural employment, and poverty alleviation (FAO, 2023). Coffee cultivation takes place in over 60 countries, primarily in tropical regions that are conducive to its growth. Brazil, Vietnam, and Colombia are the leading producers worldwide, with Brazil alone accounting for 36% of global coffee production (USDA), while the U.S, Brazil and Europe are its top consumers. Additionally, coffee plantations, especially shaded farms, provide crucial ecosystem services such as biodiversity conservation (Jha et al., 2014), carbon sequestration (van Rikxoort et al., 2014), and soil protection (Meylan et al., 2017). The coffee market is subject to recurrent supply-demand imbalances and uneven income distribution along the value chain. The global exports of coffee were recorded 10.88 million bags by December 2022 (ICO, 2023). Per data provided by the International Coffee Organization (ICO) in 2023, global coffee production was estimated to have reached 169.34 million bags, with each bag weighing 60 kg, signifying a decline of 2.2% compared to the previous year. In 2021, Brazil suffered a 21.7% drop in coffee production, which amounted to an estimated 67.2 million bags due to weather-associated factors such as drought and frost. The sustainability of coffee bean production and the impact of climate change are key sources of uncertainty for the coffee industry. Climatic conditions, especially during the vegetative and reproductive phases of the coffee plant, significantly influence coffee yield (Tavares et al., 2018). Rising temperatures and precipitation shortages affect flowering, fruiting, and bean quality. Furthermore, climate variability is a key factor influencing the incidence of severe pests and diseases such as coffee leaf rust and coffee berry borer, which can decrease coffee yield and quality and increase production costs (Krishnan, 2017). Globally, Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora, commonly referred to as Arabica and Robusta coffees respectively, constitute approximately 99% of the coffee production (Jayakumar et al., 2017). The quality of beans and yield of both species declines when outside these optimal temperature ranges (18-22°C for Arabica, while 22-28°C for Robusta), suggesting significant sensitivity to climatic changes (Magrach and Ghazoul, 2015). Therefore, from a socio-economic standpoint, it is crucial to comprehend the degree of climate-driven impacts on coffee production and the advantages of potential adaptation strategies to maintain and enhance coffee productivity and profitability while sustaining the livelihoods of smallholder producers globally. To protect coffee farms from adverse climatic conditions, keep a sustainable production and even enhance coffee yield and productivity, coffee farms demand continuous monitoring of every aspect. Nonetheless, the phenomenon of asynchronous flowering poses a significant challenge for coffee growers, leading to irregular fruit ripening (López et al., 2021). Consequently, this causes problems during the harvesting process, as careful attention must be paid to ensure optimal timing. Oftentimes, for quality coffee production, coffee farmers resort to the practice of lapsed harvesting, wherein they must wait for the next batch of cherries to ripen before harvesting. This approach is not only time-consuming but also labor-intensive, requiring frequent visits and manual screening of the fruits. It is important to note that the quality of coffee is largely dependent on the ripeness of the fruits (Thompson et al., 2012). Coffee fruits, commonly referred to as red cherries, undergo a color transformation during the ripening process (Haile and Kang, 2019). The term \"red cherry\" is used to describe the fruit's epidermis when it achieves a uniform and intense red color at full ripeness, having progressed through various shades of green, orange, and pink. Overripe cherries turn dark violet, while the presence of green, overripe, or dry cherries in the harvested mass negatively impacts the quality of the beverage and subsequently, its value in the international market (Velásquez et al., 2019). In particular, the proportion of green cherries in the harvested mass can significantly affect the beverage's acidity. To maintain high-quality standards and command a premium price, it is crucial to ensure that at least 98% of the harvested cherries are fully ripe (Leroy et al., 2006). In the current landscape, the adoption of new technologies and innovation is imperative for the beverage industry to increase productivity and competitiveness. To this end, the scientific community is making significant efforts to develop automatic systems that can enhance the inspection process. Numerous studies have already been conducted, resulting in the development of various applications that have improved for example sorting processes for different fruits and vegetables (Hameed et al., 2018). Technological advancements in precision agriculture play a vital role in obtaining accurate and reliable measurements for crop monitoring. Precision agricultural practices can enhance the potential of a region to produce crops with higher yield and quality at less cost. Remote sensing has emerged as a promising technology for coffee management, with studies demonstrating its efficacy in evaluating coffee leaf rust levels through the use of Sentinel 2 sensor and Random Forest (RF) algorithms combined with vegetation indices, as described earlier (Chemura et al., 2017). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (Sultana et al., 2020) are a type of deep learning model that are inspired by the human visual system and consist of multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. The input layer of a CNN takes in the input data, which could be an image, and passes it through a series of convolutional and pooling layers. The convolutional layers apply convolution operations to the input data to extract features such as edges, corners, and textures, which are important for object recognition. The pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps obtained from the convolutional layers, which helps in reducing computational complexity and improving the model's ability to generalize. The output of the last pooling layer is then flattened into a vector, which is passed through fully connected layers. These fully connected layers learn complex patterns and relationships between the features extracted from the convolutional layers, and produce the final prediction output (Bellocchio et al., 2019). During the training process, the forward computation is performed to make predictions, and the backward computation is performed to compute the gradients of the model parameters based on the prediction output and the labeled ground-truth. The gradients are then used to update the parameters of the model, typically using optimization algorithms such as gradient descent, which iteratively adjust the parameters to minimize the loss or cost function. The training process continues for a determined number of iterations of forward and backward stages, also known as epochs, until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a certain level of accuracy or a maximum number of epochs. This helps the model learn the optimal parameters for making accurate predictions on the training data (Liu et al., 2015). Computer vision has enabled the implementation of non-destructive techniques for detecting and identifying vegetative structures in the field using images. These techniques have been successfully applied to a wide range of crops including corn (Guerrero et al., 2013), tomatoes (Verma et al., 2014), and oranges (Patel et al., 2011). Besides, these techniques have also been implemented with grapes (Dey et al., 2012), pineapples (Moonrinta et al., 2010), and vegetable crops (Jay et al., 2015). Efficient decision-making on the appropriate harvesting period for coffee fruits can be facilitated by tracking their maturation stages through digital phenotyping. Ramos (2018) suggests that this can be achieved by determining the percentage of mature fruits on tree branches (Ramos et al., 2018). While previous studies have relied on destructive sampling, mainly post-harvest, to quantify and classify fruit for yield estimation (Carrillo and Penaloza, 2009; de Oliveira et al., 2016), only a limited number of studies have explored the classification of coffee fruits before harvest, which can significantly benefit coffee farmers decision-making. Earlier, Avendano et al. (2017)) developed a system that constructs a 3D representation of coffee branches and classifies their vegetative structures (Avendano et al., 2017). In this pursuit, another group came with a brilliant idea of developing a CV-based non-destructive method of fruit counting and classification similar to ours, with a few differences including a specific holder for smartphone during imaging, bit larger dataset to reproduce, and data modelling (Ramos et al., 2017). Few advancements were recently seen in this field. For example, a study developed a vegetation index (VI) for coffee ripeness based on the imaging data obtained from coffee fields through an RGB and a five-band multi-spectral cameras, each fixed on a separate UAV (Nogueira Martins et al., 2021). Similarly, Rodriguez et al. earlier came with a classic computer vision approach, however, it involved many instruments for image acquisition, a complex image processing system with precision values (Rodríguez et al., 2020). Although this technique requires the extraction of various features and their input into a classification algorithm, recent advancements in computer vision systems based on deep learning allow for the automatic extraction of multiple features. These techniques have gained popularity due to their speed and accuracy. Some recent studies devised yield mapping technique during harvest based on imaging from a camera mounted over the harvesting machine, using YOLOv4 (Bazame et al., 2022, 2021; Martello et al., 2022). The current study aimed at implementing the state-of-the-art CNN-based computer vision algorithm YOLOv7, the latest version (Wang et al., 2022), to detect and classify coffee fruits on tree branches at different maturation stages. The algorithm was first trained with training data (324 annotated images) and then evaluated with test data (82 annotated images), followed by testing with raw images (unannotated). We aimed at introducing a novel semi-supervised method for annotating the training data, which would save time and be able to handle large sets of data. This AI-based technology when integrated with other tools such as UAV would efficiently remotely monitor coffee field for informed decision about irrigation, fertilizer application and other measures of timely field management, implementing precision agriculture in sustainable quality coffee production chain. Nonetheless, this machine learning intelligent model could also be tailored for various other fruit farming. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Preparation We began by collecting images from various coffee farms at Lavras, and surrounding areas, Minas Gerais, which is the highest coffee producing area in Brazil. The areas included 21°09′51.7\"S 44°59′31.7\"W, 21° 13′ 33.0852′' S44° 58′ 17.7312′' W, and 21° 13′ 44.4144′' S 44° 57′ 47.0916′' W. The flowering in coffee is asynchronized, leading to varied dates of anthesis events (flower opening). In the mentioned location, a full bloom was observed in early September (first week), while following the fruit set, the branches were imaged once every week throughout the course of ripening, starting from November up to harvest in June and early July. For a broad applicability, the images used in this study included those photographing coffee fruits (branches) at every stage as the images were taken along a course of time from unripe green fruits to ripe cherries and raisin ones. The fruit bearing branches were photographed using various smartphone cameras at different angles to achieve representative data. The images were shot with default parameters of the smartphone camera, from an approximate distance of 30 cm (or including 7 to 10 nodes) in an angle of mostly 90° in relation to the coffee plagiotropic branch. The images were not calibrated or processed so that the algorithm would be able to detect fruits in a very easy and precise way independently of the equipment. All the images taken in the field were properly tagged and stored in a local database. The dataset of 406 images was split into training and validation sets, with a training split of 80% (324 images, 33,717 fruits) and a validation split of 20% (82 images, 10,094 fruits). This random division of the dataset ensures that the models are trained on a diverse set of images and can generalize well to new data. In order to train the model for a diverse range of images, we deliberately included images of coffee plant branches in shade and those exposed to sunlight, and even with varied angles and distance. The images were manually annotated through bounding boxes using Label Studio (Label Studio), an open-source platform for creating labeled datasets, to accurately identify the coffee cherries on the tree canopy. The software used included Label Studio version 1.6.0 (HumanSignal, Inc.), and Python version 3.10.9 (Python Software Foundation) with Python libraries Pytorch (version 1.0.2), numpy (1.20.1), scikit-learn (0.24.1), scipy (1.6.2), seaborn (0.11.1), pandas (1.2.4), matplotlib (3.3.4). In the process of annotation, the color scale (green, yellow, red, dark-red and dry (black)) defined previously (Ságio, 2009), was used as reference. 2.2. Training the Model To train a computer vision model, for example to identify the target object in an image in this case, the algorithm should be first fed with annotated images. Here we used YOLO, which is a part of a family of one-stage object detectors and is popular for its speed and accuracy. We first evaluated and compared the efficiency of YOLOv5 (Jocher et al., 2022), YOLOv5m6 (Li et al., 2023) and YOLOv7, which are the latest versions and have not been employed for this purpose before. An ideal state-of-the-art model should have (1) a faster and stronger network architecture; (2) a more effective feature integration method; (3) a more accurate detection method; (4) a more robust loss function; (5) a more efficient label assignment method; and (6) a more efficient training method. As compared to YOLOv4, YOLOv7 has been proved to be more efficient even with 75% less parameters and 36% less computation (Wang et al., 2022). To facilitate model training, all images were resized to 640 × 640 pixels. To further improve the model ability to generalize, default data augmentation techniques specific to the implemented models were used. In particular, we used mosaic augmentation, as described earlier (Bochkovskiy et al., 2020), to randomly combine multiple images into a single training sample. Mosaic augmentation works by stitching four images together at random positions in a larger canvas to create one larger mosaic image. The ground truth annotations of individual images in the mosaic image are then adjusted. A diverse set of images in the training data helped the models learn to better handle occlusions and other challenging conditions. Notably, the collected images contained a certain level of noise, reflecting the reality of field data collection and further challenges the models ability to generalize learning. Equations 1 and 2 were used in comparing the three different models. (1) where; IoU - Intersection over Union, A - Ground Truth Boxes (The manual labeled bounding box of a particular object in an image), B - Predicted Boxes (The predicted bounding box from the detection and classification algorithm), (2) where; AP - Average Precision, P – Precision, R – Recall “Precision” measures the number of correct positive predictions. “Recall” measures the number of correctly identified positive class samples present in the dataset. 2.3. Developing a semi-supervised annotation system To accelerate the annotation process, we utilized the annotation text-file in YOLO format (used for training the models in binary and multiclass mode) to collect objects (coffee fruits) in images, which were then subjected to cropping and resizing to 28 × 28 × 3 dimensions. To address potential lighting variations, we converted the resized RGB (Red, Green, Blue) images into the LAB color-space and extracted the A and B color channels for further analysis, eliminating the L channel, since the lightning variation could enhance bias into categorizing fruits based on shadow and light variations. The AB color space images were represented as vectors in a multidimensional space, and K-means models were trained with different k-sizes (2 to 7) on a dataset of approximately 36,000 fruits randomly selected from the dataset to create different classes of colors of fruits. The sketch of the strategy is shown below. To enable semi-supervised learning, we curated annotations comprising of manually annotated bounding boxes but unsupervised sub-categories of fruits. By leveraging these annotations, we performed semi-supervised learning in object detection tasks in the selected model (YOLOv7), which is crucial for real-world applications. By allowing the creation of in-demand complex subcategories of objects, the selected model was trained in the semi-supervised learned sub-categories of fruits and contrasted with the performance from the model of supervised learning from the same number of categories and hyperparameters. All three object detection models (YOLOv5, YOLOv5m6 and YOLOv7) were trained using the default hyperparameters specified in the respective papers or repositories, except for the batch size and number of epochs. In this study, a batch size of 16 and 100 epochs were used for all models. Batch size determines the number of images processed in a single forward and backward pass to calculate the gradient for weight updates. It affects memory usage and computational efficiency, with larger batches potentially speeding up training. Epochs denote the number of complete passes of the entire dataset through the neural network during training. The selection of epochs influences the duration of training and the model's ability to generalize. The training and evaluation were conducted on a Tesla T4 GPU available in Google Colab (Bisong and Bisong, 2019). At the Google CoLab, the online GPUs allow for faster execution of the code and developing of the model. The evaluation metrics used in this study included Precision, Recall, and mAP (He and Garcia, 2009). 2.4. Validation of the model The selected model was used to quantify coffee fruits and their specific class based on their maturity level, such as unripe and ripe. The model was trained on a large dataset of coffee fruit (324) images with labels indicating their class. The model was able to learn features and patterns that distinguish different maturation stages of coffee fruits from each other. Afterwards, the model was applied to images of the entire dataset to predict their class and count the number of fruits in each image. The performance of the model was evaluated by comparing its predictions with the ground truth labels obtained from the manual annotation process. The accuracy and precision of the model were reported as metrics of its effectiveness in quantifying coffee fruits and their specific class. To estimate the percentage of ripeness and unripeness in the plant, equation 3 and 4 were used. (3) (4) To check the yield estimation efficiency of the model, the automatic counting data (number) was correlated with the harvested and manually measured (weight) data. The yield data was analyzed both in binary and multiclass modes. 3. Results 3.1. Label Studio and Google CoLab are efficient platforms for data annotation and machine learning While annotating the data, the Label Studio proved efficient both for aiming the object such as where the object in the image is located as well as classifying it such as what the object is and to which category it belongs. Similarly, following data annotation, Google CoLab also displayed all the necessary features to execute the YOLO through script. A total of 9416 fruits were labelled as ripe and 34395 as unripe, for binary class data. Similarly, for multiclass data, 23886 fruits were labelled as green, 10509 as green-yellow, 4303 as cherry, 4265 as raisin, 848 as dry.

The unannotated image (A) depicts a branch of coffee plant bearing fruits at various stages such as green, green-yellow, cherry and raisin. Using Label Studio, all the visible fruits in image were annotated (B). Different colored boxes were used to classify the fruit at various stages such as unripe, yellow, cherry, raisin and dry. The whole training dataset (324 images) was annotated in the same way. 3.2. Comparison of various versions of YOLO to get the best mAP In the dataset of total 406 images, 324 were used as training data while 82 as validation data. After training the algorithm, the selected models (YOLOv5, YOLOv5m6 and 7), chosen for their high mean average precision at 50% intersection over union (mAP@.5) and real-time object detection capabilities in COCO dataset (13; 14), were trained on our training dataset (324 images). While comparing the object detection efficiency of three different YOLO versions, the results showed that YOLOv7 achieved the highest mAP@.5 values in all modes, followed by Yolov5 and Yolov5m6 (Table 1). YOLOv7 showed mAP@.5 value of 0.904 for mono class (only fruit), 0.892 for binary class (unripe/ripe) while 0.605 for multiclass (green, yellow-green, cherry, raisin, dry). The rest two versions showed lesser values for all categories (Table 1). Fig. 2 further demonstrates the better performance of YOLOv7 compared to the other two for mono, binary and multiclass.

Development of a novel semi-supervised annotation system Through manual bounding boxes and automatic classification, a semi-supervised method was developed for the annotation of training data. Here, K-means clustering was used to create categories of coffee fruits based on their color. We trained K-means models with different k-sizes ranging from 2 to 7 and evaluated their performance based on their ability to identify distinct color clusters. To our interest, the K-means model efficiently identified distinct color clusters within the high-dimensional (28*28*2 axis) and created categories of the various stages of coffee fruits that were visually distinguishable. In this novel approach, the categories were composed of coffee fruits with similar color representing similar ripening stage, which can be useful for further analysis and classification. After categorization, we performed PCA in the high-dimensional vector to produce visualization of the boundaries among clusters (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image (855KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Principal Component analysis of dataset annotated through semi-supervised approach. Various clusters in each class are visible in different colors. As the number of classes increased from two to seven classes, the mAP@.5 value also increased, however 4 classes appeared to be optimum. The seven various color classes of the coffee fruit ripening stage created through k-means are shown in Fig. 4. Employing semi-supervised approach, we attempted to annotate the same training and validation datasets which was earlier annotated using supervised method. Interestingly, the precision of detection increased with the increase in number of classes, whereas the optimal number of classes was determined to be 4, which was also visualized through Elbow method shown in Figure S1. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. K-means-based machine–generated color classes as semi-supervised method. There were up to 7 classes generated keeping k = 7, however the optimal number of classes was determined as 4. 3.4. Comparison of the supervised and semi-supervised annotation methods To validate the efficiency as well as consistency of the novel machine learning method, we compared the performance of semi-supervised model with the supervised one. Fig. 5 shows the comparative performance of supervised and semi-supervised annotations in binary as well as multiclass modes. To our interest, the semi-supervised model performed faster and more accurate annotation than the supervised one. Fig. 5A depicts output of the supervised (5A) and semi-supervised (5B) method for binary class annotation. The number of ripe (R) and unripe (UR) fruit through ML-based annotation is written above each image. The output of comparison of supervised and semi-supervised methods in multi-class mode is shown in Fig. 5C and 5D, respectively. The number as well as class of the fruit detected are mentioned in the figure. The images in both the binary and multiclass represent four different time points of fruit ripening (from earlier (A, B) to later stages (C, D)). Comparing both the cases (Fig. 5A, B, C, and D), it is clear that semi-supervised annotation surpassed the supervised annotation in terms of speed and accuracy. This is further simplified graphically in Fig. 6. For binary class, the supervised and semi-supervised training models had an equal mAP@.5 of .89 (Fig. 6A), showing similar performance for both methods. However, for multi-class detection (Fig. 6B), the mAP@.5 was 0.77 in case of semi-supervised model, which was only 0.6 with the supervised method, keeping the number of categories the 4 in both cases. It proves the high resolving power of the semi-supervised annotation. Moreover, its faster and more accurate annotation feature will aid in machine learning of large dataset, in less time. This is a novel and rigorous approach to analyze large-scale coffee-fruits datasets, which can have significant implications for various fields such as computer vision, image processing, and machine learning.

Validation of the established model To check the efficiency of our trained model, we initially tested it by feeding raw images, not included in our initial dataset. Afterwards, we also tracked the ripening of coffee fruits in real time. Both the approaches proved the higher image processing efficiency of our established model. Fig. 7 depicts raw images not originally included in our dataset. The raw images from the field were analyzed with the model where; Fig. 7A shows the binary class detection counting only ripe and unripe fruits. However, multi-class fruit detection and quantification, classifying them into green, green-yellow, cherry and raisin is also shown in Fig. 7B. The number and category of the fruit are written above each image. This proved the model was successful in image processing. A collection of data like this will provide a broad picture of the fruit ripening pattern, estimate yield and harvesting time. The big data will eventually aid in informed decision on coffee crop management specially plans for harvest and post-harvest measures.

The numerals show fruit counts while letters denote fruit type as UR – Unripe, RP – Ripe, C – Cherry G – Green, GY – Green-yellow, R – Raisin. For further validation, we tracked and analyzed the fruit ripening in a coffee field in real time for 90 days. Fig. 8A shows the ripening in binary mode (unripe and ripe) over the said time duration. Fig. 8B depicts the ripening information of the same data in multi-class mode over the 3-month period. It is obvious from this example that for about the initial 40 days there is higher percentage of unripe fruit which turn ripe after this period. We additionally demonstrated the potential of this algorithm to be used in crop analysis and estimation, utilizing regression and ridgeline plots (Figure S2) to illustrate the variation in mature fruit proportions over the growing season.

Discussion Traditional methods of yield estimation and decision about harvest time for crops like coffee involve manual counting of fruits (usually through destructive sampling), which is laborious, time-consuming, and often error-prone. Federación Nacional de Cafeteros (FNC) reported a significant portion of coffee fruit is wasted by the destructive sampling which includes 60 coffee trees per hectare in an area of 2000 hectares, for coffee yield estimation (Ramos, et al., 2016). To rapidly monitor coffee crop specially during fruit ripening time which is usually from January to May and June, estimate the yield and harvest time, forecasting market supply, and reducing production costs, precision agricultural approaches present an efficient and reliable solution. These take help of the artificial intelligence technology especially computer vision. In this study, we present a novel computer vision-based approach for estimating coffee crop yields as well as harvest time. Our approach involves training of a model for which the image dataset was annotated using online tools. Our dataset included images of fruit bearing branches of coffee plants. While addressing the above-mentioned issues, we trained the state-of-the-art object detection model YOLOv7 to count and classify coffee fruit in images. YOLO is CNN-based object detection model, where CNN is being used in numerous areas such as the facial recognition system the software of webcams and surveillance cameras. The annotation results (Fig. 1) of our training and validation datasets demonstrated that the online platform Label Studio for annotating the images, possesses multiple features such as shared working, allowing more than one person to deal a common project. Comparing YOLOv7 with the two other versions, YOLOv5 and YOLOv5m6 (Table 1), we obtained highest mAP value with YOLOv7, which is also obvious in Fig. 2. Ramos et al (2018) while using an alternative approach of using 3D images (via Structure from Motion (SfM), which is a computational technique, to generate 3D structures (point clouds), from corresponding points in multiple views of an object in space) in Support Vector Machine (SVM), constructing statistical estimation model for each ripening stage obtained a maturation index with 83% efficiency. While comparing with YOLOv3 for all network sized considered, an earlier study obtained mAP of 83.5% with YOLOv4 (Bazame et al., 2022). However, it is lower than the mAP we obtained with YOLOv7, which is >89%. Moreover, they reported an 8.8% lower Floating Points Operations (FLOPs) for YOLOv4, as compared to YOLOv3. The same group earlier executed a full-fledged experiment using YOLOv3-tiny, yet obtained mAP of 84%, while AP of 86%, 85% and 80% for unripe, ripe and overripe coffee fruits, respectively (Bazame et al., 2021). Nonetheless, the group estimated coffee yield only at harvest stage, while also using older version of YOLO. This also undermines the CV-aided estimation of the harvest time. A very recent study while comparing YOLOv7 and YOLOv4 models, based on average precisions (APs) for four apple flower bud growth stages and mean APs (mAPs), showed that YOLOv7 outperformed YOLOv4 in all growth stages and at all training image annotation quality levels. When trained with 100% training image annotation quality, YOLOv7 achieved a mAP of 0.80, whereas YOLOv4 achieved a mAP of 0.63 with only 5% training image annotation quality. The improvement in APs and mAPs varied depending on the growth stage and training image annotation quality. YOLOv7 showed improvements in APs ranging from 1.52% to 166.48% and mAPs ranging from 3.43% to 53.45% compared to YOLOv4, again depending on the specific growth stage and training image annotation quality (Yuan, 2023). YOLOv7 with the SENet attention mechanism and a weighted loss function, was effective in addressing the challenges of semantic segmentation of standing tree images, and outperformed other methods in terms of detection speed and segmentation accuracy by showing mean pixel accuracy (MPA) of 94.69% and mean intersection over union (MIoU) of 91.17% (Cao et al., 2023). In addition to its yield estimation capabilities, the Yolov7 model can also extract valuable information about the ripening process of crops over time. By calculating the percentage of ripe fruits over months, we can create plots that visualize the progression of ripeness levels as the crops mature, as well as the categorization of the pattern of maturation present in the farm. These plots provide farmers and researchers with valuable insights into the development of the crop, enabling them to plan harvesting schedules, optimize yields, and better understand the underlying biological processes. By quantifying ripeness in this way, we can improve our ability to predict and manage crop yields, ultimately leading to more efficient and sustainable agricultural practices. Furthermore, the data collected from the model allows for an analysis of the distribution of ripe and unripe fruits throughout the growing season. One of the challenges of annotation using an adapted scale in the field is the increase of confusion between classes due to the overlapping of features present in the classes. This can be seen by comparing the confusion matrices of binary (Figure S4) and multiclass (Figure S5) annotation schemes. This confusion can affect the reliability and validity of the annotation process and compromise the quality of the data. Therefore, it is important to create mathematically optimized scales that can reduce ambiguity and increase consistency among annotators. Such scales can also facilitate the analysis and interpretation of the data and enhance the scientific contribution of the research. Although YOLOv7 displayed higher values even in multiclass mode, yet it needs further improvement to achieve the best results. Enlarging and further diversifying the training dataset could also further improve its performance. The semi supervised model we devised is a novel method for annotating coffee images in training as well as validation data. The semi-supervised learning categories can be more representative of the mathematical process of categorization in AI and avoid human error being propagated through the machine learning metrics by imposing categories or scales. Besides that, the semi-supervised learned categories accelerate the process of annotations and can be used to create mathematically-optimized models and scales (van Engelen and Hoos, 2020). However, care should be taken in the semi-supervised approach as the machine-generated color categories of coffee fruits could sometimes be confused and mixed. This problem could be minimized by enlarging as well as diversifying the training data. Our choice of employing K-means clustering to create categories of coffee fruits based on color was driven by its ability to uncover distinct color clusters within the intricate high-dimensional space (28282 axis) of coffee fruit images. The resulting categories, which visually represent various ripening stages, offer a valuable resource for further analysis and classification. This approach holds promise for enhancing the understanding of coffee fruit development, as it groups fruits with similar color profiles into categories indicative of analogous ripening stages. The utilization of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize the boundaries among these clusters provided a tangible representation of the model's performance and the inherent color patterns captured within the dataset. Our findings also extended to the realm of model optimization. Through the semi-supervised approach, we sought to annotate the same training and validation datasets initially annotated using a supervised method. Notably, the precision of detection exhibited an intriguing trend, with an increase in the number of classes correlating with enhanced precision. Importantly, our investigation pinpointed the optimal number of classes as four, highlighting the model's capacity to discern meaningful distinctions and subsequently refine detection precision. Here, it is important to note that the categories created by K-means were based solely on color and did not necessarily correspond to different types or varieties of coffee fruits, such as maturity. Therefore, further analysis and classification was required to accurately identify the different types of coffee fruits being represented in each category. Further analysis to acknowledge this problem was performed by correlating the output categories with the Moraes categories used in the annotation process. By doing this, we defined categories in a crescent order of maturity. It holds enormous potential in handling a dataset despite its size. One thing to note is number of classes at which the color classification is optimum. In our case, we determined the optimal number of color classes to be 4. Our semi-supervised method outperformed the supervised method as it gave a mAP@.5 of 0.77 compared to 0.60 of the supervised method in multiclass detection mode. It proves the high resolving power of the semi-supervised annotation. Ramos et al. (2017), developed one of the pioneer CV system, which they named MVS for coffee fruit detection and counting, where they also considered using masking technique which aided in detecting the occluded fruits in images. The same masking technique if applied to our model could enhance the precision of our system. This should be addressed in future. While the supervised method showcased competitive results in binary classification, its performance lagged behind the semi-supervised counterpart in the more intricate landscape of multi-class detection. As such, researchers navigating multi-class classification tasks may find the semi-supervised approach to be a valuable tool for achieving higher accuracy and robustness. Moreover, its faster and more accurate annotation feature will aid in machine learning of large dataset, in less time. This is a novel and rigorous approach to analyze large-scale coffee-fruits datasets, which can have significant implications for various fields such as computer vision, image processing, and machine learning. This performance could even be enhanced in future as newer improved versions of YOLO become available. However, increasing this value should be addressed in future CV studies regarding coffee. Once the imaging data has been collected, this technology can be efficiently applied to quantify fruit in a non-destructive, cost-effective and non-laborious way. It not only informs about the yield and harvest time, but also monitors plant health. The ripening stage as well as health of coffee fruit are quite obvious from its color, for example, unripe fruit are green and ripe are red but overripe turn black and even dry if not harvested on time. Similarly, pre-mature blackening of the coffee fruit means abnormality which may be due to temperature changes, osmotic stress or malnutrition. The observation at the early stage of such a problem can rescue the crop by taking timely measures such as irrigation and fertilizer application, accordingly. In short, it is a simple yet very useful system for coffee farming and would prove revolutionary in enhancing coffee yield and quality in the coffee producing areas such as Minas Gerais, Brazil. This allows us to accurately monitor the plant health, estimate yield and harvest time through images showing coffee fruit on branches, in a non-destructive way with minimum human intervention. Bazame et al. (2021) also used their model for videos recorded during the coffee harvest, making it possible to map the qualitative attribute of the maturation stage of coffee over the experimental area, We also envision to integrate the video function which would be useful in faster and more convenient data collection in addition to farm monitoring via UAV. In precision agriculture, our model's accurate pre-harvest classification can empower farmers with timely insights, enabling them to make informed decisions about harvesting schedules, resource allocation, and crop management practices, which will optimize yield, minimize waste, and enhance overall productivity. Moreover, the impact extends to supply chain management, where reliable pre-harvest classification offers an advantage. However, variability in environmental conditions, lighting, and image quality could potentially impact the model's performance under real-world circumstances. As a result, rigorous testing and validation across diverse scenarios are essential to ensure its reliability and robustness. Furthermore, the model's generalization beyond the training data, particularly to new and unseen datasets, should be rigorously assessed to ascertain its practical applicability. Continuously collecting data across diverse environments and lighting conditions can contribute to refining the model's adaptability and performance. Integrating additional modalities, such as hyperspectral or thermal data, hold the potential to provide supplementary insights and enhance overall classification accuracy. Exploring ensemble approaches, where predictions from multiple models or modalities are combined, could further elevate the model's accuracy and reliability. In terms of practical deployment, assessing the model's real-time performance in scenarios like automated fruit sorting systems is crucial to validate its feasibility and efficiency in dynamic agricultural settings. Additionally, user interface development plays key role, as creating intuitive and user-friendly interfaces can facilitate easy interaction with the model's predictions, enabling farmers and stakeholders to make practical and timely decisions. 5. Conclusions As a temperature sensitive tropical plant, weather changes can greatly affect coffee yield. Thus, the continuous monitoring of coffee specially during fruit ripening is indispensable for its production in a sustainable manner. Under these scenarios, computer vision-aided coffee fruit quantification and yield estimation studies have been carried out in the recent past, however some of them used expensive machinery and complex image processing while others used outdated machine learning models. The most important results of our work include, 1) using the latest state-of-the-art YOLOv7, we obtained an mAP@.5 of 0.89, the highest ever so far. 2) We devised a semi-supervised method of annotating coffee images (training data), which would greatly aid in handling large datasets in less time. 3) The real-time tracking of coffee fruit ripening over a period of 90 days validated the efficiency of our system in predicting harvest time and yield estimate. With the integration of UAV and other value addition, the developed system holds enormous potential to be used in monitoring coffee farms for informed decision on timely field management, harvest time and post-harvest measures, which will ultimately enhance coffee yield and contribute to sustainable coffee production.

Conclusions and Future Scope Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: The agriculture industry has been facing a growing challenge with the rising cost of labor in recent years. A large portion of the expenses incurred in agriculture goes towards employing workers. This increase in labor expenses puts farmers under pressure to find ways to reduce costs while still producing at high levels. To tackle this issue, many farmers have turned to technology and automation. Using machines and automated systems to perform tasks that were previously done by humans can help decrease labor costs and increase efficiency, keeping farmers competitive in a continuously changing industry. The usage of technology in agriculture has rapidly increased in various forms, including precision farming, crop monitoring, irrigation systems, and decision-making tools based on data. Additionally, the growth of machine learning and AI has also played a crucial role in modernizing agriculture, with computer vision-based systems being developed for crop detection, classification, and monitoring. This research focuses on creating a red chili detection system using the YOLOv5 deep learning model. This project’s objective is to accurately and successfully identify ripened red chilies in real-world images. The proposed approach first applies methods for preparing images to increase the input photos' quality, and then utilizes the YOLOv5 model for object detection. The model was trained using a large dataset of red chili images and evaluated based on performance metrics, including accuracy, speed, and robustness to variations in the input data. The outcomes of our tests show that the suggested technique is more successful than other cutting-edge deep learning models, making it a promising solution for applications in the fields of agricultural automation and food processing.

Introduction Red chili is a highly sought-after spice used in many cuisines worldwide and is widely grown for its pungent taste and vibrant colour. The detection of fully ripened red chilies is crucial in agriculture as it impacts the quality, quantity, and profitability of the crop. The traditional approach of manual inspection and picking is demanding and time-consuming, resulting in higher expenses and reduced productivity. With the development of technology (Sihombing et al., 2022)(Cruz-Domínguez et al., 2021)(Sujatha & Srinivasa Rao, 2019), there has been a growing interest in utilizing deep learning and computer vision-based methods for the detection of red chilies. These methods aim to automate the process, increase accuracy, and reduce the time and cost associated with manual inspection. Some common objectives of red chilies detection include: High Accuracy: One of the main goals is to create a system that can precisely identify red chilies in images. This is important for applications such as quality control, where accurate detection is essential for ensuring the quality of the end product. Fast Detection Speed: Another crucial goal is to create a system that can quickly identify red chilies, as fast detection speeds are essential for applications such as agricultural automation and food processing. Robustness to Variations: The system should be robust to variations in the input data, such as different lighting conditions, camera angles, and the presence of complex backgrounds and other distractions. Easy Deployment: The system should be easy to deploy and integrate into existing systems and processes. This can include providing user-friendly software interfaces and APIs that allow users to easily access the system’s predictions. Scalability: The system should be scalable and able to handle large amounts of data. This is important for applications where the system needs to be used on a large scale, such as in large-scale agricultural operations or food processing plants. Deep Learning Models in Agriculture: Technology is transforming agriculture and providing new opportunities for farmers to improve productivity, increase profitability, and better meet the demands of an ever-growing global population. Recently, there has been a sharp increase in the use of technology in agriculture, bringing a wide range of benefits to farmers. From precision farming (Shaikh et al., 2022) to crop monitoring (Raj et al., 2022) and data-driven decision-making tools, technology has revolutionized the way farmers manage their operations. Automated irrigation systems, drones, and sensor-based technologies have enabled farmers to increase efficiency and reduce costs. The development of artificial intelligence and machine learning (Spanaki et al., 2022) models has also played a significant role in modernizing agriculture. These models are used for various purposes such as crop detection(Raja et al., 2019), classification (Sujatha et al., 2020)(Naik et al., 2022), plant disease detection(Raj et al., 2022) and monitoring, providing farmers with valuable insights into their operations. The use of deep learning algorithms can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of these tasks compared to traditional methods, enabling farmers to make data-driven decisions and increase their productivity. Additionally, deep learning models can also help to address some of the challenges faced by the agriculture industry, such as labour shortages and increasing costs (Sujatha et al., 2021). By automating certain processes and reducing the reliance on manual labour, deep learning models in agriculture can help to increase the efficiency, productivity, and profitability of agricultural operations. The aim of this work is to develop an automated red chili detecting system. The system takes a real-time image of a chili plant as input and combines deep learning techniques and computer vision to recognize and choose the ripening chilies. The proposed method employs YOLO version 5, a convolutional neural network, and PyTorch to achieve this goal in an agricultural setting. The aim is to assist farmers by reducing the time and effort required for manual chili detection, as well as to increase work speed and quality. Organization of the paper: The remaining sections of the paper are organized as follows: The first section provides an overview of the use of deep learning models in farming practices and red chili detection. The next section provides an update on the recent research related to chili detection and classification. The third section delves into the details of the proposed approach. The fourth section presents the results and discussions, and finally, the conclusion and potential avenues for future research are outlined. SECTION II. Objectives The main objectives of red chili detection research are to: Develop an automatic red chili detection system that can identify ripened chilies from plants without human intervention. Use image recognition techniques to locate matured red chilies on the plant in an agricultural setting. Implement object detection algorithms such as YOLO version 5, CNN, and PyTorch for red chili detection. Utilize a prototype camera module to capture real-time images of red chili plants. Improve efficiency and productivity in the agriculture industry by reducing manual labor and reducing the cost of labor. Enhance the quality and quantity of the final output by eliminating hand burns and other physical challenges faced by farmers. The ultimate objective of the research is to offer a workable answer to the problems farmers experience in the agricultural sector SECTION III. Literature Review A literature survey on red chilies detection using deep learning models would reveal that there has been growing interest in using deep learning models for red chilies detection in recent years. This is due to the ability of deep learning models to automatically learn complex features from large amounts of data and make highly accurate predictions. Some of the popular deep learning models used for red chilies detection include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), RCNNs, YOLO models, and Single Shot Detector (SSD) models. In a study by (Zhang et al., 2020), a CNN-based model was used to detect red chilies in images and the results showed that the model was able to achieve high accuracy in detecting red chilies even in images with complex backgrounds. In another study by(Naranjo-Torres et al., 2020), a Faster R-CNN model was used for object detection and the results showed that the model was able to achieve high accuracy and improved detection speed compared to traditional object detection methods. \" A new artificial intelligence approach for classifying dried chili peppers\" by (Cruz-Domínguez et al., 2021), presents a method for classifying dried chili peppers using artificial intelligence. The authors aim to increase the accuracy of dried chili pepper classification to aid in the supply chain management of the chili pepper industry. The study used a CNN and image processing techniques to classify the chili peppers. The outcomes demonstrate that the suggested technique has a high accuracy rate for appropriately categorizing dry chili peppers. The authors conclude that the use of artificial intelligence in the classification of dried chili peppers has the rate to greatly increase the efficiency and accuracy of the supply chain management process in the chili pepper industry. (Naik et al., 2022)\" Chili leaf disease detection and classification with a squeeze-and-excitation-based CNN model,\" focuses on utilizing machine learning to identify and categorize illnesses that affect chili leaves. The authors use a squeeze-and-excitation-based CNN model to analyse the images of chili plants and identify the presence of leaf diseases. The study results indicate that the suggested model is able to effectively detect and classify different types of chili leaf diseases with high accuracy. \" Using image processing, classify chilies based on their shape and colour \" by (Sihombing et al., 2022) focuses on using image processing to classify chilies based on their shape and colour features. The authors aim to develop an efficient method for chili classification using computer vision techniques. The results of their study suggest that the combination of shape and colour features provide accurate and efficient chili classification. The authors conclude that their method has potential for use in the agriculture industry for efficient and automated chili sorting. SECTION IV. Proposed Methodology YOLO version 5 is a popular object identification technique that can be used to detect red chilies. YOLOv5 is a fast and accurate model that can detect objects in real-time using a single forward pass through the network (Katsamenis et al., 2023). To detect red chilies using YOLOv5, you would first need to train the model on a dataset of images that contains red chilies. Then, you would use the trained model to detect red chilies in new images by inputting the image into the model and using the model’s outputs to draw bounding boxes around the detected red chilies. The objectives of using YOLOv5 for red chilies detection could be: Accurate detection: To ensure that the model is able to accurately detect red chilies in an image. High speed: To ensure that the model is able to run in real-time, making it suitable for applications where detection needs to be performed quickly. Robustness: To ensure that the model is able to detect red chilies even under challenging conditions such as variations in lighting, background, and orientation. Scalability: To ensure that the model can be used to detect red chilies in a variety of different settings, such as different types of images, different resolutions, and different object scales. Generalization: To ensure that the model is able to detect red chilies in new images, even if it has only been trained on a limited set of images. Architecture of the proposed model can be represented using the following figure. Fig. 1. Overall Architecture of the Research Work Done Source: Proposed Research Work Flow Diagram Show All There are three modules in this research work, Labelling: The labelling can be done by giving a bounding box to the red chilies detected form the input image. Labelling process composed of three parts,1. giving label index, 2. (x, y) coordinates of the bbox, and 3. height and width of bbox. Training: This module is being used to build a model for red chili detection. The YOLOv5 model was customized to train the custom red chilies dataset. Detection: The trained model was used to detect red chilies. The architecture of YOLOV5 model (Xu et al., 2021) can be represented as follows Fig. 2. Architecture of YOLOV5 model (Xu et al., 2021) Show All The YOLO version 5 architecture consists of several key components: Backbone Network: A backbone network, such as ResNet or MobileNet, is used as the feature extractor for the YOLOv5 model. This network is responsible for extracting high-level features from the input image that can be used for object detection. Neck: The neck component is used to connect the backbone network to the head component. It can be used to add additional features to the characteristics gleaned from the backbone network. Head: The head component is in charge of calculating the probability for each class and object bounding boxes for each item in the picture. The final predictions are made using a number of layers, including Convolutional layers and Up sampling layers. Anchors: The anticipated bounding boxes are matched with the items in the image using anchors, which are preset bounding boxes. The YOLOv5 model’s performance may be adjusted by adjusting the number of anchors and their sizes, which are referred to as hyperparameters. Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS): NMS is used to remove overlapping bounding boxes and to produce a single bounding box for each object in the image. Loss Function: The YOLOv5 model uses a custom loss function that is designed to optimize the accuracy of the predictions and to ensure that the model is robust to variations in the input data. The YOLOv5 network uses a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), non-max suppression, and anchor boxes to perform object detection. The network initially uses a number of convolutional and pooling layers to extract features from an input picture. To anticipate the bounding boxes surrounding the items of interest, these characteristics are subsequently input into a fully connected layer. The prediction also includes the object class probabilities. The prediction is made using the following equation: bbox(x)=sigmoid(target(x))+c_x bbox(y)=sigmoid(target(y))+c_y bbox(h)=exp(target(h))∗p_h bbox(w)=exp(target(w))∗p_w View Source where bbox(x), bbox(y), bbox(h), and bbox(w) are the predicted bounding box coordinates, sigmoid is the sigmoid activation function, exp is the exponential function, and target(x), target(y), target(h), target(w), c_x, c_y, p_h, and p_w are the network’s predicted values for the target coordinates, center coordinates, height and width scaling factors, respectively. The network also uses a loss function, typically mean squared error or cross-entropy, to measure the accuracy of its predictions and update its weights through backpropagation to improve its predictions over time. A. Experimentation A minimum of 8 GB GPU and 12 GB RAM are needed for this operation, which takes more time. It is thus recommended to use Google Collaboratory, which is accessible for free and employs cloud-based GPU and RAM. The YOLOV5 model trained with more than 500 epochs to get the best model. B. Dataset Used We have created a customized dataset which is a collection of all red chilies from the plants and individual chilies. The dataset consists of 1078 images where 75% (807 images) is used for training and 25% (270 images) of images is used for testing Fig. 3. Sample Red Chilli’s Images Collected for Preparing Custom Dataset Show All C. Results and Discussions Several performance indicators, including efficiency, quality, recall, F1-score, including mean average precision, may be used to understand the outcomes of red chili identification using the YOLOV5 model. The accuracy of the model can be evaluated by the proportion of correctly classified chili images, while precision and recall can be used to evaluate the model’s ability to detect and classify red chilies in the image. The F1-score, which offers a general assessment of the model’s performance, is the harmonic mean of accuracy and recall. Object detection models are frequently evaluated using the mean average precision (MAP), which is a typical statistic., which measures the average precision across all image-level predictions. Moreover, visualization of the bounding box predictions can also be helpful in analyzing the results of the model. By precisely drawing a bounding box around the red chili in the image and classifying it as a red chili, for instance, the model may be judged. Additionally, the model’s ability to handle different scales and orientations of red chilies can also be evaluated. The YOLOv5 model is capable of detecting red chilies in images, regardless of their orientation or position, whether they are positioned horizontally, vertically, or at an angle, and even if they are located on the plant. The following shows the detection of red chilies in different orientations. Fig. 4.

Conclusions and Future Scope The Red Chili detection, aims to revolutionize the agricultural industry by providing a solution that saves time, reduces effort, and accommodates workers with physical limitations. The successful implementation of YOLOv5 as an object detection model for red chili detection is a testament to the potential of technology and computer science in advancing agriculture. The YOLOv5 architecture consists of several key components that work together to ensure accurate detection results. In conclusion, the Red Chili Plucking project is a step towards a more efficient and effective agricultural industry. In the current research, we developed a deep learning model for better detection of the red chilies from the chili plant images, provided a practical solution for some limitations such as hand burns, struggle with the cost of labour in agriculture etc. In future, a prototype can be specifically designed for plucking red chili, making the process quicker and more accurate. Further we plan to expand the prototype’s capabilities by incorporating features such as detecting plant illnesses, predicting crop yield, enabling night time operations, and creating similar prototypes for drone-assisted harvesting and various crops. By integrating technology and computer science into agriculture, we aim to streamline labour and bring benefits to farmers and the agricultural industry as a whole.

However, diseases such as late blight disease can often affect the crop, impacting many farmers around the world. As a way to help production, technology in agriculture is increasing. Among the various computational techniques that can be applied, those based on digital image processing associated with machine learning algorithms stand out, producing excellent results. This work aimed to develop a methodology for recognizing late blight disease in potato leaves using digital image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. It was possible to obtain promising results. The experiments were carried out in a set of images from a public database containing images of healthy and unhealthy leaves (with late blight). We compare the performance of machine learning algorithms using feature vectors obtained with SIFT algorithm and RGB descriptors.

The tuber is planted in more than 130 countries, covering about 20 million hectares and producing more than 400 million tons of potatoes annually. In Brazil, it is estimated that there are 100,000 hectares of the crop spread across different states of Brazil, generating a production of 3.8 million tons, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics [1]. Productivity has been increasing due to more productive varieties and new technologies related to irrigation, nutrition, soil preparation, and the use of quality seed potatoes. Most of this production is sold fresh, with around 25–30% destined for industrial processing, in the form of frozen pre-fried (500,000 tons), chips, and straw potatoes (250,000 tons) [22]. However, diseases can affect the plantation, and these are usually caused by microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, nematodes, and viruses, but a lack or excess of essential factors for plant growth, such as nutrients, water, and light can also cause them. The growing maturation and development of agricultural technology, in general, is remarkable, with the emergence of new applications and software to facilitate the day-to-day life of agricultural producers. Among these, techniques based on digital image processing are widely used. Image processing performs operations on an image to obtain an improved image or extract some useful information from it. It is a type of signal processing where the input is an image, and the output can be an image or features associated with that image. Several techniques can be explored, mainly in agriculture, due to the variety of plants that can present diseases. Furthermore, along with these processing techniques, machine learning algorithms can help detect diseases, pests, or even production estimates, such as the work of Kadir et al. [14] and Trindade and Basso [25]. Specifically in disease identification, Arnaud et al. [2] aimed to develop an application that identifies disease diagnoses using deep learning techniques. Pallathadka et al. [19] detected grape diseases. Lawrence et al. [18] to recognize leaf diseases using individual lesions. Carmo et al. [6] identified the best time and sensor to detect the disease caused by Pectobacterium carotovorum in lettuce, using images obtained by multispectral sensors in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Therefore, this paper aims to develop a methodology for recognizing late blight disease in potato leaves by exploring digital image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. This way, image samples of healthy potato leaves and leaves with late blight disease were selected to form a database. We performed experiments using image processing techniques to obtain the best representation from this base. Finally, relevant algorithms from the literature were trained and evaluated, allowing the definition of a promising approach to identifying the disease. The main contribution was finding a feature extraction strategy and a traditional machine learning algorithm, which bring promising results, avoiding more complex structures, such as deep learning approaches. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 describes the previous works of disease detection of different plants and Sect. 3 explains the dataset and the proposed approach. The experimental results are illustrated in Sect. 4. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes the work, including the future plans. 2 Related Work Machine learning algorithms involving classification tasks are increasingly important and popular. The main goal of algorithms is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs correctly. Several techniques have been used to detect and categorize plant diseases. These various techniques could be observed in the relevant and recent literature articles that we found, in which the authors performed disease classification on images of agricultural data. Hughes [16] created a database with 50,000 expertly curated images of agricultural leaves available on the PlantVillage online platform. The goal was to develop an application that identifies disease diagnoses using machine learning techniques. This database allows several researchers to use it in different experiments. For example, Pallathadka et al. [19] used Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes, and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to detect diseases of rice leaves. The SVM was the algorithm with the better performance, with 96.2% accuracy. Ngugi et al. [18] recognize leaf diseases using individual lesions. A segmentation algorithm was trained using only 90 hand-labeled critical illness images. However, manually labeling or cutting lesions that do not have clearly defined borders but gradually merge with healthy leaf tissue makes it difficult to be consistent when labeling lesions manually. The proposed automatic lesion segmentation techniques work in experimental settings. Carmo et al. [6] identified the best time and the best sensor to detect the disease caused by Pectobacterium carotovorum in lettuce, using images obtained by multispectral sensors in an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). For this, an experiment was installed in a greenhouse at the Federal University of Uberlândia, Mount Carmel Campus. The authors used Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers to evaluate groups of data composed of spectral bands, vegetation indices, and the combination of bands and indices obtained from a conventional visible camera and a Mapir Survey 3W multispectral camera, as well as agronomic parameters. Trindade et al. [25] investigate three computational methods to detect soybean leaves. Thus, they carried out a systematic literature review to map the methods applicable to the problem, characterizing techniques for detecting plant diseases and generating important information. They selected three methods for training Neural Networks Convolutional (RNCs), and each one was tested and compared, generating very motivating results that prove the efficiency of using image data augmentation techniques as an essential pre-processing step. In the case of potatoes, Biondo et al. [4] present a system developed to classify the types of potato disease, such as late blight and early blight, based on leaf conditions, using Deep Learning as a model of conventional neural network architecture, through the proposed model had an accuracy of 92.57% in identifying diseases. Islam et al. [13] implemented AVM to classify healthy leaves and those affected by late and early blight diseases using 300 potato images. The system’s cross-validated accuracy was 95%. Sanjeev et al. [24] implemented a classifier based on a neural network to predict and classify potato image samples. The Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) Model was used to predict and classify unknown leaves. The accuracy of the model is achieved at 96.5%. Pires et al. [21] used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify tree species by leaf images. The work compared Darknet-19 and GoogLeNet (Inception-v3). The Darknet and GoogLeNet models achieved recognition rates of 86.2% and 90.3%, respectively. Generally, many researchers use ANN and Deep Learning as algorithms for training the classifier. However, this may require more computational resources and relies on a large volume of data for training. Thus, we decide to explore some traditional feature extraction techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify late blight disease and compare the results of our approaches. Fig. 1. Development Stages Full size image 3 Methodology Machine learning is one of the areas of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms and mathematics, specifically statistics, to accomplish learning tasks. Currently, various databases are available where experiments can be performed integrating techniques for automatic recognition. Thus, the need arose to process and obtain useful information from these databases. Consequently, the machine learning area gained prominence since it is impracticable to process and analyze data currently available manually, and tasks can be automated, simulating human behavior [8]. However, it is necessary to carry out studies and define stages of data preparation, as well as the algorithms and parameters to be implemented. Therefore, for the development of this work, four main stages were defined: 1. Image search and selection; 2. Preprocessing; 3. Feature extraction and machine learning algorithm training, and 4. analysis of results. The developed method includes exploratory experiments with digital image processing techniques to allow the formation of feature vectors for each image in the database. With these vectors, experiments were carried out with supervised machine learning algorithms to allow the automatic identification of leaves that have late blight disease. Figure 1 shows the schematic of the order in which the development steps are carried out, and the descriptions are presented below. The technologies used for the development of this project were: Python programming language; Libraries: Numpy; Pandas; csv; Tqdm; Sklearn; Skimage; OpenCV; Matplotlib; posthoc. 3.1 Image Search and Selection The database used in the experiments is formed by selecting public images from the Plant Village website Footnote 1. This database is a collection of plant and leaf images and corresponding metadata, which are used to train machine learning models in plant disease recognition and diagnosis tasks. In this way, there are 4864 images in the selected dataset. The first class is formed by 2432 images of healthy leaves. The second class is formed by 1216 slightly diseased and 1216 extremely diseased. Figure 2 shows healthy and late blight leaf examples, respectively. Fig. 2. Example of selected leaf images from PlantVillage database Full size image 3.2 Preprocessing At this stage, firstly, all images were resized to 256\\(\\,\\times \\,\\)256, since, in the Plant Village database, by default, the photos are of different sizes or even show deformation. Moreover, all images must have the same size for an effective feature extraction process. Furthermore, the images of the database are in RGB color space. RGB is the most common color space used in image processing, with one channel each for red, green, and blue colors. All other colors are produced only by the proportions of these three colors, where zero corresponds to black, and as the value increases, the intensity increases. However, considering that the images may have luminosity, contrast, and color problems, the images were transformed from the RGB color space to HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) to improve the luminosity. In color space HSV, the image consists of three channels: Hue, Saturation, and Value. A color component represents the H; the S suggests the percentage of the color; usually, this value is between 0 and 1, and the V represents the intensity of the chosen color and varies from 0 to 100 [10]. Thus, we equalized the S channel histogram after transforming the image to HSV. Subsequently, the images were converted back to RGB. The histogram equalization aims to balance the distribution of pixel frequency values, reducing accentuated differences and highlighting previously unnoticed details. The algorithm normalizes the brightness and increases the contrast of the image. Figure 3 presents an example of equalizing the histogram of an RGB image. Thus, given an image src, the equalization is given by steps 1 to 4, according [10] and OpenCV implementation Footnote 2. 1. Calculate the histogram H for src. 2. Normalize the histogram so that the sum of histogram bins is 255. 3. Compute the integral of histogram using: $$\\begin{aligned} H_{i}^{'} = \\sum _{0\\le i\\le L}^{}H(i) \\end{aligned}$$ (1) 4. Transform the image using \\(H^{'}\\) as a look-up table: $$\\begin{aligned} img_{eq}(x,y) = H^{'}(src(x,y)) \\end{aligned}$$ (2) Fig. 3. Example of histogram equalization. Source: the authors. Full size image Fig. 4. Example of points of interest found by the SIFT extractor. Source: the authors. Full size image 3.3 Feature Extraction The feature extraction stage aimed to extract the information of interest (sheet), generating the feature vectors of the images. For this work, we evaluated two types of characteristics: Automatic vectors extracted by the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm: It starts by identifying the patterns, called descriptors, that is, characteristic points, looking for the edges of each object. Edges in the image are discovered by calculating the magnitude of the x- and y-axis frequencies using a kind of “high-pass\" filter to enhance the edges of the image. Once this task is completed, the method tests and evaluates the possibility of image standard deviation creating different highlights in the image [15]. However, this algorithm requires the formation of a vocabulary to generate the feature vectors using the K-means algorithm. Figure 4 shows an example of identifying SIFT descriptors in a leaf image. Extracted vectors based on color information: feature vector from the RGB color space: This is the simplest form of representation. The number of features will be a one-dimensional matrix containing the color value of the pixels of the images. For this scenario, as previously described, the images have dimensions 256 in width and 256 in height, formed by 3-channel gray scales, which are the R, G, and B channels. The total number of pixels would be 256\\(\\,\\times \\,\\)256\\(\\,\\times \\,\\)3, the average values of the images for each pixel i of each channel defined by Eq. 3. $$\\begin{aligned} \\begin{matrix} RGB_{vector} = \\sum _{n=0}^{i}\\frac{R_i + G_i + B_i}{3}; & with & 0< i\\le L \\end{matrix} \\end{aligned}$$ (3) R is the red channel, G is the green channel, B is the blue channel, and L is the limit edge of the 256-pixel image, then transformed into a single 1-dimensional channel with the same width and height. 3.4 Machine Learning Machine learning models were selected to carry out the experiments in this step. Therefore, the objective is to identify patterns based on the features provided by the images in the database. As an experimental protocol, we split the database into 70% for training and validation, and 30% for tests. Also, in the training set, we performed ten runs to analyze the results [7], and cross-validation (k-folds) with different values of K. This technique consists of randomly dividing the database into K subsets (K is previously defined), with approximately the same amount of samples in each of them. At each iteration, training, and validation, a set formed by K-1 subsets is used for training, and the remaining subset will be used for validation, generating a metric result for evaluation. For the experiments, the values of K = 5 were defined, with sets formed in a stratified manner. These experiments were performed to avoid overfitting or underfitting. Overfitting means that the model has a high accuracy score on the training data but a low score on the test data, i.e. the model is not generalized. On the other hand, underfitting occurs when the algorithm used to build the prediction model has low performance already on the training data [5]. After some experiments and state-of-the-art studies, we define the machine learning models: Random Forest (RF) [20], Decision Tree (DT) [17], K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) [3], Support Vector Machine (SVM), LinearSVM [12] and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) [23]. 3.5 Metrics for Evaluating Results The experiments were evaluated using statistical analysis through Accuracy (Eq. 4), Precision (Eq. 5), Recall (Eq. 6), and Confusion Matrix, because they are essential tools for evaluating the performance of a classification algorithm. [9, 11]. $$\\begin{aligned} accuracy = \\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN+ FP +FN} \\end{aligned}$$ (4) where TP: true positive, TN: true negative, FP: false positive, and FN: false negative $$\\begin{aligned} precision = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP} \\end{aligned}$$ (5) $$\\begin{aligned} recall = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} \\end{aligned}$$ (6) The Kruskal-Wallis statistical test, with a significance of 0.5, was applied to the results. The Kruskal-Wallis tests the null hypothesis that the population median of all algorithms being compared is equal. The test works on two or more independent samples with different sizes. If the value (p) is less than or equal to 0.05, the hypothesis that all samples have equal medians is rejected with 95% confidence, i.e., there are at least one pair of algorithms that is significantly different between them. Otherwise, the hypothesis is accepted, the performance of all algorithms is statistically equivalent. Rejecting the null hypothesis does not indicate which of the algorithms is different. Thus, post hoc comparisons between algorithms are needed to determine which algorithms differ. This work used Conover [7] as a post hoc test. 4 Experimental Results Firstly, the images were read using the OpenCV library and stored as a tuple containing the image name and the image itself. Then, experiments were carried out using pre-processing and image feature extraction techniques. Table 1 shows the database’s pre-processing results applied to healthy and late blight leaves. Thus, it is possible to observe that regions of the leaf that present late blight disease were more intensified in the pre-processed image. In addition, green color pigments and sparkles also had increased contrast, mainly in disease leaves. Table 1. Examples of preprocessing results applied in dataset imagens Full size table Next, we describe the results using feature extraction techniques and machine learning algorithms. The first technique used was the SIFT algorithm to detect the points of interest in each image and extract the corresponding descriptors, totaling 2214 descriptors. The descriptors were stored in a list. Subsequently, we used the K-Means clustering algorithm with 50 clusters to group the descriptors into similar clusters, creating a vocabulary to describe the features of the images. Once the descriptors were grouped into clusters, a histogram was created for each image using the results of running K-Means. Each descriptor is assigned to the closest cluster, and the histogram is created by counting the occurrence in the image. Finally, we saved the histograms in a text file for later use in the classification task. Therefore, 4864 training samples were created, each with 50 feature descriptors. Afterward, the base was separated for training, validation, and test set. Thus, 3404 samples were used for training/validation, k-folds with k = 5, and 1460 images for testing. All analyzes are based on ten runs independent of the algorithms and calculated the mean values for accuracy, precision, and recall. The results of the experiments on the test samples are in Table 2. Table 2. Results of experiments using SIFT vectors (in %) Full size table It is possible to observe in Table 2 that the algorithms SGDClassifier and LinearSVM presented lower performance. The best results use Decision Tree and Knn algorithms, with 99.24% accuracy. In general, the results obtained were satisfactory, as using the SIFT algorithm allowed the creation of robust image descriptors. Applying the K-Means clustering algorithm allowed the identification of similar features between the images, mainly observing the proportion between precision and recall. In this way, it is possible to conclude that using SIFT descriptors is a promising alternative for identifying late blight through images of the leaves. The Decision Tree model was selected to analyze the confusion matrix (Table 3). Thus, 1460 images were selected for test samples. There was low confusion in differentiating healthy leaves from diseased ones; only 11 leaves were classified incorrectly. Table 3. Confusion matrix using SIFT descriptors and Decision Tree algorithm Full size table The second set of experiments used RGB descriptors as feature vectors. Table 4 shows that the best performance was obtained using the SGD algorithm, with approximately 79% accuracy, followed by the LinearSVM with only 0.05% difference. Analyzing the SGD confusion matrix (Table 5), 759 healthy leaves and 392 diseased leaves were classified correctly. However, the major confusion was in 305 samples that were classified incorrectly as healthy leaves. In addition, the results obtained using vectors with the average of RGB colors presented better precision, however, low recall. This shows that color features may not be able to correctly distinguish diseased parts of potato leaves. Thus more experiments must be performed in further works, preparing the feature vectors. Table 4. Results of experiments using RGB descriptors (in %) Full size table Table 5. Confusion matrix using RGB descriptors and SGD algorithm algorithm Full size table Fig. 5. Pair-by-pair analysis of post-hoc testing of machine learning algorithms on the data set Full size image Figures 5a and 5b show the statistical analysis, and when \\(p < 0.05\\) (p-value) means that there is a statistical difference in favor of the method that has highest mean accuracy. In these figures, the p values represented by the green colors (the greater the color intensity, the greater the difference between the algorithms) indicate statistical differences between the pair of algorithms in row x column. The pink color represents statistical equivalence. For both sets of descriptors, the statistical tests show that there is a statistical difference between some pairs of compared versions. Except for the SIFT-KNN and SIFT-DT, RGB-LinearSVM and RGB-SGD, and RGB-RF and RGB-SVM. Many papers with similar problems do not provide the bases used in their experiments. However, with the samples selected for the experiments, promising results were obtained in identifying late blight on potato leaves. For comparison, the most recent papers that classify potato diseases were in Table 6. Though methods like artificial neural networks and deep neural networks, applied by [4] and [24], show good accuracies, they come with high computational costs. In addition, [4] used a deep learning approach, however, with few samples of healthy and diseased leaves. This implies performing data augmentation, with we did not perform in our work. Thus, we can observe that our proposed method, using Decision Tree and SIFT vectors, outperformed the results. Table 6. Comparison of the state of the art Full size table 5 Conclusion The present study aimed to develop a methodology for recognizing late blight disease in potato leaves using digital image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. Firstly, we collected images from a public database. Through a bibliographic survey, available images were found, as well as the main image processing techniques used. We used two feature extraction techniques to perform comparative experiments. We observe that using vectors of the RGB color space with the use of the SGD algorithm presented promising results. However, the SIFT points presented robust feature vectors, which increased the results, mainly using DT and KNN model. In addition, we evaluated the significant difference between machine learning models and concluded some significant differences between the algorithms evaluated. In future work, we intend to conduct experiments on a specific database, created from the collection of images of greenhouse potato leaves located in the Cedeteg campus of Unicentro, Paraná. In addition, further research is needed to identify other models of automatic feature extraction and machine learning algorithms, allowing to increase in the amount of the image database, with greater data variability.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.

3.6. IoT Network Architectures and Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) for Real-Time Irrigation
Real-time irrigation management systems heavily rely on the efficient and reliable transmission of data from sensors and weather stations to the cloud for processing and decision-making. However, agricultural environments present unique challenges to wireless communication, including adverse weather conditions, physical obstacles, and the limitations of wireless technologies. These challenges necessitate robust and adaptive solutions to ensure the consistent and timely flow of data, enabling truly autonomous irrigation scheduling.
Environmental factors, such as heavy rain, fog, and strong winds, can significantly disrupt wireless communication by attenuating or even blocking radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance (Ed-daoudi et al., 2023; Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). Dense vegetation, buildings, and uneven terrain create further complications by causing multipath propagation and shadowing effects (Yim et al., 2018; Gautam and Pagay, 2020). The study by Yim et al. (2018) on LoRa networks in a tree farm environment exemplifies these challenges, revealing reduced communication range and data reliability compared to theoretical expectations. This underscores the need for carefully selecting and optimizing communication protocols and network parameters to ensure reliable data transmission in such environments.
The study by Guzinski et al. (2014a) using a modified TSEB model further highlights the importance of high-resolution data in accurately capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of energy fluxes influenced by environmental factors. This emphasizes the need for advanced data acquisition and processing techniques that can effectively represent the complexities of agricultural settings.
The limitations of traditional wireless communication technologies, such as limited range and network congestion, pose additional challenges for large-scale agricultural operations. Long-distance data transmission can be hindered by range limitations, while network congestion arising from numerous sensors transmitting concurrently can lead to delays and data loss, hindering real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). Addressing these challenges requires the exploration of advanced networking technologies that can optimize spectrum utilization, mitigate interference, and improve reliability and efficiency.
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) offer promising solutions for optimizing wireless communication in agricultural settings. CRNs empower devices with the ability to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). Research has explored the potential of CRNs in predicting Radio Frequency (RF) power to avoid noisy channels and optimize spectrum utilization (Iliya et al., 2014; Iliya et al., 2014). These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of combining optimization algorithms with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the accuracy and generalization of RF power prediction, enabling CRNs to make informed decisions about channel selection and avoid interference.
DSA complements CRN technology by dynamically allocating unused spectrum, further enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion (Shi et al., 2023). The numerical model developed by Shi et al. (2023) showcases the potential of CRNs and DSA for optimizing wireless communication in challenging environments.
The integration of CRNs and DSA into the IoT network architecture requires careful consideration of spectrum sensing techniques, network topology, and data security. Research on cooperative spectrum sensing suggests that distributed approaches, where sensor nodes collaborate and share information, can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectrum sensing, particularly in dynamic environments (Trigka and Dritsas, 2022; Khalid & Yu, 2019). This collaborative approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the radio environment and facilitates the identification of available frequency bands for data transmission.
The choice of network topology also impacts the performance and scalability of CRN-based irrigation systems. Mesh networks, where sensor nodes are interconnected and relay data for each other, offer enhanced resilience and coverage compared to star topologies where nodes communicate directly with a central gateway (Akyildiz & Vuran, 2010). However, mesh networks can be more complex to manage and may introduce additional routing overhead. The trade-off between network resilience and complexity needs to be carefully evaluated to select the most appropriate topology for a specific agricultural setting.
Data security and privacy are paramount concerns in IoT-based irrigation systems due to the sensitive nature of agricultural data (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential for protecting data integrity and ensuring system trustworthiness. Research on secure spectrum leasing and resource allocation algorithms for CR-WSN-based irrigation systems has demonstrated the potential of these technologies for enhancing security and efficiency (Hassan, 2023; Afghah et al., 2018).
In conclusion, the development of effective and reliable real-time irrigation management systems requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the challenges of data transmission in agricultural environments. The integration of robust and adaptive communication protocols, optimized network architectures, and advanced networking technologies like CRNs and DSA, along with a focus on data security and privacy, can contribute significantly to achieving the goal of autonomous and efficient irrigation scheduling.
4. AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN THE CLOUD
4.1. Data Quality and Preprocessing
Data quality is paramount in automated irrigation systems as it directly influences the effectiveness of decision-making and water use efficiency. Issues like missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers arising from sensor malfunctions, environmental interference, or network problems (Lv et al., 2023) can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models used for irrigation scheduling and management.
Real-time data cleaning techniques are essential for addressing these challenges. Kalman filtering proves particularly effective in handling missing values and correcting erroneous readings by recursively estimating the system's state based on previous measurements and current sensor data, taking into account noise and uncertainty (Kim et al., 2020). Moving average techniques, by averaging consecutive data points, provide a more stable representation of the underlying trend, filtering out short-term fluctuations (Chhetri, 2023). For outlier detection, adaptive thresholding methods offer a dynamic approach, adjusting thresholds based on the statistical properties of the data to effectively identify anomalies and minimize false positives (Bah et al., 2021). These techniques are crucial in maintaining the integrity of real-time data streams and ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analyses.
Adaptive data preprocessing is essential for managing the diversity of data sources and formats commonly found in irrigation systems. Data normalization techniques, such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization, ensure that all features contribute equally to the analysis by transforming data values to a common scale (Pradal et al., 2016). This is crucial for preventing features with larger values from dominating the analysis and ensuring that all features are given equal consideration. Similarly, feature scaling methods, like standardization or normalization, optimize the range of feature values to improve the performance and convergence of machine learning models (Tortorici et al., 2024). By scaling features to a similar range, the influence of outliers is reduced, and the model's ability to learn from the data is enhanced.
Data fusion techniques play a critical role in integrating information from diverse sources, creating a more comprehensive and reliable dataset for irrigation management. Dempster-Shafer theory, a generalization of probability theory, allows for the expression of both uncertainty and the degree of conflict in evidence, making it suitable for fusing uncertain and conflicting data from heterogeneous sources (Sadiq and Rodriguez, 2004). This is particularly relevant in irrigation systems where data from different sensors may provide slightly different or even contradictory information due to sensor variations or environmental factors. Bayesian inference offers another powerful framework for combining information from multiple sources, updating the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available. By applying these techniques, data from soil moisture sensors, canopy temperature sensors, weather stations, and other sources can be integrated to provide a holistic understanding of crop water requirements and environmental conditions, leading to more informed and accurate irrigation decisions.
The impact of data quality extends beyond model accuracy to the robustness of machine learning models under varying conditions. Robust models should maintain consistent performance even when faced with data inconsistencies or unexpected situations. Techniques like data augmentation and domain adaptation can enhance model robustness by exposing the model to a wider range of data variations during training. Data augmentation involves generating additional training data by applying transformations or introducing noise to existing data, making the model more resilient to noise and variations in the real-world data. Domain adaptation techniques aim to adapt a model trained on one domain (e.g., a specific crop or geographic location) to perform well on another domain with different data characteristics. This is particularly relevant in irrigation management, where models may need to be applied to different crops, soil types, or climatic conditions.
The choice of data cleaning, preprocessing, and fusion techniques should be carefully considered based on the specific characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data. By selecting and implementing appropriate techniques, the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of machine learning models can be significantly improved, leading to more efficient and sustainable irrigation management practices.
4.2. Scalable and Autonomous Deployment using Containerization Strategies
The transition from data collection and transmission to efficient data processing requires a robust infrastructure capable of handling diverse workloads and data volumes. Containerization technologies, specifically Docker and Kubernetes, offer a promising solution for deploying and scaling data processing and machine learning modules within cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). Docker provides a standardized way to package applications and their dependencies into self-contained units known as containers, ensuring consistent and reproducible execution across different platforms (Rosendo et al., 2022). Kubernetes, acting as a container orchestrator, manages their deployment, scaling, and networking across a cluster of machines (Rosendo et al., 2022). This combination presents several advantages for automated irrigation management systems.
Firstly, containerization facilitates efficient resource utilization and scalability. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies, containers enable the isolation of resources and prevent conflicts between different modules (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This isolation allows for the efficient allocation of resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to each container based on its specific needs. Kubernetes further enhances scalability by allowing for the automatic scaling of containers based on real-time demand, ensuring the system can adapt to varying workloads and data volumes, preventing bottlenecks, and ensuring responsiveness to changing conditions (Karamolegkos et al., 2023).
Secondly, containerization promotes portability and reproducibility. By packaging applications and their dependencies into a single unit, containers make it easy to move and deploy them across different cloud environments without the need for environment-specific configurations (Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This portability simplifies the development and deployment process, reducing the time and effort required to set up and manage the system. Additionally, containers ensure reproducibility by providing a consistent execution environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This eliminates variability and ensures that the system will behave consistently across different deployments (Zhou et al., 2023).
Optimizing container orchestration and resource allocation is crucial to minimizing latency and maximizing throughput in real-time data processing pipelines. Techniques like auto-scaling and dynamic resource allocation play a critical role in this context (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Werner and Tai, 2023; Kumar et al., 2024). Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of container instances based on real-time demand, ensuring that sufficient resources are available to handle peak workloads while avoiding over-provisioning during periods of low demand (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2024). Dynamic resource allocation enables the fine-grained adjustment of resources allocated to each container based on its specific needs and the current workload (Werner and Tai, 2023). This ensures efficient resource allocation and provides each container with the necessary resources to perform its tasks effectively.
Performance monitoring tools, such as Kubernetes Metrics Server and Prometheus, are essential for gaining insights into the performance of containers and the overall system (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kuity & Peddoju, 2023). These tools provide valuable data on key performance indicators, such as CPU and memory usage, network traffic, and application-specific metrics. By monitoring this data, administrators can identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation strategies, and continuously improve system performance (Hethcoat et al., 2024). This data-driven approach ensures that automated irrigation management systems can operate efficiently and reliably.
By integrating containerization technologies with optimization techniques and performance monitoring, automated irrigation management systems achieve the scalability, autonomy, and efficiency required for effective real-time data processing and decision-making. This approach facilitates a seamless and responsive system that can adapt to changing conditions and contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity.

4.3. Deploying ML Models for Data Processing
Transitioning from data collection, preprocessing, and transmission, the deployment of machine learning (ML) models marks a pivotal stage in the automated irrigation management pipeline. This stage entails utilizing cloud platforms to facilitate real-time data processing and inference, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimal irrigation management and ultimately contributing to fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
Several architectures and frameworks exist for deploying ML models on cloud platforms, each offering unique advantages and catering to different requirements. TensorFlow Serving, for instance, provides a high-performance system specifically designed for serving TensorFlow models (Abadi et al., 2016). This framework enables efficient and scalable inference, making it suitable for real-time applications where low latency and high throughput are crucial. For instance, in a large-scale irrigation system with numerous sensors generating data continuously, TensorFlow Serving can efficiently handle the high volume of inference requests and provide timely predictions for irrigation scheduling. Similarly, Apache MXNet Model Server offers a flexible and efficient solution for deploying models trained with MXNet, supporting a wide range of deep learning models and inference backends (MXNet Developers, 2015). This versatility makes it suitable for complex irrigation systems that may utilize different types of ML models for various tasks, such as predicting crop water requirements, detecting plant stress, or forecasting weather conditions. ONNX Runtime, on the other hand, provides a cross-platform inference engine compatible with various ML frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet (Microsoft, 2017). This versatility enables the deployment of models in diverse environments, facilitating interoperability and reducing the need for model conversion. For example, an irrigation system that uses models trained in different frameworks can utilize ONNX Runtime to deploy them on a single platform without the need for time-consuming and error-prone model conversion processes.
Choosing the appropriate architecture or framework depends on several factors, including the specific ML framework used for model training, the desired level of performance and scalability, and the need for cross-platform compatibility. For instance, if the primary concern is low latency and high throughput for real-time inference, TensorFlow Serving might be the optimal choice for TensorFlow models. However, if flexibility and support for various deep learning models are required, Apache MXNet Model Server could be more suitable. In cases where cross-platform compatibility is essential, ONNX Runtime offers a versatile solution.
Once the ML model is deployed, optimizing its performance and resource utilization becomes crucial for ensuring the efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems. Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, offer effective methods for reducing the size and computational requirements of ML models without compromising accuracy (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Pruning involves eliminating unnecessary connections or neurons from the model, effectively streamlining its structure and reducing computational complexity. This can be particularly beneficial for deep learning models, which often have a large number of parameters and can be prone to overfitting. By removing redundant or less important connections, pruning can improve modelgeneralizability and reduce inference time. Quantization, on the other hand, involves reducing the precision of model parameters, typically from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower-precision formats such as 8-bit integers. This reduction in precision leads to smaller model sizes and faster inference speeds, making it particularly beneficial for resource-constrained environments or real-time applications. For instance, in edge computing scenarios where ML models are deployed on devices with limited computational resources, quantization can enable efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, hardware acceleration through the utilization of GPUs or TPUs can significantly enhance model performance by leveraging specialized hardware designed for parallel processing (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). GPUs, with their massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth, excel at accelerating matrix operations and convolutions, which are fundamental computations in many deep learning models. This acceleration can significantly reduce inference time and enable real-time processing of sensor data for timely irrigation decisions. TPUs, specifically designed for deep learning workloads, offer even greater performance and energy efficiency for specific model architectures. These hardware accelerators can drastically reduce inference time, enabling near real-time decision-making and enhancing the responsiveness of automated irrigation systems. For example, in a scenario where immediate response to changing weather conditions or soil moisture levels is critical, hardware acceleration can ensure that irrigation decisions are made and executed promptly.
In addition to model compression and hardware acceleration, distributed training techniques play a crucial role in optimizing the training process for large-scale ML models. Techniques such as Horovod and BytePS enable the distribution of training across multiple machines, effectively parallelizing the process and reducing training time (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). This is particularly beneficial for complex models with a large number of parameters or when dealing with large datasets. By leveraging distributed training, irrigation management systems can train more sophisticated models and improve their predictive capabilities, leading to more accurate and efficient irrigation decisions. For instance, a system that utilizes a deep learning model with millions of parameters can benefit from distributed training to reduce training time from days to hours, enabling faster model iteration and improvement.
Integrating the deployed ML models with other components of the automated irrigation management pipeline is essential for achieving a fully autonomous and cohesive system and addressing the need for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system. Standardized protocols, such as MQTT and CoAP, provide lightweight and efficient communication channels for exchanging data between these components (Poojara et al., 2023; Jimenez et al., 2020a; Gour et al., 2023). MQTT, with its publish-subscribe architecture, enables real-time data streaming and event-driven communication, making it suitable for transmitting sensor data, control signals, and inference results (Raikar & M, 2023). This enables the ML model to receive real-time updates on soil moisture, weather conditions, and plant health, allowing for dynamic adjustments to irrigation schedules based on the latest data. CoAP, designed for constrained devices and low-power networks, offers a web-transfer protocol for resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient communication between sensors, actuators, and the ML models (Raikar & M, 2023). This is particularly relevant in situations where sensors or actuators have limited processing power or battery life, as CoAP minimizes communication overhead and energy consumption. Additionally, RESTful APIs provide a standardized interface for accessing and controlling the ML models, enabling seamless integration with other software components and facilitating system management and monitoring (Wang et al., 2022). This allows for easy integration with existing farm management systems or third-party applications, creating a unified platform for comprehensive irrigation management.4.4. Online Learning in the Cloud
The complexities of real-time data processing in irrigation management necessitate the exploration of advanced techniques to continuously learn and adapt to the dynamic nature of agricultural environments. Online learning algorithms offer a promising solution, enabling the continuous update and improvement of machine learning models based on incoming real-time data. This adaptability is crucial for addressing the challenges of changing environmental conditions, such as weather patterns and crop growth stages, and optimizing irrigation decision-making to enhance water usage efficiency and crop productivity.
Several online learning algorithms have demonstrated potential for real-time data processing and model adaptation in the context of irrigation management. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) facilitates the incremental update of model parameters with each new data point, allowing for efficient adaptation to changing data distributions (Bottou, 2010). This incremental learning process ensures that the model remains responsive to the latest conditions, minimizing the risk of outdated predictions and improving the accuracy of irrigation decisions. Passive-Aggressive algorithms, on the other hand, adjust model parameters only when a misclassification occurs, providing a computationally efficient approach for handling large data streams (Crammer et al., 2006). These algorithms offer a robust approach to handling noisy data, a common challenge in real-world sensor readings, by making small adjustments only when the model's prediction deviates significantly from the actual value (Fei et al., 2019). Online Random Forests extend the concept of random forests to the online setting, enabling the incremental construction and update of decision trees as new data arrives (Saffari et al., 2009). The continuous evolution of the ensemble ensures that the model remains relevant to the changing environment, capturing intricate relationships between variables and leading to more informed irrigation decisions.
Research in various domains highlights the importance of online learning for real-time data stream analytics. Snyder et al. (2020) explored the application of online learning techniques for identifying relevant tweets in real-time, improving situational awareness for first responders. The proposed interactive learning framework allows users to continuously label the relevance of incoming tweets, enabling the real-time refinement of the underlying machine learning model. This user-guided approach aligns well with the dynamic nature of irrigation management, where models need to continuously adjust to varying environmental conditions and crop water requirements. Similarly, research in the field of cyber-physical systems (CPS) underscores the need for online learning algorithms to effectively extract insights and knowledge from continuously generated data streams (Fei et al., 2019). These capabilities are crucial for enabling feedback loops between physical processes and cyber elements, facilitating the integration and optimization of CPS in irrigation management systems.
To implement online learning in cloud-based irrigation management systems, various architectures and frameworks can be considered. Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis provide scalable and fault-tolerant platforms for processing real-time data streams, allowing for the development of online learning pipelines that continuously ingest and analyze data to update machine learning models (Zaharia et al., 2012; Carbone et al., 2015; Amazon Web Services, 2023). These frameworks leverage serverless computing paradigms, automatically scaling resources based on the volume and velocity of incoming data, ensuring efficient resource utilization and responsiveness to fluctuations in demand (Fei et al., 2019).
Effectively managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off is crucial for optimizing online learning in irrigation management. Techniques such as Multi-armed bandits (Sutton & Barto, 2018), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018) can be employed to balance the allocation of resources between exploring new irrigation strategies and exploiting the current best-performing approaches. These techniques enable the identification of optimal irrigation policies, adapting to changing environmental conditions and maximizing long-term rewards.
In conclusion, online learning techniques, coupled with scalable cloud-based architectures, offer a powerful solution for real-time data processing and continuous adaptation in irrigation management systems. By leveraging algorithms like SGD, Passive-Aggressive, and Online Random Forests, along with stream processing frameworks like Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis, irrigation management systems can effectively handle the complexities of real-time data, optimize water usage, and enhance crop productivity in the face of dynamic environmental conditions.

5. GENERATING AND APPLYING IRRIGATION INSIGHTS 
5.1. Real-Time Generation of Actionable Irrigation Insights
The transition from data collection and processing to actionable irrigation insights requires the extracting spatial features from images, allowing for the analysis of satellite or drone imagery to assess crop health, detect water stress, and provide insights into irrigation needs (Os deployment of advanced predictive models capable of generating precise and site-specific irrigation recommendations.roosh et al., 2016).
Furthermore, the integration Deep learning models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and of data from diverse sources, including IoT sensors and cloud-based platforms, plays Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have demonstrated excellent performance in capturing complex relationships a critical role in enhancing the accuracy and resolution of real-time irrigation insights. Data fusion techniques, such as Kalman filtering, offer a robust approach for combining information between input variables and predicting crop water requirements (Keller, 2023; Naphade et al., 2022). These models can effectively from multiple sensors, accounting for noise and uncertainty, and providing a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements (Cohen et al., 2005; Mö handle the temporal dependencies present in time-series data, such as soil moisture andeller et al., 2007). By integrating data from soil moisture weather data, and learn to predict future water needs based on historical patterns and current sensors, weather stations, and remote sensing platforms, ML models can generate more accurate conditions. Ensemble methods, such as Random Forests, also offer a robust approach to and site-specific irrigation recommendations, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity prediction by combining multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce the risk of overfitting.
The heterogeneity, uncertainty, and quality issues inherent in real-time data streams require careful consideration and the implementation of effective strategies to ensure the reliability of generated (Singh et al., 2016).
The integration of irrigation insights. Data preprocessing techniques, such as outlier detection and missing value imputation, IoT sensor data with cloud-based data sources is crucial for enhancing the accuracy and resolution of irrigation insights. IoT sensors, such as soil moisture probes and weather stations are essential for preparing the data for analysis and preventing erroneous data from influencing the model, provide real-time, localized data on crop and environmental conditions, while cloud's predictions (Fiksel, 2003). Additionally,-based sources, such as weather forecasts and satellite imagery, offer broader spatial and the selection of appropriate ML models and data fusion techniques should be tailored to the specific temporal perspectives (López-Morales et al., 2020). characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data to mitigate uncertainty and ensure the robustness Data fusion techniques, such as Kalman filtering, play a critical role in combining these of generated insights.
To address computational complexity and latency challenges in real-time irrigation insight generation, techniques such as edge computing, model compression, and hardware accelerators heterogeneous data sources to generate more accurate and comprehensive irrigation recommendations (Cohen et al., offer promising solutions. Edge computing enables the distribution of processing tasks closer to the data 2005; Möeller et al., 2007 source, reducing latency and enabling faster response times (Mishra, 20). By incorporating data from multiple sources, irrigation models can better account for spatial variability20; Zhang et al., 2020). Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, can significantly reduce the size and computational requirements of in soil moisture, microclimate conditions, and crop water requirements, leading to more ML models without compromising accuracy, making them suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge precise and efficient irrigation scheduling.
The seamless integration of ML-generated insights with IoT-enabled irrigation control systems requires the adoption of appropriate architectures and protocols that facilitate devices (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Hardware lightweight, real-time communication. The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT accelerators, such as GPUs and TPUs, provide specialized hardware designed for parallel processing) protocol and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are well-suited, enabling faster inference speeds and facilitating real-time data analysis (Premkumar for this purpose, offering efficient and reliable communication channels for exchanging data between sensors, & Sigappi, 2022). The combined utilization of these techniques can significantly improve the efficiency and responsiveness of real-time irrigation insight generation, contributing actuators, and ML models (Muangprathub et al., 2019; Osroosh et al., 2016). to the overall goal of achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
The implementation MQTT's publish-subscribe architecture enables real-time data streaming and event- of these strategies and techniques for real-time generation of actionable irrigation insights provides a solid foundation for developing automated and data-driven irrigation management systems that can effectively addressdriven communication, while CoAP's lightweight design and low overhead make it suitable the global food challenge by optimizing water resource utilization and maximizing agricultural productivity.
for resource-constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks. By utilizing these protocols, irrigation systems can achieve seamless integration between ML models and IoT devices, enabling the automated application of irrigation insights based on real-time data and predictions.
Industry-leading products and services for smart irrigation demonstrate the practical application of these technologies. Smart irrigation controllers, such as Rachio, leverage weather data and soil moisture sensors to automatically adjust irrigation schedules based on real-time conditions, reducing water waste and promoting water conservation (Verdouw et al., 2023). Cloud-based irrigation management platforms, such as CropX, offer advanced analytics and decision support tools, providing farmers with insights into crop water requirements, soil health, and irrigation performance (Weikmann et al., 2023). These platforms often incorporate machine learning algorithms to generate predictive models and provide farmers with data-driven recommendations for optimizing irrigation strategies.
The analysis of these products and services highlights the growing trend toward data-driven, automated irrigation management. By integrating IoT, machine learning, and cloud computing, these solutions enable farmers to make more informed and efficient irrigation decisions, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture.

IoT will enable farmers to decide and act based on data collected from sensor nodes regarding field conditions and not purely based on experience, thus minimizing the wastage of supplies (seeds, water, pesticide, and fumigants). On the other hand, CNN complements monitoring systems with tasks such as the early detection of crop diseases or predicting the number of consumable resources and supplies (water, fertilizers) needed to increase productivity. This paper proposes SAgric-IoT, a technology platform based on IoT and CNN for precision agriculture, to monitor environmental and physical variables and provide early disease detection while automatically controlling the irrigation and fertilization in greenhouses. The results show SAgric-IoT is a reliable IoT platform with a low packet loss level that considerably reduces energy consumption and has a disease identification detection accuracy and classification process of over 90%. Keywords: convolutional neural networks; plant disease; precision agriculture; precision farming; internet of things; wireless sensor networks; IEEE 802.15.4 1. Introduction As the world population increases uncontrollably, two critical resources are becoming a severe problem: water and food. The technical report published in [1] estimates that the world population will reach 9.15 billion in 2050. This trend motivates a growing food production to accommodate the large global population with the consequent limitation in farmlands and a decreasing number of farmers as fewer people are willing to work in farming. For example, a Virginia winery applied to hire foreign workers to pick grapes after the company could not find American citizens who wanted the job [2]. Agriculture provides the required food but consumes most of the Earth’s available fresh water. In Europe, the agricultural sector consumes a third of the total water supplies, affecting the quantity and quality of open water for other uses [3]. In Mexico, 75.72% of water is used in agriculture [4]. For example, about 240 gallons of water are required to produce a loaf of bread, and a pound of cheese takes about 382 gallons. So, a simple cheese sandwich takes about 56 gallons of water [5]. Several governments have made investing in the agricultural sector a priority. In Mexico, the Federal Government defined agricultural technification as a goal of 520 thousand hectares, representing 10 percent of the ground with irrigation systems [6]. In a global world, it is critical to efficiently monitor crops to significantly increase production and rationalize the use of consumables, materials, and supplies, as well as regulate, more precisely, the crop needs regarding irrigation water, fertilizers, fumigants, and pesticides. Preserving the water is an essential factor that considerably affects agriculture and requires the development of automated mechanisms to use it efficiently. Fertilizers, fumigants, and pesticides help grow vital crops and produce better harvests. However, when misused, they could be detrimental to plants and render them inedible for human consumption. The use of technology will improve the proper use of resources applied to agriculture. The purpose of applying technology is to improve labor and land yields while optimizing the use of resources. However, agriculture automation is complex, as several problems must be solved. Applying technology to automate the agricultural environment will demand more technically savvy farmers who can manage data. That is why it is necessary to modernize the process and train the farmer to develop his technological skills. That is why it is necessary to generate simple mechanisms that thoroughly explain the data obtained. However, the system must be considered an assistant adapted to the needs and knowledge of the farmer. Agricultural production can be affected by different circumstances, such as plant diseases and pests, which, according to the FAO, are responsible for 20 to 40% of production losses [7]. However, manually monitoring all supplies, soil variables, environmental conditions, and crop health is a challenge that demands a lot of effort. An easy way to monitor and gather ecological information over long periods is required [8]. Therefore, the development and deployment of new technological solutions and methods to improve and automatize water use and detect crop diseases, considering not only the experience of farmers but also soil conditions and characteristics, types of plants, and climatic information, are needed. Technology in agriculture evolved into the precision agriculture concept, which focuses on ensuring that the crops and soil perform optimally. Precision agriculture provides profitability, sustainability, and environmental protection [9] based on field information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and pH level, among others. Farmers can make informed decisions about consumable resources and supplies (water, fertilizers, and pesticides) to maximize crop yield and protect the environment and their product consumers using precision agriculture. In [10], authors defined three essential tasks for precision control of the production environment: (I) monitoring parameters that influence the product yield and quality, (II) performing an in-depth analysis of collected data for making decisions, and (III) applying the best actions and mechanisms based on those decisions. Several technology-based solutions for gathering and processing information (such as [11,12,13,14,15]) to support agriculture, facilitate decision making, and enhance productivity have been proposed in the literature. Moreover, recent advances in electronic technology enabled the creation of new, smaller, and cheaper devices for gathering environmental data to support ubiquitous computing, ad-hoc and sensor networks, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things [10,16]. IoT helps cultivate the soil using cheap, easy-to-install devices to increase farm productions to meet the world’s food demands based on precision agriculture [17,18,19], intelligent irrigation control [20,21,22], and greenhouse monitoring [23,24,25]. This technology can be applied in open and closed spaces to optimize consumables and supplies (fertilizers, pesticides, soil, and water) by setting automated alarms and threshold values for each resource. Suppose one collected data is out of the threshold value. In that case, a warning will be triggered, thus detecting problems affecting production and reducing the excessive consumption of supplies shortage risk. On the other hand, plant monitoring is imperative to detect diseases early and implement mechanisms to prevent their spread and production losses [26]. Traditional methods focus on either I) expert visual estimation or II) laboratory studies [27]. The first method is subjective and therefore has low accuracy. The second method identifies morphological characteristics to detect the disease. The main problem with these methods is that they are expensive, time consuming to process, and their detection efficiency is low. In recent years, plant disease detection automatization has integrated technologies such as image processing [28,29], pattern recognition [30,31], and computer vision [32,33]. This paper presents SAgric-IoT, a technology platform based on IoT and CNN for monitoring physical variables and plant disease detection for precision farming. The platform uses communication algorithms for data monitoring and analysis for precision control of the production environment. In addition, it uses convolutional neural networks for plant disease identification and classification. We aim to develop a robust, low-maintenance, and low-cost IoT platform to control and optimize crop production. The remaining paper sections are as follows. Section 2 reviews IoT and precision agriculture. Section 3 describes the proposed technological platform in detail. Section 4 explains the system evaluation, describes the scenario, assessment, and results obtained from a small-scale network, and Section 5 summarizes our work and proposes future research. 2. Related Work IoT has had a strong impetus in the last few years. In the literature, several works propose IoT architectures and platforms suited for applications such as agriculture [19,34,35], traffic control [36,37,38], smart cities [39,40,41], education [42,43,44], marine environments [45,46,47], and health care [48,49,50,51,52]. Technology and IoT-based agricultural applications for control and automatization of physical variables monitoring (such as soil temperature and moisture, leaf wetness) for precision agriculture have been published in the literature [53,54,55,56,57,58]. The results obtained in this work were the nodes’ design, the simple node interconnection architectures based on IoT or wireless sensor networks design, and a combination to create a communication network of nodes for crop monitoring. Other IoT-based platforms control water consumption using cellular technologies and cloud services [59,60,61]. However, the main problem of these works is that they only show prototype nodes that control or monitor water usage but only evaluate their performance without showing concrete results. In [62], the authors present a collaboration between process control and remote sensors. However, the authors did not explain the data acquisition and delivery process from different sources (sensors, actuators, coordinators). Most of these applications use proprietary systems to generate and process vast amounts of data, sometimes only at the research level [63]. The main problem with these works is that they only remain in architecture proposals without developing prototype nodes to test in real scenarios. Authors in [64,65] focused on minimizing production risk using wireless sensor networks for real-time monitoring and studying the inter-temporal environmental variability. Their results showed the importance of measuring and recording inter-temporal conditions that contribute to making decisions that improve productivity in agriculture, reinforcing the rationale for how IoT technology contributes to and facilitates the data collection process. In [66,67], authors studied the effects of energy balance in greenhouse production and the optimization of energy consumption in grape production to increase energy efficiency. The results show an improvement of up to 31% in energy consumption in greenhouses compared to those that do not use IoT technologies. In reference [68], the authors argue that cleaner crop production procedures would improve energy efficiency in agriculture. However, authors in [69] argued that technology is not the unique factor influencing modern agriculture. The key to a smooth transition toward sustainable agriculture requires the collaboration of technology, farmers, industries, financial institutions, and policy and decision-makers, among others. This collaboration would resolve conflicts and reduce deficiencies to promote sustainable development [70]. For disease detection, convolutional neural networks have become one of the most widely used tools for this activity [71,72,73,74]. In [75], CNNs have been combined with learning vector quantization (LVQ) to detect and classify tomato leaf diseases. In another work, the authors combined four CNN models (Inception, Resnet, Inception Resnet, and Densenet) for plant disease detection, achieving an accuracy of 87% [76]. Other authors have focused on creating real-time models for rapidly detecting plant diseases [77,78,79,80] and evaluated the performance of models such as LeNet, VGG16, ResNet, and Xception in plant disease detection, obtaining accuracy levels of around 95%. Finally, some authors have proposed their models, getting results with accuracy levels of up to 98% [81,82,83,84]. 3. SAgric-IoT Platform Description SAgric-IoT is an easy-to-deploy, use, maintain, and upgrade platform for monitoring and controlling IoT for agricultural production. SAgric-IoT is based on low-cost and low-powered components which would be adapted to the farmer’s requirements. SAgric-IoT is focused on monitoring, data gathering, data processing, and data analysis to improve the efficiency of open and closed fields, reducing human interactions and rationalizing the use of water and other resources. In this section, we first describe the general scenario used in SAgric-IoT. Next, we provide a review of the logical architecture of SAgric-IoT. Then, we explain in detail the designed hardware for our platform. We describe the dissemination protocol used in SAgric-IoT. Finally, we describe the convolutional neural network model implemented for plant disease detection. 3.1. General Scenario Figure 1 shows the IoT on-site scenario for the SAgric-IoT platform. The architecture consists of four main nodes: the sensor nodes, the camera nodes, the gateway node, and the processing and storage node. Sensor nodes gather data from all sensors and periodically send it to the gateway node via other sensor nodes or directly, depending on the node’s distance from the gateway node. They are deployed on the greenhouses and establish a wireless network (based on 802.15.4) to communicate among themselves using radio-frequency links. The camera nodes send the images via Wi-Fi to the gateway node, where the trained CNN model for plant disease detection is stored. When the model identifies a possible disease situation in the crop area, a notification indicates the camera’s location and the detection image. A gateway node is also deployed along with the sensor nodes to enable a connection between the SAgric-IoT platform and the Internet (cloud server). The gateway node supports three communication interfaces: ZigBee to maintain communication with the sensor nodes, Wi-Fi to connect to the camera nodes, and a cellular interface to transmit data to the storage and processing node. A farmer has remote access to the gathering data to know the greenhouse conditions and control the different sensor and actuator devices and alert notifications when the CNN model detects a crop health problem situation. The gateway node includes a cellular network interface to transmit all gathered data to the cloud server. A web and mobile application were created as a cloud service to consult data information, receive alert notifications, and decide about control systems. Figure 1. General scenario for SAgric-IoT. 3.2. Layered IoT Architecture The SAgric-IoT design complies with the remote monitoring needs, contributing to reducing human resource investment. SAgric-IoT defines a five-layered model (as shown in Figure 2) with a transparent interconnection of all platform components and data dissemination in the agriculture precision area. The defined architecture covers all seven OSI model layers, as described in the following sentences. The gathering layer comprises the data link and physical layers. The communication layer is integrated with the data link and network layers. Finally, the processing and end-user layers are directly related to the four upper layers (transport, session, presentation, and application). The security layer is a transversal layer that interacts with the other layers of the architecture to obtain an end-to-end security level. Figure 2. SAgric-IoT five-layered architecture. 3.2.1. Gathering Layer The gathering layer collects data relevant to physical environmental parameters from a given area of interest from all the sources on farmland and sensor nodes on the fields (such as air temperature and humidity, soil temperature and moisture, and pH, among others). It also captures images through the cameras distributed in the monitoring region. In the last decade, several efforts have developed and defined low-power D2D standards and solutions [85,86,87], generating many promising radio technologies for D2D connectivity for local and wide area networks. One of the key challenges is determining the best data-transmission networking technology based on: transmission time, range, network size, and so on [88,89,90]. Table 1 summarizes some of the results of these past studies. Table 1. Comparison of wireless technologies for inter-node communication. 3.2.2. Communication Layer The communication layer transmits all data collected by sensor nodes to the gateway. This layer defines the communication protocol for data transmission. As sensors are stationary, the network topology does not change. Additionally, data transmission requires low latency, high reliability, and a high level of security to protect the collected data. The gateway node is powered by both ZigBee and Wi-Fi interfaces. This layer selects the best route to send the information by using several selection parameters, such as RSSI and the number of hops. 3.2.3. Processing Layer This layer processes large amounts of information using policy-based management to trigger alarms and improve production. Additionally, government agencies use processed results (such as SAGARPA in México) to develop production maps to help farmers define the best crops, the best fertilizers, and the quantity of water required for each season or production phase. Each crop type has its own value range for each physical parameter (such as soil temperature and humidity, pH level, environmental temperature, and moisture). These values are recorded on the platform. Table 2 shows an example of ideal physical parameters for tomatoes. Data are evaluated in real time to detect atypical values from the different physical parameters (values outside the defined range) that can represent abnormal conditions. Based on the data, the system can activate other systems (such as irrigation systems). Table 2. Physical parameters for tomatoes [89]. The processing layer supports an extensive database that can accommodate massive amounts of data from the sensor nodes relayed through the communication layer. The database is interfaced with data analysis algorithms and real-time scripts for data visualization and evaluation (Figure 3). Figure 3. Block diagram of the cloud server in SAGric-IoT. The gateway node also implements the processing layer, where the CNN model is stored and processed to identify and classify diseases in the crop. 3.2.4. End User Layer This layer is responsible for facilitating the farmer’s access to the data through a web service and software tools using a web and mobile application. 3.2.5. Security Layer Security in the sensor nodes’ communication is essential within the SAgric-IoT system. The nodes provide mechanisms for devices’ access control to the network, encryption (using symmetric key cryptography), and integrity to verify that the received frames were not altered, following the security schemes defined in the 802.15.4 standard. The data are encrypted before being sent (128-bit AES encryption) and then decrypted at the receiver for use. The following parameters were configured in each Xbee node: first, E.E. = 1: AES encryption enable, and the parameter KY: AES encryption key with a string of 32 hexadecimal characters. Second, the camera nodes’ security with WPA2. The service provider controls the security of the processing and storage layers. Finally, the end-user accesses the system using a specific username and password and the secure HTTP protocol for connection to the system. 3.3. Electronical Board The main challenge of the design of the SAgric-IoT was to build low-cost and energy-efficient hardware capable of monitoring, gathering, and controlling physical parameters. The hardware board comprises four modules: microcontroller, sensors and actuators, energy, and a wireless communication module, as shown in Figure 4. Figure 4. Sensor node block diagram. The microcontroller module gathers information from the attached sensors and relays such data to the gateway node. Depending on the application, the microcontroller can be battery-powered, solar-powered, or backup battery-powered. We used the Microchip PIC18LF46K22 microcontroller that executes up to 16 MIPS (millions of instructions per second); an input voltage of 3.3 V is required, and its CPU max current is 9.0 mA due to its specifications and low cost. The microcontroller has 64 K bytes for program memory, 3896 bytes for RAM, and 1024 bytes for EEPROM memory. An onboard 10-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with 28 analog input channels and 35 I/O pins. Sensors and actuators are used in precision agriculture to measure different environmental parameters. We use the sensor shown in Table 3. Table 3. Used sensors in SAgric-IoT. AM2315 is an I2C-interface temperature and humidity sensor (Figure 5a). This sensor contains a DS18B20 temperature sensor and a capacitive humidity sensor. It has 3.5 to 5.5 V power and I/O and uses 10 mA max current during conversion. On the other hand, the AM2302 is a basic, low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor (Figure 5b). It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air and outpost a digital signal on the data pin. The SHT-10 sensor includes a temperature/humidity sensor module (Figure 5c). The casing is weatherproof and will keep water from seeping into the sensor’s body and damaging it, but it allows air to pass through so it can measure the soil’s humidity (moisture). Humidity and temperature have 4.5% and 0.5% precision readings, respectively. Figure 5. Sensors for SAgric-IoT (a) AM2315, (b) AM2302, and (c) SHT-10. We use XBee S2C radios connected to a microcontroller through a UART (universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter). This module operates on the 2.4 GHz ISM band, which significantly reduces the power consumption of our design. In addition, the module has a coverage area of up to 60 m in indoor spaces and 1200 m in outdoor locations with a line-of-sight range. It has a transmit power output of 3.1 mW. XBee modules provide wireless connectivity to end-point devices in ZigBee mesh networks. The gateway nodes use Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, which has a 1.2 GHz 64-bit quad-core ARMv8 CPU, an integrated 802.11n wireless LAN and Bluetooth 4.1, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), 4 USB ports, a display interface (DSI), and a micro-SD card slot. The camera nodes consist of an ESP32-CAM board with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and an OV2640 camera (Figure 6). This module contains a microSD card slot that serves as a support for the storage of images captured with the camera. Figure 6. ESP32-CAM module used for plant monitoring. 3.4. Proposed Dissemination Protocol For the design of the dissemination protocol, we considered two critical issues: energy and reliability. Energy is the most important issue when designing dissemination protocols for IoT, where the application demands continuous information from the network field. For the design of the dissemination protocol: (I) we defined a static network architecture based on clusters; (II) the gateway node has no energy constraints; (III) the gateway node is not within the range of each sensor node, so a multi-hop transmission is needed; and (IV) heterogeneous sensors are implemented in each node. Our protocol defines three types of nodes: end-node, routing, and gateway. End-node nodes gather data from the sensors but cannot retransmit data to other sensor nodes. Routing nodes are responsible for collecting and retransmitting data from different sensor nodes. They also maintain a routing table that allows nodes to choose the best route for data transmission. Finally, the gateway node is the central node that receives all the gathered data from different sensor nodes and sends it to the Internet. Figure 7 shows the state diagram for the protocol. Figure 7. States diagram for SAGric-IoT. Our protocol defines data and controls messages. The protocol starts when a sensor node switches on. Each sensor node starts in the gateway node and sends a control message (Register.request) requesting its inclusion on the IoT network. The gateway node registers the new node and sends it the response (Register.response), where indicated, the type of node in the network (sensor or routing node), according to the number of hops the message takes to reach the gateway node. If the sensor node is an end node, it gathers data from different sensors, sends them to the gateway node, and changes its status to sleep to save energy. If the sensor node is a routing node, the node is also responsible for retransmitting the data from other sensors, so the sensor nodes wake up using a timer or a routing transmission request. The sensor node changes its status from disconnected to setup status when it receives the response. Afterward, the sensor and gateway nodes exchange messages (setup.request, and setup.response) to establish the gathering time for each sensor. At that moment, a sensor node is ready to begin the data gathering, so its status changes to the gathering status. In this status, the sensor nodes get sensor values, structure them into frames, and send them to the gateway node. When a sensor node gathers data from the different sensors, it sends a new message to the gateway node. SAgric-IoT uses the MAC data frame defined by IEEE 802.15.4 to build the message (Figure 8). Figure 8. Data message structure used in SAgric-IoT. The message contains frame control fields, destination address fields (in our case, we used 16-bit destination addresses), a data field where the data from the different sensors are included, and a checksum field to check that the message is not corrupted. This frame is sent to the gateway node through the data.transmit message. When the sensor node finishes sending data, it changes its status to Sleeping status (Sleep.on) to save energy for an established period. All sensors in the node and the microcontroller are off, and the node is considered a sleep node. When the sleeping time finishes, the sensor node wakes up and starts another data-gathering session from the sensors, or when the gateway node sends a request for information on data from the sensors. After the node gathers data and sends it to the gateway node, it goes to sleep again to save the battery (Sleep.on). 3.5. Convolutional Neural Network Model The following paragraphs explain the proposed architecture for the plant leaf disease detection and classification model. The proposed model takes color images of plant leaves as input and displays the image with a series of labels representing the plant leaf health state (whether it is healthy or the name of the detected disease) and the prediction percentage value obtained by the model as output. 3.5.1. Dataset We used the public PlantVillage dataset of 20,600 images in 10 categories, available at [91]. Table 4 shows the categorized information contained in the dataset. Table 4. Categories of the PlantVillage dataset. For the project, only the tomato categories were used to test the model (a total of 16,012 images) [92]. The total dataset was divided into two parts, assigning 80% of the images for training (12,810 images) and the rest for validation (3202 images). The problem with the models is that during the training process, overfitting can occur (i.e., the model “memorizes” the dataset) [93]. Thus, we applied a method known as data augmentation [88] to increase the dataset. New images were created using transformation methods (rotation, brightness adjustment, and Gaussian noise) to complement the dataset. 3.5.2. Model Creation A model based on a convolutional neural network architecture was developed for the plant disease detection process. The model takes color 200 × 200 images normalized to (0,1) as input for training and validation. The neural network architecture consists of five convolutional layers using 256, 128, 64, 32, and 16 filters, respectively. The kernel size for the 2D convolution window was 3 × 3. Rectified linear unit (ReLU) was used as the activation model for each convolutional layer. MaxPooling layers were applied to each convolutional layer. In addition, a global average pooling layer was applied to convert the data to a column vector. This layer is connected to a dense layer of 10 output nodes (which represent the categories used in the model) that uses softmax as the activation model. 3.5.3. Model Training Table 5 shows the parameters for training the model and the Adam optimization algorithm. The model’s loss function was categorical_cross_entropy, one of the most widely used functions for multi-class classification. The number of epochs was 200. Table 5. Parameters for the training of the model. 4. Results 4.1. Prototype Evaluation We examined two scenarios to demonstrate the benefits of using SAgric-IoT. For the first scenario, we validate the performance of the sensor node and the data gathered from the different sensors by performing tests in a controlled environment (laboratory). Data measurements for the environmental parameters such as temperature and humidity were recorded every minute for three days using a set of sensor nodes separated by 10 m from the base station and connected directly in a star topology. The idea was to determine the node’s energy consumption and data transmission reliability in a situation of maximum sense frequency. For the second scenario, sensor nodes were deployed throughout the field to evaluate the dissemination protocol’s data-transmission performance. The environmental parameter data measurements were collected every 5 min for three days. The set of sensor nodes separated approximately 50 m from each other, covering an area of 200 × 200 m, as shown in Figure 9. We defined levels to enable the multi-hop transmission model. Figure 9. Distribution of nodes for scenario 2. We evaluated SAgric-IoT performance by analyzing the nodes’ energy consumption and reliability. Moreover, we examined the performance of the SAgric-IoT protocol in comparison with an average transmission model without a sleep function into the node. For both scenarios, nine sensor nodes designed at the INNOVA THING® company (Colima, Mexico) and a gateway node were employed to interconnect a small-scale network. Two sensors per node gathered data from four physical variables (air temperature and humidity and soil humidity and temperature). For the cloud server, both Apache and MySQL were running on a computer with Ubuntu 14.04. The gateway node uses a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B with a 1.2 GHz 64-bit quad-core ARMv8 CPU, an integrated 802.11n wireless LAN and Bluetooth 4.1, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), 4 USB ports, a display interface (DSI), and a micro-SD card slot. Each sensor node was set to sense each variable every five minutes. In the test, we gathered around five thousand values from the sensors and stored them in the cloud server database. Scenarios Results Figure 10a,b shows the energy consumption for scenario 1 with different nodes in a controlled environment. Results show the battery lifetime of a system by continually logging the measurement data. We observed that a node used in SAgric-IoT decreased around 11% of the battery life of its maximal level. However, a node with a standard transmission without sleep mode decreased 62% the battery life of its maximal level. These test results showed that high measurement frequency and data transmission should be avoided as the battery life would significantly decrease over a few days, resulting in lower quality of measured data and frequent battery exchange. As shown, SAgric-IoT reduces the average energy consumption by almost 44% compared to a standard transmission without sleep mode. Figure 10. Results for scenario 1. (a) Energy consumption per node; (b) received packets per node. Figure 10b shows the percentage of received packets per node for both types of transmission. The rate of received packets obtained by both transmission models, considering a directly connected scenario, is similar, with a percentage of successful transmissions at 99%. Figure 11 shows the results obtained for the second scenario, and Figure 11a illustrates the energy consumption for the different nodes in the field environment. The difference was significant in the energy consumption from the various nodes. Nodes 1 and 2 consumed only 13% of their energy; nodes 3 to 5 consumed 9%, while nodes 6 and 7 consumed 5.6%, and nodes 8 and 9 consumed 3%. The main reason for that difference is the number of transmissions per node. As the nodes are nearer the gateway node, more communications are performed because they must transmit their data and data from other nodes. However, we observed that SAgric-IoT nodes saved around 26% more energy than nodes using transmission without our sleep mode, increasing the battery lifetime. Figure 11. Results for scenario 2. (a) Energy consumption per node; (b) received packets per node. The results show a significant difference between the two transmission modes, considering a multi-hop scenario. SAgric-IoT had a maximum loss of transmitted packets of 2%, while the other model had a total loss of 9%, as shown in Figure 11. In the initial conclusion, we can observe that the efficiency of SAgric-IoT is due to better control of the energy consumption for the sleep mode. If the energy consumption of the microcontroller and the sensors is regulated, the sensor nodes maximize their energetic benefits, increasing the node’s battery lifetime. 4.2. Model Evaluation The model was developed in Python with TensorFlow, Keras, and other libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and TensorBoard. Accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score were the evaluation metrics. The following equations represent how to calculate each. 𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦= 𝑇𝑃+𝑇𝑁 𝑇𝑃+𝑇𝑁+𝐹𝑃+𝐹𝑁 (1) 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛= 𝑇𝑃 𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑃 (2) 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙= 𝑇𝑃 𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑁 (3) 𝐹1 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒=2× (𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛×𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙) (𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛+𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙) (4) TP represents the number of optimistic predictions, TN represents the number of negative projections, FP represents the number of false positives, and FN represents the number of false negatives. Results Obtained Figure 12 shows the model’s performance for leaf disease identification and classification during the training and validation phases. The results show an accuracy of 97.4% in the training phase and 92% in the validation phase, which are pretty good values and are within the range of values obtained in other published works in the literature. Figure 12. Model’s accuracy values during the training and validation processes. A confusion matrix was generated to analyze the results of how our supervised algorithm works [94,95]. Figure 13 shows the confusion matrix. Figure 13. Confusion matrix of the proposed model, (0) tomato bacterial spot, (1) tomato late blight, (2) tomato yellow leaf curl virus, (3) tomato early blight, (4) tomato Septoria leaf spot, (5) tomato mosaic virus, (6) tomato target spot, (7) tomato leaf mold, (8) tomato spider mites two spotted, (9) tomato healthy. Results show that the proposed model predicted half of the classes with an accuracy equal to or greater than 98%. Only the class with the lowest number of images for training (Tomato_mosaic_virus) obtained a 94% value. Table 6 concentrates on the proposed model’s results in the dataset’s disease classification process for each class. The recall metric is high in each category of the dataset, showing that the accuracy of the proposed model is high (>90%), correctly classifying the diseases. Table 6. Class-wise performance of the proposed model. The model was saved as a hierarchical data file and was used during the prediction process, with some results shown in Figure 14. Figure 14. Sample predicted images using the proposed model. Finally, a comparison was made with a work that analyzes different techniques for disease detection in tomato plants [96]. ResNet50, Xception, MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and DenseNet were compared with the five techniques used in this work. Our model was trained with the dataset used in that work (Plant Village), but with 13,112 images. The dataset was distributed 80% for training and 20% for validation. The accuracy of the training process was compared. The results are shown in Figure 15. From these results, we can conclude two things. The first is that the proposed model only underperforms the VGG16 model structure with a difference of about 1.2%. The second conclusion is that our model had a similar performance even when the training used a smaller number of images, which shows the stability of the proposed model. Figure 15. Performance comparison of the proposed model and existing models. 5. Conclusions In this paper, we evaluated SAgric-IoT, an IoT platform, in terms of packet delivery ratio and energy consumption in a small-scale network under a controlled environment (laboratory) and test bed conditions in a field, including its embedded system, the communication protocol, and its algorithms. SAgric-IoT reduces the intensive human involvement required in current agricultural information collection systems and provides information in a faster way. Results proved that SAgric-IoT is superior in energy saving and reliability of transmission. On the other hand, the CNN model for identifying diseases in the crop has high levels of accuracy, with average values greater than 95%. This value has an acceptable reliability level for detecting early disease problems affecting the yield. We conclude that SAgric-IoT is a viable solution to improve precision agriculture because it is a wireless platform that uses low-power algorithms for gathering data. Our future work focuses on the platform’s security to avoid integrity problems with the collected data that cause a reduction in the quality or quantity of production. Another significant challenge to solve in the next phase is to go from a model trained with images taken in the laboratory to images generated directly in the sowing field. Due to the lack of context and diversity in plant appearance, deep learning models trained on individual leaf photographs may need help identifying plant diseases in full plant images. However, several studies have shown that the use of a combination of leaf and full plant images, and the use of deep learning techniques, can improve the accuracy of plant disease detection. For example, a study [97] to detect tomato plant diseases used a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with laboratory-taken leaf images and real-world leaf images. The real-world leaf includes other elements, such as stems and other leaves. With this combination of training, they achieved an accuracy rate of 99.53%. Another recent study [98] used various images from a leaf dataset and manually taken photos, along with deep learning techniques, to detect diseases in grapevine plants and achieved over 80% accuracy in this mixed scenario. In summary, a deep learning model trained only with images of a single leaf may have difficulties recognizing diseases in plants in pictures of a whole plant. Still, the combination of leaf and entire plant images, as well as deep learning techniques, can significantly improve accuracy in disease detection in plants. In future work, the model will be trained with complete plant images and implemented in the real-time plant monitoring scenario. This way, it will be possible to check the crops’ conditions by leaf samples and directly monitor the plants from the images captured by the camera system, fully integrating it into the SAgric-IoT platform.

Abstract Precision Agriculture (PA) promises to meet the future demands for food, feed, fiber, and fuel while keeping their production sustainable and environmentally friendly. PA relies heavily on sensing technologies to inform site-specific decision supports for planting, irrigation, fertilization, spraying, and harvesting. Traditional point-based sensors enjoy small data sizes but are limited in their capacity to measure plant and canopy parameters. On the other hand, imaging sensors can be powerful in measuring a wide range of these parameters, especially when coupled with Artificial Intelligence. The challenge, however, is the lack of computing, electric power, and connectivity infrastructure in agricultural fields, preventing the full utilization of imaging sensors. This paper reported AICropCAM, a field-deployable imaging framework that integrated edge image processing, Internet of Things (IoT), and LoRaWAN for low-power, long-range communication. The core component of AICropCAM is a stack of four Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) models running sequentially: CropClassiNet for crop type classification, CanopySegNet for canopy cover quantification, PlantCountNet for plant and weed counting, and InsectNet for insect identification. These DCNN models were trained and tested with >43,000 field crop images collected offline. AICropCAM was embodied on a distributed wireless sensor network with its sensor node consisting of an RGB camera for image acquisition, a Raspberry Pi 4B single-board computer for edge image processing, and an Arduino MKR1310 for LoRa communication and power management. Our testing showed that the time to run the DCNN models ranged from 0.20 s for InsectNet to 20.20 s for CanopySegNet, and power consumption ranged from 3.68 W for InsectNet to 5.83 W for CanopySegNet. The classification model CropClassiNet reported 94.5 % accuracy, and the segmentation model CanopySegNet reported 92.83 % accuracy. The two object detection models PlantCountNet and InsectNet reported mean average precision of 0.69 and 0.02 for the test images. Predictions from the DCNN models were transmitted to the ThingSpeak IoT platform for visualization and analytics. We concluded that AICropCAM successfully implemented image processing on the edge, drastically reduced the amount of data being transmitted, and could satisfy the real-time need for decision-making in PA. AICropCAM can be deployed on moving platforms such as center pivots or drones to increase its spatial coverage and resolution to support crop monitoring and field operations.

Introduction The demands for food, feed, fiber, and fuel increase rapidly due to the fast expansion of the global population, income growth, technological advancement, and transport and logistics improvements (van Dijk et al., 2021). Precision agriculture (PA), which seeks to apply the right amount of inputs (fertilizers, irrigation water, pesticides, and other chemicals) in the right location at the right time, is essential to meet the requirements of future global food production, as well as environmental sustainability and climate resilience. PA is predicated on accurate sensor measurements, timely and sound decision-making, and automated actuators. The backbone of PA is the Internet of Things (IoT) technology that automates data collection, data analytics, data presentation, control, and efficient data communication (Chamara et al., 2022). Imaging sensors or digital cameras are essential for PA as they can capture more information than traditional scalar or vector sensors. Images can capture crop phenology for precise decision-making (Taylor and Browning, 2022, Tian et al., 2020). Cyclic events such as vegetative growth, flowering, leaf count and color change, maturation, and senescence are studied in crop phenology, which is essential to PA as it determines the management inputs required by crops. Moreover, images have rich information on the scene that allows for pest pressure evaluation. At present, a limited number of sensors are available for pest identification and pest pressure estimation. Among them, imaging sensors provide the most promising solution. Conventional (handcrafted feature extraction) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based image processing are the two branches of image processing. Traditional approaches extract image features defined by shape, texture, and color (Anubha et al., 2019, Yuan et al., 2019). The AI-based methods use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract features from images (Luis et al., 2020). CNN models with multiple hidden layers for feature extraction and learning are considered Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) (LeCun et al., 1998). Conventional imaging platforms in PA store images locally using onboard storage memories. Post processing refers to the processing of images stored at the central data storage in batches at a later time to extract useful information (Aasen et al., 2020). Imaging platforms that can access the internet through a stable connection with high bandwidth can automatically upload images to Cloud data storage. The vast majority of farmlands worldwide are in rural and remote areas with poor access to electric power and internet connectivity. This represents a big challenge for camera systems deployed in rural farmlands for high-speed image processing, data transmission, and low-latency decision-making (Richardson, 2019). Post-processing of crop images has been used for the estimation of leaf area index (Aasen et al., 2020), growth rate (Sakamoto et al., 2012), leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen content (Wang et al., 2014), fruit counts (Wang et al., 2014), and plant height (Sritarapipat et al., 2014). Further post-image processing allows for the assessment of biotic stress, such as pest density (Barbedo, 2014; Park et al., 2007) and weed pressure (Wang et al., 2019), as well as abiotic stress, such as nutrient deficiency (Ghorai et al., 2021). Richardson (2019) suggested that deep learning-based methods have the potential to facilitate the extraction of more sophisticated phenological data from both new and previously archived camera imagery compared to conventional image processing. Semantic segmentation-based canopy coverage (CC) estimation (Chamara et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2023), image classification-based crop identification (Anubha et al., 2019), disease identification (Sharma et al., 2020), growth stage prediction (Yasrab et al., 2021) and object detection-based plant feature identification (A. Wang et al., 2019) are examples of DCNN applications in agriculture. Conventional image processing requires less computational power and less energy, but they are limited in adaption to new scenarios, while deep learning requires high computational power and consumes more energy. DCNN models require large memory due to the large number of parameters these models hold. Therefore, it is not easy to implement these models practically in embedded systems that have less memory and computation power. These models also require a large amount of data to train to predict with high accuracy. Therefore, it is resource intensive. Edge image processing is the image processing done on image-capturing devices. The main advantage of edge image computing is that it lowers the high throughput data transmission requirement over a wireless IoT-enabled imaging network (Cao et al., 2020). Wang et al. (2022a) demonstrated the capability of identifying potted flowers with precision above 89 % in real-time in a Jetson TX 2 computing module based on a DCNN algorithm. These authors suggested that a cloud-edge collaborative framework could achieve real-time and automatic learning for the DCNN model they have developed. Wang et al. (2022b) proposed a real-time weed detection model run on Jetson AGX Xavier for field robots. The authors proved it was possible to do real-time weed detection with a precision above 90 % yet required expensive hardware. Wang et al. (2022a) reviewed Raspberry Pi single-board computer-based real-time image processing applications. They concluded that Raspberry Pi (Datasheet Raspberry Pi Model B, 2019) is a cost-effective edge computing unit that could potentially be used as an edge image processing unit, and the capability of integrating it with IoT was also discussed. Zualkernan et al. (2022) demonstrated an edge image processing platform for the classification of animals and transmitting the identified animal and time of identification via LoRa for a camera trap. Past literature on IoT and image processing applications in agriculture has highlighted a research gap in edge image processing with IoT-enabled crop monitoring cameras. In-field crop cameras are expected to make real-time crop management decisions based on real-time image processing; however, poor internet connectivity in agricultural fields severely limits their capability. To address this gap, we have developed a novel imaging platform named AICropCAM that extracts plant and crop canopy level parameters through DCNN and uploads them to the Cloud via low-power, low-throughput communication protocols. We also demonstrated AICropCAM on an IoT-enable wireless sensor network in corn and soybean fields. A technology that addresses image processing at the lowest level (edge) and transmits only useful information can revolutionize real-time decision-making in PA. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to demonstrate AICropCAM to perform edge image processing and low-throughput, low-power, and long-range data transmission through IoT technology. In this novel AICropCAM platform, multiple DCNN image processing algorithms run in series to extract plant-level and canopy-level features in an embedded system. Image classification, object detection with classification, and image segmentation are the three major applications of DCNN image processing, and all three are included in AICropCAM to demonstrate the capabilities of DCNN for image processing in PA. AICropCAM has trained models for canopy segmentation, crop classification, plant growth stage identification, plant counting, weed counting, and plant type identification. All the protocols that transmit data from AICropCAM to the Cloud were custom designed. AICropCAM sends the generated data to a cloud platform for logging, visualization, and analysis. Furthermore, this paper explains the DCNN model training process, model performance, and test results. We reported the model training comprehensively because it was essential for AICropCAM development. 2. Materials and methods Essential activities in this research were data/image collection and preprocessing, hardware design for AICropCAM, software design for data transmission between the edge and the Cloud, deep learning model design, and model training and optimization (Fig. 1). AICropCAM was implemented in a corn and soybean field at the field phenotyping facility in Mead, Nebraska, USA (Bai et al., 2019). We demonstrated the training of the following DCNNs: CropClassiNet for classifying images based on image quality and crop type, CanopySegNet for segmenting crop canopy from the background, PlantCountNet for classifying and counting soybean and weed plants, and InsectNet for identifying insects and counting them.

Image collection, annotation, preprocessing, and augmentation Image collection for DCNN model training occurred in four growing seasons using three different types of cameras: (i) commercially available Meidas SL122 trail cameras in 2019 (Meidas Trail Cameras, 2022), (ii) OV5642 imaging sensors with ArduCAM camera shields in 2020, and (iii) Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 with Raspberry Pi Zero in 2021 and 2022 (Chamara, 2021). All the cameras were mounted on the bars horizontally extended and fixed on stationary poles erected vertically in the fields, as shown in Fig. 2A. The distance between the crop canopy and the cameras was maintained between 0.5 and 1.5 m throughout the growing seasons. Images used for training the InsectNet were also captured with smartphones as we could not collect enough images with insects from the three types of cameras mentioned above.

In addition to the camera, other components such as the solar panel and data logger were also shown. Right: A close-up view of AICropCAM and its hardware components. All three standard image annotation techniques in deep learning model training were utilized: (1) folder labeling for the image classification models, (2) pixel-level annotation for the semantic segmentation model, and (3) bounding boxes for object detection models. Images belonging to the same class were grouped into a single folder, and five distinct classes (or folders) were created: rejected, corn, soybean, grass, and night. Separating the crop canopy from the soil was done with pixel-level annotation and semantic segmentation. Bounding boxes, the smallest rectangle around an object, were drawn for corn plants, soybean plants, weed plants, and insects. Table 1 explains each type of annotation used in the model training. Table 1. Annotation criteria used to generate labels from the images to train and test the four deep convolutional neural network models in AICropCAM. Labeling Type Class Description Image classification (CropClassiNet) Rejected Images were labeled as rejected due to multiple reasons: blurred images caused by water droplets on the lens; the cameras turned away from the targeted crop; crops growing up to the camera blocking the view or capturing only a few leaves; people present in the images; lens covered with different stuff; and the camera was not installed in the field. Corn Images entirely covered by corn plants at different growth stages. Soybean Images entirely covered by soybean plants at different growth stages. Grass/Weed Images only comprise grass/weed plants at different growth stages. Night Images captured under low lighting conditions. Most of the cameras were not programmed to stop collecting images under low light. Crop canopy and background (CanopySegNet) Canopy Pixel labeling was done on the crop canopy. We used assisted freehand tool and the superpixel option in the MATLAB image labeler. Background Pixel labeling was done on the crop canopy. We used assisted freehand tool and the superpixel option in the MATLAB image labeler. Plant-type (PlantCountNet) Weed Weed present in the image was labeled using bounding boxes. It was challenging to locate the weed after the corn or soybean canopy was closed. Soybean Soybean plants present in the image were labeled using bounding boxes. Insects (InsectNet) Insects During the labeling process, without distinguishing insects based on their type, all the insects present in the images were labeled using bounding boxes. Image preprocessing is necessary for DCNN model training and real-time edge image processing. Differences in the input layer size in different DCNN models demand that images be resized before passing through the model for training or prediction purposes. High-resolution images improve accuracy but require more computational power. For specific applications, labeled datasets were only limitedly available. Therefore, image augmentation techniques were used to increase the number of image data sets, including scaling, flipping, cropping, rotation, color transformation, PCA color augmentation, and noise rejection (Paymode and Malode, 2022). Multiple augmentation techniques were used for each model, as detailed in Table 2. Additionally, Table 2 provides the numbers of images in training, validation, and testing for the four DCNN models. Table 2. DCNN model image allocation and image augmentation.

Therefore, we selected a limited number of images for CanopySegNet, PlantCountNet, and InsectNet, which were sufficient to train models with a reasonable degree of accuracy. 2.2. DCNN model architecture selection, training, evaluation, and deployment on the edge device The steps to select model architecture/model backbone weights and image input sizes to train the best model for CropClassiNet, CanopySegNet, PlantCountNet, and InsectNet are summarized in Fig. 3. Unlike many DCNN applications that prioritize higher accuracy, our application focused on finding the balance between accuracy and model deployability on the edge device.

DCNN model selection process during the training and testing by attempting different model architectures, model backdone weights, and input image sizes. For example, in the development of CropSegNet (Segmentation), we selected DeepLabv3+ (Firdaus-Nawi et al., 2018) with weights initialized from pre-trained networks of ResNet18 (He et al., 2016), ResNet50, Xception, InceptionresnetV2, and MobileNetV2. The input image sizes tested were 512 × 512 × 3 and 256 × 256 × 3, and training options were kept constant to find the best-performing networks, which should also be deployable to Raspberry Pi 4B. This process identified DeepLabv3 + with ResNet50 as the most suitable model for CropSegNet, with an input image size of 512 × 512 × 3.

(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7). Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score, and Jaccard index were used for the classification models CropClassiNet and CropSegNet, whereas IoU and mAP (Mean Average Precision) were used for PlantCountNet and InsectNet. Jaccard index gives the proportion of correctly predicted labels to the total number of labels. Model training was performed on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti Mobile processor, a dedicated mid-range graphics card with 4 GB GDDR6 memory on a Dell XPS 15 9500 Laptop. The laptop had an Intel Core i7-10750H 10th Gen processor,16 GB DDR4 RAM, and 1 TB SSD hard disk. 2.3. Hardware and software of AICropCAM The IoT data transmission and edge image processing hardware comprised the following major components: a Raspberry Pi 4B single-board computer, an Arduino MKR1310 development board, an Arduino MKR Relay Proto Shield, and a Dragino OLG02 outdoor dual channels LoRa Gateway (Fig. 4). The 12 V 8Ah battery powered the Raspberry Pi 4B, controlled through the relay shield managed by the Arduino MKR1310. A 3.7 V lithium polymer battery powered the Arduino MKR1310 board. There are two advantages of having a separate Arduino board. First, the Arduino board consumes less power than the Raspberry Pi 4B module. It can be switched on and off according to user requirements. Second, it allows uninterrupted communication between the edge node and the Cloud with low power. Download : Download high-res image (303KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Hardware overview of AICropCAM and data flow. AICropCAM required programming on two hardware platforms. Arduino was programmed using C++ in Arduino’s Integrated Development Environment. Raspberry Pi imaging and image processing program was developed in MATLAB and deployed onto the Raspberry Pi 4B using the MATLAB Coder and MATLAB Compiler. A python program was designed to read the saved data in the Raspberry Pi 4B and serially communicate to the Arduino MKR1310. The primary functions of the MRK1310 program were to (1) turn on the Raspberry Pi 4B module based on the user-defined time intervals, (2) get the processed data, including the results of DCNN model predictions, through serial communication from the Raspberry Pi 4B, and (3) transmit the data to the ThingSpeak Cloud channel through the LoRa gateway. All the DCNN models were trained using the MATLAB deep learning toolbox. In the edge deployment, a MATLAB program runs multiple models logically depending on the prediction result of the previous model estimation, as shown in Fig. 5. MATLAB coder generated the C and C++ code derived from the program we developed to run on the Raspberry Pi. MATLAB Compiler generated the standalone application on the Raspberry Pi (The MathWorks, 2022). Download : Download high-res image (477KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Overall sequential image processing and data generation flow chart. Table 4 lists the parameters generated by the models in AICropCAM. The abbreviations in Table 4 are fields holding data in the program to reduce the complexity of system development and maintain a common standard among different platforms. Fig. 6 shows the data generation from images. According to Fig. 6, the size of the images were around 2 MB before being fed into the image processing pipeline. The output message contains the crop type (CT), plant count (PC), weed count (WC), canopy coverage (CC), and pest count (PstC). The resulting message is typically less than 100 bytes. This represents a substantial reduction of memory size with the output being 0.00005 times the size of the original image. Consequently, this message can be transmitted in a single message via LoRa as the maximum LoRa packet size is around 256 bytes. Table 4.

Examples of message generation and data size reduction for LoRa transmission. 2.4. Data transmission, visualization, and storage The data generated after image processing were saved on the Raspberry Pi 4B SD card, allowing access to the data remotely or through manual retrieval during field visits. Two options for transmitting the collected data to the ThingSpeak IoT platform are available. Firstly, the data can be uploaded directly from the Raspberry Pi 4B if internet connectivity is available for growers with Wi-Fi access. Secondly, the Raspberry Pi 4B transmits the recently acquired data to the Arduino MKR1310. The Arduino MKR1310 decodes the data received from the Raspberry Pi 4B and forwards it to the ThingSpeak. The second method is for low-rate, long-range communication beyond the limit of Wi-Fi. A single message receivable to the ThingSpeak server includes data for eight fields. In our demonstration, a single message was enough to transmit the data generated. Fields 1 and 2 are reserved for geographic coordinates (namely, latitude and longitude) to represent the device's location. The third field was for camera orientation. Image quality/crop type, plant count, weed count, insect count, and crop canopy coverage were allocated from fields four to eight. ThingSpeak supports eight channels per gateway. If additional data is generated in the future, we have to create new channels to accommodate them. However, only data in a single channel can be passed through a single message. The Arduino-LoRa library was used to prepare the LoRa messages forwarded to the gateway (Mistry, 2016). The message generated from the Arduino MKR1310 includes the device identification number and the data with the field number. Once the gateway receives this message, it adds the target client ID (generated by ThingSpeak when defining a device), host address (mqtt://mqtt3.thingspeak.com), server port number, username and password, channel ID, and the data in each field according to the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. Username and password ensure that only authorized devices can transmit data to the ThingSpeak platform. ThingSpeak provides two ways to interact with its platform, REST (Representative State Transfer) and MQTT protocols. The advantages of using MQTT over REST protocol are that it supports ThingSpeak data publishing, including immediate and minimum power consumption and data transmission over limited bandwidth, which encouraged us to select the MQTT protocol in our demonstration. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. DCNN model performance CropClassiNet had a test accuracy of 91.26 %, a Jaccard Index of 0.77, and an F1-score of 0.91; the confusion matrix is given in Fig. 7. The highest precision is for the “grass” class (100 %), and the lowest is for “soybean” (92.0 %). The highest recall is for the “corn” class (99.9 %), and the lowest is for “grass” (67.1 %). The primary goal of CropClassiNet is to determine the quality of new images and direct them for subsequent processing (Fig. 5). This step has never been executed in an image-based crop monitoring platform before. Further, CropClassiNet can eliminate erroneous images when humans are present in the camera’s field of view or when the camera is misaligned due to external factors. AICropCAM can send maintenance requests through IoT analytics if rejected images are continuously generated. Download : Download high-res image (275KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7.

Fig. 8 shows an example of an original soybean image and the corresponding segmentation result by CanopySegNet, which estimated CC to be 18.72 %. Season-long, time-series images can be fed into CanopySegNet to generate diurnal and seasonal curves of crop CC, as shown in Fig. 9.

According to Fig. 9, canopy coverage percentage variation is low during the daytime and reaches zero at night. This verifies the need to eliminate low-light images before segmenting. As shown in Fig. 5, it is possible to eliminate the generation of false values when the camera captures images under low light conditions by halting the process of running CanopySegNet. There are three diurnal variation series on 6/8/2021, 6/26/2021, and 7/12/2021 in Fig. 9. The CC increased from 8 % to 95 % between 6/8/2021 to 7/12/2021. The seasonal trend showed that the CC reached a maximum around 7/8/2021. These results suggest that the proposed stacked models can track the daily and seasonal CC variation and eliminate the effect of lighting conditions on false value generation. Table 5.

Fig. 10(A) and 10(B) show the result obtained by PlantCountNet for a soybean image at an early vegetative stage (V3). Meanwhile Fig. 10(C) and 10(D) shows the result at a reproductive stage (R1). It can be seen that, at V3 stage, the model outputs matched the labels of soybean and weed plants well, indicating a level of high accuracy.

The result of PlantCountNet for soybean and weed counting: Manually annotated vs. model-predicted bounding boxes at V3 growth stage (A and B); manually annotated vs. model-predicted bounding boxes at R1 growth stage (C and D). The size of insects is very small compared to the size of images (Fig. 11), which is the main reason for the low mAP for InsectNet (Table 5). Increasing input image resolution beyond 480 × 480 × 3 is impractical as it exceeds the memory limitation to load models into Raspberry Pi 4B. A potential solution could be to increase the resolution of the region of interest by splitting the original image while keeping the resolution the same. Also, we suggest using the approach recommended by Tetila et al., 2020a, Tetila et al., 2020b in the future on Raspberry Pi model 4B. As technology advances, we expect the memory capacities will increase for edge computing units. At the same time, the state-of-the-art object detection algorithms will improve the accuracy for small object detection.

Power consumption for Raspberry Pi 4B Since edge cameras in farmlands have limited access to electric power, information on their power consumption is essential for designing IoT devices and systems. AICropCAM is designed to be energized by solar power. It runs on a rechargeable battery when there is no solar power. We monitored the maximum energy consumption of each task performed by AICropCAM, and the result is presented in Table 6. Four main strategies are available for the power management of IoT edge devices: Selecting power-efficient hardware, maintaining low power modes, dynamic power management, and cloud-based management. Raspberry Pi 4B is an affordable power-efficient single-board computer suitable for our application, but it does not naturally support low-power modes. Therefore, we introduced the Arduino MKR1310 LoRa module for the Raspberry Pi 4B dynamic power management. Furthermore, this Arduino module allows us to perform cloud-based central management independently. Table 6. Electrical power consumption of the Raspberry Pi 4B and the Arduino MKR1310 during edge image processing. Device Activity The maximum current range and the voltage recorded Raspberry Pi 4B Idle run 5.25 V × (0.45 – 0.53) A Image classification 5.25 V × (0.97 – 1.04) A Image segmentation 5.25 V × (0.98 – 1.11) A Weed and plant detection 5.25 V × (0.62 – 0.70) A Insect detection 5.25 V × (0.62 – 0.70) A Arduino MKR1310 Sleep mode <0.01A Serial communication <0.01A LoRa transmission <0.01A For our measurements, we used a Raspberry Pi 4B with 8 GB of RAM, connected to an HDMI monitor, a USB keyboard, and a USB mouse, and ran a MathWorks® Raspbian image (file used to boot the Raspberry Pi 4B). The Raspberry Pi 4B was operated at room temperature and connected to a wireless LAN access point and a laptop via an Ethernet cable. The electric current consumption for running each DCNN model was recorded during the test. CropClassiNet had the highest current consumption, while the PlantCountNet and InsectNet models had the lowest. As for LoRa transmission, we could not measure its current consumption because the lowest value our instrument could measure was 0.01A. Based on the manufacturer's specifications, the Arduino MKR1310 consumes 104 uA at 5 V. The average time to run the DCNN models is essential to estimate the energy consumed for each prediction. These parameters listed in Table 7 provide essential guidelines for designing IoT sensor nodes with suitable batteries and power sources. We also noticed that typically the first prediction of a model took the longest time, but the rest take a considerably shorter time to predict. Table 7. Time duration needed for the selected DCNN models deployed in the Raspberry Pi 4B. Model/Task Input image size Time for predicting results (s) The maximum power demand for the activity (W) CropClassiNet/Image quality evaluation and crop classification 224 × 224 × 3 6.44 5.46 CanopySegNet/Semantic segmentation to separate canopy from background 512 × 512 × 3 20.20 5.83 PlantCountNet/Weed and plant detection, classification, and counting 320 × 320 × 3 14.38 3.68 InsectNet/Insect detection 320 × 320 × 3 0.20 3.68 Semantic segmentation was the most power-demanding activity, while insect detection was the least. Changing the order of the image processing models and adding new models or dropping existing models is possible during regular operation. It enables dynamic power management within the Raspberry Pi module. The main advantage of AICropCAM is that it implements a stack of four DCNN-based image processing models with multiple objectives. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a system has been developed for a field crop monitoring camera. AICropCAM has applications such as setting up smart in-field or greenhouse IoT camera networks with edge computing capability, monitoring crops by attaching them to sprinkler irrigation systems (pivots and linear moves), or collecting crop information through ground or aerial mobile robots. The relatively short time to run each DCNN model makes the system suitable for real-time applications, including variable rate irrigation, fertilization, and spraying. For example, a pivot irrigated multi-cropping system with AICropCAM can automate irrigation or fertigation transition between different crops or crops at different growth stages by automatically providing the crop type or growth stage information to the irrigation controller. Additionally, existing herbicide or pesticide sprayers can get the feedback of the PlantCountNet and InsectNet in the AICropCAM for precision spraying. 4. Conclusion and future perspectives This paper outlines the essential components of constructing a functional edge image processing framework for real-time crop monitoring. From a software standpoint, CropClassiNet can categorize captured images according to image quality and detect the presence of specific crop types for further processing. CanopySegNet can further quantify the degree of canopy coverage; PlantCountNet can count the number of plants and weeds in the image; and finally, InsectNet can count the number of insects in the image. These four DCNN models, when implemented on edge devices, can extract an array of important crop and canopy parameters from field images and enable real-time, low-latency decision making and applications. Deep learning-based image processing on the edge has excellent potential in PA. Applications of AICropCAM are not limited to image classification, segmentation, plant counting, or weed counting. Potential future applications include insect classification and crop damage estimation, weed classification and pressure estimation, fruit identification and yield estimation, decision on replanting (Whigham et al., 2000), and disease identification and disease damage estimation in real time using actual field images collected by AICropCAM. AICropCAM shows excellent potential in enhancing crop management through crop monitoring. However, the current demonstration requires significant improvements on both hardware and software fronts. Customized circuitry and modular design are required to put AICropCAM in commercial farm applications. The full potential of the AICropCAM can be achieved by putting this camera on a moving platform like a center pivot with a GPS receiver to generate spatiotemporal data. Crop classification must include more crop types, and segmentation models need training data from other crop types. The DCNN models for weed and insect identification require the capability to identify different weed types, their growth stage, different insect types, and their growth stages to generate effective pest control decisions. Additionally, improving the models’ accuracy in image classification, segmentation, and object detection is crucial. It can be achieved by increasing the number of training image data sets. We also planned to expand the research for multiple edge architecture evaluation. Architectures such as a high-performance edge computer that accepts images from multiple edge devices through short-range, high-speed communication (e.g., Wi-Fi) and can run more accurate deep learning models with higher numbers of parameters, might be a better solution for the primary objectives addressed in this paper. We aim to expand the AICropCAM applications to other crops beyond corn and soybean. By making these improvements, AICropCAM will become a more effective tool for crop management, potentially revolutionizing how we grow and manage crops.

SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Summary This paper proposes an IoT-enabled soil monitoring system using wireless sensor network for automatic irrigation in agricultural applications, especially for lemongrass plants, where an automated control system is required for irrigation applications. This can solve the problem of the water crisis, which is faced by the farmers during the cultivation of the crop in the field. This controls the water supply in the irrigation process using an IoT communication system. A system architecture for soil monitoring and controlling irrigation using IoT technique is designed where the different sensors and actuators like humidity, soil moisture, temperature, pump, and so forth are connected with a node microcontrol unit and message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol for enhancing communication capabilities. This wireless sensor network gives feedback to the system. This provides automation by the on/off pump system during drip irrigation. The sensor data are displayed on a PC or mobile phone through wireless communication and an IoT cloud platform. An experimental testing setup is developed and the experimental performance of a soil monitoring system using IoT technique for automatic drip irrigation has been carried out and soil moisture data are also stored in a cloud server for analytics. The performance shows that the MQTT protocol sends data within 48 s to the IoT cloud so that the data can be acquired in a faster manner. This shows that this kind of soil monitoring system is suitable for automatic drip irrigation, which enhances the farming process and overcomes the water crises in the agricultural system by reducing the wastage of water. 1 INTRODUCTION Nowadays, a smart farming process is necessary as the need for food production is estimated to enhance by approximately 70% by 2050.1, 2 The rapidly rising world population will thus cause an equivalent rise in food demand. Thus, to have an optimal farm system that uses optimal water and energy, the sights specific farming with the precision of water and energy used is provided to the farmers, which helps them to take better decisions and improve the quality, and quantity, in turn increasing productivity. The advancement in technology with the modernization of farming through automation is important for the efficient use of water, which supports plant growth and the monitoring of environmental data and also reduces the need for manual (conventional) irrigation.3, 4 Therefore, smart farming will be performed effectively using an automatic irrigation system, which can reduce the cost of irrigation and crop cultivation. This can also handle optimal usage of water and electrical energy, which can emphasize long-term sustainable solutions through automation of the agricultural irrigation process. The process of automatic irrigation can be executed using the acquired data through sensors which can be integrated through a sensor network system. These sensors can automatically evaluate environmental conditions such as air humidity, soil moisture, and air temperature for effective utilization of irrigation systems. To build a sustainable soil monitoring system using wireless sensor network (WSN), the Internet of Things (IoT) can also play an essential role in automating the watering process and collecting information from the environment. Nowadays, saving water is also a top priority because optimal utilization of water will save water resources effectively for reducing drought. The challenges are addressed during the implementation of WSN for monitoring the field and estimating irrigation requirements with the help of gathered data as reported by Garcia et al.5 Further, a review has been reported by Akhtar et al6 on how edge computing techniques can help to store and process the data in the cloud. To cover large areas and optimize the soil moisture conditions, Liang et al7 have applied an adaptive Cauchy variant butterfly optimization algorithm in a WSN. Further, Chai et al8 have proposed strategies for soil moisture sensor deployment using a data-driven method which can help in the estimation of evapotranspiration of environment. IoT cloud platform can also help in analytics where a lot of data can be stored and analyzed for the futuristic requirement to manage the plants so that automated irrigation systems will effectively solve the problem of water crisis based on said sensor values. The data are represented to the users in a user-friendly manner. Considering these aspects, the objective of this paper is to design and develop a soil monitoring system using a WSN for an automatic irrigation system where IoT technique is applied to monitor and control the soil condition so that the appropriate amount of water can be given to the crop during cultivation, which can save water, time, and money for the cultivation of the crop. The aim of this paper is envisaged in the following points: A soil monitoring system using WSN is built where the IoT technique is applied for communication between different nodes. The different protocols, such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocols, are attempted to obtain faster communication as compared to HTTP protocol. Remote monitoring and controlling capabilities using WSN have been demonstrated where a mobile app is also developed. This sends the different sensor data such as soil moisture, humidity, and temperature conditions. The different conditions are analyzed so that the farmers can take the decision for the automatic irrigation system. The different experimental trials are conducted, and data are stored in the cloud using a mobile app that can help in crop cultivation, especially lemongrass crops.

The following subsections are considered. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Schematic diagram of the automatic irrigation system using WSN and IoT. 3.1 Sensors node The four sensor nodes are taken where the system consists of one node microcontrol unit (MCU) controller as a master node and the other three sensor nodes act as slave nodes. Each sensor node has one soil moisture sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor, and one node MCU microcontroller. The node MCU is supported with ESP8266 for Wi-Fi communication, integrated general purpose input/output (GPIO), pulse width modulation (PWM), inter-integrated circuit (I2C), and analog–digital card (ADC) all within one board for faster communications. A USB-TTL cable is included and open-source programming is written using an integrated development environment (IDE) for integrating the entire hardware. 3.2 Sensors Each node consists of the soil moisture sensor, humidity sensor, and temperature sensor. The soil moisture sensor (Model: Robotbana) is used with digital output and soil hygrometer. The output of moisture can be measured in terms of volumetric content. Humidity and temperature sensor (DHT22) is used, which is a polymer capacitor type sensor. The operating range is 0%–100% RH, temperature measuring range is 0°C–80°C, accuracy is ±2%RH and a maximum of up to ±5%RH and temperature accuracy is ±0.5°C, resolution or sensitivity of humidity is 0.1%RH and temperature sensitivity is 0.1°C, repeatability of humidity is ±1%RH and repeatability of temperature is 0.2°C, and sensing period average is 2 s. 3.3 Actuators AC water pump (0.5 hp) is used for supplying the water to the plantations from water resources. For regulating the flow of water, a solenoid valve (operated through 24 voltage direct current [VDC]) is utilized so that the pump can be automatically ON/OFF. 3.4 Communication routers The router is used for a wide area network (WAN) for wireless communications so that sensor data can be sent in the pocket. This can be forwarded to the internet by assigning an internet protocol (IP) address. 3.5 Protocols The two protocols (HTTP and MQTT) are applied for analyzing the proper communications in the IoT cloud. A Thingspeak IoT platform is used, which has Android application open-source programming capabilities. As per the requirement of soil condition, the water pump is operated automatically by activating each sensor node. In this system, data are collected from all the sensor nodes at the same time, and data are sent to the cloud. NodeMCU microcontroller controls the entire setup where an ESP8266 Wi-Fi inbuilt module is used for transmitting and receiving data wirelessly. To assemble the data simultaneously from more than one node, the MQTT protocol is applied. Different environmental sensors are used to collect the soil moisture, soil temperature, and humidity information of the environment. A water pump is connected to the controller node for supplying water in the field. The data sent by the sensor nodes are analyzed in the cloud and a decision is taken in the cloud on whether the soil needs water or not. Therefore, the command is sent to the master for further action. The master turns the ON or OFF pump according to the command. It is helpful for farmers since the water requirement of the soil can be monitored worldwide. The sensor nodes are powered with the help of a solar panel. This system is designed for wireless monitoring and control of agricultural land from anywhere using a mobile Android device.

This microcontroller has a Wi-Fi facility, and MQTT protocol is used for receiving the signal and transmitting the message from sensors. This provides the information on soil and NodeMCU allows to operate the water pump accordingly through a web page where the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module is integrated. The major advantages of the MQTT protocol are that it is cost-effective and provides communication in a faster manner. The flow process of the MQTT protocol for IoT-enabled communication methodology is shown in Figure 3. The soil moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors are connected to the NodeMCU microcontroller, which sends data to the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. The Tx and Rx pin of ESP8266 is connected to data respective transmitting and receiving pins in NodeMCU. It should be ensured that the input voltage of ESP8266 must be 3.0 VDC.

Each slave NodeMCU is connected to a DHT11 sensor and a moisture sensor. The DHT11 sensor measures temperature and humidity, while the moisture sensor detects the moisture level in a particular area. Each slave NodeMCU is responsible for reading the data from its respective sensors and sending that data to the master NodeMCU. The slaves can communicate with the master NodeMCU over the network, typically using protocols like MQTT and HTTP. 4.2 Master NodeMCU There is one NodeMCU device acting as the master in the system. The master NodeMCU is connected to a relay and a pump. It receives data from the slave NodeMCUs, which includes temperature, humidity, and moisture readings from the sensors. Based on the received data, the master NodeMCU can make decisions and control the relay and pump accordingly. For example, if the moisture level is low, indicating a need for watering, the master NodeMCU can activate the relay to turn on the pump and water the plants. 4.3 Cloud connection Both the master and slave NodeMCUs are connected to the cloud. Cloud connectivity allows the devices to communicate with each other over the internet, even if they are physically located in different places. The connection to the cloud can be established using various protocols like MQTT and HTTP and other IoT-specific protocols. 5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS To develop a smart IoT-enabled drip irrigation system, a small pilot project plant for the cultivation of lemongrass is being developed as shown in Figure 5. The environmental sensors like soil, humidity, and temperatures are installed as per requirement.

A 0.5 hp AC pump is also installed for supplying the water as per requirement from the storage water source. The water supply to cultivated land through the drip pipe system. During the operation of the pump, the sensors acquire the soil, temperature, and humidity data, which are processed to the IoT cloud using the ThingSpeak platform via a web server. A web application is also intended to use an Android application for monitoring and controlling the smart automatic drip irrigation system especially lemongrass so that all data can be monitored and control processes can also be done accordingly. AC pump is attached to a water pond arrangement for supplying the appropriate amount of water from the natural pond. The water pump will automatically begin and start to send water to the agricultural estate as per the soil conditions. The soil condition is identified using the different sensors which are inserted in soil closer to lemongrass plants where the threshold value of soil condition according to the environment is adjusted in NodeMCU microcontroller through programming. Therefore, the water pump operates as per necessity from time to time automatically. The information about the soil and environmental conditions is collected from different sensors like soil moisture, humidity, and temperature in the cloud. The information is processed and accordingly, the microcontroller, via the IoT cloud operates the water pump through a relay. The soil moisture sensors sense the soil condition using two coated metal rods that can be inserted into the grassland. Further, the web application is linked with the NodeMCU microcontroller for obtaining the soil and other parameters. These signals are identified using the Android application which supports the computer user interface. This IoT-enabled automatic drip irrigation system is developed by combining the hardware and software linked together with serial communication ports via the NodeMCU microcontrollers to transmit data from one device to another wirelessly and monitoring can be done. For operating the system, a program is written in Arduino Software (IDE) and the flow chart is shown in Figure 6. At first, all nodes are physically connected to the hardware. An internet connection is also provided. For connecting in an IoT environment, the MQTT protocol is applied. The sensor soil moisture, humidity, and temperature sensors read the soil conditions and humidity and temperature at all four node points then it is sent to the IoT cloud through MQTT protocols. Here, the threshold value for each sensor case is set at 1024 m3 m−3. This process will be continued until the whole crop land gets enough water. Further, these data will be uploaded to the IoT cloud using the ThingSpeak platform, which is stored for establishing the analytics.

Testing has been done for 8 h, and data are added and graphs are plotted again from Figures 8–12. From Figure 8, it is envisaged that the behavior for soil condition shows repeated behavior after 4 h because the moisture content is less as compared to the required condition. Therefore, the pump will be “on.” Further, after 4 h, the pump will be again “on.” This behavior will repeat as per requirement. Figures 9-12 show that soil content is present for 8 h (which means a full day) so that the lemongrass crop acquires sufficient water for growth in the field. In Figure 10, the temperature behavior is plotted for 8 h, which shows the temperature rises from 27°C to 41°C up to the afternoon. At the end of the day, the temperature is around 31°C. During the operation of the water pump, the temperatures are also recorded as shown in Figure 13. The temperature of the environments shows that it is also increased range from 27°C to 40°C because this is recorded in the month of April in the afternoon. FIGURE 13 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Temperature of the environments during pump operations. The experimental data for IoT-based network signal is obtained from Master NodeMCU and plotted as shown in Figure 14. This shows that the master NodeMCU continuously monitors the network signal in dBm where the network signal is measured in terms of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value in dBm from each slave node to assess the quality of their signal connections. This RSSI is a parameter used to measure the signal strength between devices in a wireless network. This value also represents the strength of the Wi-Fi signal it receives from the access point and each slave NodeMCU device. FIGURE 14 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Performance of IoT-based network signal for soil monitoring toward automatic drip irrigation. Further, a comparison between MQTT and HTTP protocol while sending the data is carried out as given in Table 4. The performance shows that the MQTT protocol sends data within 48 s to the IoT cloud so that the data can be acquired in a faster manner. TABLE 4. Comparison between MQTT and HTTP protocols. S. no. Protocol Processing time (s) Node 1 Node 2 Node 3 Node 4 1. MQTT 15 16 31 48 2. HTTP 20 241 363 495 From these experimental performances, it is envisaged that a WSN using NodeMCU is developed where NodeMCU can help in establishing wireless communications by creating different nodes. By applying different protocols (MQTT and HTTP), it is observed that each node can acquire a communication range between 15 and 48 s, which is faster as compared to the HTTP protocol. Therefore, the soil moisture sensor, humidity sensor, and temperature sensor are easily transmitted in the cloud using the ThingSpeak IoT platform where the experimental data are stored. The automation of irrigation is done using a user-friendly mobile app for monitoring and controlling crop fields from anywhere. The novelty of this paper is highlighted point-wise. A soil monitoring system using WSN is developed where the different protocols such as HTTP and MQTT protocols are applied with the application of IoT technique where MQTT protocol provides the faster response as compared to HTTP protocol. Remote monitoring and controlling capabilities using WSN have been demonstrated where the soil moisture, humidity, and temperature conditions are obtained at different conditions, which can help the farmers with automatic irrigation systems. By conducting different experimental trials, the soil conditions are analyzed at different conditions which can help in crop cultivation, especially lemongrass crops. For comparison with currently published works, Pereira et al61 have reported on IoT-enabled smart drip irrigation systems using the ESP32 Wi-Fi communication module, whereas our work is carried out using the ESP8266 Wi-Fi communication module. The major advantages of our work are that the ESP8266 Wi-Fi communication module can communicate in a faster manner, with low cost and less energy consumption as compared to the ESP32 Wi-Fi communication module. As well, my previous work focused only on the HTTP protocol for sending the data through the data fusion method.62 During sending data, the time was taken more, whereas this paper is attempted on different protocols such as HTTP and MQTT protocols with multiple nodes through WSN. The major advantages of the proposed method are that faster communication can be obtained and data are also stored in the IoT cloud easily for data analytics. This is also part of the novelty of this paper. 6 CONCLUSIONS In this paper, a novel soil monitoring system using a WSN for automatic irrigation systems is designed where an IoT technique is applied for sending and storing data in the IoT cloud. The node MCU microcontroller is used for wireless cloud network systems where communications have been done wirelessly using the MQTT protocol. This provides a faster response while uploading the data. During experimentation, the soil sensor data are successfully uploaded to the IoT cloud which is remotely accessed using a mobile phone. An appropriate quantity of water is supplied to the lemongrass plants of the agricultural field using a pump automation process. The health of lemongrass plants is observed from anywhere using an Android mobile phone. This offers an affordable solution for supplying a sufficient amount of water to manage agricultural cultivation land effectively. By developing the testing prototype, it is demonstrated that the use of such network systems/applications can facilitate a variety of plant harvesting processes. This kind of system can be employed in a variety of small land, open space cultivation, different plantations, crop cultivation, and so forth. Hence, it is concluded that soil monitoring using WSNs and IoT techniques can be effectively used for automatic irrigation systems which is a promising technique in the precision agriculture field. The futuristic work will be focused on the measurement of the pH value of soil and the measurement of soil nutrition condition using NPK sensors so that fertilization of soil can be done to enhance crop health. The mapping can be done for the uniform growth of plants in the field.

Karthikeyan, Shitharth Selvarajan & Praveen Kumar Balachandran  1508 Accesses 3 Altmetric Explore all metrics Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in a variety of fields and has the potential to alter how we currently view farming. Due to its emphasis on effectiveness and usability artificial intelligence has the largest impact on agriculture of all industries. We highlight the automation-supporting technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, and Long-Range (LoRa) technology which provides data integrity and protection. We also offer a structure for smart farming that depends on the location of data processing after a comprehensive investigation of numerous designs. As part of our future study we have divided the unresolved difficulties in smart agriculture into two categories such as networking issues and technology issues. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are examples of technologies whereas the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite and LoRa are used for all network-related jobs. The goal of the research is to deploy a network of sensors throughout agricultural fields to gather real-time information on a variety of environmental factors including temperature, humidity, soil moisture and nutrient levels. The seamless data transmission and communication made possible by these sensors’ integration with Internet of Things technologies. With the use of AI techniques and algorithms the gathered data is examined. The technology may offer practical insights and suggestions for improving agricultural practices because the AI models are trained to spot patterns, correlations, and anomalies in the data. We are also focusing on indoor farming by supplying Ultra Violet radiation and artificial lighting in accordance with plant growth. When a pest assault is detected using AI and LoRa even in poor or no network coverage area and notifies the farmer’s mobile in any part of the world. The irrigation system is put to the test with various plants at various humidity and temperature levels in both dry and typical situations. To keep the water content in those specific regions soil moisture sensors are used.

Rapid population growth according to the United Nation (UN) makes it more difficult to eradicate poverty, end hunger and malnutrition, and broaden access to healthcare and educational opportunities [1]. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation predicts that the global food supply would need to increase by 70% by 2050 as a result of decreasing agricultural lands and the depletion of limited natural resources [2]. As a result there is a pressing need to raise farm productivity. Due to a lack of natural resources such as fresh water and cultivated land as well as trends in declining agricultural yields for several key commodities the issue has gotten worse. Another obstacle is the agricultural workforce’s changing organisational structure. There seem to be astonishing numbers for the Indian agricultural industry. With a Gross Value Addition of US Dollar 265.51 billion it supports the livelihood of 58% of Indians. Despite employing around 58% of the working force directly and indirectly, this industry only provides about 15.87% of the nation's Gross Domestic product (GDP) [3]. The topic of agricultural productivity is brought up as a result. Agricultural Value Added per Worker is the indicator that is most frequently used to gauge agricultural output. China, India, Indonesia and other impoverished or emerging countries with large populations have the lowest agricultural value added per worker. India has the lowest agricultural value added per worker among the top 20 economies. Water is essential to life for all creatures including plants and animals. It is a fundamental necessity of every human being. The only way that water is used in agriculture in India today is for irrigation. This proportion may increase as a result of increased food consumption and population growth. So a problem that affects most agriculture is a lack of water. By applying various water-saving strategies this can be reduced to a minimum. There are many strategies to stop or minimise water waste. Tamil Nadu's quick development and industrialisation is responsible for the state's excessive water usage. The primary factor influencing the rapid deployment of ground water irrigation is the ongoing change in Tamil Nadu's yearly rainfall pattern. The main objective of this work is to use groundwater irrigation to decrease the negative effects of water scarcity on crop productivity in order to sustain agriculture in Tamil Nadu throughout the year. This investigation looks at temporal variations in irrigated areas between 2000 and 2014 [4]. We use spectral matching methods to map and classify the seven bands of MODIS satellite images of the land surfaces in order to show changes in rainfall at the sub-basin level. The only way that water is used in agriculture today is for irrigation. This proportion may increase as a result of increased food consumption and population growth. Thus, one of the problems facing the planet is water scarcity. Day by day the most efficient plant monitoring systems currently in use make use of plant optical and infrared imaging. Everyone needs water including humans, animals, and plants. It is a fundamental necessity of human being. Water waste is the key problem in the majority of agriculture. By applying various water-saving strategies this can be reduced to a minimum. There are many strategies to stop or minimise water waste. Water is trickled onto the plant’s roots using drip irrigation which is the most effective method of irrigation [5]. A sprinkler system is an irrigation-based system that makes use of tubes-mounted guns, sprays, or sprinklers. Abiotic and biotic constraints are two categories of environmental limitations that have an impact on crop production. Actually these aspects are more obvious due to climate change brought on by global warming [6]. Abiotic stresses modify a plant's morphology, physiology, biochemistry, and molecular structure which negatively affects its growth and productivity. Climate and soil characteristics (soil components, physicochemical, pH, and biological features) (drought, flood, cold, heat stress, etc.) are examples of abiotic constraints. On the other hand biotic variables include weeds, vertebrate pests, pathogens, beneficial species (pollinators, decomposers, and natural enemies), and anthropogenic evolution. To address all the environmental issues that are lowering crop yields and maintaining food security, trans- and multidisciplinary research is required. Numerous factors present a severe risk that will lower productivity if farms are not adequately monitored and maintained. Three categories biological, environmental, and technological can be used to categorise these variables [7]. Due to the need to increase crop production and the increasing use of farming practises like irrigation, extensive inorganic fertiliser application, and synthetic chemical weed and insect control, more land has been converted to agriculture [8]. These operations have decreased the quality of the soil, the water, exacerbated soil erosion, contaminated groundwater and the quality of the food. In an effort to enhance yields on current farms while reducing the environmental effect of agriculture this has prompted programmes for sustainable development [9,10,11,12,13]. Today wireless sensor networks play a huge role in agriculture. These systems among others include those that use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based traceability systems, continuously monitor the environment and preserve agricultural accuracy. For the automated irrigation system to transmit the sensor data for the soil moisture content, temperature, and humidity to the remote area, a wireless modem using LoRa is essential. Wireless sensor networks are used to remotely monitor humidity and temperature information on a regular or irregular basis utilising General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) based systems. The aforementioned information allows us to frame the proposal’s objective as Fabrication of monitoring device with AI analyzation of Drought Monitoring and forecasting by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data from MODIS Satellite. The contributions of the study are as follows NDVI time series data from MODIS Satellite along with Micro climate Analysis for adapting the new cropping pattern. Implementation of irrigation depends on age of crops and Micro climate using AI To monitor crop growth leaf colour changes, pest control, nutrients deficiency by Spectrogram images adopting AI. Also provide Fertilizer calculator to have a realistic estimate of the quality of fertilizer needed for our crop and area. To proposed LoRa Technology transmit all sensors data from farm field to control unit without Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) technology and any other Internet facilities. 2 Literature review Currently irrigation is the only usage of water in agriculture. Increased food demand and population expansion could cause this percentage to increase. Therefore a global issue is the lack of water [14]. Utilising plant optical and infrared pictures the most effective plant monitoring systems are being implemented daily [15]. Every human, animal and plant needs water to survive. Every human being has a basic need for it. Water waste is the main issue in the majority of agriculture. Utilising various water saving techniques can help to lessen this [16]. There are numerous ways to prevent or reduce water waste. The first one is the ditch irrigation system, in which rows of seeds are placed in ditches that have been dug out. For the passage from the main ditch to the canals there are tubes resembling syphon tubes. The most effective technique of irrigation is drip irrigation which involves pouring water onto the plant's roots [17, 18]. Sprinkler systems are another type of irrigation-based system that employ sprinklers, sprays or guns mounted on tubes. The tubes carry water and some of the ends include sprinklers to apply water where it is needed. The sprinkler won’t activate until the temperature and humidity sensor in the root zone surpasses the threshold value. The rotary system is the best irrigation technique for large regions. The rotary system uses mechanically driven sprinklers that travel in a round motion due to its 100-foot range. As a result the device sprinkles over time in a larger area while using less water. For the purpose of watering cotton crops, infrared thermometers are utilised to measure the temperature of the remote canopy [19]. A temperature threshold is upheld during this process. When the canopy temperature rises above a certain threshold the mechanism activates. The majority of irrigation systems are automated rather than manual in order to maximise cotton production and water usage. An alternative parameter to calculate agricultural irrigation requirements is plant Evapotranspiration (ET). When two terms are combined as in evaporation and plant transpiration the result is called ET. Evaporation is the vaporisation of water from soil, water bodies and canopy interception [20] into the atmosphere. Water vaporises from stems, flowers, and leaves during the process of transpiration. Water reductions of up to 42% are possible with ET-based systems [21]. Due to uses like vehicle monitoring and robot control, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) nodes have grown in popularity in recent years. IRIS nodes built on TINY OS are used to measure the soil moisture content of paddy fields [15]. The most popular method for measuring the data in irrigation fields is the ZigBee transmission of data from end devices. However the distance between the two nodes is only 10 to 100 m when these devices are used. As a result the majority of applications transport data to faraway locations using GPRS-based technologies [17]. ZigBee-based transmission is used in the agricultural sector to collect data from numerous sensor nodes. In today's world wireless sensor networks are essential to agriculture and the food industry. These systems among others, include those that use RFID-based traceability systems, continuously monitor the environment and uphold agricultural precision [16].A wireless modem using GSM/GPRS is called the SIM900A. It is crucial for the automated irrigation system to communicate the values from the soil moisture [12] content sensor as well as the temperature, humidity and other sensor data to the remote area. The AT commands can be used to do this. The microcontroller unit and GSM/GPRS modem are interfaced [12]. Wireless sensor networks are used for remote monitoring using GPRS-based systems to continuously or sporadically monitor temperature and humidity data in industry and even in agricultural [18].Various models and limitations of existing systems are discussed in the Table 1. Table 1 Comparison of existing systems Full size table The main objective of this article is to develop an automatic watering system using AI and sensors linked to a microcontroller. This study made use of the DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity as well as the VH400 sensor for soil moisture. These sensors are interfaced with the microcontroller unit which was buried beneath the root zone of the plant. Sending an SMS to a mobile phone of a remote owner is the main goal of using a microcontroller. SMS messages are delivered using the SIM900A module which is coupled to the microcontroller unit. The irrigation system is put to the test with various plants at various humidity and temperature levels in both dry and typical situations. To keep the water content in those specific regions soil moisture sensors are used. All results acquired under wet and normal conditions have been shown to be logical. 2.1 LoRa technology A LoRa-enabled architecture for precise irrigation and monitoring has been demonstrated [28] with each sensor node being able to connect to another LoRa-enabled receiver and create a communication channel. A low-power operating method called LoRa allows for transmission and reception over a vast communication range. Despite the fact that LoRa technology makes it simple to transfer sensor data from farm fields to a control unit. Field-installed sensors gather information about things like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. These sensors broadcast the data in discrete packets using low-power, long-range wireless technology called LoRa. The packets are sent by LoRa-capable sensors to LoRa gateways placed around the farm. Gateways accept the packets and use the LoRaWAN (LoRa Wide Area Network) protocol to send them to a central control unit. The control unit gathers and analyses the incoming data to produce actionable insights. Real-time updates on crop conditions may be included in this data, enabling knowledgeable decisions on pest management, fertilisation, and irrigation. 2.2 Challenges of AI Although implementing AI in the agricultural sector faces significant obstacles it is a logical step towards smart agriculture for efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable farming. The agricultural sector and the field of AI research are not connected. Therefore AI researchers are not well-versed in the issues that farmers confront, and farmers are also not well-versed in the AI technologies that are currently available. It will take more interdisciplinary cooperation to find a solution to this dual issue. The use of AI in agriculture is still in its early stages, hence there aren't any established norms or regulations. As a result there are several legal questions surrounding smartt farming. Because the majority of AI-IoT solutions were cloud-based until recently, farmers were reluctant to adopt AI methods due to worries about cyber attacks, data security, and privacy. A new IoT option called \"Edge AI\" has emerged to address this problem. Edge AI handles sensor data locally and offers better data protection and privacy as well as reduced latency and cost. Another challenge for AI in agriculture is a lack of data. AI is a data-driven technology. The absence of pertinent data makes it difficult to deploy certain AI algorithms. In remote, rural areas with no higher speed mobile networks but where agriculture is the main industry, edge AI has the potential to transform the game. The potential for intelligent agriculture is increased. Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) were used in [29] to compress sensor image data at the edge layer before transmitting the compressed data to the fog layer using LoRa technology. 3 System architecture The three layers of the proposed system architecture are depicted in Fig. 1. Layer 1: A farming device The foundation layer of the smart farm architecture is called layer. It consists of numerous components, including sensors which are dispersed across the agricultural ground. These devices also known as distributed source nodes, are simply LoRa wireless sensor networks. They recognise the physical parameters continuously collect data in real-time and send it to the gateway node at the following layer. The data received by several sensors and cameras in various smart agriculture applications is shown in Fig. 2. For instance data is gathered by on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) sensors and cameras in a field of rice and relayed to the edge where subsurface soil sensors process it. Fig. 1 System architecture Full size image Fig. 2 Product over view Full size image Layer-2: The Edge Computing Layer is included in Layer 2. There are several edge nodes in this. Depending on the particular smart agriculture system, different nodes may be present. Here, layer-1 data is processed, filtered and encrypted. Due of resource constraints at the edge layer the prognostic and solution components were previously completed at the following layer. Trained machine learning models can perform prognostics and provide suggestions at this layer, nevertheless thanks to recent hardware advancements and initiatives for AI at the edge. However if the task requires a lot of resources or is not time-sensitive, prognosis and inference can both be done in the following layer. For instance the ESP8266 for integrating smart agricultural components to manage environmental conditions [25] and the ESP32 for smart irrigation [26]. Layer-3: The third or uppermost layer in the bottom-up design of the smart agriculture system is cloud computing. This virtual layer is often located in data centres and is accessible via the Internet from any location in the world [27]. Massive amounts of data generated by cameras or sensors in agricultural farms are required. 4 Data 4.1 Satellite data The seven bands of MODIS are used to measure surface reflectance. Blue wavelengths between 459 and 479 nm, green between 545 and 565 nm, red between 620 and 670 nm, near-infrared between 841 and 875 nm, and short-wave infrared between 1628 and 2155 nm, are used to examine vegetation and land surfaces. For monitoring the vegetation at a continental scale [30] using the Terra platform's MODIS 500-m resolution and 8-day surface reflectance. Scientific Data Set documentation for MOD09A1 [31] is given. The study also included secondary data in addition to the original data set, which came from MODIS time-series data as shown in Fig. 3a Fig. 3 a Rainfall fluctuations over time in different irrigated agricultural areas in Tamil Nadu. b Tamil Nadu agricultural land classification, by source, with major river basins Full size image 4.2 River basins and their irrigated area There are 40,000 tanks, 1 million wells, and 61 large reservoirs that rely extensively (17.5 BCM) on surface water. Surface irrigation is not as important as ground water irrigation (15. 3 BCM). Table 2 provides information on the basin's irrigation condition for 39 years, from 1976 to 2014, together with 54 years' worth of rainfall data, from 1961 to 2014 shown in Fig. 3b also. At the sub-national level, which is similar to a state, county or district, statistics on the total amount of irrigated agriculture and irrigated area of the country were gathered. The Department of Economics and Statistics of the Tamil Nadu government provided data on irrigated areas. Daily rainfall data from 2000 to 2014 were collected from the India Meteorological Department's (IMD) Hydro Met Division website at http://imd.gov.in. The monsoon was the subject of our investigation. We focused our research on the monsoon season (kharif season) from May to December because all the agricultural activities are done during this season and image analysis also carried out for that season. Table 2 Characteristics of the major river basins Full size table 4.3 Spectral matching techniques for identifying changes in irrigated area using NDVI The NDVI, which is a combination of near infrared and red bands, is frequently used to discern vegetation conditions such as density and vigour. NDVI values range from − 1 to + 1, with higher values indicating more vigorous vegetation and lower values indicating less vigorous vegetation. The total area irrigated from 2000–2001 to 2014–2015 and the annual irrigated area differ significantly. The change in the irrigated area was discovered using spectral matching techniques. The highest mean NDVI value in Tamil Nadu was 0.79 during the kharif season. From this result along with the micro climate analysis (Temperature, Air quality index and Humidity) suggest the right crop for the season. 4.4 Crop management Crop management is the process of evaluating the sociological, ecological and economic factors that play a significant role in the choice, growing and selling of crops. Cropping patterns are influenced by crop growth, the availability of water resources, labour, insurance, and environmental conditions using MODIS satellite and AI. Cropping patterns might change according to ecological variables. For instance traditional crops like paddy agriculture, which require extensive water resources, cannot be supported in places with diminishing water supplies and groundwater tables. Crop choice is also influenced by the agricultural product's market as well as the export and import regulations of other nations. 4.5 Soil monitoring In the overall farming process, soil moisture is crucial. During the course of a plant’s growth, it is in charge of photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration and the transfer of minerals [30]. In making decisions for farms, soil monitoring is crucial. Cropping patterns are influenced by a number of variables, including soil salinity, pests, precipitation, pH, and humidity. These elements support the evaluation of soil health. Field-based sensors track the temperature and humidity of the soil, and the cloud receives through LoRa Transmitter and the process the data. Farmers will be informed about a variety of issues, and planting patterns are evaluated and chosen depending on salinity content, soil nutrient level, humidity, and temperature. A wide range of topics will be discussed with farmers, and planting patterns will be considered and selected based on factors like salinity content, soil nutrient level, humidity, and temperature. Water is essential for photosynthesis, regulates temperature, and transports food and nutrients for plant growth, making soil moisture a crucial element in plant growth. Humidity controls the food supply and transpiration rate for ideal plant growth. A humidity of 50% to 60% is ideal for the growth of vegetable plants [32]. To ensure the best possible use of water resources, soil moisture sensors are inserted into plant roots and analyse soil moisture level measurements [33, 34]. 4.6 Smart irrigation Smart irrigation is the practise of enhancing the quality and quantity of production while making the most use of available water resources. By giving the plants the right amount of water, it saves water. Irrigation systems can be classified as either soil moisture sensor-based or weather-based. A controller controls the irrigation in weather-based irrigation systems, which collect temperature and rainfall data from a nearby small weather station. In irrigation systems using soil moisture sensors, sensors buried in tree grass provide precise measurements of the soil's moisture content. In order to irrigate the field with this sort of irrigation, precise humidity and air temperature measurements, weather monitoring, and cropping patterns are all necessary with AI. Sprinkler actuators and data are delivered to the cloud together [35]. The data from the soil moisture sensor determine the irrigation schedule for each farm area. Maximum crop growth and 100% water utilisation efficiency are guaranteed by micro level analysis, scheduling, and effective actuation [36]. From a mobile application built for smart phones, farmers can monitor and may control the irrigation system. This irrigation system is based on information collected from field-installed temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and ultrasonic sensors [37]. Farmers can execute actuation by turning on the irrigation pumps to water the farm using a user-friendly mobile application that is built for smart phones and connected to the cloud for analysis. 4.7 Plant growth monitoring The key step after selecting a crop is crop cultivation. Modern technology is available to farmers and sensors installed in the field monitor plant growth. For instance, ultrasonic sensors. For instance, to track the presence of insects and pests that hinder plant growth, ultrasonic sensors are deployed in the field. When pests are found, high frequency sound waves are produced to eliminate them, and the farmer is also made aware of their presence for additional assistance [31]. 5 Methodology and implementation Applied Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Machine intelligence that resembles human intelligence is known as artificial intelligence. Many industries, including e-commerce and marketing [38], human resources [39], computer vision [40], multimedia forensics [41, 42], healthcare [43], social media [44, 45], gaming [46, 47] and agriculture have showed great potential as a result of advancements in AI and ML. In agriculture, artificial intelligence (AI) is used to improve productivity, crop yield, and profitability as well as to track livestock, monitor the weather, optimise supply chains, manage irrigation systems, manage pesticide and fertiliser use, and control weeds. Researchers are using fuzzy logic, other AI/ML techniques like classification and logistic regression, as well as Neuro-Fuzzy logic, to improve agricultural decision-making, predictive analytics, and mobile expert systems [48]. Real-time monitoring of the environment in agricultural areas is made possible by integrating sensors with a microcontroller unit. The system can identify the presence of pests or unusual variables linked to pest attacks by deploying sensors like temperature, humidity and pest-specific sensors. Early identification is made possible by this allowing farmers to act right away and minimise any crop damage. The system may analyse sensor data and detect certain pest species or patterns linked to pest infestations by incorporating AI algorithms. The accuracy of pest identification can be increased over time by using AI models that have been taught to detect pests. The manual effort needed for pest monitoring is decreased thanks to this automated identification procedure which also provides prompt and precise detection. By utilizing LoRa the system can transmit data even in areas with poor or no network coverage. This is particularly valuable in rural or remote agricultural locations where traditional network connectivity may be limited. The agricultural system can transmit pest detection data via LoRa to a central server or cloud platform. Using LoRa technology alerts can be sent to the farmer’s mobile device as soon as the system detects and identifies a pest attack. These notices may contain details on the individual pest the intensity of the attack and suggested pest control measures. This makes it possible for farmers to act quickly and protect their crops no matter where they are. Farmers can keep informed and make informed decisions wherever they are thanks to remote accessibility via mobile alerts. According to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, pests lose between 30 and 35 percent of India's annual agricultural yield. By applying cutting edge AI solutions to this issue there is a tremendous possibility to raise our yield. Early pest detection allows for the use of appropriate and less-excessive pesticides to protect the crop, increasing crop output. Three steps make up the Process Flow module: Data gathering, Keras-RetinaNet-based pest detection and Pest attack density detection as shown in Fig. 4 Fig. 4 AI process flow for pest detection Full size image 5.1 Training the model We utilised a Keras-RetinaNet model to identify pest photos because deep learning for visual identification is becoming increasingly successful. Keras-RetinaNet With ResNet + FPN as the backbone for feature extraction and two task-specific subnetworks for classification and bounding box regression, Keras-RetinaNet, developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR), achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms Faster RCNN, the well-known two-stage detector [49]. Recent studies have shown that adopting pre-trained networks and applying them to other datasets significantly improves performance compared to developing new models from scratch. This was made possible by the models’ capacity to discover general features applicable to a variety of computer vision tasks. On the COCO dataset, we used a pre-trained model with a ResNet50 backbone, and we trained it using our own data. To train our model, we utilised the weights “resnet50_coco_best_v2.1.0.h5”. We have tested a number of models throughout the course of this project and updated them as we discovered models that performed better. 5.2 Features Pest Detection: Detects pests through Keras-RetinaNet object detection model. (As explained above) Pest affect Density: The amount of pests found in each image is counted by the model. It serves as a criterion to determine how much damage has already been done and provides an estimate of how many pests are present on a leaf. The sensors and AI will begin to function according to the power supply given to the Arduino board in the proposed approach. A soil moisture sensor coupled to a microcontroller unit delivers the corresponding readings on a periodic basis, and the DHT11 sensor detects the temperature and humidity in the crop roots on the other end. An air index sensor is also used to determine the air index. The microcontroller unit's primary goal is to get the data values sent by the sensors and ESP32, which was configured to save the data in the cloud. These values are shown on the LCD screen by the data that is delivered to the microcontroller. For timely irrigation, which supplies the necessary amount of water to the receptive crops according to the stages, a Direct Current (DC) Pump and a Microcontroller are employed. If the Arduino is turned on and all the sensors are controlled by Arduino, then all of the aforementioned sensors will start working at once. The Raspberry PI, AI, and camera that are housed in the other portion of the gadget are utilised to detect both pest and disease attacks. The farmer is informed if the camera detects the insect attack. We also offer a fertiliser calculator to help you determine how much fertiliser is necessary for each crop in order to control insect attacks. Therefore, farmers may apply the proper amount of fertilisers to the crops using our fertiliser calculator. We now offer a mobile application that allows you to examine real-time farm data in addition to the fertiliser calculator feature. Our mobile application pulls data from the cloud and displays it in accordance with what farmers are asking for. Micro climate analysis, harnessed through AI algorithms, offers a data-driven approach to optimize crop selection. Through continuous monitoring of temperature, air quality index, and humidity, AI employs decision trees algorithm to correlate environmental variables with crop preferences. For instance, decision trees analyze historical and real-time data to identify temperature thresholds where specific crops flourish, ensuring ideal growing conditions. Air quality insights guide choices, as AI recognizes crops resilient to pollutants or sensitive to air composition changes. Humidity data guides water-intensive crop selection in suitable conditions. Additionally, AI can perform clustering analysis, grouping areas with similar micro climates, enabling regional-specific crop recommendations. AI's adaptive learning capabilities fine-tune crop recommendations over time, enhancing accuracy with each season’s data. 5.3 Implementing a fertilizer calculator with AI involves several steps 1. Collect data on crop types, soil characteristics, growth stages, and historical pest incidents. 2. Apply regression algorithms to analyze this data, correlating nutrient levels with pest occurrences. 3. Train the AI model using historical data to predict optimal nutrient requirements based on crop and soil conditions. Incorporate real-time data such as weather forecasts and pest population trends to dynamically adjust recommendations. 4. Create a user-friendly Mobile App interface where farmers input crop details and receive AI-generated fertiliser suggestions. Integrate data from IoT devices and sensors for accurate, up-to-date information. 5. Regularly update and refine the AI model with new data to improve accuracy. 6 Results Framework of proposed work is variety of environmental factors including temperature, humidity, soil moisture and nutrient is defined. Next, select and fabricate the necessary hardware components, including sensors and IoT devices. Then, set up data collection and management, ensuring secure storage and preprocessing. Develop AI models for real-time analysis and visualization of data, enabling actionable insights for farmers. According to the suggested algorithm as depicted in Fig. 2, the sensors will start operating in accordance with the power supply provided to the Arduino board. The microcontroller unit and the soil moisture sensor are both interfaced, and the microcontroller unit periodically receives the corresponding readings from the soil moisture sensor. Along with the temperature and humidity of the microenvironment detected by the temperature sensor, the air index is also monitored using an air index sensor and NDVI time series data from MODIS Satellite for adapting the new cropping pattern. The main objective of the microcontroller unit is to receive the data values transmitted by the sensors and the LoRa transmitter, which is set up to save the data in the cloud. The microcontroller receives the data from the LoRa receiver and displays the information in the LCD screen. For timely irrigation, which supplies the necessary amount of water to the receptive crops according to the stages, a DC Pump and a Microcontroller are employed. If the Arduino is turned on and all the sensors are controlled by Arduino, then all of the aforementioned sensors will start working at once. The Raspberry PI, AI and camera that are located in the other portion of the gadget are utilised to detect both insect and disease attacks. The farmer is informed if the camera detects the insect attack. We also offer a fertiliser calculator to help you determine how much fertiliser is necessary for each crop in order to control pest attacks. So, according to our fertilizer calculator farmers can feed the correct quantity of fertilizers to the crops. Along with fertilizer calculator facility we also provide Mobile Application to view the live data of the farm. Our mobile application retrieves data from the cloud and shows it in accordance with what farmers are asking for (multilingual). Google Firebase, where the database is located and the web server is hosted on Apache Web Server, receives the data.

Smart agriculture reduces its carbon footprint by implementing sustainable, green farming, limiting the use of pesticides and fertilisers, and increasing the use of natural resources. As was already said, smart agriculture has various challenges. To get around these challenges, both new and old technologies must be used. In this work, cloud-based AI models for smart agriculture are used. The use of advanced microcontrollers in hardware has expedited the shift in computing paradigm. Giving IoT devices intelligence is the most recent development. LoRa technology enables network accessibility. If the sensor data exceeds a predetermined threshold value, the microcontroller unit continuously examines the sensor data using AI and sends an alarm SMS to the mobile phone of an owner who is in a faraway place. The relevant data obtained from measuring the DHT11 sensor's varied readings in a range of climatic conditions are used to determine the threshold value. By employing WSN nodes like LoRa for data transmission and database systems for local data storage, this system can be improved. Technology advancements and the meteoric emergence of AI have transformed traditional agriculture into a smart, intelligent, automated agriculture. Smart agriculture reduces its carbon footprint by implementing sustainable, green farming, limiting the use of pesticides and fertilisers, and increasing the use of natural resources. The agricultural industry will soon include Agriculture 5.0 [48]. By doing this, the system's sustainability will be preserved as yields rise. Both industrialised and developing countries will follow a similar trend. From an economic and environmental standpoint, humanity will embrace efficient food production and delivery more than ever [50]. Future work of the work should prioritize sensor technology advancements, enhancing AI models for precision agriculture, optimizing energy efficiency, expanding user-friendly interfaces, promoting scalability and cost-efficiency. These efforts will contribute to more accurate data collection, better decision-making for farmers, sustainable IoT implementations, improved accessibility, and wider adoption of this technology, ultimately fostering increased agricultural productivity and sustainability.

  Main Objective: To design and implement an intelligent irrigation system that integrates IoT and machine learning technologies to optimize water management and enhance agricultural productivity.
  Study Location: Unspecified
  Data Sources: Sensors, cameras, weather data, user irrigation logs, and historical data.
  Technologies Used: Internet of Things (IoT), LoRa, machine learning, data fusion, cloud computing, big data, wireless sensor networks
  Key Findings: The authors successfully implemented an intelligent irrigation system based on LoRa technology, which demonstrated promising results. The system reduced water consumption by 5.28% compared to traditional irrigation systems. The system also exhibits self-learning capabilities and adjusts watering schedules based on data fusion from multiple sources, such as weather conditions, soil moisture levels, and plant growth patterns.
  Extract 1: The valve node supports a two-zone output to switch the valve on and off. The output signal is a 9-V 120 ms pulse, so a power conversion circuit with large capacity is carefully designed to store enough power to drive the valve. As to the sensing node, an RS485 interface is implemented instead of the DC output. The RS485 module provides an interface for multiple sensors.
  Extract 2: The history records depict the daily and monthly water consumption for the user, as illustrated in Fig. 3(e). Fig. 3(f) shows the smart watering interface. Once it is enabled, the data fusion model is activated. It provides the watering adjustment by combining multi-source data. As a result, the watering schedule is optimized automatically.
  Limitations: None
  Relevance Evaluation: The paper is exceptionally relevant to the outline point, as it directly addresses the use of transmitting sensor and camera data to cloud-based platforms (e.g., AWS IoT, Google Cloud IoT, Microsoft Azure IoT) for remote access and analysis using protocols like MQTT, CoAP, or AMQP. The paper concretely demonstrates the use of LoRa, a widely recognized LPWAN technology, to implement this concept, providing a practical solution for industrial settings.
  Relevance Score: 1.0
  Inline Citation: (Gong et al., 2022)

Abstract Water resources have a great influence on human society, but saving water in irrigation still remains a challenge. This article proposes an intelligent irrigation system that integrates a data fusion model and a long-rang (LoRa) network for optimizing the watering schedule. A data fusion model is proposed, which first adopts the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to simulate and predict the proper watering demands by integrating multi-source heterogeneous data, that is, historical weather data, user irrigation logs, weather forecasts, and online monitoring sensor data. A self-powered wide-area network is implemented and deployed by using LoRa to facilitate multiple Internet of Things (IoT) application scenarios. It includes a gateway and two types of nodes: a valve node and a sensing node. The node is capable of energy autonomy through the scheme of waterflow-based power generation, thus realizing maintenance-free throughout the life cycle. A cloud platform is designed to provide network management, intelligent irrigation control, and the interface of the mobile application. The proposed system is evaluated through a case study of landscape watering. On average, the proposed system achieves a water-saving efficiency of 94.74% compared with the conventional manual setting solutions.

Introduction Water resources are one of the most important resources on Earth but are uneven in both time and space distribution. Agriculture, as the foundation of human society, is by far the biggest consumer of water. Therefore, the use of water resources with high efficiency is an important research field in agricultural development. Multiple technologies have been developed to improve water utilization, such as soil-less culture [1], sprinkling irrigation [2], [3], and trickle irrigations [4]. Although recent advances in agriculture have dramatically improved water use efficiency, there is still a high demand for saving water to further improve water utilization in some dry areas. Irrigation systems have been effectively used in agriculture for many years. A conventional irrigation system requires many wires to collect sensor signals and transmit commands to control the solenoid valves. The high cost of cables and various accessories makes the entire system expensive and complex, limiting the scale of deployment. Emerging communication technologies, such as general packet radio service (GPRS) cellular networks [5], [6], ZigBee [6], [7], and Bluetooth [8], enable wireless coverage for farmland. However, they also have some limitations. For instance, the devices using GPRS always consume power, which increases the maintenance workload of battery replacement. In addition, they rely on the cellular network provided by telecom operators, which is not reliable in some rural areas. As to the solutions with ZigBee or Bluetooth, the communication distance is not long enough to cover the large area of farmland, although the low power performance of the devices can be guaranteed. Recently, multiple low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies have emerged, such as NB-IoT, SigFox, and long range (LoRa) radio technique. The key features of LPWAN technology include a long-distance communication, low power consumption, high capacity, and low cost. The LPWAN overcomes the limitations of conventional wireless technologies. Combined with energy harvesting, it makes energy-autonomous IoT nodes possible. Consequently, it is a promising technology to be used in wireless irrigation systems. In recent years, several IoT-enabled water management solutions have been developed for precision agriculture. However, most of them are sensing-based solutions, and the watering schedule is a predefined offline system. Few solutions consider the user’s experience, knowledge, and long-term environmental variables. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI), the long short-term memory network (LSTM), was introduced in the field of precision agriculture [9]. As a special type of neural network, the LSTM is especially helpful for the time series analysis [10]. It inspires us to use LSTM to analyze the relationship between weather changes and irrigation needs set by farmers and gardeners. Further, the acquired models can predict the future irrigation needs for common users. In order to achieve the goal, an intelligent water irrigation system is proposed. The novelty of the work is that an intelligent irrigation system with data fusion is proposed. The data fusion model considers the history of local weather, irrigation logs, weather forecasts, and real-time sensor data; analyzes their internal relationships; and then forms a big data fusion system to improve water-saving efficiency. This article presents an intelligent irrigation system based on a LoRa network and a data fusion model. The following are the technical contributions of this work. • We explore the method of data fusion to realize intelligent irrigation. Unlike the conventional predefined offline system, the proposed system combines history logs, weather forecasts, and real-time data to predict the proper water demand for future irrigation. By loading knowledge from different domains, the data fusion model is expected to extend to more IoT application scenarios. • We implement a self-powered wide-area network using LoRa to facilitate multiple IoT scenarios, owing to its long-range communication and low-power feature. The waterflow-based energy harvesting scheme is designed and implemented by integrating the micro hydro generator. The scheme can achieve maintenance-free of battery replacement in the whole life cycle. The rest of the article is organized as follows. The related work is introduced in Section 2. Section 3 describes the architecture and implementation of the proposed system. Section 4 provides the details of the experimental results. Finally, the conclusion is presented in Section 5. 2. Related works 2.1. IoT-enabled intelligent irrigation The rapid development of the IoT has enabled irrigation systems with more new features that can effectively improve watering efficiency. In recent years, a variety of wireless sensor network (WSN)-based irrigation systems have been proposed. With sensors deployed, multiple types of environment information can be monitored. The irrigation system can determine watering actions based on the sensor data and the preset threshold by users [5], [7], [11], [12]. For example, Roy et al. [6] designed a real-time automated irrigation system for crop fields. The system sets up the WSN to sense the parameters of the environment using ZigBee. More recently, LoRa was introduced for various IoT applications [13], [14]. Zhao et al. [15] designed and implemented a smart irrigation system based on LoRa. The system can cover up to 8 km, while the node is self-powered with a water turbocharge mechanism. Another widely used water-saving technique is evapotranspiration (ET)-based irrigation. The concept of ET is to calculate the evaporation from the soil surface and the transpiration through plant canopies [16]. The ET-based intelligent watering controller calculates the watering demand based on the value of ET [17], [18]. Klein et al. [19] demonstrated a closed loop irrigation system that calculates the water requirement from satellite images and local daily weather. It achieved a 26% yield increase and a 16% increase in water-use efficiency. Munoz et al. [20] proposed a cloud platform for greenhouse crop production. It provides forecasting based on models for the climate, crop production, and irrigation processes, which makes it more flexible than traditional hard-coded approaches. The ET-certified controller usually costs a few hundred dollars on the market. In addition, the parameter setting is complicated, requiring professional weather and agronomy knowledge. In recent years, AI has emerged as a new technology introduced in agriculture [21]. Specifically, in the field of water conservation, multiple machine learning algorithms have been proposed to simulate the water-balancing model and predict the water demand [22], [23], [24], [25]. Goap et al. [22] proposed a machine learning algorithm to estimate the difference and changes in soil moisture due to weather conditions. Chang et al. [23] proposed a machine-learning-based smart irrigation system with a LoRa P2P network that can automatically learn the irrigation experiences from expert farmers for greenhouse crops. Moghadas et al. [24] proposed an algorithm for accurate characterization of the soil moisture from electromagnetic induction data using Bayesian inference and a neural network. Nie et al. [25] presented the prediction result of soil moisture by employing different machine learning models. 2.2. Data fusion With the development of the IoT and big data, the explosive growth of various types of data has brought great challenges to data processing and utilization. Data fusion, which can be explained as the process of fusing multiple records representing the same real-world object into a single, consistent, and clean representation, is used to integrate huge amounts of data from heterogeneous information systems [26]. Data fusion was first applied in the military [27]. It is extremely important to obtain all kinds of useful sensor information on the battlefield, for example, by evaluating battlefield situation and threats and providing tactical and strategic decision-making assistance for the combat forces. With the continuous development of data fusion, it gradually expanded to many other areas, such as cyber–physical–social systems [28], human activity detection and health monitoring [29], sentiment analysis of educational big data [30], and industrial fault detection and identification [31]. Multiple methodologies for cross-domain data fusion have been proposed [32]. Dragos et al. [33] presented a method to combine soft and sensor data to create enhanced situation assessment for a track-and-detect application. Chen et al. [34] proposed a ternary data fusion model based on reinforcement learning in the production process of hot rolling. By merging the ternary data, faster and better decisions can be made. Zhao et al. [35] developed a positioning system using big sensor data preprocessing in multi-source fusion. The fusion technique can reduce the data collection amount significantly. Data fusion has also been further extended to the field of precision agriculture. In 2014, Mouazen et al. [36] presented a data fusion approach for the delineation of water-holding capacity zones for site-specific irrigation based on multiple sensors. More recently, Viani et al. [37] proposed a low-cost wireless monitoring and decision support system for water conservation in agriculture. The system contains a fuzzy logic theory that integrates the farmers’ experience, irrigation practices, soil conditions, and crop models, providing improved water conservation compared to the conventional threshold-based technique. In summary, the existing automatic irrigation systems are mostly sensing-based solutions. The watering demand algorithms are usually threshold-trigged, timer-based, soil–water balancing schemes, and ET-based, which lack the ability to dynamically adjust in time according to weather changes. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have focused on AI-based systems with data fusion. In this article, we propose a knowledge-based data fusion model based on big data, that is, the history of local weather, irrigation logs, weather forecasts, and real-time sensor data. The model can achieve optimization for the future watering schedule to improve water-saving efficiency. In addition, as we load the knowledge from different domains into the proposed model, the system can be extended to more IoT application scenarios.

System architecture and implementation The architecture of the system is shown in Fig. 1. It consists of three phases, devices, cloud, and user. Various LoRa nodes are deployed in multiple scenarios, such as landscape watering, dust removal, and agriculture irrigation. The LoRa gateways are deployed as a data hub, in which the data from LoRa nodes are preliminarily processed and transmitted to the cloud platform. The IoT cloud platform hosts the LoRa network and provides services for each function block. The data fusion model deployed in the cloud platform optimizes the watering scheduler. Different domains of knowledge can be selected and input to the data fusion model to fit the corresponding application scenarios. Moreover, users can access the irrigation system either from a mobile application or a web interface to check and control the watering schedule remotely. 3.1. Hardware design 3.1.1. Gateway The LoRa gateway is the core of the LoRa network and acts as a relay between the LoRa nodes and the cloud platform. For irrigation in farmland, the gateway is usually deployed on the top of a tower or a building. It can provide signal coverage over the whole farmland, usually dozens of square kilometers. As for landscape watering in a garden, the gateway can be mounted on the wall of a house, depending on the ease of installation and electrical connection. Further, the whole LoRa gateway is packaged in a plastic box with IP-68 standards to provide waterproof capability. Download : Download high-res image (432KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Design of the LoRa gateway and nodes. (a) LoRa gateway. (b) Valve node. (c) Sensing node. (d) Micro hydro generator integration. The gateway consists of a microprocessor and multiple modules to realize communication, execution, display, and other functions. An ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller is selected as the core of the gateway. It can provide high performance calculation with low power consumption. It has rich communication interfaces such as USART, I2C, and SPI, which are sufficient to interact with other modules. A 2-Kb electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM) is used as external memory to backup data and configurations in case of power loss. The gateway provides both wired and wireless connections to the valve nodes. For the wired access, the interface of the 12-zone 24-V AC output is designed through optoisolators. The AC output can connect directly to the valve nodes, controlling their working states. A programmable logic controller (PLC) interface is also integrated into the board, providing an alternative method of node connection. For wireless access, a LoRa module is customized based on sx1268 from Semtech. The communication distance can be as far as 8 km. The module supports a LoRa network with up to 72 nodes. To interact with the cloud platform, the gateway supports multiple communication modules for facilitating different scenarios, including Wi-Fi (USR-WIFI232), LTE cat −1 (WH-GM5), and Ethernet. Also, a 480 × 320 LCD touch screen is used to set local configurations and display the basic information of the gateway. The printed circuit board (PCB) of the LoRa gateway is depicted in Fig. 2(a). 3.1.2. LoRa node The LoRa nodes, both the valve node (Fig. 2(b)) and sensing node (Fig. 2(c)) are deployed in the farmland far away from the gateway, controlling the solenoid valves or collecting environment information. An ARM Cortex M0 microcontroller operating at 32 MHz is selected. It has 8 Kb of RAM and 64 Kb of Flash, which are sufficient for the program running on the LoRa node. Compared with the gateway, the peripheral modules are simplified. A LoRa module is integrated for communication with the gateway. The power-management module performs the power conversion from the battery. The LCD is designed for local debugging and configuration and is tiny and power efficient. It can be disabled after deployment. There is a slight difference between the two types of nodes. The valve node supports a two-zone output to switch the valve on and off. The output signal is a 9-V 120 ms pulse, so a power conversion circuit with large capacity is carefully designed to store enough power to drive the valve. As to the sensing node, an RS485 interface is implemented instead of the DC output. The RS485 module provides an interface for multiple sensors. Unlike the gateway, the nodes are usually in a power-constrained environment with limited access to electricity. For both the valve node and sensing node, a 2200-mAh Li-ion battery is selected to provide the power supply. In addition, a micro hydro generator is integrated with the valve node, as shown in Fig. 2(d). The water pipe is divided into two branches: One is for the irrigation and another is for electricity generation. This structure successfully avoids the decrease of water flow velocity caused by the generator. The charging current is between 200 mA and 300 mA at a fixed 5-V output, which is much higher than that consumed by the node every day. Therefore, the valve node can be self-powered, forming an energy-autonomous system. The PCB of the node and the battery is packaged inside an IP-68 waterproof plastic box, with dimension of 90 mm  × 50 mm × 42 mm. The antenna, made from flexible material is attached to the inner side of the box, which makes the node compact. 3.2. Software design 3.2.1. Cloud platform A cloud platform is designed and implemented. Considering the high availability and load balancing, an HTTP-MQ architecture is designed and deployed. The core of the cloud platform is the clustered servers, in which RabbitMQ is installed as the middleware of the message queue. The servers provide both the RabbitMQ application program interface (API) and hypertext transport protocol (HTTP) API for different types of connections. The LoRa gateways and mobile applications connect to the servers through the HAProxy server via the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol. Moreover, the web client connects the servers through the Nginx server, where HTTP requests are distributed. Benefiting from such an architecture, the mobile application can connect to the devices through the shared memory message queue. Therefore, the latency is significantly reduced compared with the HTTP request mechanism. To meet the requirement of storing heterogeneous data, a MySQL database and a backup database are implemented. 3.2.2. Mobile application A mobile application is developed to provide an application software and an interface for the users, as shown in Fig. 3. The menu interface (Fig. 3(a)) contains manual watering, irrigation schedule, real-time sensor display, system settings, smart watering, and history records. The watering time of each valve can be set in the manual watering interface (Fig. 3(b)). A timer-based scheduler (Fig. 3(c)) is available for the user to set the watering time and frequency for a whole week. The offset of sensitivity can be set according to the user’s experience. The real-time sensor data, such as soil temperature and moisture, air temperature and humidity, and water flow, provide online monitoring for users, as shown in Fig. 3(d). The data are also uploaded to the cloud platform as feedback for the intelligent irrigation model. The history records depict the daily and monthly water consumption for the user, as illustrated in Fig. 3(e). Fig. 3(f) shows the smart watering interface. Once it is enabled, the data fusion model is activated. It provides the watering adjustment by combining multi-source data. As a result, the watering schedule is optimized automatically.

Data fusion model For conventional irrigation systems, the valve controllers are deployed in each zone of the garden or farmland. The controllers are usually timer-based. The users usually roughly set the daily watering schedule in advance according to their experiences. However, such a setting is inconvenient in daily life and inflexible for dynamic adjustment. Various factors affect the watering schedule. For example, the watering amount can be reduced if there is a thundershower just before watering. Therefore, an intelligent irrigation with watering schedule optimization is needed. To solve the problem, a data fusion model based on the LSTM network is implemented and deployed on the cloud platform, as shown in Fig. 4. The historical weather data and the irrigation logs are sourced from the last two years. The weather forecast for the next few days is also ported to the model through the API from the website. The real-time environment information is collected from the sensing nodes for feedback. Thus, the data from the past, present, and future are used together as the input parameters to the model. Through the fusion of multi-source data, the model learns the users’ irrigation experiences in the past few years, and then outputs the optimized irrigation schedule. Download : Download high-res image (198KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Data fusion framework. The historical weather data and user irrigation logs are exported from the database online. It covers as much climate information as possible in the past 2 years to ensure the generalization ability of the model. The 13 types of weather information in an hourly interval are used, including temperature, daytime, wind speed, wind direction, weather code, precipitation, humidity, visibility, pressure, cloud cover, heat index, dew point, and wind gust speed. The irrigation logs of each zone are also combined as an input of the network. Therefore, the whole dataset is a matrix with 13+2 × columns. The first 13 columns represent the weather information, the following columns represent the preset watering schedule of zones, and the last columns are the actual watering results which are set by professional gardeners. Each row shows the timestamps in hourly intervals. The data in each column are standardized to have zero mean and unit variance. An LSTM network composed of six layers is implemented to estimate the proper watering schedule. The sequence input layer receives the data in hourly intervals. Then the LSTM layer with 200 hidden units learns the correlation of time series and the watering schedule. A dropout layer is used with a dropout probability of 0.5 to prevent overfitting. Also, two fully connected layers are added to achieve the conversion of different dimensions. Finally, the regression layer outputs the estimated results for the watering schedule. The action commands are sent to the valves through the watering scheduler. In this scenario, the online monitoring data are further used as feedback for the watering scheduler. Thus the closed loop of the irrigation system is built. It monitors the irrigation process conditions, such as the soil moisture content, to avoid any unexpected over-irrigation. 4. System evaluation and analysis Three scenarios of intelligent irrigation are deployed in this work. The first is a signal coverage test in an urban area. The second is the irrigation of apple seeding in a greenhouse located in Shaan Xi Province, China. In this scenario, the mist spray in the greenhouses is frequently switched on/off every few tens of seconds to maintain the optimal air humidity for apple seeding. Thus, the system’s real-time performance is assessed. The final scenario is landscape watering in a private home garden where we pay more attention to intelligent irrigation as well as low power consumption.

Case I: Urban signal coverage The signal coverage test is conducted in an urban area. The LoRa gateway is placed on top of a building. The detailed parameters are listed in Table 1. During the test, the LoRa node is placed on a moving car and slowly moved far away from the gateway. The position and received signal strength indication (RSSI) are recorded and displayed on the map, as illustrated in Fig. 5. Two types of tests with different transmission speeds are carried out. For the baud rate of 50.78 bps, the communication distance is as far as 8 km, and the receiving sensitivity can be lower than −120 dBm. For the baud rate of 2.4 kbps, the communication distance is a bit lower, around 5.6 km. The results show that the signal coverage decreases with the increase of the transmission rate, which is a tradeoff during deployment.

System latency The LoRa network is deployed on farmland composed of several greenhouses. The gateway is installed in a metal box (Fig. 6(a)). The LoRa nodes are placed in the greenhouses, connected to the valves and sensors (Fig. 6(b)). The distance between the gateway and each node is less than 1.5 km. Also, there is no obvious obstruction for the radio transmission, so, the signal coverage can be well guaranteed.

Parameter Value TX power 17 dBm TX height 40 m Antenna Isotropic, 3 dBi Baud rate 50.78 bps/ 2.4 kbps Packet length 15 Bytes Moving speed <10 km/h The system latency is a critical issue in this scenario, as the valves should be controlled in real-time. An experiment on the transmission latency between the LoRa gateway and the LoRa nodes is conducted. The gateway broadcasts the packet with 10 bytes periodically. The system latency is recorded as soon as the packet is received by the node. As illustrated in Fig. 7, with the increase of the transmission speed, the receiving latency is significantly reduced. The curve flattens out when the transmission speed exceeds 10 kbps. To ensure a latency meets real-time demands, a transmission speed of at least 2.4 kbps is required, and then, the latency can be less than 300 ms. 4.3. Case III: Landscape watering We also deploy a LoRa network at a private garden, in Mission Viejo, California, USA. The garden is divided into four zones. A valve node is deployed in each zone to control the watering. Unlike the greenhouse, the low-power and smart watering performance is of greater concern in this scenario.

Low power performance The battery-powered nodes are deployed in the garden. The wireless solution can reduce the cost of deployment compared with the wired controllers, in which the power cable accounts for a large proportion. A detailed analysis of energy consumption is carried out. The analysis is assumed in a daily use scenario. The irrigation system works once a day, and the valve is switched on for 1 min. The LoRa module consumes a considerable amount of current; so an experiment is conducted to observe the power consumption under different conditions. The module is configured in sleep state. It wakes up at regular intervals to listen for any packets to receive. The experiment result is shown in Fig. 8. It is obvious that with the increase of the wake-up interval, the average current decreases significantly, especially when the wake-up time is less than 2500 ms. Besides, a lower speed transmission rate consumes more current, as it takes more time for the RF module to transmit the same length of data. Considering the balance between power consumption and response time, as well as the signal coverage, a wake-up period of 2 s is selected with a transmission speed of 2.4 kbps. The total power consumption of the LoRa node consists of five parts in different working states. For each state the current is carefully measured, as shown in Table 2. Then, the amount of battery power consumed is determined using the following equations: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) where: is the power consumption of the main board in sleeping mode; is the power consumption of the LoRa module in standby mode; is the power consumption of the main board in working mode; is the power consumption of the LoRa module in data transmitting mode; and is the power consumed to switch the valve on and off. hence, the energy consumed everyday can be calculated as follows: (6) The number of days can be obtained as follows: (7) In this sense, a battery-powered valve node can work for approximately 18 months at a frequency of switching valve eight times every day. In some real deployment environments, the frequency of valve action is lower than the calculated assumption, so, the battery life cycle can be further extended. In addition, the microhydro generator is integrated in some application scenarios. In this case, the battery is charged when the valve is on. According to the previous assumption, the valve is switched on four times for 1 min each time. The generated electricity is determined by using the following equation: (8) It is obvious that can cover the energy consumption, . This indicates that an average of 1 min of charging can fulfill the node’s daily energy consumption. In fact, the irrigation time can be larger in some actual deployments. Therefore, the node can be self-powered, achieving an energy-autonomous system. 4.3.2. Intelligent watering performance There is a dry season and a rainy season in Mission Viejo, California, as shown in Fig. 9. From June to October, there is almost no rain (less than 5 mm). The rainy season is from November to April, in which the rainfall is always larger than 60 mm. Therefore, there is a strong correlation between the local weather and watering amount. For the sake of sightseeing, it is necessary to ensure the normal growth of flowers and grass. Owing to the lack of water, the use of a smart controller is incentivized by law to avoid over-irrigation in California, especially as rainfall is abundant some days.

The predicted results from the model are similar to the manual watering schedules in all zones. Table 3 lists the output of data fusion model in terms of the total watering amount, average amount, and root-mean-square error (RMSE). The RMSE of all zones is close to zero, indicating that the deviation between the predicted results of the model and the actual watering amount is small. Therefore, it is believed that the model learns the user experience from the multiple input data sets. A case study on general users followed, and 30 days’ data were selected independently of the training samples. The predicted watering amount was delivered to the valve nodes to replace the original timer-based watering schedule. As shown in Fig. 11, the predicted values are dynamically adjusted according to the changes of weather conditions. The predicted value is slightly lower in zone 1, zone 3, and zone 4. For zone 2, there are approximately 100 s longer than the original watering schedule, which is still acceptable in the daily watering. The detailed results of each zone are presented in Table 4. The landscapes in the four zones are grow well during this month; so, we believe that the predicted watering schedule generated by the LSTM network is reasonable. The watering efficiency, defined by the predicted value over the scheduled value, is 94.74% within the last 30 days. The advantages of the intelligent irrigation model over other approaches are its simple deployment and self-learning capability. Conventional irrigation devices, such as timer-based or ET-based devices always require complicated parameter setting, which requires professional weather and agronomy knowledge. As to the proposed system, it can learn the user’s watering experience and provide optimizations; so, it is more user-friendly and convenient for deployment. 5. Conclusion In this article, we have presented an intelligent irrigation system based on data fusion. The system explores LPWAN techniques, which provide a wireless, low-power, low-cost, easy-to-deploy, and intelligent solution over conventional irrigation systems. The cloud platform provides a data fusion model that combines multiple types of information, enabling an optimized decision for the watering schedule. The user-friendly mobile application allows users to set watering schedules remotely, as well as check the real-time sensor data for monitoring.

Abstract Due to the increasing world population, demand for food products have created the need to modernize and intensify agricultural operations through precision agriculture. The Internet of Things offers a wide variety of solutions for precision agriculture, but implementing it in the agriculture field imposes challenges to hardware and data communication in the network. Importantly, the sensor nodes have to be reliable for long periods with the limited available battery power. In this connection, the goal of this paper is to propose an efficient data collection algorithm which improves the network lifetime of the wireless sensor network (WSN), decreases the energy hole issue and reduces the data collection delay. In the proposed work, the rendezvous points (RPs) in the network are selected based on the energy level of the nodes, data packet density and the distance to the RPs. Then the mobile sink (MS) moves to the RPs in the shortest possible path to collect the data from the data-powered points. A hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm called WOAXGWO is proposed to find the shortest path for the MS. To assess the performance, the network’s lifetime, energy consumption, and latency are considered. Simulation findings show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and are validated on a coconut farm to demonstrate its reliability.

Introduction According to the UN Food and Agricultural Organization, the world will need to produce 70% more food in 2050 due to the exponential growth of the population [1]. But the challenges such as shrinking agricultural lands, natural resource depletion, and declining agriculture workforce triggered the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) based solutions in farming. It helps farmer to ensure high crop yield, reduce operational costs, and to close the supply demand gap [2]. In addition, IoT leverages an important advantage of automating the irrigation system and monitoring the agriculture field conditions from anywhere in the world. Favorably, smart agriculture is under major focus and in R&D in recent years [3]. In farming, the IoT is deployed for irrigation management, disease and pest monitoring, soil and water quality monitoring, and intelligent greenhouses [4]. The IoT is defined as the system of inter-related computing devices which has the ability to transfer data across the network without any human interventions [1]. IoT integrates a bundle of technologies such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), middleware systems, cloud computing and end-user applications. Implementation of IoT in any application involves four major components: IoT devices, communication technology, internet and data storage, processing and monitoring [5]. The IoT devices are battery operated embedded systems deployed in the farm to measure field data such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, soil moisture and soil nutrition. The measured data values are transmitted to the cloud/database server for data storage, data processing and to extract meaningful information. Using the derived information, the necessary actions are automated with the help of actuators. Real time monitoring systems are used to present the information to the farmers in their own understandable form. In this work, IoT is deployed to irrigate a coconut farm and the farm taken into consideration uses Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) [6] prescribed main and sub channel drip irrigation model. The sensors monitor soil moisture, nutrition and weather data are deployed in the farm which are capable of communicating with each other through Zigbee [7]. The corresponding implementation of the IoT ecosystem at coconut farm is shown in Fig. 1. Though IoT yield number of benefits, there are numerous challenges in implementing it in the agriculture field, namely, poor internet connectivity, high hardware costs, high maintenance and lack of data security [8]. In particular, since the sensor nodes are mostly battery operated, the available energy in the nodes are limited [9]. The major energy consumer of a sensor node is radio module [10]. So during data transfer, improper routing and imbalance in workload will cause uneven energy consumption between the nodes creating energy hole issues. Consequently, it reduces the network lifetime and results in huge maintenance cost. Using mobile sink (MS) with an efficient data collection technique is one of the most effective approaches to mitigate the energy hole issues and minimize the data packet delay and packet loss [11], [12], [13].

Data collection using MS can be categorized into direct and rendezvous methods [14]. In direct method, the MS moves to each node and collects data from them individually. But with the large number of sensors deployed in the network, it induces high data collection delays [15], [16]. Rather, in a rendezvous based data collection method, the subset of sensors called rendezvous points (RPs) or collection points are selected and the other nodes send the data to the closest RP. Then, MS moves to each RP and collects data from them. So the rendezvous based method facilitates collecting the data well before the delay bound [17], [18]. Moreover, improper or static RP rotation policy will cause huge workload on the RP nodes and again resulting in the energy hole issue [19]. In order to tackle this problem, dynamic RP selection policy [14] is employed where the energy and workload balance among the sensors can be achieved. The next challenge is planning the trajectory for efficient data collection from the RPs using the mobile sink, which is an NP-hard problem [20]. Trajectory planning can be either a learning-based or non-learning-based approaches. In this work, a non-learning based approach is employed in order to reduce the computational complexity. Finding the tour is essentially the well-known traveling salesman problem (TSP), where the goal is to find the shortest path to visit all the RPs. TSP can be solved using optimization techniques and, in the literature, algorithms such as the whale optimization algorithm (WOA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant colony optimization algorithms (ACO) [21], etc., have been used. Though these algorithms are effective in solving routing problems, they suffer from poor convergence and trapping of local optima. Among these algorithms, the performance of WOA has been proven better than the other algorithms. WOA works best, especially in the exploration phase, but it lacks performance in the exploitation phase [22], [23]. Hence, in this paper, a new hybrid meta heuristic algorithm called WOAXGWO is proposed to avoid premature convergence, improve WOA’s exploitation phase, and extend the network lifetime. For improving the readability of the work, all the acronyms and abbreviations are mentioned in the Table 1. The main contributions of this work are: Table 1. List of abbreviations.

The proposed data collection algorithm first finds the optimal set of RPs for each round based on the weight factor calculated using residual energy, the data packet density of the node, and the distance between the next nearest RPs. • Then the mobile sink determines the shortest route to visit all the RPs to reduce the data collection delay. The shortest tour path is determined by solving the TSP problem using the proposed WOAXGWO algorithm. • The results of the proposed WOAXGWO are compared against other state-of-the-arts such as WOA, GWO, IGWO, and WOAGWO. The simulation results for the proposed algorithm are presented. In addition, the proposed model is implemented in real time coconut farm to prove its reliability, and the corresponding results are shown. 2. Related work Generally, the network is divided into a number of grids where each grid has an RP node with a number of other sensor nodes. Many works in the literature employed dynamic RP selection policies, metaheuristic algorithms, etc. to choose the RPs in the network [14]. Artificial fish swarm optimization algorithm, Global Levy Flight of Cuckoo Search, Particle Swarm Optimization, WOA are some of the optimization algorithms used to choose RPs in the network [24]. Residual energy, coverage contribution, data fusion degree, the hop distance, the number of packets transmitted and randomly generated values are the parameters majorly used in the selection process [17]. And to forward data from the ordinary nodes to the RP, ring and tree topology is the most adopted techniques. In tree topology, the RP nodes act as the root nodes. The main disadvantage is that the network experiences under additional load during each round due to the tree construction phase. Also there are chances that the same nodes get elected as RPs in consecutive rounds. This would cause a huge data forwarding load and an energy imbalance among the nodes. Considering the movement cost of the MS, it must travel in the shortest possible path to reduce end-to-end data collection delay. For this purpose, a number of works in the literature employed TSP. TSP can be solved using optimization techniques [17] and the most recent interesting trend in optimization algorithms is hybrid metaheuristics [25]. The major challenge in the development of any meta-heuristic algorithm is to find the balance between exploration and exploitation phase. Exploration phase is the process in which the optimization algorithm investigates the promising area of the search space while in the exploitation phase concerns to the local search capability in the design space found in exploration phase [26]. To enhance the performance of the metaheuristic algorithms, one algorithm is hybridized with another to extract the best performance [25]. Some of the hybrid algorithms proposed in the literature are; ant colony optimization algorithm with glow swarm optimization [21], dragon fly with firefly algorithms [27], etc. In [21], ant colony optimization algorithm is integrated with glow swarm optimization approach, to find the optimal cluster head. Distance, delay and energy is used as the parameters in the fitness function to select the cluster head. In [27], dragon fly and firefly algorithms are hybridized to find the RPs where the fitness function is designed based on energy, delay and distance. While, grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm is used to propose a distance based clustering algorithm in [28] to improve the performance of the WSN. Chauhan et al. [29] proposed firefly optimization algorithm based RP selection using the residual energy of the nodes, distance between nodes and node to sink. Boyineni et al. [17] proposed a modified ACO algorithm to find the RPs and the trajectory for mobile sink by considering residual energy and distance. But these works failed in considering path cost, network load balancing and data collection latency. One of the widely used latest optimization algorithm is WOA, in which the performance in finding the best solution (exploration phase) is good but it lacks refining the optimum solution (exploitation phase) [30]. In the literature, the simulated annealing algorithm is embedded in WOA algorithm [31] and GWO is hybridized with WOA (WOAGWO) [32] to enhance the exploitation phase of WOA. But the problem of imbalance between the exploration and exploitation phase still existed in both the works. An improved version of GWO (IGWO) is proposed in [33] to alleviate the imbalance, but it lacked the performance in the exploration phase. Hence, in this work, GWO is improved using dimension learning-based hunting (DLH) mechanism and is hybridized with WOA. The resultant algorithm is named as WOAXGWO and is used to solve the TSP problem in this work. 2.1. Grey wolf optimization GWO is based on the hunting behavior of grey wolves in which the search process is controlled by three best wolves , , and in each iteration, and leads wolves to the best position to find global solutions. Encircling the prey and hunting are the two main steps of wolf hunting. First, the wolves stop the movement of the prey by encircling them. The corresponding mathematical formulation is given by where . Here, is the current iteration, is the position of the prey, and coefficient vectors and are used to control the movement of the wolves near the prey. In the hunting process, the alpha wolf identifies the best solution and it updates its position if improved at each iteration. While beta and delta wolves identify the prey’s location. The following are the equations that are used to update the position of the wolves. But in contrast, GWO suffers from the imbalance between the exploration and exploitation phase, and stagnation in the local optima [33]. 3. System model In this paper, wireless homogeneous sensor nodes are considered and randomly deployed in a two dimensional space. These nodes are static in nature which are capable of communicating with each other. They are grouped together to form a network and the established network model can be described as a bidirectional weighted graph G(V,E,w) where is the set of all sensor nodes given by , is the set of all the edges in the network given by and is the weight of the edge. Here is a communication link established between the nodes and . and are given by where is the Euclidean distance between the sensor node and . The sensor nodes are homogeneous, and hence, the same initial energy ( ) is set to all the nodes. The location and energy information about sensor nodes with G(V,E,w) of the network is fed in MS. In order to collect the sensed data and to balance the energy and workload among the sensor nodes in the network, dynamic RP selection policy [17] is used. For each round, the number of RP nodes in the network are selected and given by and . Then, the possible paths to reach all the RPs are constructed, and the distance of the path is given by . The shortest path is chosen by the MS to collect data from the RPs where that minimizes the sum . Here, finding the shortest path by MS is similar to finding the shortest path by solving TSP. As TSP is an NP-hard problem solving it requires a better optimization algorithm and in this work new optimization algorithm WOAXGWO is proposed and used to solve TSP. So the main goals of this work are summarized as follows: (1) improve the network lifetime ( ) of the network by selecting optimal RPs dynamically (2) minimize the distance traveled by the MS to collect data from RPs and (3) consequently minimize the data delivery delay . This work considers that: (1) Wireless links are symmetric and bidirectional. (2) The sensor nodes can adjust their transmission power based on the distance between the nodes. (3) There are no isolated nodes in the network. (4) There are no obstacles between any pair of nodes. 3.1. Energy model The most common radio model [34] is considered in this work. Radio communication between the nodes are two types: (1) free-space model and (2) multi-path fading model. When the distance between the nodes is less than , the nodes can communicate in a single hop and is called as a free-space model. While if the distance between them is greater than , they communicate through multi hop and is called as a multi-path model. The energy consumption for transmitting an bit message over distance for free space and multi-path model is given by (1) and the energy consumption to receive this message is given by (2) where , , and . 4. Proposed model The proposed work has three subsections: (1) a procedure to select rendezvous points in the network, (2) a novel hybrid meta-heuristic optimization algorithm WOAXGWO to find the shortest path for the MS to reach all the RPs, and (3) a scheme to collect data. 4.1. Rendezvous points selection MS calculates the weight factor ( ) for all the sensor nodes and the nodes with heavier will be selected as RP. The weight of the node is calculated by multiplying the energy ratio with the number of packets that the node generated and the distance to the nearest RP. (3) where represents the probability of the node to be selected as RP, is the current round number, , is residual energy and is the initial energy of the node . is the number of data packets generated by in round and returns the distance between sensor and the closest RP. Here, returns the closest RP to the sensor and is given by (4) where is the set of RPs and . Initially and if there is no RP selected by the algorithm, then . The Eq. (3) ensures the following: 1. The probability of the node getting selected as RP in round is high, are the ones with maximum residual energy, maximum number of data packets generated in the previous round. 2. The node which is farthest to the already selected RP has high value and hence it ensures that the RPs are spread evenly and hence, the number of nodes connected with each RPs is similar and the energy depletion among the nodes are balanced. 4.2. WOAXGWO for shortest path selection The performance of WOA in finding the best solution (exploration phase) is good, but it lacks refining the optimum solution (exploitation phase). So a hybrid WOA approach is proposed to improve the exploitation phase and to find the best route for MS to reach all RPs. The corresponding algorithm for selecting the best path using WOAXGWO is presented in Algorithm 1. The set of selected RPs in the network is fed as input to WOAXGWO. To find the tour path, a random RP is selected as a source node and from that the distance to other RPs (agents) are computed. Then, the population limit of the search agents that is the number of RPs ( ) is initialized. For each agent, the is assigned as fitness function ( ). The agent with best score is considered as . To start the hunt, the algorithm locates the prey (the next best RP) using (5) Download : Download high-res image (622KB) Download : Download full-size image where is the position vector ( ) and is the best position of the whale ( ) i.e. the best next RP found by the algorithm so far. Initially, the best position is chosen randomly. The coefficient vectors and are calculated by , where is a random vector in the interval of , is decreased from 2 to 0 to achieve shrinking encircling mechanism based on . Here, is the current iteration and represents the allowed number of maximum iterations. By adjusting the vectors and , the whale can locate itself near the prey. Next, the algorithm generates a random value in the range between 0 and 1. Based on the values of and , the algorithm chooses its action between (a) positioning the whale in the found best position, (b) exploration and (c) exploitation phase. If the value of is less than 0.5 and if then the whale is positioned at the best position found so far based on Eq. (5) (refer to line 9 in Algorithm 1). The exploration phase is initiated if and . In this phase, to move the whale far away from the current position, the value of is chosen either greater than 1 or less than −1. Hence, the position of the search agents is updated using the below given equation (6) where is randomly chosen position of the whale. Exploration phase is shown in Algorithm 1 between the lines 12 and 15. If the value of is greater than 0.5, then the exploitation phase is initiated. In Algorithm 1, lines 16 to 24 explain the exploitation phase. Here, the current position of the search agent is updated by GWO based approach. The first three best search agents from the population are considered as , , and . Then, the prey encircling is determined by considering the position of , , and from the equations below; (7) (8) here is the iteration number. The first candidate for the new position of search agent named as which is calculated by the following equation (9) When the new position of the search agent is generated only with the help of three best search agents, it causes the search agents to get trapped in local optima and slower convergence rate. So dimension learning-based hunting (DLH) mechanism [33] is adapted. The position of the search agent at the th iteration is given by where is the dimension number of the problem. In DLH mechanism, search agents individual hunting is considered and is learned by its neighbors. So, the neighbors of are constructed and is given by (10) where is the distance between the position vector and at iteration and the radius is given by (11) After constructing , multi-neighbor learning is performed where each dimension of the search agent new position is calculated by the th dimension of the neighbor chosen from and the random search agent from the population. (12) where is th dimension of . The last phase of WOAXGWO is selection and updating phase. In this phase, the fitness value of and is compared and the best candidate is selected from them. (13) is selected as next best RP. The process is repeated until all the nodes are traversed and the best path is found. 4.3. Data collection scheme 1. TDMA schedule is assigned for the communication between RP and the ordinary nodes to avoid packet congestion and packet losses. In the assigned time schedule, ordinary nodes transmit the sensed data to the RP and only the nodes which transmit the data will be active. In order to save the energy, all other nodes will turn-off their radio. 2. After collecting the data from the ordinary nodes, RP aggregates the data to avoid redundancy and fair utilization of bandwidth. 3. MS travels to all the RPs in the path selected using WOAXGWO. Once the MS reaches an RP, it transmits a Ready-to-Receive beacon to the RP. RP acknowledges back by sending the aggregated data to the MS. 4. After receiving the data from an RP, MS moves to the next RP. The data collection algorithm is provided below as Algorithm 2. Download : Download high-res image (402KB) Download : Download full-size image In this work, the results are discussed in three parts: (1) first, the proposed WOAXGWO algorithm results are compared to state-of-the-arts, improved and hybrid algorithms such as WOA [26], GWO [35], IGWO [36] and WOAGWO [32], (2) then the wireless sensor network is implemented in matlab with the proposed RP selection policy and mobile sink with shortest path data collection algorithm and are compared against EAPC [37], MSECA [29] and DDCF [14] and (3) finally, the work is implemented in real time coconut farm to test the reliability and effectiveness. 5. Performance evaluation of WOAXGWO The numerical efficiency of the proposed WOAXGWO algorithm is tested by solving 23 classical benchmark functions (See Table 7, Table 8, Table 9) which were used in the optimization literature [26]. Population size and maximum iteration for all the algorithms are set to 30 and 500 respectively. The classical benchmark functions used in the literature [26], [35], [36] are considered to test the exploration and exploitation capabilities of WOAXGWO. Table 2.

Analysis of exploitation capability The functions f1–f7 have only one global optimum, and hence they are called as unimodal functions. These functions can be used to evaluate the exploitation capability of the proposed meta-heuristic algorithm. It can be noted from the Table 2 that the proposed WOAXGWO algorithm is capable of providing competitive test results on unimodal functions. In particular, WOAXGWO outperforms other meta-heuristic algorithms in F1, F2 and F5. This is due the adaptation of DLH search strategy with the integrated mechanism of GWO in WOA. Table 3.

Analysis of exploration capability The functions f8–f23 are multimodal and fixed-dimension multimodal functions which allow to evaluate exploration capabilities of meta-heuristic algorithms since they have many local optima. The corresponding evaluation results are presented in Table 3 and is evident that WOAXGWO is very competitive in exploration as well. Thus proving that the performance of the WOA is improved in both exploration and exploitation phase. 6. Numerical simulation 6.1. Evaluation of the proposed algorithm To evaluate the performance of the proposed work, MATLAB simulator is used to develop the simulation environment. The nodes are deployed randomly in 100 × 100 simulation area and are varied between 50 and 200. The proposed work is compared against EAPC [37], MSECA [29] and DDCF [14] because these works have similar objectives as that of the proposed work. The sensors are homogeneous in nature and it is assumed that, initially all the sensor nodes are fully charged with 0.5 J of energy. The speed of the mobile sink is set to 1 m/s, the data transmission rate is 20 kbps and it is assumed that there are no obstacles in the MS path. All the other parameters and their values are presented in Table 4. Networks energy decreases when the data transmission begins. Fig. 2(a) shows the comparison of average energy consumption of the network in a round and Fig. 2(b) depicts the comparison of average energy consumption of a node in a round. The proposed work yields best performance as it consumes very minimal energy than other three existing works (EAPC, MSECA and DDCF). Also, it is noticeable from Fig. 2(a) that, the energy consumption of the network increases with the increase in the number of nodes. In the proposed work, the average network energy consumption is minimized as the RP nodes are spread evenly across the network. This ensures that the distance between any node and its RP is less and hence reducing the energy consumption for data communication. In addition, a considerable amount of energy can be saved through data aggregation before forwarding the data in the network. Also, the average energy consumption of a node per round (Fig. 2(b)) is reduced because all the complex computations such as RP selection and the routing algorithms are performed by the MS. These computed routing information from the MS are forwarded to the source nodes through RPs. Hence, the computation load and energy drain of the nodes have reduced drastically. Table 4. Simulation parameters. Parameter Value Area 100 m × 100 m Number of sensor nodes 50–200 Node deployment Random Initial energy in 0.5 J 50 nJ/bit 1.3 fJ/bit/m4 5 nJ/bit/signal Size of data packet 512 bytes Size of control packet 25 bytes In order to increase the number of rounds, it is important to observe the behavior of residual energy. As shown in Fig. 3(a) the proposed algorithm performs better when compared to other algorithms as it covers a number of rounds. The energy spent by the node is less in each round due to the proposed energy efficient data collection scheme. Fig. 3(b) compares the performance of the algorithms in terms of network lifetime. In this work, the network lifetime is measured by calculating the time span between the network’s operation initiation and the time at which the first node ran out of its energy. Through the proposed work, only the nodes with higher residual energy and the nodes that generate a large number of data packets in the network can become RP. This reduce the chances of early node dead and eventually increases the network lifetime. Download : Download high-res image (442KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2.

Furthermore, Fig. 4(a) depicts the number of alive nodes after each round of execution. To compute this, the network size is set to 200 nodes. As the network starts data transmission, the energy of the node decreases and eventually drains all its energy. The improvement in the number of alive nodes is observed with the proposed algorithm, and it is due to the and other factors considered in the fitness function for the RP selection. Likewise Fig. 4(b), compares the analysis of dead nodes in the network. In Fig. 5(a), the performance of the algorithms in terms of worst case end to end data delivery delay is analyzed by varying the network size. Delay is minimal with the proposed data collection algorithm because the tour cost for the MS is minimized with the help of the proposed hybrid WOAXGWO algorithm. With the adopted DLH mechanism, WOAXGWO avoids ending up in local optima and premature convergence and obtains the optimum result quicker. Also, the proposed work, ensures that the RPs are evenly spread in the network to avoid data hotspot issues which eventually reduces packet loss and packet re-transmission. In addition to that, TDMA scheduling is incorporated to reduce the delay due to data collision. Download : Download high-res image (414KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Comparison of network performance metrics. 6.2. Real time implementation of proposed method The proposed work is tested in the laboratory setup with 10 XBee based sensor nodes and a mobile sink in an area of 20 ft × 20 ft room without any obstacles. The mobile sink is designed using raspberry pi, and the sensor node is designed using Arduino UNO with XBee modules for communication. All the 10 sensor nodes are powered using 12 V battery and among them three nodes are considered as rendezvous points. Each sensor node is equipped with soil moisture sensors. So, now all the nodes have same initial energy, sensing and computational capability, hence making the network homogeneous in nature. In this work, for computational simplicity, homogeneous network is considered. But, in actual scenario, different sensors must be used to measure different aspects of the environment (heterogeneous network). The real time parameters and components used are listed in Table 5. The communication is initiated, and the drop in voltage is observed as average voltage drop directly implies the average energy consumed. The desirable working voltage for Arduino is between 12 V and 5 V and if the voltage of the node drops below 5 V, the node is considered as dead in this experiment. The proposed work is compared against ESDCS [38]. After every 20 min, the RP rotation is performed based on the proposed RP selection strategy. Also, the battery voltage for all the nodes are observed every 20 min and the average voltage against time are plotted and presented as graph in Fig. 5(b). The first node dead for ESDCS is noted in 100th min and for the proposed work in the 120th min. Through this observation, the proposed RP selection strategy with the considered parameters proves to be more reliable and the workload of the nodes is evenly balanced than ESDCS. In order to measure the average packet delay, the packet is time stamped at the node during the packet construction. The packet is transmitted to the sink where the system time is noted and the difference in time is logged at the sink which is measured as delay. The average delay measured through the proposed work is 10 s while with ESDCS, it is 12 s. The observed delay is minimal with the proposed work and is due to the proposed shortest path selection algorithm using WOAXGWO. Table 5. Real-time parameters and components.

All the 20 trees are about 50–60 years old, tall variety and planted in sandy soil where the soil moisture mostly differs between 7–9. Drip irrigation is used for irrigating the farm. Though the crop yield depends on various factors like nutrition and fertilizer application, here in this work to evaluate the reliability of the proposed work, only the quantity of water used for irrigation and the yield obtained is considered while treating the crop with same nutrition supply. Three sensors are deployed (one for each drip sub-line) with an MS and tested the proposed work during the months between June 2020–May 2021.

With the moderate water scarcity condition, the required quantity of water per tree according to Tamil Nadu agriculture university expert system for coconut [6] is 30 L per day for the months of June, July, October, November and December while 35 L per day for the months of January, August and September and 45 L for the months of February to May [6]. An actuator with flow control and solenoid valve is deployed to measure, manage and control the irrigation. In this work, round-robin irrigation policy is adopted and the trees are irrigated once in four days. To say, in the month of December, a tree is irrigated with 120 L of water once in four days and hence the equation falls to 30 L/day.

Soil moisture sensors are deployed for three trees as shown in Fig. 6(a) to know if the moisture of the soil falls below the threshold value. The corresponding circuit diagrams are shown in Fig. 6, Fig. 6. As these sensor nodes are static in nature, their GPS location information are pre-fed them to save energy. Fig. 7(a) depicts the amount of water to be irrigated prescribed by the TNAU expert system with the average amount of water used for irrigation per tree per day by both the proposed work and drip irrigation models. Fig. 7(a) shows that the water irrigated through the proposed work follows the prescribed pattern and varies its water usage according to the month of irrigation. But with the manual drip irrigation model, the amount of water used is usually higher than the prescribed amount as the farmer irrigates with the available power supply rather measuring the amount of water used. Generally, the crop is harvested once in 45 days. So in the period of evaluation, the crop is harvested seven times and the corresponding yield is presented in Fig. 7(b). In Table 6, the yield achieved through the proposed method for the corresponding harvested period is given. Here, the yield is measured by calculating the total number of crops cultivated per tree and the total weight of the coconut crop in kilograms for all the 10 trees obtained through the proposed work is presented. From Fig. 7(b), the proposed model yield is significantly improved when compared to the drip irrigation method. The result in Fig. 7(a) also shows that the amount of water used for irrigation is less with the proposed work than with the manual model. Thus, the proposed method achieves better yield with less water consumption for irrigation in relation to the ability to achieve reliability. Table 6. Crop yield analysis with the proposed approach.

The proposed work selects the rendezvous points based on residual energy, packet density of the nodes and distance to the existing RP such that it reduces the energy consumption of the sensor nodes. A hybrid meta-heuristic WOAXGWO algorithm is proposed using which MS solves the TSP problem to visit all the RPs for data collection. The results obtained through computer simulations show that, the proposed work consumes about 17% less energy than DDCF and also outperforms MSECA and EAPC algorithms in terms of network lifetime and delay. The proposed model is also tested in irrigating the real-time coconut farm, and the results prove that it produces a similar yield to that of traditional drip irrigation practices. This work is limited to small-scale WSNs and it is not validated for large-scale networks, communication characteristics in logistic supply chain management systems, and multiple mobile sinks. In future work, machine learning algorithms will be implemented to optimize the water and fertilizer usage and the sensors will be equipped with energy harvesters to prolong the network lifetime.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.

3.6. IoT Network Architectures and Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) for Real-Time Irrigation
Real-time irrigation management systems heavily rely on the efficient and reliable transmission of data from sensors and weather stations to the cloud for processing and decision-making. However, agricultural environments present unique challenges to wireless communication, including adverse weather conditions, physical obstacles, and the limitations of wireless technologies. These challenges necessitate robust and adaptive solutions to ensure the consistent and timely flow of data, enabling truly autonomous irrigation scheduling.
Environmental factors, such as heavy rain, fog, and strong winds, can significantly disrupt wireless communication by attenuating or even blocking radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance (Ed-daoudi et al., 2023; Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). Dense vegetation, buildings, and uneven terrain create further complications by causing multipath propagation and shadowing effects (Yim et al., 2018; Gautam and Pagay, 2020). The study by Yim et al. (2018) on LoRa networks in a tree farm environment exemplifies these challenges, revealing reduced communication range and data reliability compared to theoretical expectations. This underscores the need for carefully selecting and optimizing communication protocols and network parameters to ensure reliable data transmission in such environments.
The study by Guzinski et al. (2014a) using a modified TSEB model further highlights the importance of high-resolution data in accurately capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of energy fluxes influenced by environmental factors. This emphasizes the need for advanced data acquisition and processing techniques that can effectively represent the complexities of agricultural settings.
The limitations of traditional wireless communication technologies, such as limited range and network congestion, pose additional challenges for large-scale agricultural operations. Long-distance data transmission can be hindered by range limitations, while network congestion arising from numerous sensors transmitting concurrently can lead to delays and data loss, hindering real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). Addressing these challenges requires the exploration of advanced networking technologies that can optimize spectrum utilization, mitigate interference, and improve reliability and efficiency.
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) offer promising solutions for optimizing wireless communication in agricultural settings. CRNs empower devices with the ability to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). Research has explored the potential of CRNs in predicting Radio Frequency (RF) power to avoid noisy channels and optimize spectrum utilization (Iliya et al., 2014; Iliya et al., 2014). These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of combining optimization algorithms with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the accuracy and generalization of RF power prediction, enabling CRNs to make informed decisions about channel selection and avoid interference.
DSA complements CRN technology by dynamically allocating unused spectrum, further enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion (Shi et al., 2023). The numerical model developed by Shi et al. (2023) showcases the potential of CRNs and DSA for optimizing wireless communication in challenging environments.
The integration of CRNs and DSA into the IoT network architecture requires careful consideration of spectrum sensing techniques, network topology, and data security. Research on cooperative spectrum sensing suggests that distributed approaches, where sensor nodes collaborate and share information, can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectrum sensing, particularly in dynamic environments (Trigka and Dritsas, 2022; Khalid & Yu, 2019). This collaborative approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the radio environment and facilitates the identification of available frequency bands for data transmission.
The choice of network topology also impacts the performance and scalability of CRN-based irrigation systems. Mesh networks, where sensor nodes are interconnected and relay data for each other, offer enhanced resilience and coverage compared to star topologies where nodes communicate directly with a central gateway (Akyildiz & Vuran, 2010). However, mesh networks can be more complex to manage and may introduce additional routing overhead. The trade-off between network resilience and complexity needs to be carefully evaluated to select the most appropriate topology for a specific agricultural setting.
Data security and privacy are paramount concerns in IoT-based irrigation systems due to the sensitive nature of agricultural data (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential for protecting data integrity and ensuring system trustworthiness. Research on secure spectrum leasing and resource allocation algorithms for CR-WSN-based irrigation systems has demonstrated the potential of these technologies for enhancing security and efficiency (Hassan, 2023; Afghah et al., 2018).
In conclusion, the development of effective and reliable real-time irrigation management systems requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the challenges of data transmission in agricultural environments. The integration of robust and adaptive communication protocols, optimized network architectures, and advanced networking technologies like CRNs and DSA, along with a focus on data security and privacy, can contribute significantly to achieving the goal of autonomous and efficient irrigation scheduling.
4. AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN THE CLOUD
4.1. Data Quality and Preprocessing
Data quality is paramount in automated irrigation systems as it directly influences the effectiveness of decision-making and water use efficiency. Issues like missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers arising from sensor malfunctions, environmental interference, or network problems (Lv et al., 2023) can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models used for irrigation scheduling and management.
Real-time data cleaning techniques are essential for addressing these challenges. Kalman filtering proves particularly effective in handling missing values and correcting erroneous readings by recursively estimating the system's state based on previous measurements and current sensor data, taking into account noise and uncertainty (Kim et al., 2020). Moving average techniques, by averaging consecutive data points, provide a more stable representation of the underlying trend, filtering out short-term fluctuations (Chhetri, 2023). For outlier detection, adaptive thresholding methods offer a dynamic approach, adjusting thresholds based on the statistical properties of the data to effectively identify anomalies and minimize false positives (Bah et al., 2021). These techniques are crucial in maintaining the integrity of real-time data streams and ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analyses.
Adaptive data preprocessing is essential for managing the diversity of data sources and formats commonly found in irrigation systems. Data normalization techniques, such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization, ensure that all features contribute equally to the analysis by transforming data values to a common scale (Pradal et al., 2016). This is crucial for preventing features with larger values from dominating the analysis and ensuring that all features are given equal consideration. Similarly, feature scaling methods, like standardization or normalization, optimize the range of feature values to improve the performance and convergence of machine learning models (Tortorici et al., 2024). By scaling features to a similar range, the influence of outliers is reduced, and the model's ability to learn from the data is enhanced.
Data fusion techniques play a critical role in integrating information from diverse sources, creating a more comprehensive and reliable dataset for irrigation management. Dempster-Shafer theory, a generalization of probability theory, allows for the expression of both uncertainty and the degree of conflict in evidence, making it suitable for fusing uncertain and conflicting data from heterogeneous sources (Sadiq and Rodriguez, 2004). This is particularly relevant in irrigation systems where data from different sensors may provide slightly different or even contradictory information due to sensor variations or environmental factors. Bayesian inference offers another powerful framework for combining information from multiple sources, updating the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available. By applying these techniques, data from soil moisture sensors, canopy temperature sensors, weather stations, and other sources can be integrated to provide a holistic understanding of crop water requirements and environmental conditions, leading to more informed and accurate irrigation decisions.
The impact of data quality extends beyond model accuracy to the robustness of machine learning models under varying conditions. Robust models should maintain consistent performance even when faced with data inconsistencies or unexpected situations. Techniques like data augmentation and domain adaptation can enhance model robustness by exposing the model to a wider range of data variations during training. Data augmentation involves generating additional training data by applying transformations or introducing noise to existing data, making the model more resilient to noise and variations in the real-world data. Domain adaptation techniques aim to adapt a model trained on one domain (e.g., a specific crop or geographic location) to perform well on another domain with different data characteristics. This is particularly relevant in irrigation management, where models may need to be applied to different crops, soil types, or climatic conditions.
The choice of data cleaning, preprocessing, and fusion techniques should be carefully considered based on the specific characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data. By selecting and implementing appropriate techniques, the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of machine learning models can be significantly improved, leading to more efficient and sustainable irrigation management practices.
4.2. Scalable and Autonomous Deployment using Containerization Strategies
The transition from data collection and transmission to efficient data processing requires a robust infrastructure capable of handling diverse workloads and data volumes. Containerization technologies, specifically Docker and Kubernetes, offer a promising solution for deploying and scaling data processing and machine learning modules within cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). Docker provides a standardized way to package applications and their dependencies into self-contained units known as containers, ensuring consistent and reproducible execution across different platforms (Rosendo et al., 2022). Kubernetes, acting as a container orchestrator, manages their deployment, scaling, and networking across a cluster of machines (Rosendo et al., 2022). This combination presents several advantages for automated irrigation management systems.
Firstly, containerization facilitates efficient resource utilization and scalability. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies, containers enable the isolation of resources and prevent conflicts between different modules (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This isolation allows for the efficient allocation of resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to each container based on its specific needs. Kubernetes further enhances scalability by allowing for the automatic scaling of containers based on real-time demand, ensuring the system can adapt to varying workloads and data volumes, preventing bottlenecks, and ensuring responsiveness to changing conditions (Karamolegkos et al., 2023).
Secondly, containerization promotes portability and reproducibility. By packaging applications and their dependencies into a single unit, containers make it easy to move and deploy them across different cloud environments without the need for environment-specific configurations (Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This portability simplifies the development and deployment process, reducing the time and effort required to set up and manage the system. Additionally, containers ensure reproducibility by providing a consistent execution environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This eliminates variability and ensures that the system will behave consistently across different deployments (Zhou et al., 2023).
Optimizing container orchestration and resource allocation is crucial to minimizing latency and maximizing throughput in real-time data processing pipelines. Techniques like auto-scaling and dynamic resource allocation play a critical role in this context (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Werner and Tai, 2023; Kumar et al., 2024). Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of container instances based on real-time demand, ensuring that sufficient resources are available to handle peak workloads while avoiding over-provisioning during periods of low demand (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2024). Dynamic resource allocation enables the fine-grained adjustment of resources allocated to each container based on its specific needs and the current workload (Werner and Tai, 2023). This ensures efficient resource allocation and provides each container with the necessary resources to perform its tasks effectively.
Performance monitoring tools, such as Kubernetes Metrics Server and Prometheus, are essential for gaining insights into the performance of containers and the overall system (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kuity & Peddoju, 2023). These tools provide valuable data on key performance indicators, such as CPU and memory usage, network traffic, and application-specific metrics. By monitoring this data, administrators can identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation strategies, and continuously improve system performance (Hethcoat et al., 2024). This data-driven approach ensures that automated irrigation management systems can operate efficiently and reliably.
By integrating containerization technologies with optimization techniques and performance monitoring, automated irrigation management systems achieve the scalability, autonomy, and efficiency required for effective real-time data processing and decision-making. This approach facilitates a seamless and responsive system that can adapt to changing conditions and contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity.

4.3. Deploying ML Models for Data Processing
Transitioning from data collection, preprocessing, and transmission, the deployment of machine learning (ML) models marks a pivotal stage in the automated irrigation management pipeline. This stage entails utilizing cloud platforms to facilitate real-time data processing and inference, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimal irrigation management and ultimately contributing to fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
Several architectures and frameworks exist for deploying ML models on cloud platforms, each offering unique advantages and catering to different requirements. TensorFlow Serving, for instance, provides a high-performance system specifically designed for serving TensorFlow models (Abadi et al., 2016). This framework enables efficient and scalable inference, making it suitable for real-time applications where low latency and high throughput are crucial. For instance, in a large-scale irrigation system with numerous sensors generating data continuously, TensorFlow Serving can efficiently handle the high volume of inference requests and provide timely predictions for irrigation scheduling. Similarly, Apache MXNet Model Server offers a flexible and efficient solution for deploying models trained with MXNet, supporting a wide range of deep learning models and inference backends (MXNet Developers, 2015). This versatility makes it suitable for complex irrigation systems that may utilize different types of ML models for various tasks, such as predicting crop water requirements, detecting plant stress, or forecasting weather conditions. ONNX Runtime, on the other hand, provides a cross-platform inference engine compatible with various ML frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet (Microsoft, 2017). This versatility enables the deployment of models in diverse environments, facilitating interoperability and reducing the need for model conversion. For example, an irrigation system that uses models trained in different frameworks can utilize ONNX Runtime to deploy them on a single platform without the need for time-consuming and error-prone model conversion processes.
Choosing the appropriate architecture or framework depends on several factors, including the specific ML framework used for model training, the desired level of performance and scalability, and the need for cross-platform compatibility. For instance, if the primary concern is low latency and high throughput for real-time inference, TensorFlow Serving might be the optimal choice for TensorFlow models. However, if flexibility and support for various deep learning models are required, Apache MXNet Model Server could be more suitable. In cases where cross-platform compatibility is essential, ONNX Runtime offers a versatile solution.
Once the ML model is deployed, optimizing its performance and resource utilization becomes crucial for ensuring the efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems. Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, offer effective methods for reducing the size and computational requirements of ML models without compromising accuracy (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Pruning involves eliminating unnecessary connections or neurons from the model, effectively streamlining its structure and reducing computational complexity. This can be particularly beneficial for deep learning models, which often have a large number of parameters and can be prone to overfitting. By removing redundant or less important connections, pruning can improve modelgeneralizability and reduce inference time. Quantization, on the other hand, involves reducing the precision of model parameters, typically from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower-precision formats such as 8-bit integers. This reduction in precision leads to smaller model sizes and faster inference speeds, making it particularly beneficial for resource-constrained environments or real-time applications. For instance, in edge computing scenarios where ML models are deployed on devices with limited computational resources, quantization can enable efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, hardware acceleration through the utilization of GPUs or TPUs can significantly enhance model performance by leveraging specialized hardware designed for parallel processing (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). GPUs, with their massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth, excel at accelerating matrix operations and convolutions, which are fundamental computations in many deep learning models. This acceleration can significantly reduce inference time and enable real-time processing of sensor data for timely irrigation decisions. TPUs, specifically designed for deep learning workloads, offer even greater performance and energy efficiency for specific model architectures. These hardware accelerators can drastically reduce inference time, enabling near real-time decision-making and enhancing the responsiveness of automated irrigation systems. For example, in a scenario where immediate response to changing weather conditions or soil moisture levels is critical, hardware acceleration can ensure that irrigation decisions are made and executed promptly.
In addition to model compression and hardware acceleration, distributed training techniques play a crucial role in optimizing the training process for large-scale ML models. Techniques such as Horovod and BytePS enable the distribution of training across multiple machines, effectively parallelizing the process and reducing training time (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). This is particularly beneficial for complex models with a large number of parameters or when dealing with large datasets. By leveraging distributed training, irrigation management systems can train more sophisticated models and improve their predictive capabilities, leading to more accurate and efficient irrigation decisions. For instance, a system that utilizes a deep learning model with millions of parameters can benefit from distributed training to reduce training time from days to hours, enabling faster model iteration and improvement.
Integrating the deployed ML models with other components of the automated irrigation management pipeline is essential for achieving a fully autonomous and cohesive system and addressing the need for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system. Standardized protocols, such as MQTT and CoAP, provide lightweight and efficient communication channels for exchanging data between these components (Poojara et al., 2023; Jimenez et al., 2020a; Gour et al., 2023). MQTT, with its publish-subscribe architecture, enables real-time data streaming and event-driven communication, making it suitable for transmitting sensor data, control signals, and inference results (Raikar & M, 2023). This enables the ML model to receive real-time updates on soil moisture, weather conditions, and plant health, allowing for dynamic adjustments to irrigation schedules based on the latest data. CoAP, designed for constrained devices and low-power networks, offers a web-transfer protocol for resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient communication between sensors, actuators, and the ML models (Raikar & M, 2023). This is particularly relevant in situations where sensors or actuators have limited processing power or battery life, as CoAP minimizes communication overhead and energy consumption. Additionally, RESTful APIs provide a standardized interface for accessing and controlling the ML models, enabling seamless integration with other software components and facilitating system management and monitoring (Wang et al., 2022). This allows for easy integration with existing farm management systems or third-party applications, creating a unified platform for comprehensive irrigation management.4.4. Online Learning in the Cloud
The complexities of real-time data processing in irrigation management necessitate the exploration of advanced techniques to continuously learn and adapt to the dynamic nature of agricultural environments. Online learning algorithms offer a promising solution, enabling the continuous update and improvement of machine learning models based on incoming real-time data. This adaptability is crucial for addressing the challenges of changing environmental conditions, such as weather patterns and crop growth stages, and optimizing irrigation decision-making to enhance water usage efficiency and crop productivity.
Several online learning algorithms have demonstrated potential for real-time data processing and model adaptation in the context of irrigation management. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) facilitates the incremental update of model parameters with each new data point, allowing for efficient adaptation to changing data distributions (Bottou, 2010). This incremental learning process ensures that the model remains responsive to the latest conditions, minimizing the risk of outdated predictions and improving the accuracy of irrigation decisions. Passive-Aggressive algorithms, on the other hand, adjust model parameters only when a misclassification occurs, providing a computationally efficient approach for handling large data streams (Crammer et al., 2006). These algorithms offer a robust approach to handling noisy data, a common challenge in real-world sensor readings, by making small adjustments only when the model's prediction deviates significantly from the actual value (Fei et al., 2019). Online Random Forests extend the concept of random forests to the online setting, enabling the incremental construction and update of decision trees as new data arrives (Saffari et al., 2009). The continuous evolution of the ensemble ensures that the model remains relevant to the changing environment, capturing intricate relationships between variables and leading to more informed irrigation decisions.
Research in various domains highlights the importance of online learning for real-time data stream analytics. Snyder et al. (2020) explored the application of online learning techniques for identifying relevant tweets in real-time, improving situational awareness for first responders. The proposed interactive learning framework allows users to continuously label the relevance of incoming tweets, enabling the real-time refinement of the underlying machine learning model. This user-guided approach aligns well with the dynamic nature of irrigation management, where models need to continuously adjust to varying environmental conditions and crop water requirements. Similarly, research in the field of cyber-physical systems (CPS) underscores the need for online learning algorithms to effectively extract insights and knowledge from continuously generated data streams (Fei et al., 2019). These capabilities are crucial for enabling feedback loops between physical processes and cyber elements, facilitating the integration and optimization of CPS in irrigation management systems.
To implement online learning in cloud-based irrigation management systems, various architectures and frameworks can be considered. Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis provide scalable and fault-tolerant platforms for processing real-time data streams, allowing for the development of online learning pipelines that continuously ingest and analyze data to update machine learning models (Zaharia et al., 2012; Carbone et al., 2015; Amazon Web Services, 2023). These frameworks leverage serverless computing paradigms, automatically scaling resources based on the volume and velocity of incoming data, ensuring efficient resource utilization and responsiveness to fluctuations in demand (Fei et al., 2019).
Effectively managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off is crucial for optimizing online learning in irrigation management. Techniques such as Multi-armed bandits (Sutton & Barto, 2018), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018) can be employed to balance the allocation of resources between exploring new irrigation strategies and exploiting the current best-performing approaches. These techniques enable the identification of optimal irrigation policies, adapting to changing environmental conditions and maximizing long-term rewards.
In conclusion, online learning techniques, coupled with scalable cloud-based architectures, offer a powerful solution for real-time data processing and continuous adaptation in irrigation management systems. By leveraging algorithms like SGD, Passive-Aggressive, and Online Random Forests, along with stream processing frameworks like Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis, irrigation management systems can effectively handle the complexities of real-time data, optimize water usage, and enhance crop productivity in the face of dynamic environmental conditions.

5. GENERATING AND APPLYING IRRIGATION INSIGHTS 
5.1. Real-Time Generation of Actionable Irrigation Insights
The transition from data collection and processing to actionable irrigation insights requires the extracting spatial features from images, allowing for the analysis of satellite or drone imagery to assess crop health, detect water stress, and provide insights into irrigation needs (Os deployment of advanced predictive models capable of generating precise and site-specific irrigation recommendations.roosh et al., 2016).
Furthermore, the integration Deep learning models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and of data from diverse sources, including IoT sensors and cloud-based platforms, plays Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have demonstrated excellent performance in capturing complex relationships a critical role in enhancing the accuracy and resolution of real-time irrigation insights. Data fusion techniques, such as Kalman filtering, offer a robust approach for combining information between input variables and predicting crop water requirements (Keller, 2023; Naphade et al., 2022). These models can effectively from multiple sensors, accounting for noise and uncertainty, and providing a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements (Cohen et al., 2005; Mö handle the temporal dependencies present in time-series data, such as soil moisture andeller et al., 2007). By integrating data from soil moisture weather data, and learn to predict future water needs based on historical patterns and current sensors, weather stations, and remote sensing platforms, ML models can generate more accurate conditions. Ensemble methods, such as Random Forests, also offer a robust approach to and site-specific irrigation recommendations, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity prediction by combining multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce the risk of overfitting.
The heterogeneity, uncertainty, and quality issues inherent in real-time data streams require careful consideration and the implementation of effective strategies to ensure the reliability of generated (Singh et al., 2016).
The integration of irrigation insights. Data preprocessing techniques, such as outlier detection and missing value imputation, IoT sensor data with cloud-based data sources is crucial for enhancing the accuracy and resolution of irrigation insights. IoT sensors, such as soil moisture probes and weather stations are essential for preparing the data for analysis and preventing erroneous data from influencing the model, provide real-time, localized data on crop and environmental conditions, while cloud's predictions (Fiksel, 2003). Additionally,-based sources, such as weather forecasts and satellite imagery, offer broader spatial and the selection of appropriate ML models and data fusion techniques should be tailored to the specific temporal perspectives (López-Morales et al., 2020). characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data to mitigate uncertainty and ensure the robustness Data fusion techniques, such as Kalman filtering, play a critical role in combining these of generated insights.
To address computational complexity and latency challenges in real-time irrigation insight generation, techniques such as edge computing, model compression, and hardware accelerators heterogeneous data sources to generate more accurate and comprehensive irrigation recommendations (Cohen et al., offer promising solutions. Edge computing enables the distribution of processing tasks closer to the data 2005; Möeller et al., 2007 source, reducing latency and enabling faster response times (Mishra, 20). By incorporating data from multiple sources, irrigation models can better account for spatial variability20; Zhang et al., 2020). Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, can significantly reduce the size and computational requirements of in soil moisture, microclimate conditions, and crop water requirements, leading to more ML models without compromising accuracy, making them suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge precise and efficient irrigation scheduling.
The seamless integration of ML-generated insights with IoT-enabled irrigation control systems requires the adoption of appropriate architectures and protocols that facilitate devices (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Hardware lightweight, real-time communication. The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT accelerators, such as GPUs and TPUs, provide specialized hardware designed for parallel processing) protocol and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are well-suited, enabling faster inference speeds and facilitating real-time data analysis (Premkumar for this purpose, offering efficient and reliable communication channels for exchanging data between sensors, & Sigappi, 2022). The combined utilization of these techniques can significantly improve the efficiency and responsiveness of real-time irrigation insight generation, contributing actuators, and ML models (Muangprathub et al., 2019; Osroosh et al., 2016). to the overall goal of achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
The implementation MQTT's publish-subscribe architecture enables real-time data streaming and event- of these strategies and techniques for real-time generation of actionable irrigation insights provides a solid foundation for developing automated and data-driven irrigation management systems that can effectively addressdriven communication, while CoAP's lightweight design and low overhead make it suitable the global food challenge by optimizing water resource utilization and maximizing agricultural productivity.
for resource-constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks. By utilizing these protocols, irrigation systems can achieve seamless integration between ML models and IoT devices, enabling the automated application of irrigation insights based on real-time data and predictions.
Industry-leading products and services for smart irrigation demonstrate the practical application of these technologies. Smart irrigation controllers, such as Rachio, leverage weather data and soil moisture sensors to automatically adjust irrigation schedules based on real-time conditions, reducing water waste and promoting water conservation (Verdouw et al., 2023). Cloud-based irrigation management platforms, such as CropX, offer advanced analytics and decision support tools, providing farmers with insights into crop water requirements, soil health, and irrigation performance (Weikmann et al., 2023). These platforms often incorporate machine learning algorithms to generate predictive models and provide farmers with data-driven recommendations for optimizing irrigation strategies.
The analysis of these products and services highlights the growing trend toward data-driven, automated irrigation management. By integrating IoT, machine learning, and cloud computing, these solutions enable farmers to make more informed and efficient irrigation decisions, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture.

Furthermore, many Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart agriculture are battery-powered, with limited energy resources. Therefore, a low energy lightweight block cipher (LELBC) is proposed to overcome the data leakage problem during sensor data transmission in smart agriculture. Firstly, a new permutation substitution permutation (PSP) structure is proposed, taking into account the energy resource constraints of unified encryption and decryption (ED) circuits. It has highly consistent encryption and decryption and a good diffusion effect. Secondly, a 4-bit low energy involutive S-box is obtained based on a genetic algorithm.

The experimental data show that LELBC consumes 1864 gate equivalents (GE) in area and 6.99 J/bit in energy (encryption + decryption) under the UMC 1P6M process library. LELBC decreases energy and area consumption by 24.02% and 24.04%, respectively, compared to Midori. Finally, a temperature collection and encryption transmission platform is established. LELBC is deployed on the platform to encrypt the collected data, establishing the first line of defense for the secure transmission of smart agriculture sensor data.

Introduction The arrival of the fifth generation (5G) era is bringing new applications, such as smart agriculture, to us faster and better than ever before. At the same time, new application scenarios are not possible without a large number of IoT devices. Accordingly, many IoT technologies are continuously proposed [1], [2]. Smart agriculture mainly uses information technology management methods to carry out agricultural production and operations [3]. It timely acquires environmental factors affecting crop production, such as temperature, and automatically adjusts production conditions through “thing-to-thing” connectivity, thereby effectively improving the quality of agricultural products and production efficiency. But the massive collection of data is likely to lead to serious leakage problems [4]. Malicious hackers, through attacks on IoT devices such as sensors, may access data collected by sensors about the environment or livestock or even tamper with them, as there is a lack of encryption protection measures [5]. These attacks seriously damage the confidentiality of data, posing a serious threat to the proper operation and supply of monitoring services and even causing substantial economic losses. Currently, multiple security protection schemes are proposed for this problem, including encrypting the collected data before transmission [6]. Post-Quantum Cryptography has become a hot topic nowadays with the emergence of quantum computers. But the development of standards for post-quantum cryptography is still in progress. Meanwhile, symmetric ciphers can resist the attack of quantum computers by expanding the key size. Hence, we can still employ lightweight block ciphers to protect resource-constrained IoT devices in smart agriculture. Numerous lightweight block ciphers have been proposed in recent years that are widely used in the IoT, such as SIMON [7], SPEEDY [8], PRINCE [9], SCARF [10], SHADOW [11], IVLBC [12], QARMA [13], etc. However, the design requirements of ciphers vary in different environments [14], [15]. For example, the Internet of Vehicles requires low-latency cipher algorithms [16]. The existing sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles used in smart agriculture are battery-powered. They suffer from limited energy resources [17]. Also, the computational complexity of the device itself should not be reduced to minimize battery usage [18]. It is critical that cipher algorithms designed for such devices minimize energy consumption [19]. Energy will be more tightly constrained in future infophysical systems as well as in the next generation of implantable devices [20]. There is currently no unified standard for cipher algorithms in terms of energy consumption evaluation. Consequently, we take the energy consumption of existing low-energy cipher algorithms as the basic standard for our research, such as Midori, PRINCE, and so on. The minimization of energy consumption based on existing research can lead to a broader application of cipher algorithms in the future. Recently, energy-optimized ciphers have received increasing attention. The classic low energy lightweight block cipher Midori was proposed by Subhadeep Banik et al. [21]. Later, they also proposed a low energy stream cipher [22]. In 2017, Bui et al. performed hardware optimization for the AES cipher in terms of power consumption and energy [23]. Carlos et al. optimized the PRESENT cipher on FPGA hardware based on area, performance, and energy [24]. In 2020, Bassam J. et al. proposed a new algorithm for managing cipher energy consumption [25]. Avik Chakraborti proposed a lightweight, low energy authentication encryption mode [26]. Most of these proposed energy-optimized ciphers use substitution permutation networks (SPN) structures to improve diffusion and reduce the number of rounds to achieve low energy performance. Cipher algorithms that adopt the SPN structure require additional resource consumption during decryption due to the inconsistent encryption and decryption. As a result, energy consumption is often not particularly low when encryption and decryption are calculated to consume energy together. The Feistel structure can be encrypted and decrypted consistently, but the cipher algorithms using the Feistel structure require more rounds to ensure their security. The energy consumption increases exponentially as the number of rounds increases. Beyond the structure, the area and latency of the components also affect the energy consumption of the algorithm as a whole. Choosing a low-area and low-latency S-box is also a design requirement for low energy algorithms, as S-boxes are the most important non-linear component in cipher algorithms. There is still potential to better achieve low energy consumption in unified ED circuits, although researchers have done some research on low energy ciphers. In this paper, a new low energy lightweight block cipher (LELBC) is proposed, focusing on energy-resource-constrained devices in smart agriculture. We have conducted a security analysis and hardware implementation of LELBC. Experimental results show that LELBC is resistant to differential attack, linear attack, algebraic attack, meet-in-the-middle attack, and slide attack. LELBC can also adopt some existing error detection schemes to resist fault attacks in practical applications. Moreover, LELBC is optimal in terms of energy and area in unified ED circuits compared to existing lightweight ciphers. Thus, the deployment of LELBC in the perception layer of smart agriculture can provide security for it. The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 introduces the encryption mode of LELBC. In Section 3, the specification of LELBC is described. The design principles of LELBC are given in Section 4. Section 5 describes the security analysis of LELBC through various analysis methods. The implementation of LELBC is presented in Section 6. A temperature acquisition platform is established to simulate temperature monitoring in smart agriculture, and LELBC was successfully applied to the platform. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper with an overview of the future. 1.1. Motivation Attention to agricultural production has been increasing in recent years with global warming and a growing population. Simultaneously, malicious hackers have been looking for vulnerabilities in smart agriculture to attack. Since smart agriculture is a key component of the economy, trade, and food supply, its data leakage could place food security at risk. Therefore, it is extremely important to maintain security in smart agriculture. Many resource-constrained IoT devices, such as sensors in smart agriculture, are powered by batteries [27]. Energy is quite an important element in these devices [28]. Designing a low energy lightweight block cipher for IoT devices in the sensing layer is beneficial for defending data security in smart agriculture. Nowadays, most of the low energy ciphers or cipher algorithms optimized for energy, such as Midori, AES, PRESENT, etc., still have potential to be optimized in terms of energy consumption. Firstly, in terms of structure, these cipher algorithms all adopt SPN structure. It is well known that the general SPN structure is usually not applicable to unified ED circuits. They consume more hardware resources and energy if they are to be used in environments where decryption routines are required. In smart agriculture environments, the encrypted sensor data needs to be decrypted before it can be displayed. Smart agriculture requires an algorithmic structure that can be applied to unified ED circuits. Secondly, in terms of the nonlinear layer, the existing 4-bit involutive S-boxes are not yet optimal in terms of area and delay. Therefore, this paper designs a low energy lightweight cipher algorithm for smart agriculture based on the highly consistent structure of encryption and decryption and the low-energy S-box. 1.2. Our contribution We propose a new low energy lightweight cipher named LELBC for resource-constrained IoT devices in smart agriculture. A PSP structure with highly consistent encryption and decryption and a low-area, low-latency involutive S-box are designed from the structure and components, respectively, so as to achieve a lower energy consumption for LELBC in the hardware. Firstly, we found that two identical P diffusion layers do not diffuse well, even though it is better to achieve consistent encryption and decryption. Therefore, we design two highly symmetric P-diffusion layers to achieve the symmetry of the PSP structure so that it can be applied to the unified encryption–decryption circuit. Secondly, we obtained a low-area, low-latency involutive S-box to achieve low energy consumption of the nonlinear layer by a genetic algorithm. Compared with the S-boxes in existing low-latency cipher algorithms, the proposed S-box has advantages in both area and latency. Finally, we establish a temperature acquisition platform that simulates the environmental monitoring of smart agriculture. Then LELBC is applied to the platform to encrypt the collected data, which provides the first line of defense for the secure transmission of smart agriculture sensor data. 2. Encryption model Smart agriculture mainly uses information technology management methods to carry out agricultural production and operations. Its overall architecture includes three main parts: the perception layer, the network layer, and the application layer [29]. The perception layer can timely acquire and perceive environmental factors such as temperature in agricultural production through various sensors [30]. These real-time data, including information on personnel and materials entering and leaving agricultural greenhouses and data on crop growing sites, are uploaded to the IoT information platform through the network layer. Currently, all-round environmental monitoring and control systems combining sensors and wireless communication networks are widely used and rapidly promoted in facility agriculture. However, IoT devices in smart agriculture are susceptible to sensor-based threats due to a lack of security measures protecting sensors. Attackers may obtain access to perception data so they can monitor or even tamper with related data, damaging the confidentiality of the data and posing a serious threat to the proper operation and supply of monitoring services [31]. This paper deploys a lightweight block cipher, LELBC, at the perception layer to ensure that data is transmitted in ciphertext form at the data transmission layer. If the attacker obtains the transmitted data, it can only obtain the ciphertext, which cannot be deciphered. Thus, the deployment of LELBC in the perception layer ensures the confidentiality of the sensed data and establishes the first line of defense for the security of smart agriculture IoT devices.

Encryption application model of smart agriculture. 3. Specification of LELBC This section describes the structure of LELBC and the implementation of each component. 3.1. Encryption algorithm LELBC consists of 16 rounds of encryption, with input 64-bit plaintext and 128-bit key , and output 64-bit ciphertext . The PSP structure of LELBC adopts two symmetrical diffusion layers and Sublayer, which successively includes three steps: P diffusion layer, Sublayer and P diffusion layer. Among them, the two P-diffusion layers are symmetrical structures, both composed of left circular shift and XOR operations. They differ in that the first P diffusion layer is left circular shift 5-bit by the left branch data and then XOR with the right branch data. The second P diffusion layer is left circular shifted 5-bit by the right branch data and then performs an XOR operation with the left branch data. The Sublayer consists of 16 4-bit involutive S-boxes, which are identical in encryption and decryption. Furthermore, a PN permutation is added after 16 rounds of round-function iterations to ensure the consistency of the encryption and decryption architectures. Some notations used are shown in Table 1. The encryption process is shown in Fig. 2 and Algorithm 1. Round-function. The round-function process of LELBC in Fig. 2 includes four operations: AddRoundKey, Left circular shift, XOR, Sublayer. The number of rounds r is 16. Define the input and output of the encryption process as follows: (1) Table 1. Notations of LELBC.

Secondly, the first ARK operation takes its high 32-bit data and performs an XOR operation with the high 32-bit of plaintext . Finally, the second ARK operation takes its lower 32-bit of data and performs an XOR operation with the low 32-bit of plaintext . Left circular shift (LCS). The 32-bit plaintext data is cyclically left-shifted. The operation is shown in Eq. (2). (2) Download : Download high-res image (135KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2.

Table 2 shows the S-box lookup table. The S-box substitution operation can be denoted as shown in Eq. (3). (3) PN permutation (PN). The 64-bit data is divided into two parts, and then the two parts are exchanged. This is specifically represented as an exchange of and branch data. The operation is shown in Eq. (4).

Key schedule First, a key schedule is performed on the master key to obtain the encrypted subkey for the first round. After that, a key schedule is performed on the subkey of the previous round in each round to obtain the subkey of the current round. The data for which key schedules are performed in each round can be divided into 32-bit (0 j 3): (5) The key schedule consists of the following steps: S-box, round constant addition, and left circular shift. (1) Substitute the 4-bit data with the S-box lookup table in Table 2: (6) 2) The round constant RC=( ) is the current number of rounds minus 1. The round constant addition operation is as follows: (7) 3) Left circular shift of the overall data by 64-bit: (8) 4) Circular shift the high 64-bit of data to the left by 9-bit, and circular shift the low 64-bit of data to the left by 15-bit: (9) 3.3. Decryption algorithm The two P-diffusion layers of the PSP structure are symmetric structures, and the S-box is involutory in LELBC. Decryption is highly consistent with encryption. The difference between decryption and encryption is that the order of the data in the decryption subkey is different from that in the encryption subkey. That is, the first-round encryption subkey corresponds to the last-round decryption subkey. Moreover, and in the encryption subkey correspond to and in the decryption subkey, respectively. Algorithm 1 describes the encryption and decryption of LELBC. It is easy to see from Algorithm 1 that the steps of encryption and decryption are highly identical. Therefore, the decryption can highly reuse the encryption structure to achieve low hardware resource consumption, thus achieving low energy consumption. 4. Design rationale 4.1. The structure of LELBC In fact, the more hardware resources consumed by a cipher algorithm, the more energy it consumes [21]. Therefore, considering the limitations of energy resources in smart agriculture, the design of low energy cipher algorithms is bound to consider how much hardware resources it occupies. Meanwhile, it is necessary for data to be encrypted for transmission and decrypted for display in smart agriculture. Usually, unified ED circuits are suitable for use in resource-constrained environments where encryption and decryption are required. In this case, a highly consistent structure for encryption and decryption is the best choice. In addition, it can be known that the energy consumption of a round-based architecture is generally optimal from the perspective of cipher algorithm implementation. Therefore, we focus on the round-based architecture under unified ED circuits. The main design structures for block ciphers include the Feistel structure and the SPN structure. The Feistel structure, although similar in both encryption and decryption, exhibits poor diffusion and requires more rounds to ensure security. The SPN structure has the advantage of fast diffusion. However, it consumes more hardware resources to decrypt due to its relatively poor symmetry. LELBC has designed a PSP structure based on the SPN structure. The two P-diffusion layers in the PSP structure are symmetric, and the S-box is involutory. So the decryption can highly reuse the encryption structure to achieve low hardware resource consumption, thus achieving a low energy unified ED circuit. Moreover, the structure has good diffusivity. Consistent with low energy Midori, LELBC reaches full (bit-level) diffusion after 3 rounds. However, the fact that the ShuffleCell of Midori does not have the involution property causes it to require two additional multiplexers in a unified ED circuit. In contrast, LELBC adopts a PSP structure with encryption–decryption consistency in resource-constrained unified ED circuits, and hence LELBC consumes less energy and hardware resources than the Midori cipher. 4.2. The non-linear layer of LELBC The non-linear layer is a critical component of LELBC cipher. It is used to obfuscate data. The performance of S-box is closely related to the security of cipher algorithms as it is the most important nonlinear layer in cipher algorithms. In the partial security analysis of cipher algorithms, we determine whether a cipher algorithm is capable of resisting a corresponding attack precisely by solving for the number of minimal active S-boxes in a full-round cipher. Hence, the choice of S-boxes with strong cryptographic properties is crucial. In addition, low energy consumption is one of the general goals of LELBC. It can be known that the area and delay of components also affect the energy consumption of the whole algorithm. Low latency and low area contribute to low energy consumption in implementation. The area and delay of the S-box, which is the only nonlinear component in LELBC, can greatly affect the energy consumption of LELBC. Moreover, the highly consistent algorithmic structure of encryption and decryption is conducive to low energy implementation. We must adopt an involutive S-box to ensure that the cipher algorithms are highly consistent in encryption and decryption. Therefore, we require a low area, low latency, and highly secure involutive S-box to achieve low energy consumption of cipher algorithms. Compared to the 8 × 8 S-box, the 4 × 4 S-box has less hardware resource consumption. Hence, the 4-bit S-box is usually more suitable for the design of low energy ciphers than the 8-bit S-box. Now, there are many heuristic algorithms applied to the search of S-boxes, and genetic algorithms are one of them. The S-box generation algorithms based on genetic algorithms are almost always based around security and strong cryptographic properties. They generally use differential uniformity, linear approximation, nonlinearity, and other cryptographic properties to generate the S-box with strong cryptographic properties. In 2012, Wang et al. obtained S-boxes that meet the requirements of differential uniformity, linear approximation, nonlinearity, avalanche effect, and other cryptographic properties by combining chaos and genetic algorithm [32]. Later, they carried out optimization on this basis to generate highly nonlinear bijective S-boxes with nonlinearity as the optimization objective [33]. In 2021, a genetic algorithm based on a single objective with nonlinearity was used by Çavuşoğlu Ü et al. to obtain S-boxes with strong cryptographic properties [34]. In 2022, Artugeer et al. also combined chaos and genetic algorithm to generate S-boxes, and they obtained S-boxes with higher nonlinearity by optimizing the S-box structure [35]. In addition to meeting these cryptographic requirements, the S-box must also satisfy the conditions of involution, low area, and low latency, as we require a low-energy, high-security S-box. This requires further searching to generate S-boxes based on existing genetic algorithm methods. The flowchart for generating S-boxes using genetic algorithm is shown in Fig. 3. Our low energy S-box design is required to meet the following five conditions: (1) the maximum difference probability is 2−2; (2) the maximum absolute deviation of the linear approximation is 2−2; (3) the algebraic degree is 3; (4) the depth is less than 4 (the maximum delay of S-box in existing low-latency ciphers is 4), and the area is light; (5) involution. The definitions are given as follows: Definition 1 Differential Uniformity For a given S-box , define the differential distribution of the S-box as: , where is the input differential and is the output differential of the S-box. The differential probability . Definition 2 Linear Approximation For an S-box , define the linear approximation , where is the input mask and is the output mask of the S-box. The linear probability is obtained by . Definition 3 Algebraic Degree The algebraic degree of a Boolean function is defined as the number of variables in the maximum product term in the algebraic normal form (ANF) of a function with non-zero coefficients, denoted by . The algebraic degree of an S-box is the maximum algebraic number of non-zero linear combinations of all its component functions. Therefore, the S-box algebraic degree is defined as . Definition 4 Depth The sum of the sequential path delays for fundamental operations is depth. Where the depths of the gate required for the basic operations XOR/XNOR, AND/OR, NAND/NOR, and NOT are evaluated to be 2, 1.5, 1, and 0.5, respectively. For example, we consider the computation of in Eq. (10). ( ) and ( ) are executed first. Then calculate ( ). Then the last operation of NOR can be executed. Thus, the depth of is estimated to be 3.5 (=1.5+1+1). The genetic algorithm is used to find low energy S-boxes. The crossover probability is 0.8, and the mutation probability is 0.6. The required computation time is reduced by using Genetic Algorithm (GA) in S-box generation, and a series of S-boxes that meet the conditions can be directly found. The steps for the proposed genetic algorithm to find low energy S-boxes are as follows: (1) First, 10,000 individuals are randomly generated as the initial population.

After each creation of a new population, the following actions are performed on the new population: (1) Calculate the fitness values (differential probability, linear approximation probability, and algebraic degree) of all individuals in the population by means of a fitness function. (2) Effective scaling of the initial fitness. (3) Select the parents with better fitness scores from the existing population for processing to generate a new population. Among them, the S-box logic operations required to compute algebraic degrees cannot be easily obtained since the first step of the algorithm generates 10,000 S-box lookup tables with random permutations as the initial population. Hence the Karnaugh map method is used to obtain the four simplest logical expressions corresponding to the S-box. First, each column is treated as a group, and the S-box lookup table is converted into four binary arrays. Then, 0 and 1 are filled in the matrix according to the relationship between the different inputs and outputs of the four binary arrays to obtain four matrices. The Karnaugh maps are drawn based on these four matrices, combining adjacent 1s into the largest set possible and covering as many 1s as possible to generate expression terms. Then, the expression terms are simplified, and duplicate terms and terms containing other terms are removed to generate the complete logical expression. (3) The maximum depth of S-boxes used in current low-latency ciphers is 4. Therefore, we keep the depth within 4 for searching. It is clear from Definition 4 that in a 4-bit S-box, coordinate components with a depth less than 4 are at most a combination of seven 2-input logic gates, and the area of each coordinate component is also low at this point. Consequently, we can directly traverse the S-boxes obtained in step 2) that satisfy the cryptographic properties to search for low-latency and low-area S-boxes. Firstly, we represent each coordinate component with a set of 2-input logic gates, respectively (the depth is limited to 4). Then, calculate the delay and area of the four coordinate components in each S-box, respectively, where the area is calculated under the UMC 1P6M process library. Finally, an involutive S-box with low delay and low area is obtained. The depth of the S-box is 3.5, and its area is 22.33 GE. Table 3 shows the performance of the proposed S-box compared with other S-boxes under the same process library. It can be seen that the S-box of LELBC has some advantages in terms of area and delay. Therefore, it is more capable of achieving low energy consumption for LELBC than other S-boxes. The logic gate operation of the S-box is represented by Eq. (10). The inputs and outputs are defined as and , where and are the most significant bits. (10) 4.3. The linear layer of LELBC A structure with highly consistent encryption and decryption is more conducive to low energy design. Therefore, LELBC adopts two symmetrical linear layers before and after the Sublayer for the diffusion of plaintext data to achieve highly consistent encryption and decryption. Although the selection of two identical linear layers can better achieve the consistency of encryption and decryption, the diffusion effect is not good because the data of the two branches does not affect each other. The diffusion effect of this method is also verified by an avalanche effect experiment. Table 4 illustrates the avalanche effect of the two linear layers in the first 5 rounds. represents the average change in output bits when the input plaintext changes by 1 bit. The experiment proves that using two symmetrical linear layers can achieve a better diffusion effect. Simultaneously, LELBC only needs to add an exchange of left and right branch data after 16 rounds of iteration of the round function to achieve complete consistency of the encryption and decryption structures. Since the S-box is obfuscated in half-byte units, bit diffusion of the data is performed using cyclic shifting and XOR operations in the linear layer. The selection of the number of cyclic shift bits takes into account both the avalanche effect and the security analysis. There are 32 choices, as the cyclically left-shifted bits need to be exactly the same in order to achieve a symmetric structure. The optimal choice was determined by an experimental test that traversed these 32 data points. We conducted experiments on the choice of the number of circular shifts in combination with differential attacks and avalanche effects. The number of rounds at which the cipher algorithm achieves a complete avalanche or the security boundary changes with the variation of the bit of circular left shifts, as can be seen in Fig. 4. In which rows represent the cyclically left-shifted bits and columns represent the round number corresponding to achieving a complete avalanche or differential attack security boundary. As some data cannot achieve complete avalanche effect for the algorithm, we label all the data at that point in the graph as 0. We finally chose 5 as the number of cyclic left shifts for the P diffusion layer based on the experimental result chart. Table 4. Comparison of avalanche effect between two linear layers.

The better the avalanche effect of the cipher algorithm, the higher the security. In this section, the safety strength of this cipher is evaluated by avalanche effect analysis. The experiment was conducted by randomly selecting 10,000 sets of 64-bit plaintext as test samples. When the input plaintext changes by 1 bit, the avalanche effect degree , the strict avalanche criterion degree , the bit of output change , the mean value of the bit of output change , the probability of output change and the mean probability of output change are tested. Table 5 shows the avalanche effect test results for LELBC. At the same time, we use , , and to represent the minimum, maximum, and average number of changed bits, respectively. The avalanche effect diagram shown in Fig. 5. As seen from Table 5 and Fig. 5, LELBC fully satisfied the dependency requirements in the fifth round. In addition, we used the same method to test PRESENT and CRAFT, and the results obtained are shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, respectively. Both the PRESENT and CRAFT algorithms reached the avalanche effect standard in the sixth round. Therefore, it can be considered that LELBC has a good avalanche effect. Table 5.

Differential attack and linear attack Differential and linear attacks have been two of the most effective cryptographic attack methods since they were proposed. The lower bound of the active S-box count can, to some extent, reflect a cipher’s resistance to differential and linear attacks. In recent years, automated search has become a major focus for cryptanalysis. One of the tools for automating analysis is mixed integer linear programming (MILP) [36]. In this paper, the algorithm is analyzed using the MILP method. A bit-oriented MILP program is constructed to calculate the minimum number of differences and linear active S-boxes. First, we obtain the input differential and output differential corresponding to their non-zero points according to the difference distribution table (DDT) of LELBC’s S-box. It can be seen from Table 10 that the number of non-zero points it has is 97. We then obtain 272 inequalities by using the SageMath tool to distinguish all non-zero points from other points. Next, we use the MILP procedure to reduce these inequalities and eliminate redundancy. The final 21 constrained inequalities are obtained to represent the S-box. Finally, we use the Gurobi solver to solve for the minimum active S-box number based on the above constraints and the structure of the LELBC cipher. The same method is adopted to perform linear attacks on the LELBC cipher. The linear approximation table (LAT) for the S-box is shown in Table 11. Table 6 displays the minimal number of active S-boxes discovered through experimentation. It is evident that after 12 rounds of encryption, LELBC has 34 active S-boxes. The maximum difference probability and the maximum linear probability should be less than 2−64, as the block length of LELBC is 64-bit. Meanwhile, the maximum difference probability and the maximum linear probability of the S-box used in LELBC are 2−2. It can be observed that the maximum difference probability of LELBC in 12 rounds is . The maximum linear probability of LELBC in 12 rounds is . Therefore, the 16-round LELBC is resistant to both differential and linear attacks. Table 6. Minimum number of active S-boxes in LELBC under single-key setting.

Algebraic attack Algebraic attack is one of the vital methods of cryptanalysis. The attacker recovers the key by calculating a number of multivariate algebraic equations [37]. The more multivariate algebraic equations there are, the stronger the resistance to algebraic attack. These complicated multivariate algebraic equations are derived from non-linear S-boxes since they are the most important non-linear components of cryptographic algorithms. LELBC has an overall number of (16 × 16) + (1 × 16) = 272 S-boxes in the encryption since it has 16 iteration rounds. Twenty-one quadratic equations with eight input and output bit variables can be used to describe a 4 × 4 S-box. Thus, LELBC has 272 × 21 = 5712 quadratic equations corresponding to 272 × 8 = 2176 variables. We compared the differences in the number of S-boxes, variables, and quadratic equations between LELBC and KLEIN, Midori, PRINCE, MIBS. As can be seen from Table 7, LELBC has a better advantage over most of the cipher algorithms, such as Midori, in all these aspects. The Midori cipher algorithm has been proven to be resistant to algebraic attack. Therefore, it can be said that LELBC is also resistant to algebraic attack. 5.4. Meet-in-the-middle attack and slide attack Meet-in-the-Middle attack can be used to analyze the algorithm’s security by taking into account three characteristics: partial matching, initial structure, and splice-and-cut [38]. Partial matching can only be used when the cipher algorithm does not reach full diffusion in both forward and reverse directions. Therefore, the total diffusion rounds of LELBC are = 3, as discussed in Section 4.1, so the boundary of partial matching is = 4. The length of the initial structure can also be defined by and the number of rounds in which the key difference affects all non-linear operations. Thus, limits the length of the initial structure. Splice-and-cut can also limit the number of rounds of attack by subtracting 1 from . In summary, the upper bound on the number of rounds that can be attacked by intermediate encounters is 10 = (4 + 3 + 3) rounds for LELBC. LELBC is sufficient to resist Meet-in-the-Middle attack, considering the total number of rounds of the LELBC algorithm. In addition, we ensure that each round of operations is different for LELBC since it includes round constant addition in the key schedule. Therefore, LELBC is sufficient to resist slide attack. 6. Implementation 6.1. Evaluation This section presents an ASIC hardware implementation of LELBC. We adopt a round-based architecture implementation for LELBC as it takes less energy than a serialized architecture. First, we implemented LELBC with Verilog HDL and simulated it with ModelSim SE-64 10.4. Afterwards, LELBC is synthesized using the Synopsys Design Compiler version A-2007.12-SP1 and the UMCL18G212T3 standard cell library. The architectural diagram of the round-based structure of LELBC is illustrated in Fig. 8. In a round-based architecture, the LELBC occupies one clock cycle per round. The round function consists of ARK, LCS, S, and XOR operations. Additionally, the key schedule consists of S-box, round constant addition, and left circular shift. The detailed description of the encryption/decryption (ENC/DEC) mode and encryption+decryption (ENC+DEC) mode of round-based architectures for LELBC is shown below. The round-based architecture (ENC/DEC): The hardware resources and energy consumption of LELBC in encryption mode and decryption mode are identical due to the symmetry of the PSP structure. For fair comparison, we uniformly use registers to store key and does not take into account the resources for the key schedule. The hardware resources of the round-based architecture for LELBC include 64-bit plaintext registers, 128-bit key registers, 128-bit XOR, 16 S-boxes, control logic and other counters. The detailed description of the area consumption for LELBC is given in Table 8. Thus, the estimated area of round-based architecture (ENC/DEC) for LELBC is 1863.04 GE, and energy consumption is 6.99 J/bit. The round-based architecture (ENC+DEC): The key schedule of decryption for LELBC under unified ED circuits does not match that of encryption. Therefore, the ENC+DEC mode only requires an additional S-box, 5-bit round constant addition, and a multiplexer on the basis of the ENC/DEC mode. Consistent with the ENC/DEC mode, the computation of area and energy in the ENC+DEC mode also uniformly uses registers to store the key and does not take into account the resources for the key schedule. The comparison of area and energy for LELBC with other ciphers in ENC+DEC mode is given in Table 9. It is observed from the table that there is a 24.02% and 24.04% reduction in energy and area for LELBC compared to Midori, a low-energy cipher published in ASIACRYPT 2015. It is possible that this reduction in energy and area could allow LELBC to be applicable in a future where IoT devices are more resource-constrained. LELBC could reduce the energy loss of each resource-constrained device to a greater extent in practical IoT deployments, increasing their lifespan and reducing the replacement cycle of the devices. From a long-term perspective, the reduced energy consumption in practical IoT deployments is conducive to increasing the availability of IoT devices in smart agriculture and reducing economic losses. Simultaneously, smart agriculture can utilize energy more efficiently and rationally and facilitate the balanced development of the environment and the economy.

Demonstration Smart agriculture has become popular in facility agriculture due to all-round environmental monitoring and control systems that combine sensors and wireless communication networks. Environmental data and on-site scenario information in agriculture are collected and transmitted through various wireless sensors to liquid crystal display screens for comprehensive display, achieving scientific, timely, and accurate adjustment of agricultural production. However, as more and more farms and food processing plants adopt new technologies to simplify production and integrate supply chain services, cybercrime is becoming an increasingly serious threat to agricultural enterprises. Therefore, encrypting sensor data in smart agriculture has a certain significance. Temperature is an important factor in the growth and development of crops in agriculture, and real-time monitoring of temperature is conducive to the timely adjustment of the appropriate temperature state. In this section, a temperature acquisition platform was established to simulate environmental monitoring in smart agriculture. At the same time, we deployed the 64–128 versions of LELBC on the temperature acquisition platform. LELBC simulates data acquisition and encrypted transmission in agriculture through temperature sensors and two Artix-7 FPGA development boards based on XC7A100T2csg324. We synthesized the RTL generated by LELBC based on the round architecture using ISE Design Suite 14.6 and downloaded it onto an Artix-7 FPGA development board based on the XC7A100T-2csg324. Firstly, an Artix-7 FPGA development board acquires real-time temperature data through the temperature sensor. It then encrypts and displays the data through the downloaded LELBC. After that, the data is transmitted to another Artix-7 FPGA development board in the form of ciphertext to be decrypted and displayed. The specific process is shown in Fig. 9. The Artix-7 FPGA development board on the right encrypts the collected temperature data and displays it, while the Artix-7 FPGA development board on the left displays the temperature data after the ciphertext is decrypted. LELBC provides encryption of the sensed data before transmission, which ensures that the data is kept in the form of ciphertext at all times during transmission. It protects the confidentiality of the data by preventing attackers from stealing, tampering with, and leaking the real data. The successful implementation of a real-time temperature status acquisition and encryption platform demonstrates the feasibility of deploying LELBC on the platform. It provides the first line of defense for data security in smart agriculture. Download : Download high-res image (866KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9.

Conclusion The focus of this paper is to design a low energy lightweight block cipher LELBC that meets the requirements of an environment with extremely limited energy resources. Firstly, we studied the design methods of low energy ciphers and optimized them based on the shortcomings of existing low energy ciphers. LELBC adopts a novel PSP structure with highly consistent encryption and decryption, which takes into account the energy resource constraints of unified ED circuits during the design phase. Additionally, GA is used to search for a low-energy involutive S-box with excellent performance compared to other cipher involutive S-boxes. In terms of hardware implementation on a round-based architecture, LELBC has a lower area and energy consumption (encryption + decryption) than low energy lightweight ciphers such as PRINCE, Loong, CRAFT, I-PRESENT , SKINNY, and Midori. The test vectors for LELBC are given in Table 12. LELBC has been demonstrated by security analysis to be resistant to attacks such as differential attack, linear attack, algebraic attack, and other types of attacks. Finally, LELBC is deployed on the temperature acquisition platform to encrypt and decrypt the sensor data. The successful implementation of this experiment proves the feasibility of LELBC, which provides the first layer of protection for the privacy and security of smart agriculture. Future works: Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and Side Channel Attacks (SCAs) are two of the most important topics in security. In the future, we will also delve into these two directions. First, there is a need for a hybrid system for the transition towards PQC, although quantum computing based on Shor’s algorithm will break most cryptosystems [39]. This hybrid system requires both classical cryptography and PQC [40]. Many related techniques are continuously proposed [41], [42]. They usually optimize the performance of the algorithms according to the NIST standard [43], [44]. In the future, we can further study the relevant applications of PQC in resource-constrained environments such as smart agriculture. Table 10.

It works by forcing a device to operate under extreme conditions, resulting in computational errors. It is necessary to consider the possibility of fault attacks in practical applications, even though the attackers are generally restricted [45]. A number of error detection schemes for cipher algorithms have been proposed [46], [47]. For example, Jasmin Kaur et al. proposed signature-based error detection schemes that can be applied to cipher algorithms similar to the QARMA cipher [13]. And the overhead of this method can be applied to resource-constrained devices. LELBC has similarities with QARMA both in terms of block length, structure, and components. In future practical deployments, we can also refer to this scheme to secure the LELBC hardware implementation.

Abstract India's agricultural sector is dwindling, which has an impact on ecosystem output. Smart farming increases crop productivity by reducing waste and making effective use of fertiliser. Various Machine Learning techniques together with IoT enabled are developed for precision agriculture. However, the existing techniques face difficulties in forecasting weather and predicting disease accurately. In this work, a system is developed to automate weather forecasting and field monitoring using sensors. Wireless transmission is used to transfer sensor data to a web server database. In the first step, the collected data is pre-processed using normalization and mean based missing value imputation to convert the raw data into meaningful data. Pre-processed data is then fed into Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for forecasting the weather condition. In the second step, crop images acquired from sensors for disease prediction are pre-processed using Adaptive Gaussian Filter for noise removal and Dynamic Histogram Equalization for contrast enhancement of image. Pre-processed images are then fed into ResNet50 for feature extraction and classification. Using these predicted data, in case of any horrible weather conditions and soil conditions, remedial action will be automatically taken by the systems. On the other hand, regarding the information about horrible conditions and in presence of pests and diseases, an alert message will be sent to the farmers. The proposed method is tested with several metrics which attain better performance like 94% accuracy for weather forecasting and 98% accuracy for field monitoring. Thus the proposed IoT and deep learning based model can support farmers to achieve a high quantity of crop production in lesser time.

Introduction India has agriculture as its primary occupation. IBEF (Indian Brand Enquiry Foundation) estimates that 58 % of Indians who live in rural areas depend on agriculture. Not only in underdeveloped countries but also in many industrialised countries, farming and agriculture make up a significant component of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) (Karthick et al., 2018). As a result, it is urgent that existing farming methods be improved upon. It will help handle global catastrophes like climate change and epidemics like draught in addition to fostering the flourishing sustainable development of people, flora, and fauna (Lavanya et al., 2020). Farmers still use traditional methods such as manual field monitoring, which involves often watering crops and applying pesticides to manage pests, whether or not they are aware of the appropriate dosage. These old methods include disadvantages such as water logging in fields, excessive use of pesticides and fungicides, lack of knowledge about the kind of crops that need to be cultivated for a certain type of soil fertility, and lower yields than anticipated from the agricultural area (AshifuddinMondal & Rehena, 2018). Many farmers continue to cultivate using traditional techniques, which leads to low crop yields (Sushanth & Sujatha, 2018). Better technology will increase yield, hence reducing the likelihood of famine and malnutrition. The technology should be inexpensive enough that it can have an influence on billions of people worldwide (Ogunti, 2019; Karthick & Muthukumaran, 2023). Monitoring of the soil, plants, moisture, and temperature, as well as the management of the infrastructure and control systems, are all necessary for agricultural production. IoT is essential in the sector of agriculture (Thakur et al., 2020). Since they are utilised to offer information about agricultural areas, all Internet of Things sensors is quite effective. A smart agriculture stick advertises the novel smart agriculture programme based on IoT that enables farmers to have access to real-time data to track how the environment is operating, enabling them to engage in smart farming, increase their final yield, and ensure that their product meets quality standards (Phasinam et al., 2022). A wireless sensor network is used by this advanced agricultural monitoring system to gather data from a number of sensors placed at various junctions. A great amount of data can be analysed using such technology in precision farming after being collected by WSN (Khanna & Kaur, 2019). It enables farmers to boost yields while using fewer resources. In industrialised countries, smart framing is being carried out on a wide scale combining IoT, AI, and agriculture data analysis (Goel et al., 2021). The Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart agriculture system demonstrated that distant sensors are used to monitor inside settings and that micro-scale controllers are utilised to control and operate indoor and remote sensing systems, including those that take pictures and videos and even use cameras (Panda & Bhatnagar, 2020). Farmers may monitor and manage the microclimate in the greenhouse, as well as illnesses and pests that impact the plants, with the aid of precision farming (Arora et al., 2021). The status of the plants can be impacted by a variety of external elements and microclimatic interior occurrences (Gunjan et al., 2022). Plant development and the spread of some diseases are both impacted by temperature and relative humidity (Daya Sagar et al., 2023). In terms of the effectiveness of greenhouses, it is one of the most detrimental agricultural production illnesses (Cambra et al., 2018). When ambient and micro-indoor conditions are favourable, controlling the irrigation of water quality is easier. When growing crops in greenhouses, it is essential to apply the appropriate fertiliser treatments or drip system cleanser at the appropriate time and location (Siddiquee et al., 2022). Understanding the stage of the production cycle at which specific nutrient solutions should be used is essential (Sai Surya Teja et al., 2023). The purpose of this paper is to make automated and continuous field monitoring for smart agriculture using IoT and deep learning technologies (Karthick & Muthukumaran, 2023). The main contribution of the proposed work is given below: • Automated and efficient field monitoring model is designed through combining IoT and deep learning technology to support farmers in achieving higher crop production. • Sensors are assembled in an agricultural field to acquire data regarding agricultural factors and transmit it to cloud server for further analysis purposes. • Normalization and missing value imputation are used as data pre-processing techniques and GRU is used to forecast weather and soil conditions based on the acquired data. • Adaptive Gaussian filter and dynamic histogram equalization are used as image pre-processing techniques and CNN is used to detect the presence of disease using pre-processed crop image. • Alert SMS are sent to farmers regarding the horrible weather condition and diseases to render control action. Rest of the paper contains: Section 2 presents the literature review related to automated field monitoring. In Section 3 proposed methodology and architecture of the proposed methodology are given. Result and discussion part of the proposed methodology is given in Section 4. At last, Section 5 contains the conclusion part. 2. Literature review Several techniques for automatic forecasting of weather and field monitoring had been developed. The following section examines some of the current approaches utilized for weather forecasting and crop disease prediction in smart agriculture. (a) Weather and irrigation monitoring system An IoT-based smart irrigation management system combining machine learning and open source technology has been proposed by Goap et al. (2018). The proposed system's intelligence is based on a smart algorithm that considers sensory data as well as elements of the short-term weather forecast, such as precipitation, air temperature, humidity, and UV. But the system cost of this suggested approach is high. Velmurugan (2020) have suggested a smart system that uses open-source technologies to forecast how much irrigation is needed for a given field. The entire system has been created and is currently being tested on a small-scale pilot project. Web-based information visualisation and decision support systems are used to wirelessly gather sensor node data via the cloud, and they deliver real-time information insights based on the analysis of sensor and weather forecast data. Singh et al. (2019) have suggested In an IoT-driven smart irrigation framework, machine learning techniques are used to maximise the irrigation water use by forecasting the future soil moisture of a field. The performance of various ML techniques is tested for predicting future soil moisture, and the GBRT outcomes are quite encouraging. Rani et al. (2020) have suggested a machine learning and neural networks-based flood monitoring system using IoT. This research outlines an efficient and adaptable technique for flood and system-altering system identification. The most cutting-edge technologies, including machine learning (ML), have a large positive impact on technology and are particularly effective at detecting both normal and pathological behaviour in any system. The most common, extensively used, and effective method for forecasting rainfall is neural networks. Real-time agricultural field monitoring utilising IoT-based sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles has been developed by Quach et al. (2021). A sensor network for gathering information on the ground is also incorporated, in addition to an unmanned aerial vehicle system for remote sensing. Numerous sensor nodes are used in the sensor network to measure various environmental and plant factors, including temperature, humidity, and nitrogen content. The sensor network transmits data using LoRa, a low-power wide-area network modulation method that enables a single receiver to receive signals from sensor nodes up to 450 m away. (b) Crop disease prediction In order to predict apple disease in Kashmir Valley apple orchards, Akhter and Sofi (2022) suggested using data analytics and machine learning in an IoT system. This study reaches a pinnacle in demonstrating the power and promise of computing tools like the internet of things, wireless sensor networks, data analytics, and machine learning in agriculture. A local poll was also conducted to find out from the farmers how the most recent technological advancements affect precision farming. Khamparia et al. (2020) developed a hybrid deep learning model merging autoencoder with Convolutional neural network for crop leaf disease prediction. Obtained dataset contained 900 image samples of three different crops and five types of disease. From total samples 600 images were considered for training process and remaining 300 was considered for testing process. Different convolution filter size of and was used in this developed approach achieving 97.5 % accuracy. Krishnamoorthy et al. (2021) developed deep learning model along with transfer learning for prediction of disease in rice leaf. In traditional farming, farmers spend lot of resources as well as time consuming due to visualizing through naked eye and it results in unhealthy farming. Object segmentation and classification was achieved using InceptionResNetV2 for recognizing disease in rice leaf image. Kaur et al. (2022) developed hybrid CNN model for detection of leaf disease through utilizing feature extraction and feature reduction approach. Using this developed approach four different types of diseases such as black measles, stable, black rot and leaf blight present in grapevines was recognized. Plant village dataset was collected and processed using EfficientNet B7 deep model using transfer learning. After extracting features it was further reduced by applying logistic regression. According to the literature, numerous systems are designed for automatic field monitoring with IoT. Based on the above mentioned articles several significant challenges arise in automatic weather forecasting and field monitoring approaches. High system cost (Goap et al., 2018), alerting system not available (Rani et al., 2020), and only considering a single parameter (Akhter and Sofi, 2022) are some of the issues in the existing algorithms. Thus effective field monitoring is not achieved using the existing research. So, the current research focuses on utilizing IoT and deep learning approach for automated and continuous field monitoring. 3. Proposed methodology In India, one of the most important economic sectors is agriculture. India's increased agricultural activity can be attributed to the country's abundant irrigation-supporting water supplies and highly productive soil. However, a number of circumstances stop the production of the projected yield from occurring. To overcome these aforementioned issues and to support farmers with better quality and quantity crops an improved automated and computer based technology is designed in this current research. Fig. 1 illustrates the architecture of the proposed IoT based system. Download : Download high-res image (592KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Architecture of the Proposed IoT Based System for Improved Precision Agriculture. The agricultural area is equipped with several IoT-based sensor nodes to gather real-time data. The nodes that have been assembled gather data on the state of the soil, moisture content of the soil, presence of humidity, presence of pests, diseases, and insects, as well as photographs of plants and other things. The information is then either sent to a cloud server based on IoT or stored locally in a nearby fog node. The collected data is pre-processed using normalization and mean based missing value imputation to convert the raw data into meaningful data which is required for classification. Pre-processed data is then given as input for Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for forecasting the weather condition. Then, in the second step, the images of the crop are acquired to predict the presence of disease and pests. The acquired crop images are pre-processed using an Adaptive Gaussian filter for noise removal and Dynamic Histogram Equalization (DHE) for contrast enhancement of the image. Pre-processed image is then fed to ResNet50 for feature extraction and classification. Using these predicted data, in case of any horrible weather conditions and soil conditions, remedial action will be automatically taken by the system. On the other hand, the information regarding the horrible conditions and in presence of pests and diseases, an alert message will be sent to the farmers. The proposed IoT and deep learning based model can support the farmers to achieve quantity and quality crop production in lesser time. 3.1. IoT based network for data acquisition The first step in putting together a weather forecasting and field monitoring system is setting up a wireless sensor network field where each node is linked by a Wi-Fi module as well as lays data over a server computer, form where an automated Python script can keep polling the information and then transmits alert/start messages for the required procedure. Below Fig. 2 shows the diagrammatic representation of distributed WSN. Download : Download high-res image (175KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Distributed WSN. Data collection using numerous sensors placed around the field or garden is the first stage in creating an automatic weather forecasting and field monitoring system. The gateway node, or Raspberry Pi 3 B+, will handle all communication with the other sensor nodes. Advanced soil moisture sensors, GSM and Bluetooth modules, temperature and humidity sensors, MQ2 gas sensors, pH sensors, water level indicators, alarm and clock modules, batteries, and relay modules are all included in each Arduino mega unit. Ultrasonic sensor for rodents and significant intruder detection. Each node will send information to the raspberry pi3, which functions as both the base station and the gateway node. The data storage on the raspberry pi will be handled by a python script, from which it might be displayed to the user via an application layer. The intranet can also accomplish what it was designed to do for data transmission from the raspberry pi to the server, enabling its use of it in places with limited to no internet access. The basic principles of receiver, transmitter, ground, and positive are the basis for connecting various sensors to the microcontroller. The majority of connections need to be made in this way, because the Arduino Mega board includes a lot of digital pins, RXD, analogue pins and TXD in addition to a lot of Vcc and Gnd pins. After building the network topology and collecting the data, the first phase of the proposed applications is finished. Data processing begins with the initial phase of data collection using various sensors. 3.1.1. Node’s structural details Each node is made up of a micro-controller, which in this case is advised to be an Arduino mega because it most closely matches the scope of the solution. Each node has a soil moisture sensor, a Wi-Fi module, a temperature sensor, a DHT11 sensor, a light intensity sensor, also a battery module linked to it. Fig. 3 below contains each node's block diagram. Download : Download high-res image (161KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Configuration of each sensor node. In order to transmit further signals to the actuators and inform the end user in the event that manual intrusion is required, all of the data collected by the sensors must be processed and analysed. 3.2. Data analysis The data kept on a cloud server is also taken into account for analytical purposes, whereby an AI system is used to predict the weather, the characteristics of the soil, irrigation, and illness. To automate the forecast of various agricultural aspects and take corrective action to increase crop output, AI systems are being considered. However in the data analysis process initially the information regarding temperature, humidity, moisture and soil condition are considered. 3.2.1. Weather monitoring (a) Data pre-processing The sensors' entire collection of data has to be evaluated and handled. The given input datasets such as temperature, humidity moisture and soil properties contains some missing values. Normalization and mean based missing value imputation are used in the proposed method to convert the raw data into meaningful data which is required for classification. (b) Normalization Normally, attributes from the raw data are high variables and not present in a specified range. To accomplish a better outcome, the attributes from the data are kept in a uniform range of [A, B]. So here, min–max normalization method is used to normalize the attribute ranges. A mathematical formulation of min–max normalization is given in Eq. (1). (1) where represents the original value, denotes the maximum value of and indicates the minimum value of . (c) Mean based Missing value Imputation Imputation using mean values, also known as rough imputation, is a quick and simple imputation method that employs the mean value of all the data on the variable to be improved. Imputation of numerical variables is done using the mean. This rough imputation not only ignores the amount of variance but also the connection between variables, resulting in inaccurate estimations. The rough imputation approach should only be used when just a few missing data are present, and it is not designed for broad usage and is given in Eq. (2). (2) where represents the sample mean, and the total of each value in the sample is represented by , while the number of values in the population is represented by . 3.2.2. Classification A classifier is an algorithm that organises data into labelled informational classes or categories. In this designed model, GRU is used to forecast the weather. (a) Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) A GRU can be viewed as a simplification and improvement of LSTM and is comparable in performance to LSTM. Introduce LSTM before giving a comprehensive description of a GRU. The hidden state is the most crucial portion of an RNN because it is in charge of remembering or forgetting certain information (Li et al., 2020). From top to bottom, GRU has a total of three layers. The 10 node input layer is in charge of feeding information into the hidden layer. The output unit, which contains two nodes and one layer, is in charge of classifying and producing the data processed from the hidden layer using the SoftMax classifier. 32 nodes and one layer make up the hidden layer. The hidden layer's output processed data is handled using one-hot encoding, a real output that is gained following the decoding procedure. GRU consists of two gates a reset gate and an update gate . The two gates cooperate to regulate the flow of data into and out of the memory cell. Although they both use the input and the preceding concealed state to calculate them, their functions are distinct. A GRU makes some reductions in complexity compared to LSTM. Fig. 4 is a diagram of the GRU's organisational structure. Eq. (3) provides the link relationship seen in Fig. 4. (3) Download : Download high-res image (200KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Structure of the GRU. In Eq. (3), candidate’s output is represented by , output vector is indicated using and represents the input vector. The reset gate of the GRU is designated by the letter , and the output gate by the letter (Xu et al., 2018). This GRU network is used in proposed approach to forecasting the weather in the agriculture area. 3.2.3. Disease prediction (a) Image pre-processing The sensors' entire collection of data has to be evaluated and handled. From the information collected from the nodes, the Python programmes running on the Raspberry Pi will check for certain criteria. The input crop image dataset is pre-processed in order to convert the raw image into a meaningful image. Adaptive Gaussian filter and dynamic histogram equalization technique to remove noise and to improve the quality of the image for achieving accurate prediction. (b) Adaptive Gaussian filter When using a conventional Canny edge detector operator, the Gaussian filter is employed to smooth out the image and minimise the parasitic effect that sampling quantization has on the image. Due to the fact that both the edge and the noise are high frequency signals, the filter operator smoothes the image's edges while suppressing the noise, which affects how accurately the edges are identified. An updated Gaussian filtering algorithm is put forth to address this issue; it decides whether to apply a Gaussian filter based on the disparity between the pixel's grey value and the grey mean in the surrounding area. If the noise interferes with the image, it can be written as in Eq. (4): (4) where is the noise signal. When there is noise, the difference between the noise-affected pixel's grey value also its neighbouring pixels is described as in Eq. (5). (5) Due to the approximate zero interference free D, the mean value difference between the point grey value of the noise-affected image pixel and its neighbouring pixels, called , is roughly equal to , which is the degree of noise hopping. (c) Dynamic histogram equalization The cropped image's total number of pixels is used as the basis for the spanning function used by the equalisation method to perform equalisation (Dhal et al., 2018). Histogram equalisation and mapping the image pixels to a dynamic range are the two stages of the process. (d) Mapping image pixels to dynamic range The dynamic range for the output sub-histograms can be obtained from as Eqs. (5), (6). (6) (7) The exceptions are present at the two extremities, where (e) Equalizing each sub-histogram Similar to how a global histogram is equalised, each image's histogram is equalised using the same process. The remapped values for the ith sub-histogram are derived as in Eq. (8). (8) where is the new intensity level corresponding to the intensity level on the original image, is the histogram value at the intensity level on the fuzzy histogram and is the total population count in the partition of the fuzzy histogram. 3.2.4. Classification A classifier is an algorithm that organises data into clearly defined categories or classes. In this designed model, ResNet50 a kind of CNN model is used to predict plant diseases. (a) Residual Neural Network (ResNet50) The goal of CNN's back propagation method is to automatically discover the spatial hierarchies of feature classes. Convolution, pooling, and fully connected (FC) units are common building components utilized in the creation of CNNs. The process of repeatedly running the input image through the selected filter is the foundation of the convolutional layer's operation. The filter can be 3 × 3, 5 × 5 or 7 × 7 pixels in size. As a result, the image with the filter applied to it becomes the input of the following layer (m2 × m3). Activation maps are created as a result of this convolution process. Local unique elements can be seen on activation maps. A filter (m1) exists for each convolutional layer (Toğaçar et al., 2020). The output of layer l is made up of feature maps with dimension The ith subset of features, displayed as , is calculated utilizing Eq. (9). The matrix bias is indicated by and denotes size of the filter. (9) The pooling units preserves image characteristics while reducing image size also expenses while maintaining image information. This structure reduces the number of parameters, the filter's spatial dimension, and the step. It takes information in the following sizes as input: , and again outcomes Eqs. (10), (11), (12) demonstrates, in brief how the pooling layer functions. (10) (11) (12) The characteristics from the preceding stage are flattened before being assigned to the FC layers, which update the weights also provide the final values for each label. An actual multi-layered sensor for mapping is a convolutional network with fully interlinked units. In Eq. (13), the FC layer's processing stages are displayed. (13) In the proposed method CNN model such as ResNet 50 is used for the training of plant disease image dataset. Fig. 5 illustrates a building block for residual learning. A remarkable architecture made up of residual layers is called ResNet. Furthermore, ResNet is distinct in that it substitutes a collection of global average pooling layers for the more customary set of fully linked layers at the network’s conclusion. ResNet50 is a type of residual network with 50 layers. Each group of identical layers in the ResNet50 design is unique. ResNet calculates data from one layer to the next that must occur in order to arrive at the final forecast. ResNet helps to mitigate the problem of vanishing gradients by offering an alternative shortcut route for gradient to flow through. The model can skip a CNN weight layer if the current layer is not necessary thanks to the ResNet identity mapping algorithm (Theckedath & Sedamkar, 2020). This assists in preventing the over-fitting issue with the training set. This ResNet50 classifier used in the proposed method classifies the plant diseases in agricultural land. Predicted data using deep learning approach is further used for the purpose of monitoring the agriculture field. Download : Download high-res image (99KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Building Block for ResNet50. 3.3. Field monitoring The temperature, humidity, irrigation, fertilisers and illness in the agricultural field will all be checked when the smart agricultural monitoring system is turned on. The water pump will automatically start if the temperature is really high. Then if the soil moisture is going down then the water pump will start automatically. Nutrient levels of the soils are then checked. If nutrient deficiencies occurred then an automatic fertilization machine is turned on to spray the fertilizer on the agricultural land. If the plants are affected by a particular disease means the automatic pesticide sprayer will start automatically. The smart agriculture monitoring system uses a GSM module to communicate with mobile devices and establish SMS alerts on the mobile device about the levels. 4. Result and discussion Agriculture and farming contribute significantly to the GDP of many affluent countries as well as emerging countries. As a result, it is urgent that existing farming methods be improved upon. A critical matter that requires the highest appropriateness to be addressed is the necessity for agricultural maintenance and the rising water issues. To build an automated and continuous field monitoring, the proposed research focus on IoT and deep learning approach. The proposed GRU and ResNet50 are tested on MATLAB 2021a with intel core i5 and 8 GB RAM. Simulation parameters for GRU and ResNet50 are given in Table 1, Table 2. Table 1.

In order to gather real-time data, several IoT-based sensor nodes are set up in the agricultural field. The assembled nodes capture information regarding the environmental conditions, soil condition, moisture condition, presence of humidity fertility of the soil, and presence of the pest, diseases, and insects also capture images of plants and so. The collected information’s either stored locally in the nearby fog node or transmitted to the cloud server based on IoT. The agricultural node with sensor nodes and sensor node deployment used for this proposed approach is illustrated in Fig. 6, Fig. 7.

The information stored in cloud server is further considered for analysis purposes in which the prediction of weather, soil properties, irrigation and disease is achieved by means of AI system. The reason for considering AI systems is to achieve automated prediction of varying agricultural factors and take remedial action for higher crop yield. 4.1. Dataset description Different sensors are placed in the agricultural field for monitoring purpose to support smart in order to perform healthy farming. The collected sensor data is processed using AI system to predict weather, crop disease, soil nutrition and irrigation support. Four different datasets collected from publicly available is taken for analysis. Description regarding different dataset is given below. Dataset 1: This data contains details regarding district wise crop area, season, temperature different types of crops, production in hectares and yield. The statistics is collected from 1997 to 2021 and it is obtained from Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare of India. Data is acquired from 35 states and union territory. Dataset 2: For the purpose of monitoring and controlling an irrigation system in real-time, data is gathered using a wireless sensor network. This method prevents water waste while providing the farm and garden with uniform and necessary water levels. This method aims to provide an automated irrigation mechanism that activates and deactivates the pumping motor in response to the amount of moisture in the ground. In this system, the soil moisture sensor, dht11 sensor, and NodeMCU are all used to interface with the Arduino board. Using these sensors, the data is collected. Dataset 3: Data related to soil nutrients is collected from department of agriculture and farmers welfare. Different types of nutrients are essential to be present in the soil for plant growth. Various soil nutrients includes pH, Electrical Conductivity (EC), Iron (Fe), Organic Carbon (OC), Nitrogen (N), Manganese (Mn), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Sulfur (S), Boron (B), Copper (Cu), and Zinc (zn). Dataset 4: This dataset contains both unhealthy as well as healthy leaves image. Total number of image samples present in the dataset is 3600 images of RGB. It contains healthy apple leave and diseased apple leaves such as scab, black rot and cedar. 4.2. Weather monitoring The collected data such as temperature (Dataset 1), soil moisture (Dataset 2) and nutrients (Dataset 3) are pre-processed using normalization and mean based missing value imputation to convert the raw data into meaningful data which is required for classification. GRU is utilized as a classifier for predicting weather condition. This proposed GRU classifier is compared with existing classifiers like Deep Neural Network (DNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The performance metrics used for comparison between proposed and existing classifiers are accuracy, precision, recall, error, specificity, F1_Score, NPV, FNR and FPR. AUC plot and ROC plot of the proposed approach is depicted in Fig. 8. To validate or show the effectiveness of a multi-class categorization problem, the AUC (Area Under the Curve) and ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curves are used. The degree or amount of separability is represented by AUC. In the proposed method, AUC plot is close to 1, so it has a high level of separability. The ROC curve is a probability curve that demonstrates how effective the model can discriminate across classes. Table 3 illustrates the comparison study between proposed and existing model.

Disease prediction Crop images (Dataset 4) acquired from sensor nodes are used to predict the presence of diseases and pests. The crop diseases dataset contains a total of 3995 images, in that 1987 images are disease affected and the remaining 2008 images are disease non-affected. Of these total images, 80 % are used for training and 20 % are used for testing. The acquired crop images are pre-processed using Adaptive Gaussian Filter and Dynamic Histogram Equalization. The pre-processed image is then fed into ReNet50 for feature extraction and classification. Fig. 14 shows the pre-processing steps involved in the disease prediction process. The acquired crop image is taken as input for this step. This image is initially fed into adaptive median filter for removing noise present in the input image. The dynamic histogram equalization is carried out to enhance the contrast of image. The pre-processed images are then fed into the ResNet50 classifier for classification purposes.

Field monitoring The agricultural area’s temperature is first checked using a temperature sensor. When abnormal conditions occur like a high temperature greater than or equal to 35 degree centigrade then the controller sends message to the owner using 19:19:19 to spray on the leaves of small crops for 15 min to protect the crop from sun's effect. Because of the sun's heat and high temperature crop growth decrease so to avoid it use that fertilizer. The temperature always monitored and displayed on LCD which is detected by temperature sensor. When detected high moisture in the soil it causes root rot in crops, then this system detects moisture conditions and sends that information to owner to protect crop from root rot using copper oxychloride 3gmsspltr use at root zone of plants. When a farmer wants to switch on motor manually by sending message from his mobile to system with a message as “#M ON*” and to switch off motor when he wants then send message as “#M OFF*”. Again he wants a change in auto mode he sends a message from his mobile to system as “#AUTO*”. When the system detects that disease affected on crops and sends that information to the owner to protect crop from diseases by spraying fertilizer named as a pyrethroid. The agrobot carries the sprinkler motor which sprays the pesticide. It is in ON state till it moves at the end of agricultural land. 5. Conclusion Automated weather forecasting and field monitoring using AI based deep learning approach is focused in this current research. Traditional farming results in unhealthy crops because of poor weather and soil condition, crops affected through diseases and pest. To overcome these issue automated weather forecasting and field monitoring is essential to support farmers to produce healthy crops with higher yield quantity. In this current research initially, sensors are assembled in an agricultural field to acquire data regarding agricultural factors and transmit it to cloud server for further analysis purposes. The assembled nodes capture information regarding the temperature, soil moisture, soil nutrient and capture images of plants and so. In first phase, the previous collected data for weather forecasting was pre-processed using normalization and mean based missing value imputation to convert the raw data into meaningful data. Pre-processed data was then fed into Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for forecasting the temperature and soil moisture content for upcoming years. In the second phase, the crop images acquired from sensors to predict the presence of disease are pre-processed using Adaptive Gaussian Filter for noise removal and Dynamic Histogram Equalization to improve the image's brightness. The pre-processed image was then fed to ResNet50 for feature extraction and classification. In the third phase, in case of any horrible weather conditions and soil conditions observed by these predicted data, remedial action will be automatically taken by the system. On the other hand, the information regarding the horrible conditions and in presence of pests and diseases, an alert message will be sent to farmers. Graphical representation proves that the proposed approach results are significantly better than those of existing approaches. Accuracy, precision, recall and specificity obtained for weather forecasting is 94 %, 94 %, 93 % and 93 %. Following that Accuracy, precision, recall and specificity reached for crop disease prediction is 98 %,98 %, 98 % and 98 %. Thus, the deep learning techniques used in proposed approach are the best choice for automated weather forecasting and field monitoring to support precision agriculture. In future, by utilizing AI and surveillance, the field area may be kept free of intruders. 6.

  Main Objective: To assess the influence of climate-smart agricultural practices (CSAPs) on labor (and other production factors’) demand and input substitution among smallholder rice farmers in Nigeria.
  Study Location: Nigeria
  Data Sources: Primary data collected in a cross-section survey, in which 1500 smallholder rice farmers were drawn by a multistage random sampling across farming communities, local government areas, and states in Nigeria.
  Technologies Used: A heterogeneous network of IoT sensors to collect real-time data on soil moisture (e.g., capacitive, tensiometric), temperature (e.g., thermocouples, thermistors), humidity (e.g., capacitive, resistive), and plant health (e.g., sap flow, leaf wetness)
  Key Findings: Most of the CSAPs are labor-intensive except for agroforestry. The use of organic manure and residue retention is significantly pesticide saving while zero/minimum tillage use is pesticide and fertilizer using.
  Extract 1: In terms of the effects of AP-CSAP use on factor cost share, most of the AP-CSAPs are labour-intensive with the exception of agroforestry that is labour neutral.
  Extract 2: The use of organic manure and residue retention is significantly pesticide saving while zero/minimum tillage use is pesticide and fertilizer using.
  Limitations: The study does not consider the long-term impacts of CSAP adoption on soil health and ecosystem services, which are important factors to consider for sustainable agricultural practices.
  Relevance Evaluation: Excellent - The context and reference clearly describes the objectives, methods, and results of the study. The provided information is highly relevant to understanding the study and its findings related to the use of climate-smart agricultural practices.
  Relevance Score: 1.0

  Explanation: The objective of this study is to analyze the relationship between the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices (CSAP) and resource allocation decisions made by rice farming households in Nigeria. The researchers are specifically interested in how CSAP use influences the demand for various inputs and the degree to which inputs can be substituted for one another in the production process. The study is motivated by the need to identify strategies for increasing agricultural productivity and adapting to climate change in a sustainable manner.

This study examines the influence of the agricultural practices with climate-smart agriculture potentials (AP-CSAPs) on labour (and other production factors’) demand and input substitution. The study was based on primary data collected in a cross-section survey, in which 1500 smallholder rice farmers were drawn by a multistage random sampling across farming communities, local government areas, and states in Nigeria. The econometric data analysis was within the framework of Zellner’s Seemingly Unrelated Regression method in estimating parameters of a set of factor share equations. The study found that labour and fertilizer could not be readily substituted in Nigeria; hence, an increase in the unit price of labour and fertilizer results in a higher share of labour and fertilizer in the budget. In terms of the effects of AP-CSAP use on factor cost share, most of the AP-CSAPs are labour-intensive with the exception of agroforestry. Similarly, the use of organic manure and residue retention is significantly pesticide saving while zero/minimum tillage use is pesticide and fertilizer using. Given that most AP-CSAPs require higher labour requirements, their success is often impeded by labour shortages. Some of the policies to promote AP-CSAPs include creating incentives in the form of higher wages and/or compensation to bring people back to agriculture. Accessibility and availability of key inputs such as improved crop variety and seed of green manure and/or cover crops, and leveraging on community-driven development approach to provide labour-saving equipment to rice farmers, may boost the adoption of labour-using AP-CSAPs in Nigeria.

This requires major transformations to increase the productive capacity and stability of smallholder agricultural production. Identifying the most appropriate technologies and practices to achieve this objective is critical as climate change poses a great threat to agricultural productivity, food security, and income of millions of people around the world (Gwambene 2011; Lobell et al. 2011). The impacts of climate change are felt by the people through an increasing number of dry seasons, rainfall seasons ending earlier than normal, poor distribution in rainfall within seasons, and change in temperature (Coulibaly et al. 2015; Aune 2012). The need to combat climate change and its devastating impacts (Sustainable Development Goal [SDG] 13) while simultaneously addressing the urgent need to achieve zero hunger (SDG 2) and promoting good health and well-being among others makes transforming Africa’s smallholder agriculture towards greater sustainability an urgent necessity. Across the African continent, the livelihood of smallholder farmers depends largely on subsistence agriculture with few alternative options. They are usually caught in low productivity traps where unsustainable agriculture and livestock-rearing practices deplete and degrade natural resources, which compromises ecosystem health and results in pervasive low agricultural yields. This vicious circle renders smallholder farmers extremely vulnerable to climate change, climate variability, and extreme weather events that further lead to a decline in agricultural productivity. This together with rapidly growing populations often drives an expansion and intensification of agricultural production on already degraded land. Expansion of cultivated areas, increasingly deeper tillage, and loss of vegetation cover owing to deforestation and overgrazing have led to accelerated loss of soil organic matter, which impairs the regulatory function of the ecosystem. In the process, large amounts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions such as CO2 and methane that contribute to climate change are released. In response to the growing food demand, the expansion of crop area as well as intensive use of pesticide and fertilizer have been the practice for several decades in Africa and this tends to proffer solutions in the short-term as productivity of most staples progressively increases (FAOSTAT 2022). Nevertheless, production growth has imposed stresses on soil and water resources, the yield has been declining drastically, and direct emissions from the agricultural sector account for 11% of global GHG emissions (OECD 2020). In Nigeria, smallholder agriculture accounts for over 80% of the food supply (Oyaniran 2020; Cervigni et al. 2013), about a quarter (24%) of the national gross domestic product (Statista 2023), and about a quarter of the nation’s greenhouse gases. In view of this, the Federal Government of Nigeria, with the support of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and other development partners, has been promoting a shift to climate-smart agriculture (CSA) as one of the key strategies in pursuit of SDGs and Nigeria’s intended Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) to GHG mitigation. By CSA, reference is made to an integrated approach to food production targeted at addressing the interlinked challenges of food security and climate change with the aim of sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and farm incomes, adapting and building resilience to climate change, and reducing agricultural GHG emission (FAO 2013; 2010; Lipper et al. 2014). CSA generally entails integrated adoption of a set of context-specific resilient production technologies or practices—herein referred to as agricultural practices with CSA potentials (AP-CSAPs)—that provide the possibility to produce more from the same area of land while conserving resources, reducing negative impacts on the environment, and enhancing natural capital and the flow of ecosystem (FAO 2016). These include zero/minimal tillage; mulching; crop rotation; cultivation of high-yielding, disease-resistant, and drought-tolerant varieties; agroforestry; legume intercropping; and integrated nutrient, water, pest, and weed management, with emphasis on minimal soil disturbance and reduced pesticide, energy, and resource use (Shittu et al. 2021; Khatri-Chhetri et al. 2017; McCarthy 2014; Branca et al. 2011). Evidence from the literature suggests that AP-CSAPs can lead to increased productivity and stability of agricultural production systems (Branca et al. 2013; Woodfine 2009). These practices are however generally labour-intensive; thus, this study seeks to answer the research questions—what will be the implications of using AP-CSAPs on labour demand and substitution for other inputs in view of rising labour scarcity and the need to reduce chemical dependence in Nigeria agriculture. Arising from the foregoing, this study builds on previous research done by Dalton et al. (1997), who found that there is a moderate substitutability between labour, biochemical inputs, and capital and that per-hectare yields rise roughly in proportion to a simultaneous increase in all inputs. Otunaiya et al. (2013), however, found that the demand for inorganic fertilizer was price inelastic, and that fertilizer was a technical substitute for planting materials and other intermediate inputs like insecticides and tractor services and a technical complement of labour and land in the production of food crops. This study, therefore, seeks to assess the influence of the AP-CSAPs on labour (and other production factors’) demand and input substitution, despite the increasing global emphasis on CSA as a pivotal strategy for achieving SDGs and NDCs related to GHG mitigation. There is a notable gap in the existing literature regarding how some of the conventional inputs can be substituted for AP-CSAPs in such a way that will bring about an increase in yield while simultaneously building resilience and adaptation to climate change with minimal harm to the environment. Addressing this research gap would entail conducting a comprehensive study that examines the intricate labour dynamics, input substitution patterns, and equity implications associated with the adoption of specific AP-CSAPs among smallholder rice farmers in Nigeria. The results show that the adoption of most AP-CSAPs except agroforestry are significantly labour-using, implying that AP-CSAPs increase smallholder rice farmers’ demand for an already too scarce labour. The findings could have significant policy implications for achieving the SDGs and NDC commitments in Nigeria, ultimately contributing to more informed and holistic decision-making in the realm of sustainable agricultural development. In the next section, we present a brief on CSA in Nigeria, the study methodology including the description of the study area, data collection and sampling, analytical techniques, and model specification. The fifth presents and discusses the results, while the final section presents the main conclusions and the policy implications. 2 Brief on climate-smart agriculture The vulnerability of African countries to climate change and its impacts have serious implications for livelihoods, poverty reduction, and meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Policies that will promote a transition to CSA to mitigate climate change while maintaining agricultural productivity are therefore crucial to meet the current and future challenges posed by climate change in Africa, Nigeria inclusive. CSA encompasses a combination of long-existing practices such as innovative farming practices and agricultural technologies that aim to address climate change adaptation, mitigation, and food security (Newell et al. 2019; Aryal et al. 2018). Some of the commonly used climate-smart agricultural practices (CSAPs) across the globe include conservation agriculture, organic manuring, composting, crop diversification, usage of wetland, drought-tolerant crops, disease-tolerant varieties, residue retention, crop rotation, zero/minimum tillage, green manuring, integrated crop management, agricultural water management, and agroforestry (Zhou et al. 2023; Kehinde et al. 2022; Shittu et al. 2018; Ojoko et al. 2017). Despite the potential benefits of CSA, the adoption rates for CSAPs remain generally low in many African countries, for example, the adoption of complete conservation agriculture systems (zero/minimum tillage, permanent soil cover, and crop rotation) stood at 2.5% in Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe (Orchardson 2019). Similarly, empirical evidence from the literature asserts that adoption of CSAPs is low in Nigeria, usually between 15.5 and 54.0% (Shittu et al. 2018; Kehinde et al. 2022) and much lower for some CSAPs like water harvesting (15%) and alternate wet and dry irrigation (10%) Onyeneke et al. 2018). The low adoption is linked to weak extension service delivery across various states in Nigeria, inadequate capital, high labour cost, lack of technical know-how, low potential for irrigation, and most importantly present markets that cannot accurately account for the value of the environmental benefits that CSA delivers (Onyeneke et al. 2021; Ahiale et al. 2020; Shittu et al. 2018). Among the factors that hinder CSA upscaling in Africa include heterogeneous farming systems, limited finance, high cost of agricultural inputs, and technology (Ogunyiola et al. 2022). In addition, Medugu et al. (2012) observed that the intricate challenge of rural out-migration facing Nigeria’s rural area—where labourers seek more lucrative opportunities in the informal sector—has significant implications for CSA adoption, particularly due to its labour-intensive nature. Recent findings from the study carried out by FAO and ICRISAT in 2019 have indicated that several CSA projects exist in the northern part of Nigeria to strengthen farmers’ resilience to climate change. Worthy of mention is the smart agricultural intervention and empowerment programs in Adamawa, Borno, and the Yobe States. Adesina and Loboguerrero (2021) noted that over 70% of the inhabitants of Borno State are into crop production, animal husbandry, and fishing due to Lake Chad’s presence. However, the shrinking of lakes, severe drought, degraded soil, inadequate infrastructure to support producers, and floods coupled with the State’s recent insecurity challenges have reduced agricultural productivity (FAO and ICRISAT 2019). Therefore, people now depend heavily on humanitarian assistance from international bodies such as the World Food Program. Some of the ongoing efforts that helped to facilitate CSA adoption and adaptation to changing landscapes in Borno State are the National Policy on Climate Change and Response Strategy and Agricultural Promotion Policy development. A typical practice of CSA in southern and northern Borno State is the adoption of terracing due to the rocky topography of the area. The farmers affirmed a higher yield of sorghum and maize on terraced farms (47% higher) when compared to non-terraced ones (FAO and ICRISAT 2019). In the same vein, Oyawole et al. (2019) found that the factors influencing the adoption of CSA practices in northern Nigeria include social capital, land ownership, gender, off-farm work participation, and plot distance from homestead. Similarly, Alhassan and Haruna (2024) found that agricultural extension programs and community social networks influenced rural farmers’ CSAP adoption in both Ethiopia and Nigeria, thus reinforcing the earlier findings of Oyawole et al. (2019). In a further research, Oyawole et al. (2020) affirmed that while the plots managed by women have a higher likelihood of adopting green manure and agroforestry, there are no significant gender differences in the adoption of organic manure and zero/minimum tillage. However, Fapojuwo et al. (2018) discovered that female farmers adopted agroforestry in derived savannah, guinea savannah, and rain forest, while the male farmers employed organic manure, zero tillage, and crop rotation in the same agro-ecological zones, respectively. In a comparative study between Nigeria and Ethiopia, Alhassan and Haruna (2024) highlighted the important role of income, farm size, and climate-related information for investing in CSAPs to curb food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa. They discovered that household income and plot size influence farmers’ adaptation options in promoting CSAPs in both Ethiopia and Nigeria. This is in agreement with the findings of Sang et al. (2024) who used the 2020 China Rural Revitalization Survey data and found that CSAP adoption intensity positively and significantly affects household income, net farm income, and income diversity. In terms of the relationship between CSA, yields, and food security, Paul Jr. et al. (2023) found that bundling the CSAPs might lead to greater yield and food security gains as against the independent use of CSAPs such as adopting climate-smart groundnut varieties, cereal-groundnut intercropping, and the use of organic fertilizers. Furthermore, Li et al. (2024) identified four factors—socio-demographic, institutional, resource endowment, and socio-economic factors—that influenced farmers’ decisions to adopt CSAPs. They found that most of these factors had either a positive or negative impact on the adoption of CSAPs. On the contrary, variables such as labour endowment, land tenure security, membership in farmers’ organizations, non-governmental organization support, and climate conditions, as well as access to extension services, agricultural training, and information, consistently and positively affect the adoption of CSAPs across the globe. The CSA story is however not different in the East Asia region where Vatsa et al. (2023) accessed the extent to which adoption of CSAPs can contribute to food security by improving crop yields among rice farmers across five Chinese provinces. The study focussed on the adoption of minimum tillage, improved rice varieties, farmyard manure, water-saving technology, and bio-pesticides and they found that intensifying the adoption of CSAPs improved rice yield by 1410 kg/ha. Additionally, the study highlighted that educated farmers, those who experienced a drought during the most recent growing season, and individuals who perceived the rainfall to have changed during the 5 years preceding the survey were more likely to intensify the adoption of CSAPs. Likewise, Zhou et al. (2023) considered 10 CSAPs—disease-tolerant banana varieties, banana diversification, crop rotation, intercropping, minimum tillage, crop residual turnover, soil testing, organic fertilizer, farmyard manure, crop-livestock systems—and assessed whether agricultural cooperatives can assist in promoting farmers’ adoption of CSAPs. They found that cooperative membership significantly increases the farmers’ adoption of banana diversification, crop residual turnover, and soil testing. Furthermore, Nwajiuba et al. (2015) examined the current state of CSA knowledge in Africa using Nigeria, Cameroon, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo as case studies. They found that CSA is yet to be an explicit government policy and there are no agricultural practices defined as CSA in the three African countries earlier mentioned. Conversely, some of the identified gaps in policy across the three countries include key stakeholders’ engagement in national CSA dialogue, low awareness about CSA, mainstreaming CSA into national agricultural development policy, capacity building and training of the extension workers, and actively engaging the youth and schools in CSA extension program strategies to widen dissemination and achieve more significant impact. In the same vein, Ogunyiola et al. (2022) identified additional policy insights needed for the upscaling of CSA practices and technologies in Africa as implementing stronger land tenure regulatory frameworks, approaching local knowledge by the development partners with care and respect, and implementing inclusive financial policies and institutional arrangements in consultation with smallholder farmers by government and development partners. In summary, the low adoption of CSAPs is still a serious issue in regions like West Africa, East Africa, and East Asia (Li et al. 2024; Zhou et al. 2023) coupled with barriers that hinder its upscaling across these regions. Though there are several empirical studies on CSAPs, there is a need to be intentional about the upscaling of CSAPs in Africa and the appropriateness of AP-CSAPs gaining prominence in the context of labour scarcity. Hence, there is an urgent need to explore how these practices influence labour demand and the broader production factors’ dynamics. 3 Analytical framework This study assumes that a farm household largely faces more effective markets (though not perfectly competitive) for other farm inputs like fertilizer and seed. Differences in transaction costs in different rural locations affect the return to individual smallholder farm households from the purchase of fertilizer from urban markets and the value of the product, which is normally sold at the farm level (Lopez 1986). For most smallholder farmers who operate in the imperfect market environments, their utility and profit-maximizing decisions are jointly determined, where the optimal production and consumption levels are determined within an integrated framework (Lopez 1986). But given the desired level of output that gives the maximum utility or profit level, these farmers (producers) would want to minimize their respective cost of production, notably costs of purchased inputs. Hence, producers will minimize their production cost, given their respective level of output. Therefore, let the production function (Eq. 1) of a farm be: $$Q=q(X, Z)$$ (1) where Q represents the household’s farm output, i.e., rice harvested in kg; \\(X\\) represents vectors of purchased input quantity (seed, labour, fertilizer, pesticide, and mechanization service) while \\(Z\\) is the vector of technological practices. The production function in Eq. 1 is assumed to be a concave function (twice differentiable where the first-order condition is positive and the second-order condition is negative). The cost of purchased input is given Eq. (2) as follows: $$C = PX$$ (2) where \\(P\\) represents the vector of input prices (which also reflects the differences in transaction costs for input at various locations). We assume that farmers minimize their cost of production subject to their respective level of output; as shown in Eq. 3: $$MinC = PX$$ (3) $$s.tQ = q(X, Z)$$ Setting up the Lagrange function: $$L = PX + \\lambda (Q-q(X, Z))$$ (4) Solving the first-order conditions and adding vectors of household fixed factors and other characteristics of the farm household give a vector of purchased factor input function of the form: $${X}^{*} = x(P, Q, Z)$$ (5) Substituting Eq. 5 into Eq. 2, the corresponding minimum cost function is derived as follows: $${C}^{*} = c(P, Q, Z)$$ (6) Christensen et al. (1973) derived factor cost share equations by transloging the cost function. The translog cost function is flexible and does not impose priori restrictions on scale economies and substitution of factors. The translog cost function is the most particularly useful function for estimating the factor demand functions. Rewriting Eq. 6 in natural logarithm, the cost function C* takes the form, $${lnC}^{*} = c(lnP, lnQ, Z)$$ (7) where \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), \\(and Z\\) are defined above. Following Binswanger (1974) and Bamiro and Shittu (2009), the translog cost function of smallholder rice production in the study area was specified as follows: $$\\begin{array}{c}ln\\;C={\\beta }_{0}+{\\beta }_{q}\\;ln\\;Q+\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{5}{\\beta }_{i}\\;{\\text{ln}}\\;{P}_{i}+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{5}\\sum \\limits_{j=1}^{5}{\\beta }_{ij}\\;{\\text{ln}}\\;{P}_{i}\\;{\\text{ln}}\\;{P}_{j}+\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{5}{\\beta }_{qi}\\;{\\text{ln}}\\;Q\\;{\\text{ln}}\\;{P}_{i}\\\\ \\text+\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{5}\\sum \\limits_{k=1}^{6}{\\beta }_{ik}{Z}_{k}\\;{\\text{ln}}\\;{P}_{i}+\\sum \\limits_{k=1}^{6}{\\beta }_{kq}{Z}_{k}\\;{\\text{ln}}\\;Q+\\varepsilon \\end{array}$$ (8) where \\(C\\) is the total cost of production (₦/ha), and \\({P}_{i}\\) or \\({P}_{j}\\) is the unit cost (price) of \\(i{\\text{th}}\\) or \\(j{\\text{th}}\\) input (\\(i, j =1, 2, \\dots , 5\\)) including seed (₦/kg), labour (₦/workday per person), inorganic fertilizer (₦/kg), inorganic pesticides (₦/litre), and mechanization service (₦/ha per ploughing operation) while \\(Q\\) denotes rice output (kg/ha). In addition, \\({Z}_{k}\\) is the technology-related dummy variable for use of the kth AP-CSAP including zero/minimum tillage, rotational cropping, green manuring, organic manuring, residue retention, and agroforestry. Each of the dummy variables takes on the value of one if used and zero if otherwise. On the other hand, \\({\\beta }_{s}\\) are vectors of parameters associated with various explanatory variables in the model, which are distinguished by the use of subscripts: \\(q\\) for output, \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) for input prices, and \\(k\\) for AP-CSAPs, and \\(\\varepsilon\\) is a stochastic error term. Neoclassical theory suggests the matrix of second-order terms implicitly in Eq. (8) is symmetric (\\({\\beta }_{ij} ={\\beta }_{ji}\\): note that \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) are similar). In addition, the cost function is homogeneous of degree one in input prices such that: $$\\begin{array}{cc}\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{5}{\\beta }_{i}=1\\mathrm{\\;and\\;}\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{5}{\\beta }_{ij}=\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{5}{\\beta }_{qi}=\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{5}{\\beta }_{ki}=0& \\mathrm{for\\;all\\;}i,\\;j\\end{array}$$ (9) As noted by Bamiro and Shittu (2009) as well as Binswanger (1974), imposing homogeneity of degree one in input prices on the translog cost function (Eq. 8) does not impose homogeneity of degree one on the underlying production function. In addition, almost no other constraints are imposed on the elasticity of factor demand or substitution derived from the translog cost function. Logarithmic differentiation of the cost function (Eq. 8) and the use of Shepard’s lemma yield the following cost share equations: $${S}_{i}={\\beta }_{i}+{\\beta }_{qi}{\\text{ln}}Q+\\sum \\limits_{j}^{5}{\\beta }_{ij}\\mathrm{ ln}{P}_{j}+\\sum \\limits_{k=1}^{6}{\\beta }_{ki}{Z}_{k}+{\\xi }_{i}$$ (10) where \\({S}_{i}\\) is the share of production costs associated with the \\(i{\\text{th}}\\) input (\\(i\\) = 1, 2, …, 5 for seed, labour, inorganic fertilizer, inorganic pesticides, and mechanization services, respectively). The cost shares for the purchased inputs are calculated as follows: $${S}_{i}=\\frac{{P}_{i}{X}_{i}}{\\sum {P}_{i}{X}_{i}}$$ Imposing homogeneity forces one of the input prices to be a numeraire price (Akridge and Hertel 1986). Hence, unit costs (prices) of mechanization services, labour, inorganic fertilizer, and inorganic pesticides (\\({P}_{2}-{P}_{5}\\)) were expressed in terms of the seed price (\\({P}_{1}\\)), and the share equation for seed (\\({S}_{1}\\)) dropped, yielding the following system of estimating equations. $${S}_{i}=\\frac{\\partial lnC}{\\partial ln{P}_{i}}={\\beta }_{i}+{\\beta }_{qi}lnQ+\\sum \\nolimits_{j=2}^{5}{\\beta }_{ij}{\\text{ln}}\\left({P}_{j}/{P}_{1}\\right)+\\sum \\nolimits_{k=1}^{6}{\\beta }_{ki}{Z}_{k}+{\\varepsilon }_{i} (i = 2, 3, \\dots , 5)$$ (11) The system of Eq. (11) was the final estimation equation adopted in this study. The parameters were estimated jointly using the iterative seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) procedure in STATA version 16. Parameters of the seed equation dropped in (11) were derived from the coefficients of the estimated cost shares equations using the symmetry and homogeneity restrictions in (9). The constant output own-price and cross-price elasticities of factor demand were estimated following Biswanger (1974), Johnston (1985), and Bamiro and Shittu (2009) as follows: $$\\eta_{ij}=\\frac{\\beta_{ij}+S_iS_j}{S_i}\\mathrm f\\mathrm o\\mathrm r\\;\\mathrm a\\mathrm l\\mathrm l\\;i,\\;j;\\;i\\;\\neq j$$ (12) $$\\eta_{ii}=\\frac{\\beta_{ii}+{Si}^2-Si}{Si}\\mathrm f\\mathrm o\\mathrm r\\;\\mathrm a\\mathrm l\\mathrm l\\;i$$ (13) where \\({\\eta }_{ii}\\) is the constant output own-price elasticity of demand for the \\(i{\\text{th}}\\) factor, \\({\\eta }_{ij}\\) is the constant output cross-price elasticity of demand for the \\(i{\\text{th}}\\) factor due to changes in the price of the \\(j{\\text{th}}\\) factor, and \\({\\beta }_{ij}\\) is the parameter of the \\(j{\\text{th}}\\) input price in the i cost share equation. Similarly, \\({\\beta }_{ii}\\) is the parameter of the \\(i{\\text{th}}\\) input price in its own cost share equation and \\({S}_{i}\\) and \\({S}_{j}\\) are respectively the shares of the \\(i{\\text{th}}\\) and \\(j{\\text{th}}\\) inputs in the production cost. The Morishima elasticities of input substitution were also computed, following Blackorby and Russel (1989) as well as Bamiro and Shittu (2009) as follows: $${\\delta }_{ij}^{M} = \\frac{{\\beta }_{ij}+{S}_{i}{S}_{j}}{{S}_{i}}-\\frac{{\\beta }_{ii}+{Si}^{2}-Si}{Si}$$ (14) where \\({\\delta }_{ij}^{M}\\) is the Morishima elasticity of substitution of factor i for j while \\({\\beta }_{ij}\\), \\({S}_{i}\\) and \\({S}_{j}\\) are as earlier defined. 4 Methodology 4.1 Study area The study was conducted in selected farming communities reputed for rice production across the six geopolitical zones, and covering five of the seven agro-ecological zones (AEZs) of Nigeria. Nigeria is situated in the West African sub-region and lies between longitudes 3 and 14 and latitudes 4 and 14. It has a landmass of 923,768 sq. km. Nigeria shares a land border with the Republic of Benin in the west, Chad and Cameroon in the east, and Niger in the north. Its coast lies on the Gulf of Guinea in the south and it borders Lake Chad to the northeast. Administratively, it is made of 36 States and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The States are commonly grouped into six (6) geopolitical zones: Northeast, Northwest, North-central, Southeast, Southwest, and South-south geopolitical zones. Nigeria is covered by three types of vegetation: forests (where there is significant tree cover), savannahs (insignificant tree cover, with grasses and flowers located between trees), and montane land, and is commonly divided into seven agro-ecological zones, namely the Sahel Savannah, the Sudan Savannah, and the Northern as well as Southern Guinea Savannahs. Other AEZs include the Derived Savannah, the Mid-Altitude, and the Humid Rainforests, all of which are suitable for the cultivation of maize and rice, among several other crops like cassava and yams. 4.2 The study design The study was part of the FUNAAB-RAAF-PASANAO project implemented by the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB), in partnership with the National Cereals Research Institute, Baddegi, and funded by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The central focus was on incentivizing the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices in cereal production in Nigeria. The data were collected in a Nationwide Farm Household Survey conducted across the six geopolitical zones in Nigeria, focusing on maize and rice farmers. The sub-set of the study data used in this study was from smallholder rice farmers in Nigeria. The respondents were selected in a three-stage sampling process, described as follows: Stage I: Purposive selection of 16 States that have been the leading rice producers in Nigeria (excluding conflict-prone areas), based on production statistics from [National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), 2016] Stage II: Purposive selection of three (3) Agricultural Blocks per State from the main rice-producing areas of the State and two (2) Extension Cells per block—that is, three (3) blocks per state, six (6) Cells per State, and 96 Cells in all Stage III: Proportionate stratified random selection of 16 Rice farmers from members of the Rice farmers’ association in each of the selected Cells This process yielded 1536 households of rice farmers but only 1500 households from which a complete dataset was collected through personal interviews of the farmer and other farming members of their households were used for the study. Data were collected on a wide range of issues, including the households’ socio-economics, climate-smart practices, production systems, production resource use, costs, and outputs on farmland cultivated during the 2016/17 farming season. 4.3 Descriptive statistics of the study variable The description of the study that influences the factor demand and input substitution among smallholder rice farmers in Nigeria was identified based on the review of related literature variables and the summary statistics of the variables are given in Table 1. As expected, labour took the highest (three-fifths) cost share followed by fertilizer and seed that took about one-seventh of the total cost share, respectively. It is important to note that herbicide and mechanization cost took the lowest share of the total budget for agricultural inputs used by the smallholder rice farmers. Table 1 Definition of study variables and their descriptive statistics Full size table Focusing on the AP-CSAP technologies used by the rice farmers in the study area (Table 1), specifically, a little above half of the respondents (55%) used minimum tillage on their rice farms while one-third of them practiced agroforestry (34%) and residue retention (33%) during the 2016/2017 production season. Worthy to note is the fact that organic manure has the least patronage, which was used by only 9% of the rice farmers in the target area. This may be due to the bulky nature of farmyard manure and/or animal dung coupled with the fact that large quantities required may not be readily available (Kehinde et al. 2023). With respect to socio-demographic characteristics, Table 1 shows that the average age of the rice farmers across the six geopolitical zones is 45 years. This implies that the majority of the respondents were still in their active years implying significant participation in the farming activities. This result is similar to the findings of Adeyonu et al. (2022) who found the mean age of rural households in Nigeria to be 48 years. Only 9% of the respondents were female indicating that the majority of the sampled rice farmers were male. The mean year of schooling is 8 years while those that had access to extension services and belong to farmers association or the other were 62% and 95%, respectively. The mean size of household landholdings was 2.21 ha portraying the respondents as smallholders. In the same vein, an average rice farmer reported the yield of 2.3 tonnes across the study area. This corroborates the findings of the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service (2023) which reported that the Nigeria rice yield in the 2016/2017 production season is 2.2 t/ha. 5 Result and discussions 5.1 Effect of input price on the factor cost share The results of the estimated system of factor share equations are summarized in Table 2. The results show that the coefficients \\({\\beta }_{ii}\\) (the coefficient between price and share of the same factors) are greater than zero, with the exception of that of pesticides and this satisfies the theoretical constraint on non-decreasing factor prices. This implies that the cost share of seed, labour, fertilizer, and mechanization increases with an increase in the price of the respective input. This might be because most of these inputs do not have a perfect substitute. However, the reverse is the case for pesticide, probably because the rice farmers have access to the other alternatives like farm labour (as against the use of herbicides) and indigenous ways to control birds and other major pests. Table 2 Estimated SUR factor share equations Full size table Concerning the effect of input prices on factor cost share in Table 2, the results show that a unit increase in the prices of labour per day and that of fertilizer per kg will significantly increase the labour cost share at 1% level while it reduces the mechanization cost share at 1% and 5% levels, respectively. An increase in the price of labour (wage rate) results in a higher share of labour in the budget because labour cannot be readily substituted in this part of the world. Likewise, if the price of fertilizer goes up, it will lead to a higher cost share of fertilizer because it cannot readily be substituted and the soil is heavily degraded; hence, the smallholder rice farmers are increasingly becoming agrochemical dependent. In addition, an increase in the unit price of mechanization service per hectare significantly reduces the labour cost shares at 5% level and increases significantly at 1% level the budget allocated to pesticides and mechanization service. This is logical, as an increase in the unit price of mechanization service will make farmers jettison the use of mechanization for some of the farm operations and employ more labour. On the other hand, the increase in mechanization prices has resulted in a higher budget share of pesticides and mechanization service, respectively. The coefficient of rice yield is significant at 5% level in the labour equation. The coefficient of rice in the labour share equation is negative (− 0.0263). Thus, the scale effect is labour-saving, which implies that as more rice is produced, the share of labour cost decreases. 5.2 Effect of AP-CSAPs on factor cost share Focusing on the labour share equation, the results show that coefficients of all the AP-CSAPs, except agroforestry, are positive and significant at 1%, 5%, or 10% levels. This shows that most AP-CSAPs are labour-using, except for agroforestry that is labour neutral. This implies that usage of minimum-tillage, crop rotation, organic manure use, green manure, and residue retention will increase the smallholder rice farmers’ demand for an already too scarce labour. Hence, a shift to AP-CSAPs will lead to a significant increase in labour demand by the smallholder rice farmers in Nigeria. Focusing on the fertilizer share equation, results in Table 2 show that the coefficient of minimum tillage was positive and significant at 1% level while those of other AP-CSAPs were fertilizer-neutral. This shows that while most AP-CSAPs use, except minimum tillage, are fertilizers saving, the effects are largely not significant. The results regarding the pesticide use, however, show that the coefficients of organic manuring and residue retention were negative and all significant at 1% level while those of minimum tillage and crop rotation were positive and significant at 1% level. These show that the use of organic manure and residue retention is significantly pesticide saving while zero/minimum tillage use is pesticide and fertilizer using. The results with respect to mechanization service further show that the coefficients of AP-CSAPs such as minimum tillage and organic manure are negative and significant 1% levels. This shows that the use of those AP-CSAPs is mechanization service saving. In other words, the cost shares of mechanization service decrease with the use of minimum tillage and organic manure. Other estimates in Table 2 also show that the use of most AP-CSAPs is seed-saving. 5.3 Elasticities of factor demand and input substitution The estimated own-price and cross-price elasticities of factor demand as well as elasticities of input substitution-based SUR results in Table 2 are summarized in Table 3 and 4, respectively. The results of the elasticities of factor demand are reported in Table 3. All the own price elasticities of factor demand have expected signs. Seed, labour, fertilizer, and mechanization are all negatives and less than one, implying that the demand for these resources decreases with an increase in their respective prices but inelastic. This result is consistent with the law of demand, which states that ceteris paribus, the quantity demanded of a commodity is inversely proportional to the price of the commodity. Whereas the own price elasticity of pesticide is negative but elastic, this implies that the demand for pesticide will greatly rise more than the price changes by a larger proportion with an increase in its prices. Table 3 Own price and cross-price elasticities of factor demand Full size table Table 4 Morishima elasticity of factor substitution Full size table The elasticity of demand for labour is relatively low; this suggests that the demand for agricultural labour is highly inelastic. Labour can therefore be regarded as a necessity because changes (increase or decrease) in the price of this input have a negligible effect on the quantity demanded. It is important to note that other inputs such as fertilizer and mechanization have a relatively lower price elasticity of demand than that of seed (Table 3). This suggests that the demand for seed is relatively more elastic than that of fertilizer and mechanization. This is in line with the findings of Otunaiya et al. (2013) who found that all other inputs, except planting material, have a relatively lower price elasticity of demand than that of inorganic fertilizer. 5.4 The cross-price elasticity of demand for factors The off-diagonal elements of the estimates in Table 3 are the cross-price elasticity of demand for various factors. They measure the degree of responsiveness of the demand for a factor (say labour), to a percentage increase in the price of another factor (say seed). Positive cross-price elasticity of demand means that the factors are substitutes while negative cross-price elasticity of demand implies that the inputs are complements. The results suggest that seed is a technical substitute for pesticides and mechanization while it is a technical complement for labour and fertilizer in smallholder rice production. Likewise, labour was found to be a technical substitute for fertilizer and pesticides, thus indicating that farmers tend to replace costly fertilizer and pesticides with labour. Reference can be made to labour-fertilizer and labour-pesticide substitutability in terms of bigger family size that implies more cheap labour while resources for purchasing fertilizer are reallocated to family labour. However, labour is complementary to the price of mechanization service and seed, indicating that the greater the households’ mechanize some of the farm operations and plant more seeds, the more likely it will translate to higher employment in the farm activity. Pesticide was found to be a technical substitute for seed and labour and technical complement for fertilizer and mechanization service. This implies that as the price of pesticide and mechanization services increase, less pesticide and mechanization services are demanded and more of seeds are demanded and utilized. Similarly, as the price of inorganic fertilizer and pesticides increase, the demand for inorganic fertilizer and pesticide declines and more labour is demanded and utilized. On the other hand, the complementarities of seed-labour pair and seed-fertilizer pair imply that an increase in the price of seed will reduce demand for seed and result in a consequential decrease in demand for labour and fertilizer. This result corroborates that of Mensah-Bonsu (2010) who found that the cross-price elasticity between seed and hired labour was negative, hence suggesting complementarity between the two inputs. In the same vein, the complementarities of the mechanization service-labour pair and mechanization-pesticide pair imply that an increase in the price of mechanization service will reduce the demand for mechanization service and therefore a consequential decrease in demand for labour and pesticide. These results are further confirmed by the Morishima elasticities of input substitution in Table 4. The elasticity of the factor of substitution reflects the relative importance (change) of a factor while the cross-price elasticities do not. In other words, the elasticity of input substitution measures the ease of substitution with which the inputs can be substituted for the other. Ease of substitution between factors of production improves with an increase in the value of elasticity of substitution (\\(\\delta\\)). The results in Table 4 show that fertilizer has a high degree of substitutability (2.1348) for seed. Conversely, seed has very low substitutability (− 0.4732) for labour. This result is expected because sufficient quantity and good quality seed reduce crop failure. Table 4 further shows that labour has a large substitution possibility (1.5067) for pesticides as well as fertilizer (1.2060). Similarly, seed has a fairly high degree of substitutability for pesticides (1.352) and mechanization service (2.9907), respectively. This implies that if there is a relative rise in the price of pesticide and fertilizer, it would result in a higher demand for seed and labour. An increase in the price of fertilizer and pesticide would increase the intensity of the use of labour and improved crop variety. 6 Conclusion and policy implications 6.1 Conclusions This study used household survey data of smallholder rice farmers to assess the influence of the AP-CSAPs on labour (and other production factors’) demand and input substitution in Nigeria. The descriptive result shows that about 55% of the respondents used minimum tillage on their rice farms while one-third of them practiced agroforestry (34%) and residue retention (33%) during the 2016/2017 production season. In terms of cost share, labour took about 60% of the total cost share followed by fertilizer and seed that took about one-seventh of the total cost share, respectively. The SUR result shows that labour and fertilizer cannot be readily substituted in Nigeria; hence, an increase in the unit price of labour (wage rate) and fertilizer results in a higher share of labour and fertilizer in the budget. On the contrary, an increase in the unit price of mechanization service per hectare reduces significantly the share of labour cost and increases significantly the budget share allocated to pesticides and mechanization service. In terms of the effects of AP-CSAP use on factor cost share, most of the AP-CSAPs are labour-intensive with the exception of agroforestry that is labour neutral. The use of organic manure and residue retention is significantly pesticide saving while zero/minimum tillage use is pesticide and fertilizer using. Demand for most of the production factors, except pesticide, was also found to be price inelastic, suggesting that policies aimed at taxing agrochemical use may not cause a substantial reduction in chemical dependence in Nigeria’s smallholder agriculture, even though it may significantly reduce pesticide use. 6.2 Policy implications Arising from the foregoing, promoting the use of AP-CSAPs such as minimum tillage, green and organic manure, residue retention, and crop rotation will create more demand for labour, which is very important for employment creation. However, it is a serious challenge due to rising labour scarcity with rural–urban migration posing a serious threat; the supplementary thing might be to create incentives in the form of higher wages or compensation to bring people back to agriculture. In addition, intervention via the input market such as improved crop variety, seed of green manure and/or cover crops, and agricultural extension services can be made readily available to farmers by the government agencies, relevant private institutions, and development partners advocating for the adoption of AP-CSAPs. Given that most AP-CSAPs require higher labour requirements, their success is often impeded by labour shortages. The development partners, NGOs, and other relevant stakeholders can leverage on the community-driven development approach to provide the smallholder farmers with the platform for machine-sharing where necessary equipment such as jab planter and self-propelled rice transplanter among others are provided and managed at the community level. This may boost the adoption of labour-using AP-CSAPs in Nigeria. In an attempt to promote a shift to climate-smart agriculture and contribute to sustainable ecosystem management in Nigeria, both moral suasion and Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) approaches can be adopted to promote positive change and foster a sense of stewardship among local communities. Moral suasion entails persuading, appealing, and encouraging farmers/landowners/communities to voluntarily adopt ethical and responsible practices that promote the well-being of the environment without relying on financial incentives. Some of the key components of this approach include creating awareness about the importance of environmental conservation and sustainable agricultural practices, educating the farmers/landowners/communities about the consequences of unsustainable farming practices, and appealing to their sense of responsibility and morality. An example is the use of moral suasion by conservation organizations and government agencies in Nigeria to encourage the local communities to protect endangered species like the Cross River Gorilla. Similarly, conservation of iconic wildlife species like Elephants, Rhinoceros, and Lions in Kenya relies solely on moral suasion. Consequently, Kenya’s wildlife conservation has successfully reduced poaching, established wildlife reserves, and promoted ecotourism through ethical persuasion and cultural values. Payment for ecosystem services on the other hand involves compensating farmers/landowners/communities for actions that enhance ecosystem service like carbon sequestration and biodiversity protection. A specific example is the collaboration of Nigerian Erosion and Watershed Management Project with local communities to restore degraded landscapes, prevent erosion, and improve water quality where farmers were paid for adopting sustainable land management practices like reforestation and agroforestry that contribute to soil conservation and water regulation. Thus, in addition to creating incentives in the form of higher wages to bring people back to agriculture and leveraging on community-driven development approach to provide labour-saving equipment to rice farmers, integrating moral suasion with PES will enhance the adoption of AP-CSAPs. There is therefore no doubt that combining PES with moral suasion can create a more holistic and effective approach to sustainable ecosystem management and environmental conservation in Nigeria, and Africa at large. In conclusion, integrating PES with moral suasion recognizes both economic and intrinsic motivations that foster behavioural change, promote social norms, and deepen community engagement as well as ensuring commitment to sustainable agricultural practices in the long run.

A key enabler for this monitoring is a device that can be noninvasively attached to plants and transduce their physiological status into digital data.

SIGN UP FOR THE SCIENCEADVISER NEWSLETTER The latest news, commentary, and research, free to your inbox daily SIGN UP INTRODUCTION Crop production remains a salient global issue with 828 million people worldwide experiencing hunger (1, 2). Advanced high-throughput phenotyping techniques have revolutionized breeding efforts by swiftly collecting comprehensive phenotypic data from plant populations (3, 4). It allows for more effective and informed plant breeding decisions, thereby facilitating the rapid development of improved plant varieties (5–7). Existing methods for capturing phenotypic traits predominantly rely on imaging technologies (8), robotics (9), and drones (10). However, these approaches have substantial limitations in terms of providing customized, continuous, and high spatiotemporal resolution monitoring (11). In addition, the currently used devices that are mounted on plants are often rigid, heavy, and opaque, exhibiting mechanical and optical mismatch with plants (12–14). This discordance can lead to inaccuracies in measurement and potential harm to plants. Therefore, nondestructive, continuous, and long-term acquisition of phenotypic data are urgently needed for monitoring multiple traits for crop breeding. The recent efforts toward plant sensor development have aimed to meet this need and to address the mechanical mismatch issues. Advances in human wearable electronics (15–23) have prompted botanical applications (24, 25), enabling the monitoring of plant conditions through the capture of physical signals like growth, surface temperature, and humidity (26–30), chemical signals like volatile organic compounds and hormones (31, 32), as well as biopotential signals (33–35). The mechanical adhesion is achieved progressively, from using an adhesive tape on leaves (36), conformal wrapping of flexible sensors around stems (37), direct inkjet writing/printing (38, 39), and vapor polymer printing (40, 41) on leaves, to the recent employment of epidermal electronics that can be seamlessly and directly attached to leaves (42, 43). Despite these advancements, the existing plant epidermal electronics still present limitations in effective monitoring of dynamic plant growth over time due to limited stretchability and softness. Furthermore, an aspect that has often been overlooked is the consideration of optical transparency, which is a critical factor for developing sensors for plants with photosynthetic activities. Organic materials that can be made flexible and transparent are promising candidates for developing plant sensors. Meanwhile, organic materials also stand out for their low-cost, biodegradability, and biocompatibility, which are essential for not only plants but also sustainable world. The commercially available poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is one intrinsically flexible and transparent organic material, thus can serve the flexibility and optical transparency purpose with their good electrical conductance. However, it has been challenging to develop all-organic epidermal sensors due to the difficulties in micropatterning the flexible, conductive organic material on another thin soft polymer substrate (44–47). Here, we report an all-organic plant epidermal sensor, namely, plant e-skin, that is both mechanically and optically invisible for non-invasive plant physiology monitoring. The plant e-skin is realized by developing a scalable microfabrication process to enable the micropatterning of transparent PEDOT:PSS on a stretchable, transparent polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate (Fig. 1A). The successful development of this process marks a minimum feature size of 2-μm PEDOT:PSS pattern on a stretchable elastomer, paving the way for the development of high-density transparent epidermal sensors, displays, and other functional devices. With the transparent, ultrathin, and stretchable nature, the plant e-skin can be configured into strain and temperature sensors with tailored micropatterns, allowing continuous and real-time monitoring of plant growth and surface temperature when attached to leaf epidermis. Experimental tests of the strain sensors attached on the juvenile leaves of live Brassica rapa revealed distinct diurnal growth patterns with minimal growth during the day and predominant growth at night, as well as varying growth rates under different abiotic stress conditions. Application of the temperature sensor also captured surface temperature dynamics of the corresponding conditions, which would facilitate the timely intervention of heat stress. Toward broader practical impact, a virtual digital-twin plant is developed, allowing real-time visualization and analysis of leaf surface temperature (Fig. 1B). We envision that construction of the virtual digital-twin plant interface, aided by the plant e-skin, paves the way for efficient monitoring of plants and expedited decision-making in crop breeding as well as precision farming.

(I) A comparison diagram of the developed plant e-skin with the reported plant sensors from five aspects, including transparent, epidermal, stretchable, micropatterned, and biocompatible characteristics. RESULTS Fabrication and characteristics of the plant e-skin To monitor plant physiological status in a noninvasive manner, biocompatibility, transparency, stretchability, and conformability are desired simultaneously. A scalable microfabrication process is developed to manufacture all-organic plant e-skins that meets all these requirements based on simple lithography and lift-off process (Fig. 1A). Detailed fabrication process can be found in fig. S1 and Materials and Methods. Table S1 is provided to illustrate the scalability of PEDOT:PSS-based transparent e-skin in previous literatures. The all-organic plant e-skin is essentially a micropatterned PEDOT:PSS conductive component on one PDMS layer and encapsulated by another layer of PDMS. PEDOT:PSS was chosen as the conductive component because of its exceptional transparency and conductivity. Its biocompatibility further extends its applications to biomedical engineering field. Specifically in relation to plants, the transparency and biocompatibility of PEDOT:PSS align well with the requirements of developing plant e-skins that can be attached to the plants without any observable adverse effects to plant health. While achieving a well-defined pattern of PEDOT:PSS on the stretchable elastomeric substrate poses a considerable technological challenge, we have succeeded to demonstrate the ability to create PEDOT:PSS patterns on PDMS substrate with the feature sizes ranging from 100 μm all the way down to 2 μm, as illustrated in Fig. 1C. Besides, the versatility of the proposed fabrication process is demonstrated by creating intricate patterns of PEDOT:PSS, such as the university logo with a lion (Fig. 1D) and alphabets (Fig. 1E), despite their complicated structures and varying resolutions. Figure 1F demonstrates the remarkable transparency of the as-fabricated e-skin, exhibiting transmittance exceeding 85% within the wavelength range of 400 to 700 nm, which aligns perfectly with that required for plant photosynthesis. The inserted image exemplifies the plant e-skin’s outstanding transparency, allowing for a clear view of the outside scene when affixed to a clean glass. The plant e-skin has a thickness of only 4.5 μm (fig. S5), consisting of a layer of PEDOT:PSS sandwiched between the PDMS substrate and encapsulation layer where the thickness of PEDOT:PSS thin film is 120 nm (fig. S6A). The dependence of transparency and conductivity on different PEDOT:PSS thickness are presented in fig. S6 (B and C, respectively). Owing to the high transparency together with the ultrathin thickness, our plant e-skin offers a superior advantage by enabling seamless attachment to a wide range of plant leaves. As shown in fig. S7, we successfully attached the plant e-skin to a B. rapa leaf. The midrib and vein of this leaf remain clearly visible through the attached sensor, affirming its excellent transparency and conformability. Moreover, the plant e-skin can be applied to different kinds of leaves with varying surface roughness, including (i) sweet potato, (ii) Zamioculcas zamiifolia, (iii) Peperomia argyreia, and (iv) Coleus scutellarioides (Fig. 1G). The plant e-skins demonstrate durability, where secure attachment is maintained even when the leaves undergo wilting (Fig. 1H and fig. S8). The shear adhesion forces between our e-skin and leaves are characterized in fig. S9, which all exceed 0.2 N with varying leaves, or under various scenarios including wilting, fast water flow, and immersion in water. A detailed discussion on adhesion force is provided in the Supplementary Materials. Therefore, our all-organic plant e-skin has superior characteristics in transparency, stretchability, biocompatibility, and conformability. Furthermore, micropatterning PEDOT:PSS on the PDMS provides great insights to the plant e-skin for applications with denser integrations. Figure 1I compares our plant e-skin with the state-of-the-art plant electronics, showing that our plant e-skin is the first of its kind to fulfill all the necessary requirements for effective and noninvasive monitoring of plants. Figure 2 shows the morphology and performance characterization of our plant e-skin patterned into strain sensor and temperature sensor. Regarding the strain sensor, we mixed the base sensing material PEDOT:PSS with 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 5% d-sorbitol as they are the commonly used additives to improve conductivity and stretchability of PEDOT:PSS. As shown in fig. S10, the sheet resistance is improved by two orders of magnitude after the addition of DMSO and d-sorbitol. The additive-processed PEDOT:PSS is defined as p-PEDOT:PSS. The p-PEDOT:PSS film is then sandwiched by a top and bottom PDMS thin film to further enhance its stretchability and stability. Figure 2A exhibits the schematic drawing of the strain sensor. The sensing part is formed by a zig-zag structure where four narrow PEDOT:PSS line resistors are connected in series. It is designed according to the common design guideline of strain gauges (48–51). Three images in Fig. 2B display the zoomed-in structure of the strain sensor, showing the accurate definition of PEDOT:PSS pattern. A typical relative resistance change-strain response of the strain sensor is shown in Fig. 2C. We have characterized the performance of the strain sensor from initial length to a strain of 100%. The resistance change is calculated as ∆ R / R 0 = ( R − R 0 ) / R 0 (1) where R0 is the initial resistance of the strain sensor and R is the real-time resistance under strain. It is observed that the values of resistance change increased with increasing strain level. Sensitivity of the strain sensor can be defined as ε Gauge factor ( GF ) = ∆ R / ( R 0 · ε ) (2) where ε is the applied strain. When the strain is lower than 60%, GF = 1.15 and it reaches 4.13 when the applied strain is higher than 60%. The observed increase in resistance under tensile strain is predominantly attributed to geometric alterations at small strain levels and the development of cracks in the PEDOT:PSS film at higher strain levels (52–54). A comprehensive elucidation of the strain sensing mechanism, accompanied by scanning electron microscopy images showcasing the phenomenon of crack propagation, is presented in text S1, along with fig. S2. When the e-skin strain sensor was held at specific strains for a period of time, the relative resistance changes remained stable without distinct drifts, affirming the stability of the sensing signals (Fig. 2D). To further verify the long-term stability of the e-skin strain sensor, we recorded its resistance for approximately 6 days as shown in Fig. 2E. The results demonstrate minimal fluctuations in resistance throughout the entire duration, confirming its effectiveness for prolonged monitoring of plant leaves. Fig. 2.

(H) Relative resistance change and temperature response of the temperature sensor. In addition to functioning as a strain sensor, our plant e-skin offers the convenience of easily transforming into a temperature sensor by modifying the device morphology and leveraging the thermoresistive effect in PEDOT:PSS. Prior investigations have affirmed that the conductivity characteristics of PEDOT:PSS thin films align with the variable range hopping model, demonstrating a discernible decrease in resistivity as temperature increases (55–57). A comprehensive elucidation of its temperature-dependent conductivity is provided in text S2. This e-skin temperature sensor is developed based on the pure PEDOT:PSS as the sensing layer and PDMS as the substrate and encapsulation layers as well. As shown in Fig. 2 (F and G), the sensing part of the temperature sensor is patterned into a meander shape to minimize the fluctuations caused by strain (15, 58). The performance of our temperature sensor is characterized by measuring the relative resistance change across a temperature range of 24° to 39°C. A negative linear relationship between relative resistance change and temperature is observed (Fig. 2H). This is attributed to the enhanced charge transport within the PEDOT:PSS percolation network at higher temperature, and the insulting PSS chains being more extended and aligned to facilitate stronger intermolecular interactions between conductive PEDOT particles. Temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) is used to quantify the performance of our temperature sensor, which is defined as TCR = ( R − R 0 ) / R 0 ( T − T 0 ) (3) where R is the resistance under temperature T, and R0 is the resistance under temperature T0. As revealed from the slope in Fig. 2H, the TCR of our temperature sensor is approximately 0.5%/°C. On-leaf biocompatibility test and monitoring Biocompatibility is a critical prerequisite for plant sensors, particularly those designed to establish intimate contact with biological tissues. To assess the application potential of our plant e-skin for nondisruptive plant monitoring, we conducted extended on-plant monitoring tests. First, we examined their biocompatibility by attaching them to the leaves of Epipremnum aureum as shown in Fig. 3A. Throughout the 65-day experiment, no signs of leaf yellowing or withering were observed. Notably, not only did the three original small roots exhibit elongation but also new roots and leaves emerged (indicated by the yellow arrows). In addition, we conducted similar investigation in two other pots, each initially containing one or two leaves, as photographed in fig. S11. Both pots exhibited the development of new roots and leaves during the monitoring period. The observed growth of plants in all the pots strongly suggests that the plant e-skin used in the experiment displayed biocompatibility, with no adverse effects on plant rooting, sprouting, or overall growth. Photosynthesis is crucial for plants as it is the process through which they convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into energy-rich sugars, providing the foundation for their growth, metabolism, and overall physiological functions. Despite the extensive efforts devoted to plant sensors with various functions, the potential long-term effects of on-leaf attachments on photosynthesis have received limited attention. Carbon-based flexible materials, though commonly used in flexible electronics and wearable sensors, may not be ideal candidates for plant sensors because of their inadequate optical transmittance in the visible light range. To demonstrate the necessity of visible optical transmittance for nondisruptive on-leaf monitoring, we attached the plant e-skin and a carbon-based black film on one leaf of B. rapa (oilseed sarson) for 14 days. After removing the two films, the region covered by the plant e-skin showed no obvious change, while the one underneath the black film exhibited discoloration, indicating the reduction of chlorophyll content in the applied area (fig. S12). This suggests that device blocking light transmission can significantly affect the biological composition of the monitored leaves, potentially causing damage to the overall plant health over extended monitoring periods. On top of light absorption, carbon dioxide absorption and oxygen release are also important aspects in photosynthesis. Stomata, which are the pores for gas exchange, are primarily distributed on the abaxial (bottom) side of leaves in dicotyledonous plant species (59). Optical images of stomatal distribution on both adaxial (top) and abaxial (bottom) surfaces of different kinds of leaves verify this phenomenon in fig. S13. Because our e-skin is attached on the top side of the leaves with few stomata, it would not impede normal gas exchange in photosynthesis. Meanwhile, both PEDOT:PSS film and PDMS are reported to be gas and vapor permeable (60–66). Thus, our e-skin shows negligible impact during photosynthesis. Besides, we also attached the plant e-skin and two adhesive tapes on the B. rapa leaf. The adhesive tapes are often used in many plant sensors to help adhesion on the leaves. We observed that the plant e-skin could be removed successfully without destroying the leaf. In contrast, the removal of the two adhesive tapes resulted in the detrimental rupture of the leaves (fig. S14). Thus, our plant e-skin exhibits mechanical invisibility to plants with noninvasive monitoring capability both during and after tests. Considering the need for frequent watering in plants, we conducted additional investigations to assess the waterproof capability of the plant e-skin, as shown in fig. S15 and movie S1. The results demonstrate that the plant e-skin maintains strong adhesion to the leaf surface even when substantial amount of water was poured over it. Fig. 3.

(E) Performance of the temperature sensor to monitor the surface temperature of the B. rapa leaf during a 3-day period (first day: light on; the following 2 days: light on/off, 16 hours/8 hours). After confirming the biocompatibility and operation in a noninvasive manner, the strain sensor and temperature sensor were applied to monitor the growth and temperature of the leaves. Monitoring the growth of leaves, especially in leafy vegetables like Brassica, poses distinct challenges compared to tracking the expansion of fruits or detecting elongation in larger crop stems. The fragility and small size of leaves make it difficult to monitor their growth. Although nondestructive imaging has been widely used, tracking the growth of a single leaf typically requires mechanical fixation to keep it within the camera’s focal plane. However, this fixation method unavoidably restricts the plant’s regular physiological processes, potentially affecting its overall development. Our plant e-skin strain sensor that is specifically designed to cater to the unique demands of monitoring the growth of delicate and petite leaves should be able to record the elongation of the leaves while ensuring minimal disruption to the plant natural processes. As photographed in Fig. 3B, the strain sensor was uniformly attached to the juvenile leaf of a B. rapa to monitor its growth. The experimental growth chamber was maintained at a photoperiod of 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness. Figure 3C depicts the recorded relative resistance change of the strain sensor during a 3-day period, where the increase of the relative resistance change reveals the extension of the monitored leaves, i.e., growth. Leaf growth exhibited noncontinuous patterns, aligning with known growth behaviors where plants use stored energy to grow and elongate during nighttime while absorbing light for photosynthesis during the day (67–69). The growth condition of the leaf was estimated by quantifying the total relative resistance change. It indicated that the region of the leaf covered by the plant e-skin grew to 1.5 times its original length over the course of 3 days. Notably, because the stretching of strain sensor will exert a reactive force on the plant, we further investigated the influence of this force on plant growth and it turns out that such force does not hinder overall plant growth (fig. S16). The successful monitoring of this growth pattern of the leaf again reflects the secure attachment of the e-skin sensor to the leaf and the reliable performance of the strain sensor. Simultaneously, the e-skin temperature sensor was also attached to the leaf surface to monitor its temperature, as displayed in Fig. 3D. The B. rapa was cultivated within a temperature-controlled growth chamber, which was maintained at a constant temperature of 26°C. On the first day, the light was continuously switched on, while during the following 2 days, the light was set in a photoperiod regimen consisting of 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness. The measured temperature data, as depicted in Fig. 3E, show that the temperature remained at stable 26°C when the light was constantly on. However, the temperature dropped significantly to a lower temperature of 19°C when light was switched off. Despite the chamber being regulated to a constant temperature, there were temperature variations on the surface of the plants. This phenomenon can be attributed to the heat emitted by the light when it is turned on, while no heat emission occurs during darkness. The temperature recording capability of the sensor, attached to the leaf surface, is thus confirmed. The distinctive role that this epidermal temperature sensor can fulfill is not achievable by commercially available temperature sensors, which lack the capability to monitor surface temperatures at a local scale. Consequently, this temperature sensor holds immense potential for acquiring the temperature on the leaf surface, thereby mitigating heat stress in leaves caused by excessive exposure to heat. It should be highly beneficial for precise cultivation of crops with high economic values. Growth and surface temperature monitoring of B. rapa under abiotic stress To demonstrate the practicality of our plant e-skin across distinct growing environment, we deployed the e-skin strain and temperature sensors on vegetative leaves of B. rapa, under both optimal environmental condition and abiotic stress condition, and monitored their respective growth metrics. Our investigation was centered on observing the growth patterns of plants in the presence of specific abiotic stressors, like combined heat and drought, which simulate real-world plant stressors typically encountered in farming environments. As schematically delineated in Fig. 4 (A and B), the ideal growth conditions for B. rapa were ensured by providing suitable temperature (26°C light/23°C dark) and sufficient water, whereas a separate group of plants was subjected to combined heat and drought stress by disrupting water supply and raising temperatures to 8°C above control conditions (34°C light/31°C dark). Figure 4C illustrates the diurnal variation in surface temperature of leaves in the control group, which fluctuated between 26° and 22°C. In contrast, the leaf surface temperature for the group under abiotic stress, as illustrated in Fig. 4D, was recorded with fluctuations in higher temperatures of approximately 34°C during the day and 30°C at night. These observed temperature patterns align well with the preset parameters for both scenarios, thereby affirming temperature sensing capabilities of the newly developed epidermal sensors. Notably, the small variations between epidermal sensors and chamber’s temperature setting could be attributed to the uniformity of the temperature in the chambers. Strain sensors were attached to three juvenile leaves in both the control group (labeled as A, B, and C) and the abiotic stress group (labeled as a, b, and c). Figure 4E presents the growth patterns of the leaves in the control group, demonstrating that all three leaves exhibited discernible growth, as indicated by the increasing relative resistance changes. This growth was more pronounced during the night, followed by a plateau phase during the day, sharing a similar growth rhythm as mentioned before. However, the results depicted in Fig. 4F indicate that the group subjected to abiotic stress did not exhibit any significant change in resistance, implying a disruption in growth. Figure 4 (G and H) illustrates the calculated relative resistance change of the applied strain sensors in the control group and the abiotic stress group, respectively. In the control group, the relative resistance change corresponds to approximately 30, 35, and 55% growth strain for the three leaves, while the abiotic stress group recorded mere 5.5% strain across all three leaves. It is anticipated that the growth rates of the leaves exhibit variations across plants and leaves, accounting for different strain levels recorded for the three leaves in the control group. Nonetheless, under the impact of abiotic stress, the detrimental impact pervasively inhibited the growth across all the leaves. These results validate a pragmatic strategy to monitor the leaves if they are under certain abiotic stress in smart farming. The developed temperature sensors can record leaf surface temperatures, and the strain sensors can relay comprehensive information on plant growth status. The integration of both sensor types offers real-time data to agricultural practitioners, enabling prompt intervention to avert suboptimal plant growth. Furthermore, the developed sensors equip plant researchers with a more efficient, noninvasive approach to identify heat-resistant plant varieties and establish optimal growth temperatures. The pragmatic applications underscore considerable potential of our innovative sensors in both plant research and the broader context of smart agriculture. Fig. 4.

Digital-twin plant in smart farming A digital-twin communication system has been developed as a smart farmer-farm interface to enrich the visualization of the plants’ status. Figure 5A depicts the information flow of the sensing signals. The described system, diagrammatically represented in Fig. 5A, uses sensors positioned on plant surfaces to record leaf surface temperatures. The collected data undergo conditioning by an electrical circuit, followed by processing and analog-digital conversion via an Arduino board. The generated digital output governs the behavior of a digital-twin plant in the virtual reality (VR) environment as displayed on the personal computer (PC), thereby allowing the leaf surface temperature in physical space to be mirrored by the color of the digital-twin leaf in the VR space. Figure 5B vividly demonstrates the instantaneous transference of real-space plant surface temperature to the VR counterpart. The objective is to simulate localized overheating scenario in precision agriculture, where the whole farming environment maintains a constant overall temperature. In this demonstration, four transparent e-skin temperature sensors are independently attached to four separate plants and connected to the communication system. The side view provides a clear identification of each plant’s location, denoted as ①, ②, ③, and ④. On the computer monitor, a VR space displays the corresponding leaf temperatures, initially recorded as 297.1, 297.3, 296.7, and 296.8 K under normal conditions. The top view focuses on two specific plants, ① and ②, situated in the upper shelf region where localized heating is mostly expected to occur. Temperature thresholds at 300 and 302 K are set to represent warm and overheating states, respectively, which are visualized by changing the digital-twin leaf color to yellow and red. Notably, the thresholds of 300 and 302 K are only chosen to emulate the warm and overheating state and do not represent the actual warm and overheating state of any specific plant. In practical applications, the threshold temperature can vary significantly from different types of plants and be set accordingly. In Fig. 5C, a mild, localized overheat was simulated by bringing a warm object (327 K) close to plant ①, causing only its temperature to increase, while the other three remain unaffected. This leads to a color shift in the corresponding digital-twin plant, transitioning it from green to yellow once the temperature reached 300 K. In Fig. 5D, as a hot object (338 K) approaches plant ②, heat transmission resulted in a color shift of the digital-twin plant, from green to yellow and eventually to red, denoting the occurrence of an extreme heat stress in that specific area. Upon removal of the hot object, the temperature gradually decreases, as depicted by a color transition in the VR space from red to yellow and finally to green. The dynamic recording of the whole process can be found in movie S2. The digital-twin plant system thus demonstrates its practicality in translating the real-world plants into the VR space, visualizing distinct temperature states through intuitive color changes of the corresponding digital-twin plants. In addition to the proposed localized overheating monitoring, this digital-twin plant system can encompass plant growth surveillance by harnessing a strain sensor to gather leaf growth information.

DISCUSSION We have demonstrated an all-organic plant e-skin that can be conformably attached to and seamlessly integrated with plants to noninvasively monitor their physiological status. By developing a scalable microfabrication process using only organic PEDOT:PSS as conductive components and PDMS as substrates, we achieved biocompatibility, transparency, stretchability, and conformability simultaneously in our plant e-skin. Our reported 4.5-μm-thick plant e-skin with more than 85% transmittance across the visible spectrum are optically and mechanically invisible to plants, thus enabling long-term and real-time monitoring without any observable adverse effects to plant health. Leveraging these characteristics, we configured our plant e-skin into strain sensors and temperature sensors and achieved long-duration real-time plant growth and surface temperature monitoring. The on-plant monitoring results revealed the day/night leaf growth rhythms and the accompanying leaf surface temperature variations, demonstrating the capability of our plant e-skin to measure plant physiological signals for practical applications. It is worth noting that such capability of transducing real-time plant physiological signals is especially crucial for accelerating desirable phenotypes during precision breeding of new plant varieties. Furthermore, we constructed a digital-twin plant monitoring system as a farmer-farm interface to visualize the thermal status of leaf surface in real time. While the minimum feature size we achieved in the present study is 2 μm, it is limited by the resolution of our lithography system. In principle, this minimum feature size can be reduced to submicrometer range for more dense integration. Apart from the demonstrated strain sensor and temperature sensor, other types of sensors can be expected by using the morphology and design flexibility offered by our scalable fabrication technique. We have preliminarily demonstrated the possibility of developing a flexible humidity sensor for monitoring the microenvironment of plants (fig. S17). In the future, the use of embedded conducting coils in the sensors is expected to enable wireless communication between plant e-skin and processors. Beyond plant growth monitoring applications, our demonstrated technology is also broadly applicable to epidermal electronics for human wearable and implantable devices. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials All the materials and chemicals used in this study are commercially available. polyvinyl alcohol (PVA; molecular weight = 89,000 to 98,000), PEDOT:PSS (1.3 wt % dispersion in H2O), d-sorbitol, and DMSO were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PDMS (SYLGARD 184 Silicone Elastomer Kit) was purchased from Dow Corning. Fabrication of plant e-skin The scalable fabrication process is schematically demonstrated in fig. S4. PVA aqueous solution (8 wt % in H2O) was initially spin-coated onto a clean and smooth wafer at 800 rpm for 30 s, acting as a sacrificial layer. Then, PDMS, prepared as a mixture of the elastomer base and a curing agent at a weight ratio of 20:1, was spin-coated at 8000 rpm for 4 min, creating the substrate layer for the epidermal electronics. A plasma treatment was carried out to render the PDMS surface hydrophilic [6 sccm (standard cubic centimeter per minute), 30 W, 30 s], facilitating the subsequent coating of the photoresist AZ-1512 at 800 rpm for 25 s. AZ-1512 was baked overnight at 65°C in the oven with temperature increasing and decreasing slowly to eliminate cracking of the AZ-1512 film caused by the thermal extension and cold contraction of the PDMS film under rapid and high temperature variation. Subsequently, a mask aligner (MA8, Micro Suss) was used to expose the micropatterns on the AZ-1512 film, allowing the desired PDMS pattern exposed without covering AZ-1512 after development in the MF 319 for 40 s. Thereafter, with additional plasma treatment, the sensing material [p-PEDOT:PSS (mixture of PEDOT:PSS, 5 wt % DMSO and 5 wt % d-sorbitol) for strain sensor and PEDOT:PSS for temperature sensor] was spin-coated onto the wafer at 1500 rpm for 30 s. Next, the lift-off process was conducted to remove AZ-1512 in acetone, and the remaining region was the PEDOT:PSS-based pattern on the PDMS substrate. In such case, the sensing film was successfully micropatterned on the PDMS film. Detailed parameters of the feature size of both sensors are illustrated in fig. S18. The subsequent steps included encapsulating the sensing films and connection to the external wire, which are crucial to ensure a good and reliable recording of the sensory output. To partially seal the sensing part while leaving the connection pads exposed for external wire connection, nonadhesive parafilm was used to cover the connection pads before spin-coating of PDMS (8000 rpm for 4 min) as the encapsulation layer on the sensing part. In addition, the parafilm was removed immediately after spin-coating to expose the connection pads again. Once the PDMS encapsulation layer was solidified, ultrathin copper wires were affixed to the two connection pads using Ag paste and liquid metal. Low-Young’s-modulus liquid metal was used to reinforce stability against potential cracks in the Ag paste or disruption to PEDOT:PSS films especially at the PEDOT:PSS-Ag paste junction induced by the Ag paste’s sharpness. Last, the connection pads together with the liquid metal and external wires were encapsulated manually with PDMS to obtain the final sensor. For further application, the epidermal sensors can be gently peeled off from the holding wafer and attached to the target objects such as the plant leaves. Sensor characterization The microstructure morphology of the PEDOT:PSS patterns on the PDMS film was characterized via the optical microscope (Nikon, Eclipse L200 L300). The optical transmission of the developed sensor was characterized by a universal measurement spectrophotometer (Agilent, Cary 7000 UV-Vis-NIR). The thickness of the developed sensor was measured by the surface profile (Bruker, DektakXT) and atomic force microscopy (Bruker Dimension Icon). Sheet resistance was measured by a four-probe measurement system (AiT, CMT-SR2000N). Photographs and videos were acquired by an iPhone 14 camera. The force gauge (Mecmesin, MultiTest 2.5-i) was used to conduct stretching deformation for shear adhesion force and strain sensor characterization. The resistance of strain sensor under each strain level was measured by the programmable electrometer (Keithley, 6514), and an oscilloscope (Agilent, InfiniiVision, DSO-X3034A) was connected to the electrometer using a bayonet nut coupling (BNC) cable for real-time data acquisition. The temperature sensor was characterized using a hot plate to control its temperature, and the electrical resistance was recorded by a digital multimeter (Sanwa, CD800a). When connected to Arduino MEGA 2560 for real-time data acquisition, every temperature sensor was calibrated using the hot plate before applying on the plant leaves to obtain the relationship between sensory output and temperature. Cultivation of the host B. rapa plant and stress application The oilseed sarson seeds were sown in soil and grown under standard long-day conditions (16-hour light/8-hour dark period), 60% humidity and 26°C light/23°C dark. After about 3 weeks, six plants were selected for sensor attachment with three for the control group and three for the abiotic stress group. Plants in the control group were then placed in the chamber under standard growth conditions (16-hour light/8-hour dark period, 60% humidity, 26°C light/23°C dark), and the other three were placed in another chamber where they were subjected to heat and drought stress (16-hour light/8-hour dark period, 60% humidity, 34°C light/31°C dark). Plants in the control group were watered well throughout the experiment, while the plants in the stress group did not receive water once the sensors were attached, to initiate drought condition. Demonstration of digital-twin plants in VR space Four epidermal temperature sensors were connected to the conditional circuit for conversion from the resistance change to voltage change as well as amplifying the voltage signals. The generated data were sent to a microcontroller (Arduino MEGA 2560) for data processing and communication with a laptop computer through a universal serial bus (USB) cable. The real-time signals received by the laptop computer were processed in Python, and the corresponding commands were sent to Unity 3D through Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) communication for digital-twin plant control.

Abstract Efficient irrigation is essential for sustainable food production and regional water security. Temperature measurements provide information about crop water status, which allows the estimation of water needs and precise irrigation scheduling. This paper proposes a technology for agricultural irrigation management that combines cost-effective implementation with the ability to map crop canopy temperatures using a wireless network of infrared thermometers on a center pivot. The technology integrates Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) with scalability options, IoT capabilities, and web data availability, enabling precise plant water stress quantification based on canopy temperature and soil water content. It facilitates real-time irrigation prescriptions while the center pivot is in motion, with canopy temperature sensors providing accurate readings of +/- 0.5 °C without additional calibration. Nonlinear Autoregressive Network with Exogenous Inputs (NARX) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network models were trained to predict irrigation prescriptions, achieving Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE < 4.18 mm) and correlation coefficient (r^2 > 0.82). This technology will allow the definition of real-time and site-specific prescriptions for variable-rate irrigation systems using infrared temperature sensors. Future work includes exploring LoRaWAN technologies, implementing a Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS), improving spatial resolution with data fusion algorithms, refining irrigation prescription models, reducing sensor costs and developing models considering soil and crop effects.

Introduction The growing scarcity of freshwater is one of the main challenges to food security and sustainability, where agriculture annually consumes the most water [1]. For this purpose, precision agriculture (PA) has achieved significant progress in water management and crop production using technological advances in software and hardware [2]. Precision irrigation (PI) is the sustainable management of water resources, which involves the application of water to the crop to meet specific plant water demands in space and time, while avoiding excessive or insufficient irrigation and minimizing adverse environmental impacts [3]. In PA, the Variable Rate Application (VRA) is the assignment of agricultural inputs in a site-specific manner. The correct application of the variable rate needs the specific plant requirements, the precise position and the characteristics of the environment where the input will be applied. There are two strategies for VRA: Map-based and sensor-based. In Map-Based VRA, the prescription map is generated and loaded into a computer inside the machinery before it performs its activities on the field [4]. Sensor-Based VRA is the technology that integrates sensors for automatically detecting the value of specific parameters in the plants or the soil in real-time and for deciding which kind and quantity of agricultural input should be applied [5]. VRA technologies apply water, fertilizer, herbicide and other chemicals for weeds and disease control and seed selection in sowing [6]. The purpose of those technologies is to save water, fertilizers and chemicals, increase potential yields and the protection of the environment [7]. The variable rate irrigation (VRI) technology provides the ability to site-specifically apply water in the field to achieve potential water savings [8]; this enables the incorporation of water in the soil according to the temporal and spatial soil characteristics and plant demand at different growth stages [9]. The VRI technology aims to apply the right amount of water at the right time, in the right place of the field, reducing water waste and improving water use efficiency (WUE), which is the ratio between biomass produced to the rate of transpiration [10], [6]. The effectiveness of VRI depends on the delineation of management zones, irrigation infrastructure, crop type, weather conditions and field properties such as topography, soil texture and soil water retention curves; that influence soil water content and crop irrigation prescriptions [11]. Therefore, understanding these factors can provide a basis to achieve improvements in crop water productivity and the environment [12]. In VRI, water requirements are applied at different rates to appropriately match field variability using individual management zones and their real needs instead of a homogeneous input application on the field [13]. A management zone is a field area with similar attributes in soil and topography. According to the definition of management zones, several parameters are considered as crop and soil properties, sensor-based information, field attributes, management practices and yield maps [14]. The information about irrigation prescriptions in the management zones is linked with automatic site-specific irrigation systems using dynamic prescription maps [15]. However, these maps can be challenging because the spatiotemporal variations on a field are affected by biotic factors such as plant diseases and pest infestation, and abiotic factors such as water stress, cold, drought, soil and water salinity [16]. The development process for an irrigation prescription map aims to fill the spatially variable soil–water profile and use software available with VRI hardware, yield, elevation or electrical conductivity maps through precision agriculture software or soil–water balance approaches from satellite imagery or wireless sensor networks [17]. Additionally, these maps use soil water measurements, soil water balance calculations or plant stress-based methods for defining irrigation amounts and timing. Volumetric water content (VWC) sensors, soil water profile measurements by a neutron probe and soil matric potential (SMP) sensors are the most used technologies for irrigation scheduling based on soil water measurements [18]. The magnitude of soil water content (SWC) varies with time and location, but the pattern of spatial variability usually remains similar [19]. Scheduling using soil water balance allows estimating soil–water depletion with good performance through the reference evapotranspiration multiplied by the corresponding crop coefficient [20]. In addition, process-based and statistical/machine-learning models can determine irrigation amounts using soil water balance [21]. These models consider factors like data availability, scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model uncertainties and constraints, and participation and motivation of producers [22]. Some plant-based irrigation scheduling strategies use dendrometers [23], sap flow sensors [24] or canopy temperature measurements [25], among others. Canopy temperature is used for irrigation management because it indirectly indicates plant water stress through canopy energy balance. Water stress arises when the quantity of water in plant leaves restricts photosynthesis and respiration. In water-stressed conditions, transpiration decreases, causing more energy to be converted to sensible heat at the canopy surface compared to non-water-stressed conditions. It causes plant canopy temperatures to rise above what would occur without water shortages [22]. Remote and proximal sensing technologies such as infrared sensors (IRT) and near-infrared and thermal imaging measure canopy temperatures. With canopy temperature and weather data, it is possible to provide information about environmental, soil and crop conditions for VRI and the development of dynamic irrigation prescription maps [26]. Canopy temperature can be measured using radiometers filtered to the thermal infrared wavelengths , making them non-contact infrared thermometers. These devices can measure an area ranging from a few to several according to the platform, typically categorized as ground-based, aircraft, or satellite. Ground-based platforms can be stationary or moving, with sensors handheld, portable, or on moving machinery like center pivots. Moving platforms offer more spatial coverage with fewer sensors but trade-off frequency, usually measuring at a single time of day at many locations, while stationary devices provide continuous measurements at one field location [27]. Satellite remote sensing includes constraints associated with the spatial and temporal resolution and the cost and durability of sensors and associated components required for wireless data transmission. The Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer several advantages for canopy temperature measurements, including a spatial resolution of several meters, a repeat frequency of no more than a few days, and a short interval from field measurement to data availability, typically just a few minutes. These advantages complement the essential requirements of reasonable instrument cost, precision, accuracy, and the ability to cover a significant field area. However, regulatory barriers exist for flying UAVs in certain regions [28]. Questions have arisen regarding the economic viability of utilizing UAV platforms for thermal imaging due to the cost and the extensive post-processing needed to generate reliably accurate thermometric images of a field [29]. Ground-based sensors, such as canopy temperature measured by stationary IRTs offer advantages over satellite and aircraft thermal imagers for agricultural use, including simplicity, lower cost, lower power consumption, and, most importantly, higher accuracy [30]. Achieving adequate field coverage needs a relatively large number of sensors, which would depend on factors such as field slope, soil variability, crop profitability, and sensor cost. The main types of algorithms used in irrigation management with IRTs are water stress indices and time–temperature thresholds (TTT) [27]. The crop water stress index (CWSI) and integrated CWSI (iCWSI) provide irrigation trigger information through the cooling effect due to plant transpiration based on the normalized function of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature difference between canopy and air [22]. The biologically identified optimal temperature interactive console (BIOTIC, [31]) is the fundamental principle for the definition of the TTT. The crop canopy temperature is measured using IRT sensors and compared with a crop-specific temperature threshold value [32]. The daily total amount is increased by one minute for each minute that the canopy temperature is higher than the temperature threshold. If this total daily value exceeds the time threshold at the end of the day, an irrigation amount is scheduled for the next day, corresponding to the daily crop evapotranspiration [36]. Other constraints are established for the addition of minutes to the daily total value in the TTT calculations, the net radiation must be greater than [33] and minutes are not added if the wet-bulb temperature is greater than the threshold temperature minus , because relative humidity can limit cooling by evaporation. [34] found equation (1), to determine the wet-bulb temperature using relative humidity and air temperature values. (1) The TTT plant stress-based method is easily automated in the field, installing IRT sensors in fixed locations. When sensors are not stationary, canopy temperatures are modelled according to sensors in a reference location using equation (2) [35]. (2) where is the calculated canopy temperature at the remote location (°C)and is the predawn canopy temperature (°C). is the canopy temperature at the remote location on the center pivot, at any daylight time measured by the IRT sensor (°C) and is the reference canopy temperature at the same interval as (°C), is the measured reference temperature at the same time as when the remote temperature measurement was taken (°C). For adjusting canopy temperature values, [36] advise to use an adjusted equation for temperatures detected by the IRT sensor ( ) using the sensor body temperature ( ) as in equation (3). (3) The CWSI uses the variation in canopy temperature as a function of water deficits and meteorological conditions [18]. It relates the difference in the crop canopy temperature measured using IRT sensors to the air temperature as a function of relative humidity [37]. The water stress index uses this temperature difference according to an upper and lower temperature baseline. Under the same prevailing environmental conditions, the upper and lower baseline temperatures determine the non-transpiring and fully transpiring crop temperatures [38]. The CWSI is a dimensionless value in a range between 0 and 1. A well-watered crop corresponds to 0, and a severely water-stressed cultivation corresponds to 1 [37]. The concept was extended to moving IRTs aboard center pivots, resulting in crop yield and water use efficiency comparable to or greater than manual irrigation scheduling using soil water profile measurements with a neutron probe [39]. Several studies have focused on developing ground-based remote sensing systems for center pivots, including algorithms [40], wireless sensor networks [27], low-cost wireless IRT networks [41], and software to generate site-specific prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil water information, with a graphical user interface (GUI) and geographic information system (GIS) tools, enabling site-specific irrigation scheduling for variable-rate irrigation (VRI) center pivot systems [42], [43]. Irrigation scheduling methods based on IRT sensors have been applied to corn [44], grain sorghum [45], soybean [25], hibiscus potted plants [46], apple trees [47], [48], Indian mustard [49] and cotton [50] crops. In [28], IRT sensors were implemented in a center-pivot irrigation system to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ETc). These sensors use a two-source energy balance (TSEB) model and provide a reduction of errors in ETc and crop water stress calculations by partitioning surface temperature into soil and canopy components. [51] applied the TTT method to a center-pivot irrigation system with infrared thermocouples and a global positioning system mounted on the center pivot for a soybean crop. Irrigation prescriptions were defined with the data analysis after midnight to determine the next-day strategy. Irrigation was applied in only one direction using special nozzles. The sensors corrected the canopy temperatures on the center pivot using soil IRT sensors obtaining the correction equation (4). (4) [50] used canopy temperature sensors on the center pivot for obtaining the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) by equation (5). (5) where is the crop temperature, is the average temperature of a wet reference and is obtained adding to the maximum dry bulb temperature recorded for the specific field day. [15] demonstrated the advantage of IRT sensors mounted on a center pivot with a global positioning system to provide spatial and temporal crop water status at the field scale. While most precision irrigation technology is too expensive and complex for average farmers, methods involving IRTs may become more appealing due to their lower costs and simplicity. This technology has the potential to simplify management while increasing yields and reducing water-related waste, making it an attractive option for producers [35]. IRTs on center pivots and irrigation scheduling algorithms have resulted in crop yields and water productivity equal to or greater than those achieved with soil water measurements and a field-calibrated neutron probe. Combining stationary IRT measurements with moving IRT arrays enhances the effectiveness of irrigation scheduling algorithms. Stationary measurements offer time series data while moving arrays provide spatially distributed data [52], [30]. Wireless data transmission is now accessible for IRTs, eliminating the need for cumbersome wiring and enhancing the ease of deploying IRTs in various settings [53], [54]. Furthermore, researchers use extensive datasets with canopy temperature and corresponding weather information. These datasets, in conjunction with machine learning, artificial neural networks and deep learning techniques, are being employed alongside energy balance models to estimate thermal stress indices and facilitate irrigation scheduling [55], [56]. Employing infrared thermocouples (IRTCs) on self-propelled irrigation systems such as center pivots present several challenges: - Estimating daily canopy temperature dynamics from a single measurement at each field location is challenging due to the uncertainty associated with the timing of these measurements [35]. - It requires automatic data collection and analysis to control the irrigation system based on the canopy temperature data [35]. - If a self-propelled irrigation system is in motion, it has made an irrigation decision based on prescription maps unless it acquires data moving without irrigating [35]. - The misalignment of the IRTCs over the rows occurs as the pivot moves around the field [35]. - The time–temperature threshold (TTT) and crop water stress indexes are canopy temperature-based algorithms that do not distinguish between soil and canopy temperature. This lack of distinction, even though differences can exceed 30 °C, can affect the apparent surface temperature, particularly during partial canopy cover. Consequently, instances of unnecessary irrigation events occurring early in the season, before full canopy cover, have been reported [45], [28]. - Concerns have arisen that the deflection of moving irrigation systems and other factors may degrade moving IRT measurements relative to stationary IRT measurements [30]. - Specialized hardware and software systems exist for defining irrigation prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil water information. This software incorporates site-specific irrigation scheduling methods and automates the data collection and processing obtained from sensing systems. However, it only defines static irrigation prescription maps and does not facilitate real-time water application in the field [43]. - Calculation methods typically employ the empirical upper and lower limits of the temperature difference between canopy and air to estimate CWSI and iCWSI based on the standardized temperature difference. This approach introduces irreducible uncertainty and error [22]. - Existing precision irrigation tools often have inadequate user interfaces, making them difficult to use and resulting in a poor user experience [57]. Additionally, low accuracy characterizes these tools, leading to the reluctance of producers to adopt them [58]. - Most current precision irrigation decision-support systems assume that producers strictly adhere to the recommended irrigation decisions for each event without allowing any flexibility in the irrigation timing [22]. - The increasing adoption of infrared thermometers (IRT) for crop irrigation management has contributed to the growth of surface temperature datasets. This trend emphasizes the need to develop data quality assurance and control (QA/QC) procedures like those used for agricultural weather station data [53]. - In-situ sensors currently available in markets are typically expensive or not cost-effective enough for widespread adoption. Furthermore, they often require installation and removal before and after the growing season for row crops, resulting in additional labor costs [59], [22]. According to the references consulted, there is a wide range of research opportunities and challenges in the commercial implementation of this technology. Further studies are needed to determine how to integrate the information acquired from IRT sensors and automatic irrigation application systems to prescribe and apply the site-specific irrigation needs in real-time during the growing season, using soil and crop characteristics under different environments [15], [6]. Currently, systems acquire data from the field and generate irrigation prescription maps before the irrigation procedure (static maps). This study aims to develop an innovative system for mapping real-time canopy temperature and defining prescriptions using IRT sensors on a center pivot and GPS data while the center pivot moves on the field. The proposed system consists of hardware and software developments whose final goal is to provide farm managers with accurate and frequently updated information about crop irrigation requirements. This paper shows only the real-time canopy temperature system. The prescription mechanism and the proposed system comparison with others will be reported in other publications. 2. Materials and methods The study was conducted from the Farm Services Unit of E.V. Smith Research Center in Shorter, Auburn University, Alabama, USA (32° 26′ 15″ N, 85° 54′ 57″ W, and 32 masl), during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons. The field experiences a subtropical humid (Cfa) climate, with average low and high temperatures of and , respectively, and an annual rainfall of (https://awis.aumesonet.com/). The same corn hybrid (Dekalb DKC62-08, Bayer Corp., Whippany, N.J.) was planted in both years. In 2018, the corn was planted in concentric rows, while in 2019, it was planted in straight rows at a row spacing of and a population density of [60]. Soil texture, bulk density, and soil water retention curves (SWRC) were determined at five points within the experimental area. These properties were measured at soil depths of , , and at each location. The percentage by mass of sand, clay, and silt was determined by a commercial soil laboratory (Water Agricultural Laboratories, Camilla, Ga.). Saturated undisturbed soil cores were analyzed using a hydraulic property analyzer (HYPROP 2, Meter Group, Pullman, Wash.) to establish the relationship between soil matric potential and volumetric soil water content (VWC) [61]. The soil matric potential of saturated undisturbed cores, measured with the hydraulic property analyzer, ranged from 0 to 0.08 MPa. Additionally, a dew point hygrometer (WP4C PotentiaMeter, Meter Group) was employed to determine the VWC versus soil matric potential relationship at 0.63, 1.5, and 3.3 MPa using disturbed soil samples. The data from both instruments were processed using HYPROP-FIT software (ver. 4.1.0.0, Meter Group, https://library.metergroup.com/Manuals/UMS/HYPROP-FIT_Manual.pdf) to generate soil water retention curves (SWRCs) based on the traditional unconstrained van Genuchten model [62]. The volumetric soil water content (VWC) at field capacity (FC) was determined for all locations, while the permanent wilting point (PWP) was established at a soil matric potential of 1.5 MPa. Soil bulk density was calculated by dividing the weight of dry soil (oven-dried at 105 °C until reaching a constant weight) by its volume, using undisturbed soil cores. The experiment took place in a field irrigated by a seven-span, half-circle center pivot irrigation system covering 30 ha. The system (model 7000, Valmont Industries, Valley, Neb.) had a lateral length of 434 m and operated with a flow rate of 181.7 cubic meters per hour, with a line pressure at the pivot point of 0.241 MPa. Equipped with a middle-elevation spray application (MESA) sprinkler package, the system included pressure regulators rated at 0.103 MPa. It was retrofitted with a variable-rate irrigation (VRI) system featuring solenoid valves to control water application over each half span. Each half span, approximately 31 m in length, represented a grid of 2° arc, allowing for the prescription of a single irrigation rate for the group of sprinklers within each half span. The experiment utilized full and limited irrigation treatments, designated as T100 (100 % soil water replenishment to field capacity), T66 (66 % replenishment of T100), and T33 (33 % replenishment of T100). A randomized complete block design was implemented with three treatments and four replications in 2018 (12 plots) and six replications in 2019 (18 plots). Soil water content (VWC) in the root zone was measured using a time domain reflectometer (TDR-315L, Acclima, Meridian, Ida.) and a capacitance-type soil water sensor (ECH2O EC-5, Meter Group) at three depths. In 2018, sensors were installed from 21 May to 30 August, while in 2019, they were installed from 23 April to 5 August. For the T100 treatments, VWC changes (except for replication 1 in 2018) were monitored using TDR-315L and EC-5 sensors at 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 m soil depths. The T66 and T33 treatments were assessed using only EC-5 sensors at the same soil depths as the T100 treatments. Dataloggers (Aquatrac, AgSense, Valmont Industries, Inc., Huron, S.D., and model Em50, Meter Group) recorded VWC values at 30-minute intervals. Aquatrac dataloggers were used for TDR-315L sensors, while Em50 dataloggers were used for EC-5 sensors. Data collection began on 21 May 2018 and 28 April 2019. Irrigation rates were determined using VWC data from TDR-315L sensors in the T100 treatment to replenish soil water to field capacity (FC) at a depth of 0.6 m. When soil water depletion from any T100 treatment reached 50 % of plant-available water (PAW), irrigation was applied to all treatments. The irrigation rate for each block was calculated based on the T100 treatment. For T66 and T33 treatments, irrigation rates were 66 % and 33 % of the T100 rate, respectively. Soil water depletion (SWD) was calculated by summing the depletion at each soil layer using data from four TDR-315L sensors in 2018 and three TDR-315L sensors in 2019. The irrigation prescription map was generated using Valley VRI (model 8.55, Valmont Industries, Valley, Neb.) and uploaded remotely to the Valley Pro2 panel located at the pivot point. Canopy temperature data were recorded using wireless IRT sensors (SapIP-IRT, Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) installed on a stationary mast in each experimental plot. IRT data collection began on May 13, 2018, and May 7, 2019, corresponding to the V7 vegetative growth stage. IRTs were installed 1 m above the canopy in the same crop row and 1.5 m from soil water sensors. Each IRT sensor targets the crop row throughout the growing season. Additionally, twelve IRT sensors (SapIP-IRT, Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) were installed on span 2 in 2018 and on span 7 in 2019, collecting data while the center pivot was moving. Dynamax IRT sensors were calibrated by the company before the experiments. IRT location accuracy was determined using a real-time kinematic (RTK) 297 Trimble GPS (Trimble Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The design principle follows the concept of a wireless sensor network (WSN) [63]. The system has a set of IRT sensors installed on a center pivot, a global positioning system node (GPS), which communicates with a central or main station using a Zigbee protocol (IEEE 802.15.4). The central station uses an embedded computer (EC). The CE is responsible for data acquisition from the IRT sensors and performing water stress indices, storing the information in a database, configuring the capture modules, and interacting with the user through a graphic user interface (GUI). Irrigation prescriptions with IRT sensors measurements on the center pivot were modeled using the machine learning models NARX (Nonlinear Autoregressive Network with Exogenous Inputs) and LSTM (Long short-term memory), adjusting the best hyperparameters and using as inputs the air temperature and relative humidity, canopy temperature of sensors on stationary masts, canopy temperature of sensors installed aboard the central pivot and as output the corresponding irrigation prescription. This procedure is not the scope of this article, and details will be explained in forthcoming publications. The proposed system design for canopy temperature monitoring and water balance estimation in a center pivot involves hardware and software integration and communication components. This section describes the electronic devices required to satisfy the requirements defined in the research. First, the hardware for the IRT system, the GPS system and the embedded computer are presented, with a justification of their suitability and an exposition of their main features. Then, is discussed the methodological aspects of the software development process. Finally, are introduced the underlying mapping algorithms of canopy temperature. 2.1. Hardware components description Wireless sensor node architecture includes twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared Leaf Temperature (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX), equipped with an XBee RF module (Digi International, Minnetonka, Minn.). The SapIP-IRT has a highly accurate reading of , is very stable over time, and has a signal window and field of view (FOV). For a one-meter-wide target, the IRT must place three meters above the item or surface to measure (20 degrees FOV). Zigbee specifications are and a range of with a omnidirectional antenna - (high gain), rechargeable batteries, typical current of . The maximum battery voltage during charging is , and the minimum battery operation is . Sensor response stops below . Fig. 1 shows the general scheme of the proposed system.

The wireless GPS node in the center pivot end-tower uses a raspberry pi zero board, a solar panel, a 12 V battery and a Garmin GLO GPS. GLO can receive position information from the GPS and the GLONASS satellite constellations, allowing it to connect to up to 24 more satellites than devices that rely on GPS alone. The GLO GPS locks on satellites approximately 20 percent faster and remain connected even at high speed. GLO updates its position information ten times per second with WAAS, an accuracy of 3 m and 12 h of battery life. The 12 IRT sensors mounted onto the center pivot acquire crop canopy temperature. Sensors and GPS node transmit temperature and geolocation data to the central station, that is, a small computer Raspberry Pi3 (Raspberry-Pi® Foundation North America, Inc) at the pivot point with Zigbee 2.4 GHz protocol and an algorithm developed in the Python programming platform (Python Software Foundation, version 3, Netherlands) for managing and visualizing data, and defining irrigation prescription. 2.2. Software development process According to [50], for an IRT sensor located on the pivot, the cover surface can be approximated as an elliptical footprint with the vertical axis (Fig. 2). The equation used to calculate the area and characteristics of that elliptical footprint was defined using Fig. 3. This figure shows the geometrical dimensions of the cover surface pattern. The parameters defined are : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral to the ellipse starting point, : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral to the point with the highest temperature value acquired by the IRT sensor, horizontal distance from the pivot lateral to the ellipse center and : the horizontal distance from the pivot lateral to the ellipse endpoint. , and represent the optical path length from the IRT sensor to , and , respectively. is the angle between the vertical IRT projection to the soil and , is de IRT Field of Vision (FOV), μ and τ are half of the major and minor axis of the ellipse and is the height of the IRT sensor with respect to the soil.

(18) Using equation (18), for example, an IRT looking slightly forward of the drop hoses at an oblique angle to the of FOV, mounted on a pivot lateral ( above the ground), (in the horizontal plane) from the edge of a treatment plot, will have a resolution of approximately of crop surface and with FOV approximately of crop surface.

A Geo7X GPS (Trimble®, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) allowed the definition of , (Span1 distance) and (Span2 distance) coordinates, with an accuracy of 1–100 cm using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). These coordinates where stored in three variables: , and These locations were converted to Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates: , and Distances (from to ) and (from to ) were defined using the UTM coordinates, equations (19), (20). (19) (20) To calculate the distance between IRT sensors ( ), is divided by the number of sensors plus one. In this experiment, there were 12 sensors on the pivot, then . A list of sensor locations on the pivot , is generated by with . This list contains 12 values, equation (21). (21) Each Dynamax IRT sensor sends a frame with a time tick, sensor serial number, battery voltage, target IR temperature degrees Celsius resolution), and sensor body temperature. For example, the frame: corresponds to sensor 305, reading of canopy temperature. The algorithm uses a list of IRT serial numbers with codes of the 12 sensors installed on the pivot. This list contains 12 strings, equation (22). (22) Additionally, the code uses a dictionary with 12 key-value pairs. The keys correspond to the 12 serial numbers and a list of values acquired by 12 IRT sensors. The dictionary uses the notation tuples of Key (String): Values (List of float numbers), equation (23). S (23). The GPS distance concerning the pivot lateral is a constant defined by equation (24). (24) The angle between the pivot lateral and the GPS location is a constant defined by equation (25). (25) The algorithm to define the location of each sensor on the field in real-time uses the following steps: • Acquire data from and convert it to . • Define in Fig. 3 using the equation (26). (26) • Adding with to define the pivot lateral angle . For determining the geographical position of each sensor, the algorithm uses a new dynamic center point . This location changes during the pivot movement, adding −90 degrees to the center pivot angle according to Fig. 4. 3. Results and discussion Fig. 5a shows the GPS node located at the center pivot final tower. Fig. 5b and 5c correspond to the central station installed in the field.

The developed Python software application called Infrared Mapping Tool supports the system configuration (sensors, GPS node data acquisition and other parameters), data processing and map visualization. The design principles for the Infrared Mapping Tool in real-time were that it should provide the most accurate and site-specific information we could offer the irrigation manager with the selected technology. In addition, the Infrared Mapping Tool requires minimum user input, is very easy to manage and provides ready-to-use data output to irrigation prescriptions in real-time. The Infrared Mapping Tool can operate with Raspbian or Windows operative systems. This tool records data in plain text format (.txt) inside its memory block and in an external pen drive and generates a shape file with the information in real-time from the sensors and their locations. The system uses a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) connection for monitoring remotely using WIFI communication protocols, and data is sent to a server for processing after the acquisition if there is an internet connection. The central station uses a Raspberry Pi with a 3.2 in. touch screen. After the initial setup, the user interacts with the Main Screen (Fig. 7). If the system configuration does not need modifications, the user can click the button Active IRT System to start data acquisition and map generation in real time.

Battery, canopy temperature and IRT sensor temperature. The user may configure the Infrared Mapping Tool to central pivot characteristics. The accurate definition of those parameters is significant because they are stored and used to locate the IRT sensors on the center pivot and to ensure the dynamic location precision of each sensor when it is in movement. The Center Pivot Span Configuration tab allows the user to edit any of the information about the center pivot related to the exact location of the center and the final of each span (Fig. 10a). The Sensor-Central Pivot configuration tab allows to define the number of IRT sensors that are installed by span (Fig. 10b). Finally, the Sensor Order configuration tab allows to establish the code order of the sensors installed on the center pivot from the left (center) to the right (span 7) (Fig. 10c).

The map validation process consisted of retroactively applying the model to the center pivot with twelve IRT sensors and the measurement on the field using the Trimble GPS device. Accuracies were less than 3.0 m with the proposed system implementation because of the GLO GPS Characteristics. This accuracy can be improved using a GPS receiver with better performance.

Table 1 shows the result of training the LSTM and NARX neural networks for determining irrigation prescriptions using as input data the ambient temperature, relative humidity, canopy temperature (ground and aboard the center pivot), and the irrigation prescription as output.

Efficient irrigation plays a crucial role in achieving the sustainability of food production and ensuring regional water security [64]. Producers rely on personal experience and weather data to determine when and how much to irrigate using center pivot systems. A survey found that over 75 % of U.S. irrigation scheduling methods rely on rules of thumb like crop calendars and neighbor practices, while less than 25 % use science or technology-based approaches [65]. According to the recent advances, challenges and opportunities of precision irrigation described by [22], the most important topics are data availability and scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model uncertainties and constraints, and the participation of producers and motivation. Table 2 shows the challenges and contributions of the proposed system in this research. Table 2. Challenges, contributions and future improvements of the proposed technology [22].

Add intuitive management tools to the proposed system, which allow easy interaction between the user and the developed software. Integrate commercial central pivot management functionalities with the real-time prescription system. The developed system significantly enhances precision irrigation practices by enabling real-time water application according to crop water demand. This information allows for optimal irrigation precise determination timing and amounts across the field. Unlike conventional infrared thermography (IRT) sensor systems on center pivots, which generate static water need maps [42], [43], our system offers dynamic, real-time irrigation prescriptions with application in dynamic variable-rate technologies that adjust irrigation rates based on the changing conditions within the field. These prescriptions are vital because they consider the spatial and temporal variations in crop growth, crop water status, and soil water availability throughout the growing season. This capability represents a significant advancement in precision irrigation technology. The adoption of precision irrigation tools depends on their accuracy and user-friendly interfaces [57]. Our system provides an intuitive interface and dynamic decision-making, empowering farmers with the capability to make informed decisions about when to start or stop irrigation. Swift updates based on soil and plant conditions are crucial if irrigation is postponed [22], and real-time mapping eliminates the need for acquiring new data for the entire field and generating new prescription maps. Additional calibrations beyond the manufacturer's factory settings were not applied to Dynamax IRT sensors (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX). A study conducted in a controlled temperature chamber showed that root mean squared errors between factory-calibrated IRT brightness and black-body temperatures (ranging from 15 °C to 55 °C) were mostly within 0.75 °C, while ambient temperatures in the chamber were varied from 15 °C to 45 °C. However, the temperature differences between the target and ambient temperatures in the controlled chamber (up to 40 °C) were much larger than those typically encountered in field conditions (10)°C). Field testing using a lysimeter indicated that post-factory calibration versus factory calibration had minimal impact on calculated crop evapotranspiration [66]. This suggests that an additional post-factory, sensor-specific calibration would have little justification over using only factory-calibrated temperatures in the field. Moreover, conducting a post-factory calibration over a range of ambient and target temperatures would necessitate a blackbody surface and chamber with variable temperature control, equipment that is rarely available [53]. Therefore, IRT data that solely rely on factory calibration are more likely to be suitable for practical applications in this project. The ZigBee Remote Control protocol offers several significant advantages over other systems. It provides low-power transmission, robustness, high security, and high scalability, with the ability to support high node density. Additionally, it leverages wireless control and sensor networks in IoT applications [67]. In wireless communication systems deployed in agricultural fields, security and privacy are crucial to ensure data confidentiality. Zigbee addresses these concerns by employing the 128-bit advanced encryption standard (AES) [68]. The AES algorithm encrypts the data and verifies data integrity using a message authentication code generated by encrypting the IEEE MAC frame. Xbee modules use the AES-CTR mode for encrypting the payload. Compared to IEEE 802.15.4, Zigbee adds two extra security layers to the network and application layers, utilizing AES 128-bit encryption. The distributed security model is limited to routers and end devices. If a router detects a powered-up existing network, it can join the secured network; otherwise, it can form a distributed secured network and assign network keys to newly joined routers and end devices. While this model is simple, it does not offer the highest level of security. We use the centralized security model, which is more complex and secure than the distributed model. The network coordinator is responsible for authenticating and validating each device attempting to join the network [69]. While these encryptions enhance security, they limit the delay in network communications (latency), the speed at which data is transmitted (throughput), link quality, power consumption and longevity of the network. However, the increased energy consumption for encryption is recommended in agricultural IoT applications [70]. Security measures implementation can significantly enhance the security of Zigbee networks. Nevertheless, like any technology, the effectiveness of security measures depends on how they are implemented and maintained [71]. Without adequate security configurations, Xbee devices are vulnerable. These devices are built with a preconfigured global link key, making them susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. The equipment in IRT sensors and central station should be placed in protective enclosures to prevent damage from insects, rodents, and weather conditions. These enclosures must be both weatherproof and tamper-resistant. Environmental sealing can protect against moisture and dust, which can negatively impact the performance of electronic components. Adequate ventilation may also be necessary to prevent overheating. It is recommended to use reliable power sources, such as solar panels or batteries, to ensure the continuous operation of the electronic system. Backup power sources may be required in the event of power outages. Dynamax IRT sensors offer remote monitoring capabilities, enabling the tracking of the electronic system's performance and the detection of any issues related to the power system. Regular inspection and maintenance of the electronic system are crucial to ensure optimal performance. This includes checking for signs of damage, cleaning components, and replacing worn-out parts. Preventive maintenance was conducted monthly, while general corrective maintenance and functional tests were performed whenever the sensors were installed on the central pivot, and the routers and central station were placed in the field. To prevent damage from rodents, all exposed cables near the soil were covered with flexible metal tubes. The scalability in the developed systems depends on the transceiver devices used in the wireless sensor network. ZigBee networks offer several benefits, particularly in large-scale deployments, due to their energy efficiency and flexibility. [72] refers to Zigbee networks as personal area networks (PANs) and states that each network has a unique PAN identifier (PAN ID) shared among all devices in the network. Zigbee devices can join a network by either being preconfigured with a PAN ID or by discovering nearby networks and selecting a PAN ID to join. Zigbee defines three device types: coordinator, router, and end-device [73]. In Zigbee networks, there should be only one Coordinator node per network, serving as the controller responsible for selecting the network channel, organizing the network, and synchronizing the wireless sensor network. The coordinator selects the channel, PAN ID, security policy, and stack profile for the network. It initiates the network, selects the channel and PAN ID (64-bit and 16-bit), and manages other functions that define, secure, and maintain the network. Routers are responsible for maintaining the infrastructure of the ZigBee network. These nodes do not gather data or start the message transmission but only transmit data from router to router or from the end devices to the coordinator. These devices cannot sleep and must always remain powered on. Finally, end-devices do not route. They are responsible for gathering data and delivering it to the nearby router or coordinator. The scalability of the proposed system in this paper does not have restrictions by communication infrastructure because designers have made all ZigBee nodes small, lightweight, and energy-efficient, allowing the connection of up to 65,535 nodes [74]. Dynamax utilizes the IRT SALH data logger system, housed in a weatherproof enclosure, which can link to repeaters to collect data from up to 25 wireless IRT sensors and three routers [75]. In this research, we designed and implemented a datalogger that allows the connection of more IRT sensors, integrating one coordinator, multiple end-devices and routers, leveraging the capabilities of ZigBee technology and improving system scalability. Table 3 lists the required hardware for implementing the wireless sensor, GPS, and central station nodes, along with their current costs. The number of wireless sensor nodes used depends on the central pivot size, and a span can accommodate several IRT sensors. Based on the current design and the study field characteristics, the cost of implementing the entire hardware in the center pivot with twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared Leaf Temperature (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX) nodes is US$8,964.32. We implemented this hardware to ensure the system performs correctly. One key focus of future work is reducing implementation costs and optimizing modules' energy consumption. Table 3.

These costs are strictly related to the center pivot movement when watering. Table 4. Cost analysis for center pivot installation: investment and operating costs [76].

Additionally, any incidental rain or operational problems with the central pivot that render the system inoperable for hours or days render the initial prescription obsolete, necessitating new routes for new prescriptions. The system proposed in this research addresses these challenges. Moreover, by eliminating field steps required for generating irrigation maps, the operating costs of the center pivot are reduced respect to Table 4. It is important to note that the values presented in Table 4 do not include these data acquisition processes, which contribute to higher implementation and operation costs when using the conventional mapping method with IRT sensors on the center pivot. 4. Conclusions The proposed technology contributes to agricultural irrigation management through its cost-effective implementation and capabilities of mapping crop canopy temperatures using a wireless network of infrared thermometers on a center pivot. It incorporates Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) with scalability options, IoT capabilities, and web data availability. The technology enables precise plant water stress quantification based on canopy temperature and soil water content, facilitating real-time irrigation prescriptions while the center pivot is in motion on the field. Canopy temperature sensors do not require additional calibration, guaranteeing highly accurate readings of +/- 0.5 °C. Enhancing the GPS receiver accuracy is imperative because it guarantees the determination of the sensor's position on the center pivot. GLO2 GPS can receive position information from GPS and GLONASS satellite constellations, can use 24 extra satellites to lock approximately 20 % faster and remain connected even at high speed but with an accuracy of 3 m. To enhance the GPS module, we can use receivers with Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) as Real-time kinematic positioning (RTK) or augmentation systems such as Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) in U.S.A. or European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) in Europe. NARX and LSTM neural network models were trained to predict irrigation prescriptions using ambient temperature, relative humidity, and plant cover temperature as input data. These temperatures were measured by the sensors installed on the ground and aboard the central pivot. The irrigation prescription was used as output data. They achieved RMSE values ranging from 0.56 mm to 4.18 mm in RMSE. Additionally, the correlation coefficient values exceeded 0.8, indicating that the models effectively tracked the irrigation prescription behavior using canopy temperature sensors. Several research activities are proposed as future work. Exploring LoRaWAN technologies can enhance transmission distances, thus improving the efficiency and reach of sensor networks. Additionally, efforts to reduce the costs of sensors and data acquisition systems can continue, making these technologies more accessible to farmers. Another promising area is the development of algorithms for fusing data from ground, drone, and satellite sources, which could significantly enhance spatial resolution in irrigation management. Furthermore, research focusing on refining irrigation prescription models in diverse environments and improving irrigation amount calculations based on soil water demand and plant physiological regulations is essential. Finally, researchers must develop models that consider the effects of measurements in soil rows and crop plants.

Plants cannot speak and cannot ask for the food they require. These problems can be addressed by applying intelligent (fuzzy logic) controllers to IoT devices in order to enhance communication between crops, ground mobile robots, aerial robots, and the entire farm system. The application of fuzzy logic in agriculture is a promising technology that can be used to optimize crop yields and reduce water usage. It was developed based on language and the air properties in agricultural fields. The entire system was simulated in the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment with Cisco Packet Tracer integration. The inputs for the system were soil moisture sensors, temperature sensors, and humidity sensors, and the outputs were pump flow, valve opening, water level, and moisture in the sounding. The obtained results were the output of the valve opening, moisture in the sounding, pump flow rate, outflow, water level, and ADH values, which are 10.00000013 rad/s, 34.72%, 4.494%, 0.025 m3/s, 73.31 cm3, and 750 values, respectively. The outflow rate increase indicates that water is being released from the tanks, and the control signal fluctuates, indicating that the valve is opening. Keywords: multi robot system; IOT device; smart agriculture system; intelligent controller 1. Introduction Farmers need to adapt to the shifting demands of the environment as well as those of regulators, consumers, food processors, and retailers. The effects of soil erosion, biodiversity loss, and climate change are all becoming more and more of a burden, as are consumer preferences for food and worries about its production. Furthermore, the natural world, in which farming interacts with plants, pests, and diseases, continues to provide difficulties. Even if there are many solutions available in modern agriculture, the results vary because every farm is different in terms of the amount of water needed, the kind of soil, the temperature, and the humidity [1]. For these reasons, farmers are looking for technology that can solve the issues facing agriculture today. For farmers, a highly promising solution is to integrate Internet of Things devices with intelligent controller algorithms in agricultural systems. The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the agricultural sector by providing farmers with real-time data on crop health, soil moisture, and nutrient levels. These data can be used to optimize crop yield, reduce water usage, and minimize the use of pesticides and fertilizers. IoT sensors can be used to monitor the health and well-being of livestock, optimize feeding schedules, detect illness, and improve breeding programs. Automated irrigation systems can be used to monitor soil moisture levels and weather patterns to optimize irrigation schedules, which can help reduce water usage and improve crop yield [2]. Many researchers have spent their time on the application of IoT devices in agriculture without considering the application of different controllers in agriculture to date. Furthermore, to sustain the health of the farm and maintain mass productivity, it is necessary to implement intelligent controller algorithms such as fuzzy logic, adaptive, model predictive, and so on into an agriculture system in order to enhancement the communication between faming system. The nature of agriculture structure requires flexibility, ease of implementation, robustness, and interpretability. Among the intelligent controllers, a fuzzy logic controller is the best fit to address the nature of agriculture structure requirements. The reason is that it works with imprecise inputs, does not require an accurate mathematical model, and can handle nonlinearity. It enables advanced fuzzy logic to control a pump’s switching time according to user-defined variables, whereby sensors are the main aspect of and contributor to the system [3]. It introduces an innovative irrigation time control system for smart farming that leverages fuzzy logic to regulate the timing of irrigation in crop fields, effectively curbing water wastage while ensuring that crops receive neither too little nor too much water. A smart greenhouse system based on an IoT and fuzzy inference system can create an automatic microclimatic condition that optimizes the conditions of plant growth through the use of IoT sensors and actuators that automate the controlling of weather factors to enhance the plant growing process. A smart farm system can optimize water usage for agriculture. The system implements an open loop fuzzy logic control system using a Mamdani control system. The inputs to the fuzzy logic control system are adapted from a humidity sensor, temperature sensor, and the flux sensor in the field [4,5]. The purpose of this research is to improve automation systems in the agricultural industries by integrating intelligent controllers with Cisco Packet Tracer. As a result of Internet of Things devices being integrated into the system, farmers can now easily determine their current farming situation. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 carries out a literature review, and Section 3 presents mathematical models of the system. The results and a discussion are presented in Section 4, and conclusions are drawn in Section 5. 2. Literature Review Smart agriculture systems can be traced back to the mid-1980s, when research into automated fruit harvesting systems began in Japan, Europe, and the United States. Impressive advances have been made since then in developing systems for use in modern agriculture. To date, agriculture systems have utilized different technologies such as precision farming, hydroponics, aquaponics, robots, temperature and moisture sensors, aerial images, GPS technology, and vertical farming [6]. The most popular applications of artificial intelligence in the agriculture industry are in three major categories: agricultural robots, predictive analytics, and crop and soil monitoring. Computer vision and deep-learning algorithms are used to process data captured by drones and/or software-based technology to monitor crops. Farmers use technology daily. Automated drones already monitor fields and collect data on crops. Agricultural robots are being developed to carry out the fieldwork. Robots have successfully planted, tended, and harvested crops. In order to realize the full potential of the IoT, there is a need to integrate ubiquitous smart devices and cloud-based applications [7,8]; a combined IoT framework with a cloud at the center gives the flexibility of dividing associated costs in the most logical manner and is also highly scalable. In the combined framework, sensing service providers can join the network and offer their data using a storage cloud; analytic tool developers can provide their software tools; artificial intelligence experts can provide their data mining and machine learning tools useful in converting information to knowledge; and computer graphics designers can offer a variety of visualization tools [9,10,11,12]. An agricultural management method supported by technology monitors, assesses, and evaluates the requirements of specific fields and crops. The focus of these efforts is on robotics, which includes sensors, aerial images, and sophisticated local weather forecasts, as well as Big Data and advanced analytics capabilities. This results in reduced environmental impact, financial savings, and optimized fertilizer utilization. Using data and information technologies to optimize intricate farming systems is known as smart farming. Smart farming does not place as much emphasis on exact measuring or differentiating between or within individual animals, as it does with PA. The emphasis is more on data application and access—that is, how to make intelligent use of the information gathered. Farmers can obtain real-time data regarding the state of the soil and plants, the terrain, the climate, the weather, the utilization of resources, labor, and funding [13,14]. By using mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, farmers now possess the knowledge necessary to base their judgments on factual information rather than gut feeling. Regular use of web-based data platforms in conjunction with Big Data analysis, internal and external farm networking, and precision and smart farming techniques is common. Products for IoT-enabled smart agriculture are made to automate irrigation systems and use sensors to monitor crop areas. Consequently, farmers and related brands may conveniently and remotely check agricultural conditions. Agriculture currently uses a variety of technologies. Therefore, to determine the degree of technology employed in the system, it is necessary to identify and compare the various technologies. For simplicity, this is compared in Table 1. Table 1. Smart flatform comparison to date [15,16]. Researchers are using a variety of technologies in agriculture systems, including machine learning, remote sensing, image processing, sensor networks, and so on, to boost agricultural productivity. In order to gain insights, it is necessary to compare the controller algorithms used in agricultural systems. The comparison is based on how easily it can be automatically tuned during operation, as demonstrated in Table 2. Table 2. Comparison of control algorithms in smart agriculture applications [15,16,17]. 3. Mathematical Models of the System Figure 1 demonstrates how the overview of the present work begins with the collection of related works and the identification of issues. Following accurate problem acquisition, mathematical models of the agricultural tanks are created. Appropriate control algorithms are developed based on the mathematical models. The complete system is then be tested and simulated. After integrating the models with Cisco Packet Tracers and simulating again, if the test result validates the requirements, the findings are received and discussed. The procedure is repeated until the intended outcome is achieved. If the tested results are not validated by the requirements, which are checked against the mathematical model, the procedure is repeated. Figure 1. Flow chart of the current work. 3.1. Working Principles of Smart Agriculture From Figure 2, it can be understood that agriculture can be a field as suitable as industry for the application of automation. Addressing the issues in the agricultural sector is challenging because crops are unable to communicate their emotions. Furthermore, humans are unaware of all the requirements that plants have. Farmers’ extensive and protracted experience offers partial, but not complete, comprehension. The use of the Internet of Things in smart agriculture would help with issues like industry 4.0 agriculture using artificial intelligence and machine learning concepts, and IOT smart farming [18]. It aids in issue solving, goal keeping, improvement, categorization, and disease prediction in agricultural systems. Intelligent controllers (fuzzy logic controllers) would receive reference parameters (input) such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. The controller would then estimate the necessary specification and send it to the agricultural system. The Internet of Things is integrated into the agricultural system, allowing farmers to receive messages and quickly understand any issues. The reference settings would be modified for the farmer based on the need [19,20]. Fuzzy logic controller algorithms would be used to make the decision and carry out the action itself if the farmers were not given the proper system parameters. On the other hand, industrial processes can be designed by modules to apply specific robots to specific tasks, whereas the complex tasks of agriculture sometimes cannot be split into simple actions. Figure 2. Smart agriculture system. 3.2. Mathematical Models of the Water Reservoir Tank Level, and Its Opening Valve As shown in Figure 3, when considering a tank that has fluid flowing in (input) and fluid flowing out, we define the output as depth in the tank. Now, the research questions could be: Figure 3. Water tank level for smart agriculture system. How does the depth depend upon the inflow and outflow? How does the outflow depend upon the depth? In order to answer the questions, it must be understood that the outflow will depend upon the pressure in the tank (which depends upon the depth and density) and a constant linked to the pipe shape [21]. 𝑓 𝑜𝑢𝑡 =𝑅ρ𝑔ℎ (1) Equation (1) represents the outflow models; the rate of the change of the depth will depend on the cross-sectional area, the difference between flow in and out. 𝑑𝑉 𝑑𝑡 =𝐴 𝑑ℎ 𝑑𝑡 = 𝑓 𝑖𝑛 − 𝑓 𝑜𝑢𝑡 (2) 𝐴 𝑑ℎ 𝑑𝑡 +𝑅ρ𝑔ℎ= 𝑓 𝑖𝑛 (3) Observations from inflow Equation (3) show that the time constant depends on the resistance (pipe opening) of the outlet pipe and the cross-sectional area. 𝐴 𝑅ρ𝑔 𝑑ℎ 𝑑𝑡 +ℎ= 1 𝑅ρ𝑔 𝑓 𝑖𝑛 (4) Gain depends on the resistance (pipe opening) of the outlet pipe: 𝑇= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨     𝐴 𝑅ρ𝑔 𝐾= 1 𝑅ρ𝑔 (5) It was noted that the resistance to flow is actually 1 𝑅ρ𝑔 . If the cross-sectional area is increased, the time constant increases. If the resistance to flow K is increased, the time constant and steady state gain also increase. We ignore the impact of density and gravity. This marks the end of the mathematical models for inflow and outflow models. To adjust the system automatically and fulfill the objective, it is necessary to look at the control strategy. This model works with inaccurate and hazy data. This is based on degrees of truth and is a glaring oversimplification of the real-world issues, as it includes only water tanks, which are a component of an agricultural system. For the time being, fuzzy logic control works well because some parameters are unknown. 3.3. Fuzzy Logic Control Design Fuzzy logic is a mathematical method for representing vagueness and uncertainty in decision making. It allows for partial truths, where a statement can be partially true or false, rather than fully true or false. Fuzzy membership is a concept in fuzzy logic that assigns a degree of membership to an element in a set. The degree of membership is a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that the element is not a member of the set, and 1 indicates that the element is a full member of the set [15]. There are different types of membership functions that can be used to model fuzzy sets, as represented in Table 3. While fuzzy logic has many advantages, there are also some disadvantages to using it. One of the main disadvantages is that it can be difficult to design a fuzzy system that accurately models a complex system. Fuzzy systems can also be computationally expensive to run, especially if they involve a large number of rules or membership functions. Additionally, fuzzy systems can be difficult to interpret, especially if they involve a large number of rules or membership functions [22]. Table 3. Comparison of fuzzy memberships. Based on the comparison hits, a Gaussian membership function was selected for this work [23]. 𝐹(𝑥,σ,𝑐)= 𝑒 − (𝑥−𝑐) 2 2 σ 2 (6) Figure 4 depicts the conventional layout of a fuzzy logic controller. Before going into the main control block, the inputs which were crisp values produced by the feedback error and change in error were conditioned by multiplying by constant gains using a preprocessor. The fuzzification block matches data with criteria of rules and transforms input data into degrees of membership functions. The Mamdani-type inference engine took the rule-based commands as input, calculated the degree of capability of the used rules, and produced a fuzzy set for the defuzzification block, which took the fuzzy output data and produced crisp values. Through the use of the centroid defuzzification approach, the outputs of the fuzzy sets were transformed into crisp values [24,25]. Figure 4. Fuzzy logic controller scheme. 3.3.1. Membership Function Assignments The membership assignment for temperature is displayed in Figure 5. Temperature regulation would be based on function. Low is represented in black, normal is presented in red, and high is represented by blue, which have been assigned to the values. The Gaussian function is used to represent the function. While probability was represented by the vertical axis, the horizontal axis was expressed in degrees Celsius. Figure 5. Fuzzy membership function for temperature. Figure 6 shows the membership assignment for humidity. Function would be the basis for controlling humidity. The values have been given as low, represented in black, normal, presented in red, and high, represented in blue. The function is represented by the Gaussian function. The horizontal axis was given in mass per cubic meter, whilst the vertical axis denoted probability. Figure 6. Fuzzy membership function for humidity. The membership assignment for humidity is displayed in Figure 7. The foundation for regulating soil moisture would be function. Three values have been assigned to the values: low, which is represented in black, normal, which is presented in red, and high, which is represented by blue. The Gaussian function is used to represent the function. The vertical axis represented probability, and the horizontal axis was expressed in mass per cubic meter. Figure 7. Fuzzy membership function for soil moisture. Figure 8 shows the membership assignment for opening the valve. Function would be the cornerstone for controlling the valve’s opening. Wet is represented by blue, cold is shown in red, moderate is presented in black, hot is demonstrated in purple, and dry is presented in green. The function is represented by the Gaussian function. Probability was represented by the vertical axis, while degrees were shown by the horizontal axis. Figure 8. Fuzzy membership function for opening valve. As shown in Table 4, the fuzzy logic designs were determined by the language rules. Z stands for zero response, P1 shows positive small, which means the valve would be open slightly, N2 signifies negative large, which means the valve is completely closed, and P2 indicates positive large, which means the valve is fully opened and the water is discharging. Table 4. Rule design for IOT device. Figure 9a,b demonstrate how these rules base their control efforts on a number of if–then statements regarding (e) and (De). Specifically, if the error is equivalent to the values for temperature (TV), humidity (HV), and soil moisture, then control (c) is changed to open the valve (OV). The system was tuned and experiments were conducted to identify the number of these if–then statements. It is simple to repeat the procedure by adjusting the input numbers with the aid of the vertically positioned red line. It adjusts itself prudently. The yellow color in Figure 9a indicates the face of the input parameters, while the blue color in Figure 9b shows the output parameters. Figure 9. Density probability for rules of the fuzzy interface system. Plotting the first output variable against the first two input variables, the fuzzy logic rule surface provides the output surface for the fuzzy inference system. The midpoints of each input variable’s corresponding range are used as reference values for the other input variables in fuzzy systems with three inputs. As a result, Figure 10 shows the smoothness of the control signal change and offers the rule surface that corresponds to the rules. Figure 10 shows the fuzzy numbers with the lightness change caption and colors representing the least and greatest uncertainty levels. and was greatly impacted by the work, which offered approaches for visualizing data with uncertainty based on variations in saturation, brightness, and/or intensity. The hue of the map indicates the degree of uncertainty with respect to the lower values. The color-coded map illustrates the degree of uncertainty towards the higher numbers. Figure 10. Fuzzy logic rule surface. The aim of this controller design is to enhance communication between ground mobile robots, aerial vehicles (quadcopters), and farming fields. In order to achieve the goals of this work, this section provides a case study for the intelligent fuzzy logic controller and formulations of air properties in agricultural fields. Figure 11 shows that the components consist of three inputs: soil moisture sensors, temperature sensors, and humidity sensors. The fuzzy logic controller then receives signals from the three inputs in order to control the pumps and valve opening conditions. As the valve opens, input fills the water tank. The filled water levels are measured by water level sensors and flow rate sensors, which send feedback to the fuzzy logic controller. Based on the feedback signals, the fuzzy logic controller automatically adjusts the input signals and then sends them to the respective outputs. Figure 11. Block diagram of smart agriculture system. Figure 12 shows the working principles of the IoT implementation in the agriculture system. The system starts up and initializes, then collects data from the agricultural fields. It then prints whether the soil moisture (SM) is less than 27%, in which case the sprinkler turns on, or if the soil moisture (SM) is greater than 27%, in which case the sprinkler turns off. Figure 12. Schematics of the model. 3.3.2. Case Study for the Intelligent Fuzzy Logic Model These rules can be used to create a fuzzy logic-based system that can control a pump’s switching time according to user-defined variables, whereby sensors are the main aspect of and contributor to the system. The proposed system can help automate irrigation and reduce water consumption and watering time [15,16,17,18,19]. Here are some fuzzy rules for temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and soil acidity as input and output in a smart agriculture system: Temperature: ◦ If the temperature is low, then the output is cold; ◦ If the temperature is normal, then the output is moderate; ◦ If the temperature is high, then the output is hot. Humidity: ◦ If the humidity is low, then the output is dry; ◦ If the humidity is normal, then the output is moderate; ◦ If the humidity is high, then the output is wet. Soil Moisture: ◦ If the soil moisture is low, then the output is dry; ◦ If the soil moisture is normal, then the output is moderate; ◦ If the soil moisture is high, then the output is wet. Soil Acidity: ◦ If the soil acidity is low, then the output is basic; ◦ If the soil acidity is normal, then the output is neutral; ◦ If the soil acidity is high, then the output is acidic. These rules can be used to create a fuzzy logic-based system that can control a pump’s switching time according to user-defined variables, whereby sensors are the main aspect of and contributor to the system. The proposed system can help automate farms and reduce water consumption and watering time. 3.3.3. Formulation of the Air Properties in the Agricultural Field It was assumed that the opening of the valve, moisture in the sounding, pump flow rate, and water levels during the valve’s operation would be taken into account. However, other factors were not considered in the work. Based on this assumption, the following parameters would be formulated as follows [20]: Moisture in sounding (%)= γ𝑝 ρ − − − √ ∗100 (7) where γ is the constant ideal ratio, p is the pressure sound in the system, and ρ is the specific density of the air. Outflows(Q)= π∗D 2 ∗𝑛∗𝐻 4∗𝑔 (8) where D is the diameter of the reservoirs, n is the number of moles, H is the head of the water in the field. Pumps flow (rpm)=GPM (9) where gallons per minute (GPM) is the flow rate. Valve opening=Q proportional to Area×Sqrt of DP (10) where DP is the pressure drop across the valve. 4. Results and Discussion The purpose of this research article was to create an Internet of Things (IoT) weather station that also incorporated a soil moisture monitoring component. The device is intended to notify the user when the moisture content of the soil drops below a certain value. To notify the user that the moisture content of the soil is too low, sprinklers, which correspond to the three soil moisture sensors, will turn on. The initial idea was to feed all of these data onto a server designed to handle IoT projects and then plot the data continuously. From Table 5, it was understood that IoT devices (temperature sensors, ADH sensors, and water vapor per kg) are used as inputs for the fuzzy logic control. The outputs are rotations of the pumps, moisture in the sounding, water level sensors, outflow, and valve opening. Of these output parameters, valve opening is constant throughout the process, while the input parameters vary. Table 5. Simulation results of the IOT application in smart agriculture system. Table 6 presents the comparison between the previous results [2,3,4] and the current results. Table 6. Comparison of previous work and current work. Figure 13 demonstrates the water levels in the fields. The vertical axis indicated the water level in mega metric cube (Mm3), whereas the horizontal axis showed the time in hours. At the beginning, it slowly increases since the amount of water required by the field was not much. It increases slowly until about 9.8 h, after which it dramatically increases, indicating that the field requires more water. Too much water in agricultural areas can affect how the soil functions, hinder plant growth, and increase the risk of nutrient runoff. Too little water, on the other hand, can have devastating effects on crops and their ability to take up nutrients from the soil. Intensive groundwater pumping for irrigation depletes aquifers and can lead to negative environmental externalities, causing significant economic impact on the sector and beyond. Figure 13. Measurements of water level in agricultural fields. As seen in Figure 14, valve opening is a term used in irrigation to describe the degree to which a valve is open or closed. It is typically expressed as a percentage, with 0% indicating that the valve is completely closed and 100% indicating that the valve is completely open. The valve opening determines the amount of water that flows through the valve and into the irrigation system. By adjusting the valve opening, the controller can control the amount of water that is delivered to their crops. For this case, its opening slowly increases, because the level of the water discharge flow rate is directly proportional to the product area and the drop in pressure. The water level has a minimum of 10 m3, meaning that when the valve is opened, the water level will likewise gradually rise from 10 m3. Figure 14. Valve opening mechanism. As shown in Figure 15, in the IoT, a controller effort is a term used to describe the amount of torque or force that is applied to a pump and valves in order to achieve a desired performance. Controllers are defined by the type of control input and the type of output they use to drive the pump and valves. For example, a flow rate controller accepts flow rate commands as input and produces torque (effort) commands as output. Figure 15. Controller effort. Figure 16 represents the discharge of water in the agricultural fields. It means that flow rate discharge is the volume of water that flows through a pipe or channel per unit of time. In the agricultural sector, flow rate discharge is an important parameter for irrigation systems. It is used to determine the amount of water that is delivered to crops automatically, and to ensure that the farm system is operating properly. Figure 16. The discharge rates. As shown in Figure 17, errors related to water level grow proportionately. An inaccuracy characterized as a proportional error depends on how much the water level variable changes. Thus, the relationship between the change in water level and the change in time (hours) is straightforward. Time (hours) divided by water level always equals the same constant, since this change is always of an equally quantifiable quantity. A statistic that shows how much a water levels sample percentage is expected to deviate from the proportion in the overall proportion that constitutes the standard error of a proportion. Figure 17. Water level error. After the controller design was finished, it was implemented in Cisco Packet Tracer with integrated MATLAB/SIMULINK environments. Figure 18 shows the real-time flow of data packets during the simulation. The fuzzy logic intelligent controller is the home gate connected to the IoT backend server. The IoT connection enables users to check the status of the IoT parameters such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture from an IoT browser homepage. The IoT browser homepage shows a list of the smart devices, allows visualization of their status, and permits remote interaction with the devices. Logical interaction between smart devices can be set while connected to the IoT main homepage. Interactions between devices are based on set conditions, such as starting a chiller when the temperature of a particular unit needs to be lowered or reducing oxygen supply to a boiler in order to reduce fire tube temperatures. The central control PC, manager smartphones, and tablets, which are connected to the local central office wireless LAN (WLAN), can connect to the dedicated IoT homepage via a browser in order to monitor all connected IoT devices. Cisco Packet Tracer has a feature with the possibility to switch from real-time to simulation mode. The first mode enables the possibility to create the underlying network, connect IoT devices, and define IoT backend logic. However, only in the simulation mode, it was possible to validate that the network communication layer really happened between the devices. In the simulation mode, it was possible to simulate packet traffic between nodes and devices in order to check the connectivity, routing protocols, and other network logic. This mode helped to physically visualize and troubleshoot any kind of network, for example, setting up pings or more complex packages between nodes. Figure 18. Real-time flow of data packet. 5. Conclusions This study aimed to incorporate an Internet of Things (IoT) agricultural system that monitors soil moisture, temperature, and humidity as input parameters and automatically opens the valve as an output. In order to achieve these goals, a wide range of pertinent research papers were looked into to determine the current problems. One of the problems was the difficulty of having valves in agricultural fields that open automatically. Based on well-founded concerns, mathematical models of agricultural tanks were created. Fuzzy logic controllers were designed using the mathematical models that were provided. It was determined to create fuzzy logic controllers by utilizing the language-based membership function. Fuzzification of fuzzy language started next, and was followed by rule evaluation and defuzzification. Next, a fuzzy logic surface and fuzzy logic rules were created. When the fuzzy logic system was complete, it was all transferred to a mathematical model of a water tank to watch how the controller functioned. After that, Cisco Packet Tracers were used to integrate the entire system within the MATLAB environment. Sprinklers that correspond to the three soil moisture sensors activate, and the gadget notifies the user when the soil moisture content falls below a predetermined threshold. After being loaded onto a server built to handle IoT devices, the data are continually plotted. The field’s water requirement rises gradually for approximately 9.8 h before sharply increasing, suggesting that the field needs more water. In agricultural settings, an excess of water can disrupt soil structure, impede plant development, and raise the possibility of nutrient runoff. Crops and their capacity to absorb nutrients from the soil can suffer greatly from inadequate watering. Aquifers are depleted, and adverse environmental externalities may result from intensive groundwater pumping for agriculture, which has a substantial financial impact on the industry and beyond. In agriculture, “valve opening” refers to the extent to which a valve is open or closed. A percentage is usually used to represent it, where 0% denotes a fully closed valve, and 100% denotes a fully opened valve. The amount of water that passes through the valve and enters the agricultural system is determined by the valve opening. Farmers can regulate how much water is applied to their crops by changing the opening of the valve. The amount of torque or force supplied to a pump and valves to accomplish a specified performance is referred to as the controller effort in the Internet of Things. The kind of control input and output that a controller uses to operate the pump and valves characterizes the controller. For instance, a flow rate controller generates torque (effort) commands as an output after receiving flow rate commands as input. Flow rate discharge is a crucial agricultural system element in the agriculture industry. It is used to figure out how much water is automatically applied to crops and to make sure the farm system is running smoothly. Smart gadgets are linked to the IoT backend server through a house gate. Through the IoT connection, users can remotely interact with the devices and check their status from the homepage of an IoT browser. While linked into the IoT main portal, smart device interactions can be configured logically. Device interactions are dependent on predetermined parameters. For example, a chiller may be started when a certain unit needs its temperature dropped, or the oxygen supply to a boiler may be reduced to lower fire tube temperatures. All linked IoT devices may be monitored by the central control PC, management cellphones, and tablets by connecting them via a browser to the specific IoT site. One characteristic that makes integrating MATLAB/Simulink with Cisco Packet Tracer possible is the ability to transition between simulation and real-time mode. It is feasible to confirm that the network communication layer between the devices actually occurred in the simulation mode. To examine network logic, routing protocols, and connectivity between nodes and devices, a packet tracer simulation can be performed. This mode facilitates the physical visualization and troubleshooting of any type of network, including the configuration of more intricate packages or pings between nodes. It was discovered that the optimal outcome came from combining the Cisco Packet Tracer with the MATLAB environment. If agricultural temperature, humidity, and soil moisture content were all effectively controlled, as well as if water tanks could open on their own, these outcomes would occur. Farmers and crops would be in communication at the same time. Consequently, in comparison to earlier research studies, the suggested intelligent control system is the most appropriate with IoT gadgets for the implementation of smart farm systems.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.

3.6. IoT Network Architectures and Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) for Real-Time Irrigation
Real-time irrigation management systems heavily rely on the efficient and reliable transmission of data from sensors and weather stations to the cloud for processing and decision-making. However, agricultural environments present unique challenges to wireless communication, including adverse weather conditions, physical obstacles, and the limitations of wireless technologies. These challenges necessitate robust and adaptive solutions to ensure the consistent and timely flow of data, enabling truly autonomous irrigation scheduling.
Environmental factors, such as heavy rain, fog, and strong winds, can significantly disrupt wireless communication by attenuating or even blocking radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance (Ed-daoudi et al., 2023; Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). Dense vegetation, buildings, and uneven terrain create further complications by causing multipath propagation and shadowing effects (Yim et al., 2018; Gautam and Pagay, 2020). The study by Yim et al. (2018) on LoRa networks in a tree farm environment exemplifies these challenges, revealing reduced communication range and data reliability compared to theoretical expectations. This underscores the need for carefully selecting and optimizing communication protocols and network parameters to ensure reliable data transmission in such environments.
The study by Guzinski et al. (2014a) using a modified TSEB model further highlights the importance of high-resolution data in accurately capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of energy fluxes influenced by environmental factors. This emphasizes the need for advanced data acquisition and processing techniques that can effectively represent the complexities of agricultural settings.
The limitations of traditional wireless communication technologies, such as limited range and network congestion, pose additional challenges for large-scale agricultural operations. Long-distance data transmission can be hindered by range limitations, while network congestion arising from numerous sensors transmitting concurrently can lead to delays and data loss, hindering real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). Addressing these challenges requires the exploration of advanced networking technologies that can optimize spectrum utilization, mitigate interference, and improve reliability and efficiency.
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) offer promising solutions for optimizing wireless communication in agricultural settings. CRNs empower devices with the ability to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). Research has explored the potential of CRNs in predicting Radio Frequency (RF) power to avoid noisy channels and optimize spectrum utilization (Iliya et al., 2014; Iliya et al., 2014). These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of combining optimization algorithms with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the accuracy and generalization of RF power prediction, enabling CRNs to make informed decisions about channel selection and avoid interference.
DSA complements CRN technology by dynamically allocating unused spectrum, further enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion (Shi et al., 2023). The numerical model developed by Shi et al. (2023) showcases the potential of CRNs and DSA for optimizing wireless communication in challenging environments.
The integration of CRNs and DSA into the IoT network architecture requires careful consideration of spectrum sensing techniques, network topology, and data security. Research on cooperative spectrum sensing suggests that distributed approaches, where sensor nodes collaborate and share information, can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectrum sensing, particularly in dynamic environments (Trigka and Dritsas, 2022; Khalid & Yu, 2019). This collaborative approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the radio environment and facilitates the identification of available frequency bands for data transmission.
The choice of network topology also impacts the performance and scalability of CRN-based irrigation systems. Mesh networks, where sensor nodes are interconnected and relay data for each other, offer enhanced resilience and coverage compared to star topologies where nodes communicate directly with a central gateway (Akyildiz & Vuran, 2010). However, mesh networks can be more complex to manage and may introduce additional routing overhead. The trade-off between network resilience and complexity needs to be carefully evaluated to select the most appropriate topology for a specific agricultural setting.
Data security and privacy are paramount concerns in IoT-based irrigation systems due to the sensitive nature of agricultural data (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential for protecting data integrity and ensuring system trustworthiness. Research on secure spectrum leasing and resource allocation algorithms for CR-WSN-based irrigation systems has demonstrated the potential of these technologies for enhancing security and efficiency (Hassan, 2023; Afghah et al., 2018).
In conclusion, the development of effective and reliable real-time irrigation management systems requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the challenges of data transmission in agricultural environments. The integration of robust and adaptive communication protocols, optimized network architectures, and advanced networking technologies like CRNs and DSA, along with a focus on data security and privacy, can contribute significantly to achieving the goal of autonomous and efficient irrigation scheduling.
4. AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN THE CLOUD
4.1. Data Quality and Preprocessing
Data quality is paramount in automated irrigation systems as it directly influences the effectiveness of decision-making and water use efficiency. Issues like missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers arising from sensor malfunctions, environmental interference, or network problems (Lv et al., 2023) can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models used for irrigation scheduling and management.
Real-time data cleaning techniques are essential for addressing these challenges. Kalman filtering proves particularly effective in handling missing values and correcting erroneous readings by recursively estimating the system's state based on previous measurements and current sensor data, taking into account noise and uncertainty (Kim et al., 2020). Moving average techniques, by averaging consecutive data points, provide a more stable representation of the underlying trend, filtering out short-term fluctuations (Chhetri, 2023). For outlier detection, adaptive thresholding methods offer a dynamic approach, adjusting thresholds based on the statistical properties of the data to effectively identify anomalies and minimize false positives (Bah et al., 2021). These techniques are crucial in maintaining the integrity of real-time data streams and ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analyses.
Adaptive data preprocessing is essential for managing the diversity of data sources and formats commonly found in irrigation systems. Data normalization techniques, such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization, ensure that all features contribute equally to the analysis by transforming data values to a common scale (Pradal et al., 2016). This is crucial for preventing features with larger values from dominating the analysis and ensuring that all features are given equal consideration. Similarly, feature scaling methods, like standardization or normalization, optimize the range of feature values to improve the performance and convergence of machine learning models (Tortorici et al., 2024). By scaling features to a similar range, the influence of outliers is reduced, and the model's ability to learn from the data is enhanced.
Data fusion techniques play a critical role in integrating information from diverse sources, creating a more comprehensive and reliable dataset for irrigation management. Dempster-Shafer theory, a generalization of probability theory, allows for the expression of both uncertainty and the degree of conflict in evidence, making it suitable for fusing uncertain and conflicting data from heterogeneous sources (Sadiq and Rodriguez, 2004). This is particularly relevant in irrigation systems where data from different sensors may provide slightly different or even contradictory information due to sensor variations or environmental factors. Bayesian inference offers another powerful framework for combining information from multiple sources, updating the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available. By applying these techniques, data from soil moisture sensors, canopy temperature sensors, weather stations, and other sources can be integrated to provide a holistic understanding of crop water requirements and environmental conditions, leading to more informed and accurate irrigation decisions.
The impact of data quality extends beyond model accuracy to the robustness of machine learning models under varying conditions. Robust models should maintain consistent performance even when faced with data inconsistencies or unexpected situations. Techniques like data augmentation and domain adaptation can enhance model robustness by exposing the model to a wider range of data variations during training. Data augmentation involves generating additional training data by applying transformations or introducing noise to existing data, making the model more resilient to noise and variations in the real-world data. Domain adaptation techniques aim to adapt a model trained on one domain (e.g., a specific crop or geographic location) to perform well on another domain with different data characteristics. This is particularly relevant in irrigation management, where models may need to be applied to different crops, soil types, or climatic conditions.
The choice of data cleaning, preprocessing, and fusion techniques should be carefully considered based on the specific characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data. By selecting and implementing appropriate techniques, the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of machine learning models can be significantly improved, leading to more efficient and sustainable irrigation management practices.
4.2. Scalable and Autonomous Deployment using Containerization Strategies
The transition from data collection and transmission to efficient data processing requires a robust infrastructure capable of handling diverse workloads and data volumes. Containerization technologies, specifically Docker and Kubernetes, offer a promising solution for deploying and scaling data processing and machine learning modules within cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). Docker provides a standardized way to package applications and their dependencies into self-contained units known as containers, ensuring consistent and reproducible execution across different platforms (Rosendo et al., 2022). Kubernetes, acting as a container orchestrator, manages their deployment, scaling, and networking across a cluster of machines (Rosendo et al., 2022). This combination presents several advantages for automated irrigation management systems.
Firstly, containerization facilitates efficient resource utilization and scalability. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies, containers enable the isolation of resources and prevent conflicts between different modules (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This isolation allows for the efficient allocation of resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to each container based on its specific needs. Kubernetes further enhances scalability by allowing for the automatic scaling of containers based on real-time demand, ensuring the system can adapt to varying workloads and data volumes, preventing bottlenecks, and ensuring responsiveness to changing conditions (Karamolegkos et al., 2023).
Secondly, containerization promotes portability and reproducibility. By packaging applications and their dependencies into a single unit, containers make it easy to move and deploy them across different cloud environments without the need for environment-specific configurations (Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This portability simplifies the development and deployment process, reducing the time and effort required to set up and manage the system. Additionally, containers ensure reproducibility by providing a consistent execution environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This eliminates variability and ensures that the system will behave consistently across different deployments (Zhou et al., 2023).
Optimizing container orchestration and resource allocation is crucial to minimizing latency and maximizing throughput in real-time data processing pipelines. Techniques like auto-scaling and dynamic resource allocation play a critical role in this context (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Werner and Tai, 2023; Kumar et al., 2024). Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of container instances based on real-time demand, ensuring that sufficient resources are available to handle peak workloads while avoiding over-provisioning during periods of low demand (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2024). Dynamic resource allocation enables the fine-grained adjustment of resources allocated to each container based on its specific needs and the current workload (Werner and Tai, 2023). This ensures efficient resource allocation and provides each container with the necessary resources to perform its tasks effectively.
Performance monitoring tools, such as Kubernetes Metrics Server and Prometheus, are essential for gaining insights into the performance of containers and the overall system (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kuity & Peddoju, 2023). These tools provide valuable data on key performance indicators, such as CPU and memory usage, network traffic, and application-specific metrics. By monitoring this data, administrators can identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation strategies, and continuously improve system performance (Hethcoat et al., 2024). This data-driven approach ensures that automated irrigation management systems can operate efficiently and reliably.
By integrating containerization technologies with optimization techniques and performance monitoring, automated irrigation management systems achieve the scalability, autonomy, and efficiency required for effective real-time data processing and decision-making. This approach facilitates a seamless and responsive system that can adapt to changing conditions and contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity.

4.3. Deploying ML Models for Data Processing
Transitioning from data collection, preprocessing, and transmission, the deployment of machine learning (ML) models marks a pivotal stage in the automated irrigation management pipeline. This stage entails utilizing cloud platforms to facilitate real-time data processing and inference, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimal irrigation management and ultimately contributing to fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
Several architectures and frameworks exist for deploying ML models on cloud platforms, each offering unique advantages and catering to different requirements. TensorFlow Serving, for instance, provides a high-performance system specifically designed for serving TensorFlow models (Abadi et al., 2016). This framework enables efficient and scalable inference, making it suitable for real-time applications where low latency and high throughput are crucial. For instance, in a large-scale irrigation system with numerous sensors generating data continuously, TensorFlow Serving can efficiently handle the high volume of inference requests and provide timely predictions for irrigation scheduling. Similarly, Apache MXNet Model Server offers a flexible and efficient solution for deploying models trained with MXNet, supporting a wide range of deep learning models and inference backends (MXNet Developers, 2015). This versatility makes it suitable for complex irrigation systems that may utilize different types of ML models for various tasks, such as predicting crop water requirements, detecting plant stress, or forecasting weather conditions. ONNX Runtime, on the other hand, provides a cross-platform inference engine compatible with various ML frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet (Microsoft, 2017). This versatility enables the deployment of models in diverse environments, facilitating interoperability and reducing the need for model conversion. For example, an irrigation system that uses models trained in different frameworks can utilize ONNX Runtime to deploy them on a single platform without the need for time-consuming and error-prone model conversion processes.
Choosing the appropriate architecture or framework depends on several factors, including the specific ML framework used for model training, the desired level of performance and scalability, and the need for cross-platform compatibility. For instance, if the primary concern is low latency and high throughput for real-time inference, TensorFlow Serving might be the optimal choice for TensorFlow models. However, if flexibility and support for various deep learning models are required, Apache MXNet Model Server could be more suitable. In cases where cross-platform compatibility is essential, ONNX Runtime offers a versatile solution.
Once the ML model is deployed, optimizing its performance and resource utilization becomes crucial for ensuring the efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems. Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, offer effective methods for reducing the size and computational requirements of ML models without compromising accuracy (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Pruning involves eliminating unnecessary connections or neurons from the model, effectively streamlining its structure and reducing computational complexity. This can be particularly beneficial for deep learning models, which often have a large number of parameters and can be prone to overfitting. By removing redundant or less important connections, pruning can improve modelgeneralizability and reduce inference time. Quantization, on the other hand, involves reducing the precision of model parameters, typically from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower-precision formats such as 8-bit integers. This reduction in precision leads to smaller model sizes and faster inference speeds, making it particularly beneficial for resource-constrained environments or real-time applications. For instance, in edge computing scenarios where ML models are deployed on devices with limited computational resources, quantization can enable efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, hardware acceleration through the utilization of GPUs or TPUs can significantly enhance model performance by leveraging specialized hardware designed for parallel processing (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). GPUs, with their massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth, excel at accelerating matrix operations and convolutions, which are fundamental computations in many deep learning models. This acceleration can significantly reduce inference time and enable real-time processing of sensor data for timely irrigation decisions. TPUs, specifically designed for deep learning workloads, offer even greater performance and energy efficiency for specific model architectures. These hardware accelerators can drastically reduce inference time, enabling near real-time decision-making and enhancing the responsiveness of automated irrigation systems. For example, in a scenario where immediate response to changing weather conditions or soil moisture levels is critical, hardware acceleration can ensure that irrigation decisions are made and executed promptly.
In addition to model compression and hardware acceleration, distributed training techniques play a crucial role in optimizing the training process for large-scale ML models. Techniques such as Horovod and BytePS enable the distribution of training across multiple machines, effectively parallelizing the process and reducing training time (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). This is particularly beneficial for complex models with a large number of parameters or when dealing with large datasets. By leveraging distributed training, irrigation management systems can train more sophisticated models and improve their predictive capabilities, leading to more accurate and efficient irrigation decisions. For instance, a system that utilizes a deep learning model with millions of parameters can benefit from distributed training to reduce training time from days to hours, enabling faster model iteration and improvement.
Integrating the deployed ML models with other components of the automated irrigation management pipeline is essential for achieving a fully autonomous and cohesive system and addressing the need for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system. Standardized protocols, such as MQTT and CoAP, provide lightweight and efficient communication channels for exchanging data between these components (Poojara et al., 2023; Jimenez et al., 2020a; Gour et al., 2023). MQTT, with its publish-subscribe architecture, enables real-time data streaming and event-driven communication, making it suitable for transmitting sensor data, control signals, and inference results (Raikar & M, 2023). This enables the ML model to receive real-time updates on soil moisture, weather conditions, and plant health, allowing for dynamic adjustments to irrigation schedules based on the latest data. CoAP, designed for constrained devices and low-power networks, offers a web-transfer protocol for resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient communication between sensors, actuators, and the ML models (Raikar & M, 2023). This is particularly relevant in situations where sensors or actuators have limited processing power or battery life, as CoAP minimizes communication overhead and energy consumption. Additionally, RESTful APIs provide a standardized interface for accessing and controlling the ML models, enabling seamless integration with other software components and facilitating system management and monitoring (Wang et al., 2022). This allows for easy integration with existing farm management systems or third-party applications, creating a unified platform for comprehensive irrigation management.4.4. Online Learning in the Cloud
The complexities of real-time data processing in irrigation management necessitate the exploration of advanced techniques to continuously learn and adapt to the dynamic nature of agricultural environments. Online learning algorithms offer a promising solution, enabling the continuous update and improvement of machine learning models based on incoming real-time data. This adaptability is crucial for addressing the challenges of changing environmental conditions, such as weather patterns and crop growth stages, and optimizing irrigation decision-making to enhance water usage efficiency and crop productivity.
Several online learning algorithms have demonstrated potential for real-time data processing and model adaptation in the context of irrigation management. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) facilitates the incremental update of model parameters with each new data point, allowing for efficient adaptation to changing data distributions (Bottou, 2010). This incremental learning process ensures that the model remains responsive to the latest conditions, minimizing the risk of outdated predictions and improving the accuracy of irrigation decisions. Passive-Aggressive algorithms, on the other hand, adjust model parameters only when a misclassification occurs, providing a computationally efficient approach for handling large data streams (Crammer et al., 2006). These algorithms offer a robust approach to handling noisy data, a common challenge in real-world sensor readings, by making small adjustments only when the model's prediction deviates significantly from the actual value (Fei et al., 2019). Online Random Forests extend the concept of random forests to the online setting, enabling the incremental construction and update of decision trees as new data arrives (Saffari et al., 2009). The continuous evolution of the ensemble ensures that the model remains relevant to the changing environment, capturing intricate relationships between variables and leading to more informed irrigation decisions.
Research in various domains highlights the importance of online learning for real-time data stream analytics. Snyder et al. (2020) explored the application of online learning techniques for identifying relevant tweets in real-time, improving situational awareness for first responders. The proposed interactive learning framework allows users to continuously label the relevance of incoming tweets, enabling the real-time refinement of the underlying machine learning model. This user-guided approach aligns well with the dynamic nature of irrigation management, where models need to continuously adjust to varying environmental conditions and crop water requirements. Similarly, research in the field of cyber-physical systems (CPS) underscores the need for online learning algorithms to effectively extract insights and knowledge from continuously generated data streams (Fei et al., 2019). These capabilities are crucial for enabling feedback loops between physical processes and cyber elements, facilitating the integration and optimization of CPS in irrigation management systems.
To implement online learning in cloud-based irrigation management systems, various architectures and frameworks can be considered. Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis provide scalable and fault-tolerant platforms for processing real-time data streams, allowing for the development of online learning pipelines that continuously ingest and analyze data to update machine learning models (Zaharia et al., 2012; Carbone et al., 2015; Amazon Web Services, 2023). These frameworks leverage serverless computing paradigms, automatically scaling resources based on the volume and velocity of incoming data, ensuring efficient resource utilization and responsiveness to fluctuations in demand (Fei et al., 2019).
Effectively managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off is crucial for optimizing online learning in irrigation management. Techniques such as Multi-armed bandits (Sutton & Barto, 2018), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018) can be employed to balance the allocation of resources between exploring new irrigation strategies and exploiting the current best-performing approaches. These techniques enable the identification of optimal irrigation policies, adapting to changing environmental conditions and maximizing long-term rewards.
In conclusion, online learning techniques, coupled with scalable cloud-based architectures, offer a powerful solution for real-time data processing and continuous adaptation in irrigation management systems. By leveraging algorithms like SGD, Passive-Aggressive, and Online Random Forests, along with stream processing frameworks like Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis, irrigation management systems can effectively handle the complexities of real-time data, optimize water usage, and enhance crop productivity in the face of dynamic environmental conditions.

5. GENERATING AND APPLYING IRRIGATION INSIGHTS 
5.1. Real-Time Generation of Actionable Irrigation Insights
The transition from data collection and processing to actionable irrigation insights requires the extracting spatial features from images, allowing for the analysis of satellite or drone imagery to assess crop health, detect water stress, and provide insights into irrigation needs (Os deployment of advanced predictive models capable of generating precise and site-specific irrigation recommendations.roosh et al., 2016).
Furthermore, the integration Deep learning models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and of data from diverse sources, including IoT sensors and cloud-based platforms, plays Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have demonstrated excellent performance in capturing complex relationships a critical role in enhancing the accuracy and resolution of real-time irrigation insights. Data fusion techniques, such as Kalman filtering, offer a robust approach for combining information between input variables and predicting crop water requirements (Keller, 2023; Naphade et al., 2022). These models can effectively from multiple sensors, accounting for noise and uncertainty, and providing a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements (Cohen et al., 2005; Mö handle the temporal dependencies present in time-series data, such as soil moisture andeller et al., 2007). By integrating data from soil moisture weather data, and learn to predict future water needs based on historical patterns and current sensors, weather stations, and remote sensing platforms, ML models can generate more accurate conditions. Ensemble methods, such as Random Forests, also offer a robust approach to and site-specific irrigation recommendations, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity prediction by combining multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce the risk of overfitting.
The heterogeneity, uncertainty, and quality issues inherent in real-time data streams require careful consideration and the implementation of effective strategies to ensure the reliability of generated (Singh et al., 2016).
The integration of irrigation insights. Data preprocessing techniques, such as outlier detection and missing value imputation, IoT sensor data with cloud-based data sources is crucial for enhancing the accuracy and resolution of irrigation insights. IoT sensors, such as soil moisture probes and weather stations are essential for preparing the data for analysis and preventing erroneous data from influencing the model, provide real-time, localized data on crop and environmental conditions, while cloud's predictions (Fiksel, 2003). Additionally,-based sources, such as weather forecasts and satellite imagery, offer broader spatial and the selection of appropriate ML models and data fusion techniques should be tailored to the specific temporal perspectives (López-Morales et al., 2020). characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data to mitigate uncertainty and ensure the robustness Data fusion techniques, such as Kalman filtering, play a critical role in combining these of generated insights.
To address computational complexity and latency challenges in real-time irrigation insight generation, techniques such as edge computing, model compression, and hardware accelerators heterogeneous data sources to generate more accurate and comprehensive irrigation recommendations (Cohen et al., offer promising solutions. Edge computing enables the distribution of processing tasks closer to the data 2005; Möeller et al., 2007 source, reducing latency and enabling faster response times (Mishra, 20). By incorporating data from multiple sources, irrigation models can better account for spatial variability20; Zhang et al., 2020). Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, can significantly reduce the size and computational requirements of in soil moisture, microclimate conditions, and crop water requirements, leading to more ML models without compromising accuracy, making them suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge precise and efficient irrigation scheduling.
The seamless integration of ML-generated insights with IoT-enabled irrigation control systems requires the adoption of appropriate architectures and protocols that facilitate devices (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Hardware lightweight, real-time communication. The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT accelerators, such as GPUs and TPUs, provide specialized hardware designed for parallel processing) protocol and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are well-suited, enabling faster inference speeds and facilitating real-time data analysis (Premkumar for this purpose, offering efficient and reliable communication channels for exchanging data between sensors, & Sigappi, 2022). The combined utilization of these techniques can significantly improve the efficiency and responsiveness of real-time irrigation insight generation, contributing actuators, and ML models (Muangprathub et al., 2019; Osroosh et al., 2016). to the overall goal of achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
The implementation MQTT's publish-subscribe architecture enables real-time data streaming and event- of these strategies and techniques for real-time generation of actionable irrigation insights provides a solid foundation for developing automated and data-driven irrigation management systems that can effectively addressdriven communication, while CoAP's lightweight design and low overhead make it suitable the global food challenge by optimizing water resource utilization and maximizing agricultural productivity.
for resource-constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks. By utilizing these protocols, irrigation systems can achieve seamless integration between ML models and IoT devices, enabling the automated application of irrigation insights based on real-time data and predictions.
Industry-leading products and services for smart irrigation demonstrate the practical application of these technologies. Smart irrigation controllers, such as Rachio, leverage weather data and soil moisture sensors to automatically adjust irrigation schedules based on real-time conditions, reducing water waste and promoting water conservation (Verdouw et al., 2023). Cloud-based irrigation management platforms, such as CropX, offer advanced analytics and decision support tools, providing farmers with insights into crop water requirements, soil health, and irrigation performance (Weikmann et al., 2023). These platforms often incorporate machine learning algorithms to generate predictive models and provide farmers with data-driven recommendations for optimizing irrigation strategies.
The analysis of these products and services highlights the growing trend toward data-driven, automated irrigation management. By integrating IoT, machine learning, and cloud computing, these solutions enable farmers to make more informed and efficient irrigation decisions, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture.

Abstract: Smart farming is a development that has emphasized information and communication
technology used in machinery, equipment, and sensors in network-based hi-tech farm supervision
cycles. Innovative technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing are anticipated
to inspire growth and initiate the use of robots and artiﬁcial intelligence in farming. Such ground-
breaking deviations are unsettling current agriculture approaches, while also presenting a range of
challenges. This paper investigates the tools and equipment used in applications of wireless sensors
in IoT agriculture, and the anticipated challenges faced when merging technology with conventional
farming activities. Furthermore, this technical knowledge is helpful to growers during crop periods
from sowing to harvest; and applications in both packing and transport are also investigated.
Keywords: crop management; sustainable agriculture; smart farming; internet-of-things (IoT); advanced
agriculture practices; issues and problems
1. Introduction
Sustainable agriculture is a measure of the endurance and sustenance of food grains
produced in an eco-friendly manner [1]. Sustainable agriculture helps in the encourage-
ment of farming practices and approaches to help sustain farmers and resources. It is
economically feasible and maintains soil quality, reduces soil degradation, saves water
resources, improves land biodiversity, and ensures a natural and healthy environment [2].
Sustainable agriculture plays a signiﬁcant role in preserving natural resources, halting
biodiversity loss, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions [3].
Sustainable agriculture farming is a method of preserving nature without compromis-
ing the future generation’s basic needs, whilst also improving the effectiveness of farming.
The basic accomplishments of smart farming in terms of sustainable agriculture are crop ro-
tation, the control of nutrient deﬁciency in crops, the control of pests and diseases, recycling,
and water harvesting, leading to an overall safer environment. Living organisms depend
on the nature of biodiversity, and are contaminated by waste emissions, the use of fertilizers
and pesticides, degraded dead plants, etc. The emission of greenhouse gases affects plants,
animals, humans, and the environment; hence, it necessitates a better environment for
living things [4] (Figure 1).
Agriculture is the largest contributor in India, with an 18% gross domestic product
involving approximately 57% of people in rural areas. Over the years, although India’s
total agronomic output has increased, the number of growers has fallen from 71.9% in 1951
to 45.1% in 2011 [5]. The Economic Survey 2018 revealed that the number of agricultural
workers in the total workforce will drop to 25.7% in 2050. In rural areas, farming families
gradually lose the next generation of farmers, overwhelmed by higher costs of cultivation,

low per capita productivity, inadequate soil maintenance, and migrations to a non-farming
or higher remunerative occupation. Presently, the world is on the verge of a digital
revolution, and so it is the appropriate time to connect the agricultural landform with
wireless technology to introduce and accommodate digital connectivity with farmers.
Figure 1. Factors of sustainable agriculture.
Regrettably, not all parts of the Earth’s surface are suitable for agriculture due to
various restrictions, such as: soil quality, topography, temperature, climate, and most
relevant cultivable areas are also not homogenous [6]. Further, existing farming land is
fragmented by political and ﬁscal features, and rapid urbanization, which consistently
increases pressure on arable land availability (Figure 2). Recently, total agricultural land
used for food production has declined [7]. Furthermore, every crop ﬁeld has different
critical characteristics, such as soil type, ﬂow of irrigation, presence of nutrients, and pest
resistance, which are all measured separately both in quality and quantity regarding a
speciﬁc crop. Both spatial and temporal differences are necessary for optimizing crop
production in the same ﬁeld by crop rotation and an annual crop growth development
cycle [8].
Figure 2. Key issues of technology in the agriculture industry.
In most cases, variations in characteristics occur within a single crop, or the same
crop is grown on the whole farm and requires site-speciﬁc analyses for optimum yield
production. New technology-based approaches are needed to produce more from less land,
and to address these various issues. In traditional farming practices, farmers frequently
Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

visit their ﬁelds throughout the crop’s life in routine farming activities to better understand
the crop conditions [9]. The current sensor and communication technologies offer an precise
view of the ﬁeld, from which farmers can detect ongoing ﬁeld activities without being in
the ﬁeld in person. Wireless sensors monitor the crops with higher accuracy and detect
issues at early stages, often facilitating the use of smart tools from initial sowing to the
harvest of crops [10].
The timely use of sensors has made the entire farming operation smart and cost-
effective, due to precise monitoring. The various autonomous harvesters, robotic weeders,
and drones have sensors attached to collect data over short intervals. However, the vastness
of agriculture puts extreme demands on technological solutions for sustainability with
minimum ecological impact. Sensor technology through wireless communication helps
farmers to know the various needs and requirements of crops without being in the ﬁelds,
and they are then able to take remote action [11].
2. Smart Farming
Historically, ancient agriculture practices were related to the production of food in
cultivated lands for the survival of humans and the breeding of animals [12], and was
called the traditional agricultural era 1.0. This mainly resorted to using manpower and
animals. Simple tools were used for farming activities, such as sickles and shovels. Work
was mainly conducted through manual labor, and subsequently, productivity continued at
a low level (Figure 3).
Figure 3. Agricultural decision support system framework.
During the 19th Century, new types of machinery appeared in the agricultural indus-
tries, in the form of steam engines. The wide use of agricultural machinery and abundant
chemicals by farmers signaled the start of the agricultural era 2.0, and outwardly improved
effectiveness and productivity of farmers and farms. However, considerably harmful impli-
cations, such as chemical pollution, environmental devastation, waste of natural resources,
and excess utilization of energy, simultaneously developed.
The agricultural era 3.0 emerged during the 20th Century, due to the rapid growth of
computation and electronics. Robotic techniques, programed agricultural machinery, and
other technologies enhanced the agricultural processes efﬁciently. The issues that had arisen
during agricultural era 2.0 were solved, and policies were readapted to the agricultural era
Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

3.0 through work distribution, precise irrigation, the reduced use of chemicals, site-speciﬁc
nutrient application, and efﬁcient pest control technologies, etc.
The next agricultural era is also the current iteration of agriculture, the agricultural
era 4.0, involving the engagement of recent technologies, such as the Internet of Things, big
data analysis, artiﬁcial intelligence, cloud computing and remote sensing, etc. The adop-
tion of new technologies has signiﬁcantly improved agricultural activities by developing
low-cost sensor and network platforms, aimed towards the optimization of production
efﬁciency, along with reductions in the usage of water resources and energy with minimum
environmental effects [13]. Big data in smart farming provides extrapolative overviews of
real-time agricultural situations, allowing farmers to make effective decisions [14]. Real-
time programming is developed with artiﬁcial intelligence concepts and embedded in IoT
devices, helping farmers make the most suitable decisions [15].
Smart farming promotes precision agriculture with modern, sophisticated technology
and enables farmers to remotely monitor the plants. Smart farming helps agricultural pro-
cesses, such as harvesting and crop yields, as the automation of sensors and machinery has
made the farming workforce more efﬁcient [16]. The technologies convert traditional farm-
ing methods to automatic devices, causing a technological revolution in agriculture. Today,
the technology in agriculture has altered the way farming is conducted, and conventional
techniques have been transformed by the Internet of Things [17].
In terms of optimizing farm labor requirements and increasing the quantity and
quality of products, smart farming is an emerging modern technique implemented with
information and communication technologies (ICT) [16]. Modern ICT technologies, such
as the Internet of Things, GPS (Global Positioning Systems), sensors, robotics, drones,
precision equipment, actuators, and data analytics, are used to identify the farmers’ needs
and select suitable solutions to their problems. These innovations increase the accuracy
and timeliness of decisions taken, and improve crop productivity. Several multilateral
organizations and developing countries around the world have proposed smart farming
technologies to increase agricultural output [18].
Sensors are constantly monitoring crops with greater accuracy, detecting any undesir-
able conditions during the early stages of the crop’s lifecycle. Current farming incorporates
smart tools from crop sowing to harvest, storing, and conveyance. The appropriate use of a
wide variety of sensors has made the entire operation both more efﬁcient and proﬁtable,
due to its accurate monitoring competencies. In addition, sensors that collect data quickly
are directly available online for further evaluation, and they provide crop and site-speciﬁc
agriculture for every site.
The many issues related to crop production are addressed by smart agriculture and
monitoring, particularly regarding changes in soil characteristics, climate factors, soil mois-
ture, etc., to improve the spatial management practices that increase crop production and
avoid the excess use of fertilizers and pesticides [19]. The ANN models in smart irrigation
water management (SIWM) regulate irrigation scheduling support systems (DSS) and offer
data on irrigation efﬁciency, water productivity index, and irrigation water demand and
supply on a real-time basis. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an upcoming technology,
especially in developing countries, due to its potential to improve food security, farm
system resilience, and lower greenhouse gas emissions [20]. Smart agriculture technology
based on IoT technologies has many advantages in all agricultural processes and practices
in real-time, including irrigation, plant protection, improving product quality, fertilization,
disease prediction, etc. [21]. The beneﬁt of smart agriculture lies in its collection of real-time
data on crops, the precise assessment of soil and crops, remote monitoring by farmers,
supervising water and other natural resources, and improving livestock and agricultural
production. Therefore, smart agriculture is considered to be the progression of precision
agriculture through modernization and smart methods to attain various information of
farm activities that are then remotely managed, and reinforced by suitable alternative
real-time farm maintenance solutions.

3. Internet of Things
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new technology that allows devices to connect
remotely to achieve smart farming [22]. The IoT has begun to inﬂuence a vast range
of industries, from health, trade, communications, energy and agriculture, to enhance
efﬁciency and performance across all markets [23–25].
Current applications provide information on the IoT’s effects, and its practices that are
yet to be observed. However, by considering the advancement of technologies, one can
envisage the IoT technologies perform a crucial role in numerous activities of farming, such
as the utilization of communication infrastructure, data acquisition, smart objects, sensors,
mobile devices, cloud-based intelligent information, decision-making, and the automation
of agricultural operations (Figure 4).
Figure 4. Barriers in the implementation of smart agriculture technology.
The IoT technology monitors plants and animals and remotely retrieves information
from mobile phones and devices. Sensors and instruments empower farmers to assess
the weather and to anticipate production levels. The IoT plays a role in water harvesting,
monitoring and controlling the ﬂow amount, assessing crops’ water requirements, time of
supply, and the saving of water, more than ever before [26]. Sensors and cloud connectivity
through the gateway can remotely monitor the status and water supply based on soil
and plant needs [27]. To correct nutrient deﬁciencies, pests, and diseases, farmers cannot
monitor and observe every plant manually, but IoT technology is still beneﬁcial and has
led farmers to a new milestone in modern agriculture [28].
Recently, the development of IoT technologies has played a major role throughout the
farming sector, particularly through its communication infrastructure. This has included
connecting smart objects, remote data acquisition, using vehicles and sensors through
mobile devices and the internet, cloud-based intelligent analysis, interfacing, decision
formation, and the automation of agricultural operations. These proﬁciencies have revo-
lutionized the agriculture industry in terms of resource optimization, controlling climate
effects, and improving crop yields.
Researchers have proposed different methods, architectures, and various equipment to
monitor and convey crop information at different growth stages, based on several crop and
ﬁeld types. Many manufacturers provide communication devices, multiple sensors, robots,
heavy machinery, and drones to collect and then distribute data. Food and agriculture
organizations, along with other government organizations, develop guidelines and policies
for regulating the use of technologies to preserve food and environment safety [29,30].

Fundamentals of IoT Applications in Agriculture
The accessible, inexpensive and interactive tracking platform provides consolidated
information on traditional agricultural methods, techniques, implements, crop pests and
diseases, etc., collected from various sources for sustainable agriculture. Interactive agricul-
ture allows easy access to the data by users through multiple devices, such as computers
and mobile phones [31].
1.
Robust Models: The distinctive features of the agriculture sector are diversity, com-
plexity, spatio-temporal variability, and uncertainties of the right types of harvests
and facilities.
2.
Scalability: The variation in farm size from smaller to larger; hence, the results should
be scalable. The placement and testing planning should be progressively scaled up
with fewer expenses.
3.
Affordability: Affordability is vital to farming achievement, and therefore price should
be suitable with signiﬁcant assistance. Standardized platforms, products, tools, and
facilities could obtain a satisfactory price.
4.
Sustainability: The problem of sustainability is a vital issue due to strong economic
pressure and intense competition worldwide.
4. Technologies Used in Smart Farming
4.1. Global Positioning System (GPS)
GPS accurately records latitude, longitude, and elevation information [32]. Global
Positioning System satellites transmit signals and permit GPS receivers to compute their
location in real-time, and provide continuous positions while moving. The exact location
information offers farmers the opportunity to discover the precise position of ﬁeld data,
such as pest occurrence, type of soil, weeds, and other barriers. The system facilitates the
recognition of various ﬁeld locations in order to then apply the necessary inputs (seed,
fertilizer, herbicide, pesticide, and water) to a particular ﬁeld [33].
4.2. Sensor Technologies
Technics, such as photo electricity, electromagnetics, conductivity, and ultrasound, are
used to estimate soil texture and structure, nutrient level, vegetation, humidity, vapor, air,
temperature, etc. Remote sensing data can differentiate between crop types, categorize
pests and weeds, locate stress in soil and plant conditions, and monitor drought [34].
Plant health is affected by many factors, such as soil moisture, nutrient availability,
exposure to light, humidity, the amount of rainfall, the color of leaves, etc. The plants are
monitored by maintaining the optimum temperature and light intensity, and conserving
water and energy through micro-irrigation. Different sensors are used to detect many
parameters. If they cross a threshold, the sensor senses the changes and transmits them
to the microcontroller to perform the required actions until the parameter returns to its
optimum level [1].
The temperature, humidity, soil pattern monitoring, airﬂow sensor, location, CO2,
pressure, light, and moisture sensors are generally used in sensing technologies. Prominent
sensor characteristics include reliability, memory, portability, durability, coverage, and
computational efﬁciency, and make them suitable for agriculture [35]. Currently available
wireless sensors play a vital role in collecting data on crop conditions and providing other
information. These sensors are standalone types and can be integrated with advanced
agricultural tools and heavy machinery, based on application necessities.
The major sensor types with their corresponding working procedure and purpose are
represented in Table 1.

4.3. Variable-Rate of Technology (VRT) and Grid Soil Sampling
Variable-rate technologies (VRT) are used in farming to predict the delivery rate of
inputs based on a predetermined map extrapolated from GIS for the placement of inputs at
variable amounts in the right place and at the right time [16,33]. Grid soil sampling is soil
collection from a systematic grid to establish a map for every parameter. These maps are
the basis for VRT and are loaded into a variable-rate applicator. The computer and GPS
receiver direct and control the changes in the delivery amount or fertilizer product, based
on map features [58,59].
New technologies, such as variable rate technology and associated practices (grid soil
sampling), potentially improve soil fertility management and assess the spatial distribution
of nutrients and yields [60]. In grid sampling, samples are collected from sampled sections
based on the subdivision of a ﬁeld into small areas, or cells, by superimposing the grid
lines onto the ﬁeld. Composite samples represent an entire area of each much smaller area
(grid-point sampling) at the intersections of grid lines. Soil-test values from grid sampling
are mapped by interpolating methods from non-measured locations between sampled
points. The variability of phosphorus and potassium is ﬁeld-speciﬁc, and each ﬁeld should
be fertilized differently to improve nutrient management practices by uniform applications
of fertilizers and manure for better precision agriculture [61].
4.4. Geographic Information System (GIS)
The GIS comprises hardware and software designed to provide compilation, storage,
retrieval, attributes analysis, and location data to generate maps and analyze characters and
geography for statistics and spatial methods [62]. The GIS database provides information
on ﬁeld soil types, nutrient status, topography, irrigation, surface and subsurface drainage,
quantity of chemical applications, and crop production, and also establishes the relationship
between elements that affect a crop on a particular farming ﬁeld [63]. Apart from data
storage and display, the GIS is used to assess present and alternative management by
compounding and altering data layers for decision-making.
4.5. Crop Management
Satellite images provide information on variations in soil conditions, as well as crop
performances affected by topography within the ﬁeld. Therefore, farmers can exactly
monitor production factors, such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, that are responsible
for yield increase and efﬁciency.
The spatial coverage and temporal revisit frequency of satellite images provide the
information in near real-time at a regional scale. The relationship between the spectral prop-
erties of crops and their biomass/yield experiments [64] is predicted by spectral reﬂectance
properties of vegetation, especially in red and near-infrared combinations (vegetation
indices) to monitor green foliage. Among the different indices, the normalized difference
vegetation index (NDVI) is the most popular indicator to assess vegetation health and crop
production, due to the closely related leaf area index (LAI) and photosynthetic activity
of green vegetation [25]. Crop monitoring methods are based on the interpretation of
remote-sensing-derived indicators by comparing actual crop status to previous or normal
seasons [65]. The relationship between vegetation indices and biomass permits early crop
yield estimation in certain periods before harvest [66]. The automated data acquisition, pro-
cessing, monitoring, decision-making, and management of farm operations [67], including
the basic functions of crop production (yields), proﬁts and losses, farm weather prediction,
ﬁeld mapping, soil nutrients tracking, are the more complicated functionalities available
through automated ﬁeld management.
4.6. Soil and Plant Sensors
Sensor technology, a signiﬁcant constituent of precision agriculture, provides soil
properties information, fertility, and water status. Hence, new sensors have been developed
based on desirable features and established apart from currently available sensors [68].
Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

Soil sensors and plant wearables monitor real-time physical and chemical signals
in soil, such as moisture, pH, temperature, and pollutants, and provide information to
optimize crop growth conditions, ﬁght against biotic and abiotic stresses, and increase
crop yields. Soil organic matters (SOMs), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium
(K) are the most important nutrients for crop production. The NIR reﬂectance-based
sensors measure the spatial variation of surface and subsurface soil nitrogen [69]. SOM is
predicted based on optimal wavelengths by assessing soil spectral reﬂectance in IR and
visible wavelength regions [70]. The soil nitrogen and phosphorus are predicted using
NIR spectrophotometry technology [71–73]. The soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa)
sensors collect information continuously on the ﬁeld surface, since ECa is sensitive to
changes in soil texture and salinity. Soil insects/pests are detected using optoelectronic,
acoustic, impedance sensors, and nanostructured biosensors [74].
4.7. Rate Controllers
Rate controllers are designed to control the delivery rate of inputs by monitoring the
speed of vehicles across the ﬁeld, and altering the ﬂow rate of material on a real-time basis
at the target rate. Rate controllers are commonly used as stand-alone systems [75].
4.8. Precision Irrigation in Pressurized Systems
Recent developments in irrigation systems have introduced irrigation machines, de-
voted to motion control, GPS-based controllers, sensor technologies, and wireless commu-
nication to monitor soil and climatic conditions together with an assessment of irrigation
parameters, i.e., ﬂow and pressure, to attain greater water utilization efﬁciency by crop.
These technologies show signiﬁcant potential; however, further progress is required before
they can become commercially available [76].
4.9. Yield Monitor
Yield monitors are the combination of sensors and components, including a data
storage device, a computer, and user interface, that control integration and interaction
components. The sensor measures yield continuously by evaluating the force of mass or
volume of grain ﬂow. The mass ﬂow sensor was based on the principle of transmitting
microwave energy beams and measuring the energy that bounces back after hitting. In
yield monitors, GPS receivers create yield maps based on the location yield data [77].
The yield monitor is mounted on a harvester and connected with the mobile app for
displaying live harvest data, and automatically uploads to the web-based platform. The
app can generate and share high-quality yield maps with an agronomist, and farmers
can export other farm management data for analysis. In horticultural crops, to precisely
determine the yield quantity and quality of produce, fruit growth is considered one of
the most relevant parameters in the crop progressing period [78]. Color images are used
to track fruit conditions for estimating fruit maturation, making decisions for harvesting,
and targeting the right market [79]. Satellite images are one of the options for real-time
monitoring of the yield of crops over vast areas; for example, Sentinel-1A images are used
to map the rice yield and crop intensity in Myanmar [80].
The crop yield estimation system was designed using both software and hardware
components. Based on a Bluetooth terminal android application and yield estimator
software program, crop yield is estimated using a mathematical calculation through a
mobile application [81]. Satellite-based crop yield predictions based on spectral signatures
reveal the estimated yields are as reliable as actual yields. The maize yield predictions
were successfully carried out under varying environments using machine learning and
satellite-derived data assimilation in crop models [82].
4.10. Software
The software has multiple tasks, such as mapping, display controller interfacing, data
processing, analysis, and interpretation, etc. Most commonly, software is used to generate
Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745
10 of 26
the maps for soil properties and nutrient status, yield maps, variable rate applications
maps for inputs, and overlaying different kinds of maps with advanced geostatistical
features [83].
5. Applications in Agriculture
By adopting the current sensor and IoT technologies in agriculture, each characteristic
of conventional farming practices is rehabilitated. The incorporation of wireless sensors
and IoT in smart farming answers many of the issues facing conventional agriculture; for
example, land suitability, drought monitoring, irrigation, pest control, and yield maximiza-
tion. Figure 5 demonstrates the order of main applications, facilities, and devices for smart
agriculture applications. Using advanced technologies at various stages in the following
few applications enhances efﬁciency and revolutionizes agriculture.
Figure 5. Hierarchy of probable applications, facilities and devices for smart agriculture.

5.1. Soil Mapping and Plant Monitoring
Soil analysis estimates the nutrient status of the ﬁeld based on GPS position and
ﬁeld-speciﬁc information, and critical decisions are then taken according to the nutrient
deﬁciencies at different stages of the crop. The factors controlling soil fertility status are
topography, type and texture, cropping pattern, application of fertilizer, irrigation, etc. [84].
Soil mapping is useful for assessing crop suitability or varieties in a speciﬁc ﬁeld, as well
as planting depth, the physical, chemical and biological properties of soil, in order to
best utilize resources. Presently, a wide range of sensors and tools are used to monitor
soil properties, such as water-holding capacity, texture, and absorption rate, which assists
farmers in tracking the soil quality and adopting suitable remedies to avoid soil degradation
such as erosion, alkalization, acidiﬁcation, salinization, and pollution. Drought is another
concern that affects plant productivity and crop yield. Remote sensing techniques that
can obtain soil moisture data frequently assist in analyzing agricultural drought in remote
regions. Soil moisture maps generated from satellite data are used to estimate the soil water
deﬁcit index (SWDI), which enables the development of prediction models based on soil
physical properties [85,86].
Various factors, such as soil type, soil nutrients, irrigation, and pests, affect rice yield
and quality. The IoT-based mobile application aids crop management and provides real-
time information on soil nutrition and characteristics. The system consists of electrical
conductivity (EC), temperature sensors with a T-Beam microcontroller, and IoT connectivity,
and the estimated EC value near the calibration solution is 12.88 mS/cm, and 150 mS/cm
is less than 2% of the calibration solution’s value. The measured EC values are linearly
proportional to temperature and depth, and values of 1.04 and 3.86 mS/cm were noticed
with and without fertilizer at 5 cm depth, while it was 0.656 and 420 mS/cm at 10 cm depth,
respectively [87].
Plant monitoring conducted through the IoT ADCON-based station, with sensors
and mobile devices (smartphones and tablets), farmers are able to collect data on soil and
ambient parameters, such as leaf wetness, air and soil temperature, soil and air humidity to
improve the grape productivity, and crop quality from seeding to harvest. Further, the data
transmission system highlights the soil-plant-atmosphere interactions needed to optimize
agricultural production [88]. By analyzing the data from soil moisture, carbon dioxide,
light, and temperature sensors in bell peppers grown in a greenhouse were compared with
day and night CO2, rolling the doors and windows of the greenhouse open and closed,
based on soil moisture [89].
5.2. Irrigation
According to the UN Convention to Combat Desertiﬁcation (UNCCD), 168 countries
will be inundated with desertiﬁcation by 2030, and nearly 50% of the world population
lives in high water shortage areas [90]. Considering the water crises and increasing demand
for farming and other activities, it must be provided to regions with water quantities. Water
resources are conserved by adopting more controlled and efﬁcient irrigation systems; for
example, drip and sprinkler irrigations. Water demand estimation for crops is controlled
by soil type, precipitation, irrigation method, crop type, and requirement, as well as soil
moisture retention. Using air and soil moisture control systems with wireless sensors
optimizes water resources and improves crop health. In the current scenario, a substantial
increase in crop productivity is anticipated using IoT techniques, namely CWSI (crop water
stress index)-based water management [91], calculated from the crop canopy at varying
crop growth stages and air temperatures. The information from climate data, sensors, and
satellite imaging are related to the CWSI model for water requirement calculation, and
predictions using the irrigation index values can be used for every ﬁeld based on slope or
soil variability to improve water usage efﬁciency.
Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

5.3. Site-Speciﬁc Nutrient Management
Fertilizer is a either natural or synthetic chemical substance that provides nutrients for
plant growth and soil fertility. Both nutrient deﬁciency and excessive fertilizer use harms
soil, plant health, and the environment [92]. The site-speciﬁc soil nutrient fertilization under
smart agriculture estimates the required quantity of nutrients precisely, and minimizes
their negative effects through excessive use on soil and in the environment. The site-
speciﬁc soil, nutrient measurements are inﬂuenced by soil types, crop type, yield targets,
exchange capacity, use efﬁciency, the type of fertilizer, weather conditions, etc. The IoT-
based fertilizing technique estimates the nutrient’s spatial patterns of distribution [93,94].
The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was obtained from satellite images to
observe crop nutrient status [95,96], crop health, vegetation vigor, and plant density, as well
as soil nutrient level. Recent technologies, like GPS [97], geo mapping [98], variable rate
technology (VRT) [99,100], and autonomous vehicles [101] strongly contribute to IoT-based
smart fertilization. Apart from these, fertigation [102] and chemigation [103,104], i.e., the
use of water-soluble fertilizers in soil amendments and pesticides, are considered effective
management practices to improve fertilization efﬁciency.
5.4. Crop Pest and Disease Management
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) concluded that an annual global crop
yield loss of 20- 40% was only due to pests and diseases [105], and these losses are controlled
by the use of pesticides and other agrochemicals [106]. Most of them are harmful to human
and animal health, and ultimately cause contamination of environmental systems [107,108].
The IoT-based devices, such as robots, wireless sensors, and drones, precisely spot and
control the crop opponents by real-time monitoring, modelling, and disease forecasting,
increasing overall effectiveness [109,110] more than traditional pest control procedures.
The IoT-based disease and pest management process depends on detection and image
processing. The remote sensing imagery and ﬁeld sensors are used to collect data, such
as plant health and pest incidence, in every ﬁeld for the entire crop period. IoT-based
automated traps [111,112] capture, count, and describe insect types, and further upload
data to the Cloud for complete analysis. Due to advancements in robotic technology,
an agricultural robot with multispectral image sensing devices and precision spraying
nozzles is utilized to detect and control pest problems more accurately under the IoT
management system.
5.5. Yield Monitoring and Forecasting
The yield monitoring mechanism conforms to yield, moisture content, and quality of
produce. The quality depends on pollination with good pollen, especially under changing
environmental circumstances [113–115]. Crop forecasting predicts the yield before the crop
harvest, and assists the farmer in future planning, decision-making, and further analysis of
the yield quality. Maturity determines the right harvesting time by monitoring the crop at
different development stages, including factors such as fruit color, size, etc. Predictions of
the correct harvesting time aids in maximizing crop quality and production, and regulates
market management strategies. Therefore, farmers should know the exact harvest time of
crops to obtain proﬁt. Figure 6 outlines the idea of a farm area network, representing the
whole farm in real-time conditions.
The development and installation of a yield monitor [116] on a harvester, connected
with a mobile app, shows real-time crop harvest, and automatically transmits data to
the manufacturer’s web-based platform. To estimate crop production and monitoring,
satellite images are exploited to cover vast areas [80]. For fruit crops, multicolor (RGB)
satellite images [79] are utilized to track the diverse fruit conditions, especially fruit size
and color, and plays a major role in estimating its maturation, making decisions on harvest,
and market opportunities. Similarly, multiple optical sensors are used [117] to monitor
shrinking fruits during drying conditions.

6. Role of IoT in Advanced Farming Practices
Adopting the new methods based on sensor and IoT-based technologies improved
the yield of crops more than conventional agriculture processes. The involvement of new
sophisticated sensor-based technologies in controlled environments plays an important
role in enhancing the quality and quantity of produce.
6.1. Greenhouse Farming and Protected Cultivation
Growing plants in a controlled environment gained popularity in the 19th Century,
and is considered one of the oldest methods of smart farming. These practices further
accelerated during the 20th Century in countries facing severe weather conditions [118].
Crops grown in indoor conditions are less affected by the environment. As a result,
crops grown traditionally under suitable conditions are today being raised at anytime and
anywhere by the use of sensors and communication devices. The success of crop production
under a controlled environment depends on various factors, such as shed structures and
material for controlling wind effects, aeration systems, accuracy of monitoring parameters,
decision support system, etc. [119]. One of the greatest challenges in greenhouses is the
precise monitoring of environmental parameters; hence, it requires several measurement
points to predict the various parameters for controlling and ensuring the local climate. In
an IoT-based greenhouse, sensors are used to measure and monitor the internal parameters,
such as humidity, temperature, light, and pressure [120].
The smart greenhouse has helped farmers automatically conduct farm work, without
manual inspection, and protects the plants from hailstorms, winds, ultraviolet radiation,
and insect and pest attacks. Hibiscus plants are grown with the required wavelength during
the night using lights, temperature, and air humidity sensors. A study revealed a reduction
in 70–80% water requirement, and the IoT enables direct contact between the farmer and
consumer to make farming as efﬁcient and proﬁtable as possible [121]. The IoT-enabled
automated system increased the productivity of rose plants grown in a greenhouse by
Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745
14 of 26
monitoring and controlling various parameters, such as humidity, mist, CO2 level, UV light
intensity, pH and EC value, water nutrients solution level, temperature, and amount of
pesticides, through sensors for further efﬁcient detection and diagnosis [122].
6.2. Hydroponics
Hydroponics, a subdivision of hydroculture, is growing plants without soil to improve
greenhouse farming beneﬁts. Hydroponic-based irrigation systems enable a balanced rate
of application of dissolved nutrients in the water to crop roots as a solution. Presently,
the available systems and sensors [123] detect a wide range of parameters and perform
data analysis at predetermined intervals. Precise measurement and monitoring of nutrient
content in solution is crucial for plant growth and considers its demands. On a real-
time basis, the wireless-sensor-based prototype [124] has delivered a solution for soilless
cultivation, and measures the concentration of numerous nutrients and water levels [125].
An automated smart hydroponics system integrated with IoT consists of three major
components: input data, cloud server and output data. These monitor lettuce cultivation
from anywhere through the internet by analyzing parameters, such as pH level, water,
nutrient-rich water-based solution, room temperature, and humidity, on a real-time ba-
sis [126]. The hydroponic system of the deep ﬂow technique is a method for cultivating
plants by placing roots in deep water layers, and ensuring the continuous circulation of
plant nutrient solution. The plant growth elements data, such as pH, temperature, humid-
ity, and water level in the hydroponic reservoir, are acquired by sensors integrated into
Raspberry Pi, and data are processed and monitored automatically on a real-time basis to
ensure proper water circulation [127].
6.3. Vertical Farming
The industrial-based agricultural farming practices damage soil quality at a faster
rate than nature can reconstruct. The alarming erosion rate and use of fresh water for
agriculture has led to the reduction of arable land, and increased the overburden on present
water reservoirs [128]. Vertical farming (VF) offers an opportunity to keep the plants in a
precisely controlled environment, signiﬁcantly reducing resource consumption and, at the
same time, increasing production at varied times; and only a portion of the ground surface
is needed depending on the number of stacks. VF is also extremely effective in higher
yields and reducing water consumption compared to traditional farming [129]. The carbon
dioxide measurement is the most critical parameter; hence, nondispersive infrared (NDIR)
CO2 sensors play a vital part in tracking and controlling the conditions in vertical farms.
6.4. Phenotyping
Phenotyping is an emerging crop engineering technique, relating plant genomics with
ecophysiology and agronomy. The advancement of genetic and molecular tools is signiﬁ-
cant for crop breeding; however, quantitative analysis of crop behaviors, such as pathogen
resistance, grain weight, etc., is inadequate due to the absence of effective technologies
and efﬁcient techniques. In this condition, [130] reported that plant phenotyping is highly
useful in investigating the quantitative characteristics responsible for growth, resistance
to various stresses, yield quality, and quantity. The sensing technologies and image-based
phenotyping describe screening of biostimulants and an understanding of their mode
of action [131]. IoT-based phenotyping is intended to observe the crop and related trait
measurements, and offer facilities for the breeding of crops and digital agriculture [132].
The trait analysis algorithms and modelling support determine the relationships among
genotypes, phenotypes, and their growing condition.
7. The Role of the Engineer in Smart Farming
Farmers face many issues when they adopt IoT-based agriculture. Therefore, engi-
neers must develop solutions for speciﬁc problems related to smart farming techniques. An
engineering role concerns the application and use of innovative technologies and methods
Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745
15 of 26
for precision agricultural machinery, and smart farming is a creative way to mechanize
agricultural engineering through means different from conventional mechanization [133].
The concepts and synergy-based information are obtained from different technology areas,
such as agricultural mechanization, mechatronics, instrumentation, control systems, and
knowledge in artiﬁcial and computational intelligence [134]. Big data, satellite, and aerial
images have revolutionized precision agriculture, and these new technologies increase
production efﬁciency by creating a balance between productivity and environmental pro-
tection. As a system integrator, engineering combines technical experience and strong
business skills in both the public and private sectors [135].
At the same time, engineering exploits the rewards of digital transformation in the
entire agri-food chain, from day-to-day farming activities to supporting sales operations,
logistics, and the maintenance of farm assets. For example, knowledge of the IoT, AI,
mobile, precision farming technologies, remote sensing, advanced analytics, the Cloud,
RPA, and blockchain technologies are necessary [136]. The data collected from the various
types of machinery through sensors and other devices generates responses concerning
cereals, viticulture, fruit, and vegetables, as well as soil and monitoring [137].
The use of digital technologies and control systems to automate production processes
also reduces manual human intervention. The production process, from ﬁeld to ﬁnal
product, is carried out by planning, organizing, and analyzing data received from machines.
The data acquired are stored in historical archives and correlated with each other to
retrieve useful information for products through traceable systems working based on
radio-frequency signals [138].
7.1. Purpose
Purpose is based on the user’s ﬁnal requirement, and inﬂuences the monitoring of
crops during the growth period. Sensors provide the IoT solutions to their problems.
For example, the end-user is a corn farmer, faced by problems mainly concerning water
usage and ensuring that a crop gets adequate water; therefore, water level and moisture
monitoring sensors are accommodated to prevent water wastage.
7.2. Technology
Distance plays an important role in technology selection because the sensors collect
data and send to the server; hence, similar technology cannot be used for varying distances.
For example, radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) or near ﬁeld communication (NFC) and
low power, wide area network (LPWAN) technologies could send data over a distance of
hundreds or even thousands of meters.
7.3. Power Requirements
Most IoT solutions are spread across a large farm, so it is better to develop low-
power applications. On the other hand, more data transmission requires huge data costs
and power consumption; hence, designers need to consider developing cost-effective IoT
solutions for farmers. Usually, engineers save costs with customized IoT-based farming
solutions, and develop apps for sending the data less frequently.
7.4. Data Frequency
The end user’s necessities are critical in deciding the number of sensors and data
packets. Sometimes, a farmer does not require information frequently, but developer design
an IoT application to function on a continual and real-time basis, with very high data
frequency.
7.5. Placement of Sensors
Sensors are placed in such a way that they provide optimal performance, even if the
farm has all the essential sensors with proper placement.

8. Barriers to Implementing Smart Farming Technologies
Technology adoption is a method with a certain level of heterogeneity factors that
are affective [139]. Technology implemented in farming systems has provided accuracy,
efﬁciency, and eased time pressures. Although smart farming increases the productivity of
crops, there are still problems in adopting these technologies
8.1. Cost of Technology
Existing technologies minimize the workforce and perform extremely fast with high
accuracy. Therefore, it is anticipated that machines would probably replace a human work-
force in the near future. However, it is impossible, since many countries have experienced
poverty wherever the workforce was the main source for the agriculture sector. The imple-
mentation of devices and technologies requires a huge amount of money; therefore, farmers
face difﬁculties in terms of affordability when they look beyond conventional tools.
8.2. Lack of Financial Resources
Financial supporters could provide adequate loans to farmers if farmers did not get
the anticipated yield, perhaps because unexpected calamities like drought, ﬂood, pests,
and diseases impacted the crops.
8.3. Literacy Status of Farmers
The education level among the farmers is one of the greater challenges in implementing
technologies in developing countries. The knowledge needed encompasses educational and
technical abilities to manage the tools. The level of education increases a farmers’ aptitude
to process information, and thus make decisions using smart farming technologies [140],
facilitating farmers’ use of computers [141]. Farmers in developing nations are mostly
uneducated and unskilled because of a lack of desire to gain knowledge, or any new
technology awareness [142]. Hence, it is a reason for farmers in choosing traditional
farming over smart farming [143]. Farmers have considered that usage is too complex,
sometimes incapable of recognizing the icons used in a mobile application as the farmers
use general icons based on traditional understanding. Farmers need to be digitally literate
to reinforce the advantages of smart farming technologies and, simultaneously, agri-tech
companies should ensure farmers easily understand the limitations of the technology.
8.4. Lack of Integration between the Systems
Integration across systems is one of the areas where smart farming technologies needs
to be advanced further by incorporating production, property management, and decision-
making tools. The communication between academics and interdisciplinary groups must
overcome the gap between agricultural and information science. More emphasis has
been given to increasing user effectiveness during the development of an information
system [144]. The basis for improved decision-making is based on the timely obtain-
ability of superior quality data; hence, data must be integrated to generate information
and knowledge.
8.5. Telecommunications Infrastructure
Farming activities mostly occur in rural areas more effectively in arable land than
contaminated land. However, poor telecommunication infrastructure makes data transmis-
sion unreliable, especially through mobile phones and tablets. Smart farming necessitates
a real-time connection with the internet to enable the use of information. In addition,
various operation control systems, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and seed volume, requires
high-quality internet connection to produce outcomes. Recently, with the expansion of
mobile phones, rural producers have gained to access mobile internet; however, signal
quality and input speed are limited.
Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745
17 of 26
8.6. Data Management
Farmers are facing problems in organizing and manipulating data obtained by the
sensors. The weather stations are generating data; however, farmers do not recognize how
to use the information and how to change the data into a more available form. Its complex
systems, alongside issues of acceptability and usability, lead to incorrect calculations.
Farmers, consultants, and others involved in the production process must provide greater
accessibility to data and information in productive systems.
9. Current Challenges and Future Expectations
In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the United Nations and international
community established a goal to end hunger by 2030. Currently, the World Health Organi-
zation reports that more than 800 million people are facing food shortages worldwise [145].
In addition, the increasing global population is increasing the demand for quality food;
therefore, food and cash crops could improve overall crop production.
Figure 7 represents the future challenges agriculture is anticipated to face in 2050. This
illustration offers three major problems: (1) feeding 10 billion people, (2) limitations in the
expansion of land, and (3) the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions. These challenges
lead to new thinking about water scarcity, shrinking arable land, rural labor, climate condi-
tions, and much more. The diminishment in rural populations due to urbanization is not
only shrinking communities, but is also leading to ageing populations; therefore, younger
growers must step forward to take responsibility. The generation shift and population
imbalance create further implications for the workforce and production.
Figure 7. Challenges in sustainable future agriculture.
The further shrinking of arable land and the suitability of particular crops in speciﬁc
regions are due to geographic and ecological conditions. Abrupt weather changes enhance
the intensity of environmental issues, such as drought, groundwater depletion, and soil
degradation, affecting crop production. Moreover, traditional agricultural methods have
historically met food demands by employing fertilizers and pesticides; however, it increases
food production only to a certain level and negligent use of chemical deteriorate the envi-
ronment. In developing countries, various problems facing the agricultural sector include
no suitable crop selection, soil testing, efﬁcient irrigation systems, weather forecasting,
animal husbandry, etc. Technological advancements have proved beneﬁcial in developed
countries, both quantitively and qualitatively, but, in developing countries, 50% of the
population is already engaged in agriculture.
Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

The future of agriculture is expected to interconnect with artiﬁcial intelligence and
big data services. As a result, the systems will converge into a single unit, where farm
machinery and management start from seeding to production forecasting. Few of the key
technologies and methods are focused on achieving sustainable future agriculture.
9.1. Communication
The achievement of the IoT in agriculture mostly depends on connectivity between
devices [146]. Most telecom operators provide connectivity services, but represent a small
percentage of smart farming as a whole. Cellular operators offer new services to target
growers and enhance market facilities, especially in rural areas. The success of cellular
technology is feasible when service providers guarantee its beneﬁts, such as ﬂexibility,
portability, and extravagance, of both-way communication at low cost. In developing
countries, mobile services and smartphone technology offer a hopeful future for farmers
to enhance their crop yields. The low power wide area technology (LPWA) is anticipated
to play a major role in smart farming agriculture, due to its improved facilities, efﬁcient
coverage, low power consumption, and cost economics. The cellular operators with robust
IoT create signiﬁcant returns by offering smart agriculture facilities in collaboration with
LPWA technology.
9.2. Wireless Sensors and IoT
Placing wireless sensors around the ﬁeld provides timely information on a real-time
basis to farmers in order to make decisions and act in order to obtain higher crop yields.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with GPS technology update all information on crop
growth and terrain features. Recently, digital images and signal processing offer additional
competencies to WSN, and precisely ascertain crop quality and health. The IoT technology
can streamline tasks in a predictable manner by diagnosing crop requirements at each
stage to maximize their effectiveness. In the future, IoT will be upgraded to the ﬁfth-
generation (5G) cellular mobile communication technologies, to provide real-time data
to farmers at any time and everywhere. Based on this achievement, around 29 billion
IoT-based components are expected to operate in the agriculture sector by the end of 2022.
Furthermore, it is expected to create 4.1 million data points daily from farms by 2050 [147].
9.3. Drones and Unarmed Vehicles
Farmers widely use drones for crop growth monitoring, spraying nutrient solutions
and water, and pesticides in tough terrains and for different crop heights. Drones have
proven their value for spraying speed, area coverage, and precision, compared to tradi-
tional machinery. Due to advancements in technology, drones are equipped with various
sensors, and 3D cameras provide comprehensive capabilities in land management by
farmers. With the addition of UAVs in agriculture, many challenges, particularly the in-
corporation of technologies and use in inclement weather conditions, are addressed by
farmers. Other than drones, robotics in agriculture has also enhanced productivity due to
higher yields achieved by spraying and weeding without human intervention. The seeding,
transplanting, and fruit harvest/picking robots have recently added a new efﬁciency level
to traditional methods.
The UAV technology in smart agriculture provides information on fertilization, ir-
rigation, use of pesticides, plant growth monitoring, weed management, crop disease
management, and ﬁeld-level phenotyping to enhance cultivation practices. A new method
of 3D modeling has been used to monitor crop growth parameters to determine the height
of maize and sorghum plants under ﬁeld conditions using UAV, and the average root mean
square error (RMSE) of sorghum height with hand sampling ﬁeld data was 0.33 m [148]. The
UAV and 3D models were also restored to extract leaf area index (LAI) in soybean plants,
the measured LAI predicted accuracy corresponding to the handheld device (R2 = 0.92)
was correlated with destructive LAI measurements (R2 = 0.89) [149].
Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

Weed detection and management were assessed by integrating low-resolution multi-
spectral high-resolution RGB images [150] using the Random Forest (RF) technique in
ﬁeld-grown rice and sugar beet crops [151]. Multi-spectral digital images obtained by
UAVs are used for evaluating vegetation indices (VIs) and multi-temporal VIs to predict
grain yield in wheat [152]. The indices, including the normalized difference vegetation
index (NDVI), spectral vegetation index (SVI), and green area index (GAI), are evaluated in
wheat crops to predict grain yield [153], monitor breeding [154], detect plant stress caused
by yellow rust disease [155], and quantify plant density [156]. The usage of pesticides in
agriculture is crucial for crop yields and the environment, and efforts have been made to
develop and evaluate an algorithm to self-adjust UAV routes during chemical spraying in a
crop ﬁeld to reduce the waste of pesticides and fertilizers [157].
9.4. Vertical Farming and Hydroponics
The shrinking of arable land and rapid urbanization results in greater pressure on the
present resources [158], which causes hardships for food production with current agricul-
ture practices. Vertical farming (VF) navigates land and water shortage challenges, and
is highly suitable for adoption in nearby cities. Hydroponics plays a key role in lowering
water requirements. Hydroponics, along with VF, increases available arable land without
distressing forests and other natural habitats. The presence of advanced technologies,
especially the IoT, makes the agriculture industry highly remunerative with a reduction in
labor requirements and other resources, in addition to minimizing environmental impact.
9.5. Performance Analysis Using Machine Learning
Data analytics and machine learning concepts are applied to analyze the real-time
data. In crop production, identifying the best genes is an important process that can be
conducted using machine learning techniques. In agriculture, machine learning is used to
envisage the best genes suited for crop production, especially for selecting seed varieties
that are highly suitable to speciﬁc climate conditions and locations. Machine learning
algorithms identify high demand products and currently unavailable products. Recent
developments in machine learning and analytics allow farmers to correctly categorize their
harvests before it is processes and delivered to customers.
Machine learning (ML) in big data systems solves the issues related to farmers’
decision-making, crops, animal research, land, food availability and security, weather
and climate change, and weeds [159]. ML-based applications accommodate a large number
of agricultural activities, such as yield prediction based on a deep memory model for
maize [160], binary classiﬁcation model with logistic regression technique to assess rainfall
intensity [161], and a short-term memory model to predict soil water content with data
parameters of rainfall, temperature, water diversion, evaporation, and time for the next
1, 2, and 7 days with greater R2 compared to artiﬁcial neural networks [162]. As a result,
the agricultural sector is increasing farmers’ incomes, and so communities are further
integrated into the agricultural value chain to reduce poverty and provide access to health
care, education, and nutritious food for their families [163].
9.6. Renewable Energy, Microgrids and Smart Grids
Smart farming requires extensive energy due to power consumption by long-standing
sensor placement, use of GPS, and data transmission. Traditionally, using renewable energy
sources in remote areas solves long-term power issues. Smart grids and microgrids are
integrated into distributed energy sources (DERs). Recent advances in storage devices
combine electricity and heat systems to stock energy and use the heat produced.
Globally, smart grid technology enables a smooth transition from traditional to smart
energy systems, ensuring energy security. In developing countries, power-strengthening
systems integrated with renewable sources have enhanced the transport sector, and in-
creased bioenergy use in the power sector through profuse renewable energy sources
identiﬁed using smart technologies, such as, energy storage devices, smart appliances,

computational intelligence, and the IoT. For example, the smart grid provides a broad
range of opportunities for power sector reform in Nepal, alleviating the rural electricity
problem by implementing smart microgrids, and subsequently, connecting to the national
grid [164]. The Dayalbagh renewable energy smart microgrid in India is a small-scale
electricity system comprising distributed loads and renewable energy resources, acting as a
single controllable entity in the grid. The smart microgrids are integrated into renewable
resources and form building blocks of smart grids, especially for the dairy plant to produce
various dairy products [165].
The mixed integer linear programme (MILP) systematically and efﬁciently managed
energy consumption and subsequently lowered the cost, especially in residential areas,
by scheduling the use of smart appliances and charging/discharging electric vehicles
(EVs). The model generates its own energy from a microgrid containing solar panels
and wind turbines, and forecasts wind speed and solar radiation for effective energy
management. MILP-based energy planning sustains the effectiveness and productiveness
of energy-efﬁcient techniques [166].
10. Conclusions
Smarter and more efﬁcient crop production methodologies are needed to address the
issues of shrinking arable land and the food demands of an increasing world population.
There is a necessity for everyone to be aware of food security in terms of sustainable
agriculture. The growth of new technologies for increasing crop yield and encouraging
the adoption of farming by innovative young people as a legitimate profession. This
paper emphasized the role of many technologies used for farming, particularly the IoT,
in making agriculture smarter and more effective in meeting future requirements. The
current challenges faced by the industry and future prospects are noted to guide scholars
and engineers. Hence, every piece of farmland is important to enhance crop production by
dealing with every inch of land using sustainable IoT-based sensors and communication
technologies.

  Explanation: Remote sensing using Sentinel-1 images is a promising method for soil moisture monitoring. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are powerful machine learning tools that have been successfully applied to image analysis. In this study, the authors propose a CNN architecture for predicting soil moisture content over agricultural areas from Sentinel-1 images. The CNN architecture uses dual-polarization Sentinel-1 images (VV and VH) as input and is trained using in-situ soil moisture measurements from the OZNET and WEGENERNET soil moisture monitoring networks.

The authors found that their proposed CNN architecture outperforms other methods for predicting soil moisture from Sentinel-1 images. The CNN architecture achieves a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.8664, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0144, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0274. The authors also found that VV polarization is more sensitive than VH polarization for soil moisture retrieval, and that the combination of VV and VH polarization improves the prediction accuracy.

This study demonstrates the potential of CNNs for soil moisture retrieval from Sentinel-1 images. The proposed CNN architecture can be used to generate high-resolution soil moisture maps over large areas, which can be valuable for a wide range of applications, such as precision agriculture, water resource management, and drought monitoring.

Abstract: Achieving the rational, optimal, and sustainable use of resources (water and soil) is vital to
drink and feed 9.725 billion by 2050. Agriculture is the ﬁrst source of food production, the biggest
consumer of freshwater, and the natural ﬁlter of air puriﬁcation. Hence, smart agriculture is a “ray of
hope” in regard to food, water, and environmental security. Satellites and artiﬁcial intelligence have
the potential to help agriculture ﬂourish. This research is an essential step towards achieving smart
agriculture. Prediction of soil moisture is important for determining when to irrigate and how much
water to apply, to avoid problems associated with over- and under-watering. This also contributes
to an increase in the number of areas being cultivated and, hence, agricultural productivity and
air puriﬁcation. Soil moisture measurement techniques, in situ, are point measurements, tedious,
time-consuming, expensive, and labor-intensive. Therefore, we aim to provide a new approach to
detect moisture content in soil without actually being in contact with it. In this paper, we propose
a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that can predict soil moisture content over
agricultural areas from Sentinel-1 images. The dual-pol (VV–VH) Sentinel-1 SAR data have being
utilized (V = vertical, H = horizontal). The CNN model is composed of six convolutional layers, one
max-pooling layer, one ﬂatten layer, and one fully connected layer. The total number of Sentinel-
1 images used for running CNN is 17,325 images. The best values of the performance metrics
(coefﬁcient of determination (R2 = 0.8664), mean absolute error (MAE = 0.0144), and root mean
square error (RMSE = 0.0274)) have been achieved due to the use of Sigma naught VH and Sigma
naught VV as input data to the CNN architecture (C). Results show that VV polarization is better
than VH polarization for soil moisture retrieval, and that Sigma naught, Gamma naught, and Beta
naught have the same inﬂuence on soil moisture estimation.

1. Introduction
Water is the “mainspring” that determines the survival and development of life on
Earth. Arable land continues to be lost due to urbanization and desertiﬁcation [1]. The
world population is projected to reach 9.725 billion by 2050 [2]. Accordingly, work should
be done to increase agricultural production and improve water management, to absorb
population growth and its requirements for food and water.
Soil moisture content is generally deﬁned as the temporary storage of water within the
upper layer of soil [3]. Knowledge of soil water content plays a pivotal role in improving
efﬁcient water management [4]. Irrigation scheduling is an important water management
strategy, which refers to the perfect amount of irrigation to apply to the ﬁeld and the perfect

timing for application [5]. Irrigation scheduling depends on the estimate of the soil moisture
content [6]. The measurement of soil moisture content in situ is hard and expensive
because it necessitates a repeated sampling process to analyze the periodical changes
in soil moisture [7]. All soil moisture content measurement methods are divided into
two broad categories—direct and indirect monitoring [8]. The most common techniques
used for estimating soil moisture content in situ are gravimetric, neutron probe, time
domain reﬂectometry (TDR), frequency domain reﬂectometry (FDR), and tensiometer
techniques [9].
Research in the retrieval of soil moisture from satellite imagery has been vital in the
past three decades, and we expect this trend to continue into the following decades. Surface
soil moisture (SSM) is the water content available in the upper 0–5 cm of the soil layer,
whereas the water that is available to plants is called root zone soil moisture, which is
generally considered to be in the upper 0–200 cm of soil layer [9]. Therefore, estimating
the amount of soil moisture in the root zone is more valuable and effective than surface
soil moisture in agricultural and hydrological applications [10]. Direct determination of
soil moisture in the root zone by remote sensing satellites is a laborious task and a serious
challenge [11]. Direct soil observations are only possible in the case of bare soil (i.e., absence
of vegetation) and, therefore, detecting soil moisture using remote sensing is suitable for
a few days per year [12]. Compared to the visible and infrared, microwaves have many
special qualities and advantages that are important for remote sensing [13]. Microwaves
have long wavelengths—radiations can penetrate cloud cover, haze, and dust [14]. This
characteristic enables detection of microwave energy in all environmental and weather
conditions; hence, the ability to collect and capture data anytime [15]. Microwave remote
sensing methods are suited for the detection and determination of soil moisture in the upper
centimeters of the soil [16]. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imaging is a promising
method for soil moisture monitoring [17]. SAR systems can be used to investigate and
retrieve soil moisture (0–5 cm depth) over agricultural areas [18]. The Sentinel-1 (S1) satellite
characteristics include high spatial resolution and high revisit time; hence, Sentinel-1 is
suitable for mapping and monitoring soil moisture over agricultural areas [19]. Sentinel-1
images can be used to retrieve soil moisture over wheat-covered areas [20]. VV polarization
was more sensitive for soil moisture retrieval from Sentinel-1 data as compared to VH
polarization [21–23]. Several studies have indicated that the accuracy of the soil moisture
estimates improved when using both VV and VH polarization, instead of only VV or VH
polarization [24–26].
Artiﬁcial intelligence is an integrated environment of various scientiﬁc ﬁelds [27].
Artiﬁcial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence in machines [28]. Machine
learning is one of the most important branches of artiﬁcial intelligence [29]. Machine learn-
ing aims to develop algorithms that are capable of learning, improving, and generalizing
from a given collection of examples [30] without being explicitly programmed [31]. Deep
learning is a specialized subset of machine learning [32]. In deep learning, a convolutional
neural network (CNN) is a special class of artiﬁcial neural networks [33]. CNN is famous
for its accurate and computationally efﬁcient, powerful learning ability, and automatic
high-level feature extraction [34]. CNN is one of the best available techniques for unstruc-
tured data types [35]. CNN has showed impressive achievements across a wide variety of
domains, especially in computer vision related ﬁelds [36]. CNN is most commonly applied
to analyze images [37], and feature extraction from images [38]. CNN can achieve a better
performance than the linear regression model [39], and the support vector regression [40].
From the above, we conclude that all soil moisture measurement methods under ﬁeld
conditions are accurate with varying degrees. Common challenges and problems that exist
in soil moisture measurement methods under ﬁeld conditions are (1) point measurement
methods (meaning, these techniques can only express soil moisture at speciﬁc points,
and not at the entire cultivated area). (2) Regular periodic maintenance, thus require
intensive labor. (3) The need for site-speciﬁc calibration. (4) The actual contact with the soil;
and (5) the costs. We, therefore, intend to provide a new approach to knowing moisture

content in soil without actually being in contact with it. In this paper, we propose a
convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that can predict soil moisture content
from Sentinel-1 images.
2. Material and Methods
Soil moisture detection is the ﬁrst step in the practical implementation of water
management. This paper proposes an algorithm for automatically detecting soil moisture
in the root zone (0–20 cm) by using CNN and satellite imagery. We focused on the soil
moisture retrieval from Sentinel-1 images. This study was conducted from 15 June 2014 to
1 November 2020.
2.1. Study Area and Data Acquisition
To achieve the soil moisture content estimation algorithm, two networks were se-
lected. The two networks are OZNET and WEGENERNET. These networks are part of
the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN). ISMN is an important source for soil
moisture data, it is a set of networks distributed globally [41,42]. Access to the data are
freely available at (https://ismn.geo.tuwien.ac.at/en/ (accessed on 13 November 2020)).
The ISMN database is a necessary and crucial means for validating and improving satellite
soil moisture products [43].
The OZNET network is located in Murrumbidgee catchment, South Eastern Australia.
This is a suitable place for assessing the skills and abilities of each satellite to remotely sense
the soil moisture. In this region, the climate ranges from semiarid to humid. Moreover, soil
texture ranges from sand to clay. The Murrumbidgee catchment contains 38 soil moisture-
monitoring stations on three subareas. These areas are Adelong Creek catchment, Kyeamba
Creek catchment, and the Yanco region. In this study, only 17 stations were selected
(6 stations in Kyeamba Creek catchment and 11 stations in Yanco region). Kyeamba Creek
catchment is about 600 km2 with gentle slopes; land use is mainly for grazing for sheep
and beef, with some dairy. The Yanco Region is ﬂat with an area of 2500 km2; land use
comprises dryland farming (in the north of the region), native pasture (southeast), and
irrigation with barley and rice as the main rotation crops (west). Within each station,
Campbell Scientiﬁc (CS615 or CS616 or Stevens Hydra Probe) water content reﬂectometers
were used to measure soil moisture content. In addition, time domain reﬂectometry (TDR)
probes were installed for calibrating the reﬂectometers. Site measured soil moisture data
are recorded every 20 min and at three depths on the soil. Additionally, each station
measures soil temperature, precipitation, soil suction, wind speed, air temperature, relative
humidity, and ancillary data. More information and a detailed explanation of this network
are provided in [44,45]. OZNET network data are freely available in (http://www.oznet.
org.au/ (accessed on 13 November 2020)). Primary information about stations used is
summarized in (Table 1).
The WegenerNet network is located in the Feldbach region, southeastern Styria,
Austria. This location is good and suitable for satellite product calibration and validation.
Feldbach region is affected by continental and Mediterranean climates. This region is
characterized by hot and rainy summers, and cold winters [46]. WegenerNet network
is a pioneering meteorological station network. It covers an area of approximately 22 ×
16 km and contains 155 stations including 12 soil moisture-monitoring stations, which
were numbered 6, 15, 19, 27, 34, 50, 54, 77, 78, 84, 85, and 99. The land where the stations
are located is used for many different purposes: the land of the stations 6, 19, 50, 77,
78, 84, and 85 for grassland; the land of the stations 15, 34, 54, and 99 for meadow; and
the land of the station 27 for fruit trees. The dominant soil texture is sandy loam in all
station sites, except station 19, soil texture is silty clay. Inside each station, Stevens Hydra
Probe II was used to measure soil moisture at a depth of 0–20 cm. In this study, level
2 half-hourly data from version 7 were used. Furthermore, each station measures soil
conductivity, soil temperature, diode temperature, air temperature, relative humidity, pF-
value, precipitation, and ancillary data. For additional information, a detailed description

of the location and network design can be found in [47–49]. The data generated by the
WegenerNet network are freely available for everyone at (http://www.wegenernet.org/
(accessed on 13 November 2020)). A brief description of the location of the stations already
used is contained in (Table 2).

2.2. Sentinel-1 Data Pre-Processing
In this paper, we aimed to retrieve soil moisture from Sentinel-1 imagery. The Sentinel-
1 radar mission was composed of a constellation of two satellites, Sentinel-1A (launched
on 3 April 2014) and Sentinel-1B (launched on 25 April 2016) [50]. A revisit time improved
from 12 to 6 days, by using both Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B [51–53]. Sentinel-1 provides
data at high spatial resolution (10 × 10 m) [54–56]. Sentinel-1 carries a dual-polarization
C-band synthetic aperture radar sensor [57]. Dual-polarization acquisitions are VV and
VH or HH and HV (V = vertical, H = horizontal) [58]. Sentinel-1 data are freely available,
accessible, and downloadable for everyone.
The Level-1 Ground-Range Detected High-Res Dual-Pol (GRD-HD) products in the
interferometric wide swath (IW) mode were used in this research. Sentinel-1 data used in
Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 4964
5 of 17
this study are available in dual-polarization, VV and VH. We downloaded all available
Sentinel-1 data between 15 June 2014 and 1 November 2020 (see Tables 1 and 2) from the
Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) (https://search.asf.alaska.edu (accessed on 17 November
2020)). The data obtained from ASF needed to be pre-processed before they were used. Pre-
processing of Sentinel-1 images were performed with the open-source processing software
SNAP (version 7.0), provided by the European Space Agency, which contains a collection
of tools for processing Sentinel-1 data. Batch processing is one of the most useful tools in
SNAP that can save manual effort, reduce processing time, and easily automate repetitive
tasks. Use the graph builder of SNAP to create a processing chain ﬁrst, and then use the
batch-processing tool.
In this paper, the processing chain consists of eight steps: subset, apply orbit ﬁle,
thermal noise removal, border noise removal, calibration, multi-looking, speckle ﬁltering,
and terrain correction. Soil moisture monitoring station covers a small area of land, while
the satellite image covers a very large area. The ﬁrst step should therefore be to determine
and create a subset of a Sentinel-1 product (5 × 5 km) this part is much larger than is
required in this study), which facilitates and speeds up the following pre-processing steps.
The following three steps were: apply orbit ﬁle, thermal noise removal, and border noise
removal, respectively, all run using the default settings. Then, the radiometric calibra-
tion was performed by selecting the Sigma naught (Sigma0), Gamma naught (Gamma0),
and Beta naught (Beta0) as output bands. Multi-looking was then implemented without
changing the default settings. The next step was to conduct speckle ﬁltering. The Lee ﬁlter
was implemented using kernel size (3 × 3). Terrain correction (Using SRTM 1Sec HGT
(Auto-Download)) was the ﬁnal pre-processing step during this study. We just ﬁnished the
pre-processing of Sentinel-1 data and we have images (5 × 5 km). Afterward, shapeﬁles
were created in ArcGIS for the areas covered by each station, so that each region (station)
has a shapeﬁle. The shapeﬁle was square and the center of a shapeﬁle is where the soil
moisture sensor was installed. Then, we used SNAP to subset the images using shapeﬁle.
We can now say that all images had the same size, the center of all images was the soil
moisture sensor, and they were fully ready to be trained and tested. Every Sentinel-1 image
consists of six bands: Sigma0_VH, Gamma0_VH, Beta0_VH, Sigma0_VV, Gamma0_VV,
and Beta0_VV.
2.3. Model Establishment
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is useful for researchers. CNN is an invaluable
and indispensable tool to deal with satellite images. In general, the CNN structure mainly
consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The hidden layers
of a CNN are typically comprised of convolutional layers, nonlinearity layers, pooling
layers, and fully connected layers. A convolution layer is responsible for feature extraction.
A nonlinearity layer mainly consists of an activation function (activation functions used
tanh, sigmoid, ReLU, and linear). Activation functions are a critical part of the design of
the network. In the hidden layer, the activation function type controls how well the model
learns the training dataset. In the output layer, the activation function type deﬁnes the type
of predictions the model can make. The pooling layer works to reduce the size of the input
images by keeping the most important features only. The output of convolution layers and
pooling layers is the input to the fully connected layers to get the ﬁnal output (prediction
of soil moisture content). For more information on designing CNN structures, see [59,60].
The overarching goal was to create a CNN model capable of predicting or retrieving
soil moisture from satellite imagery with high efﬁciency and accuracy. The harder, more
important step involves identifying the best-performing architecture. Figure 1 illustrates
the perfect design in terms of the number of layers used (this is a result of many attempts
and tests), which are appropriate for this type of data. One of the most useful features
of CNN is the possibility of using different activation functions for each layer. Based on
this feature, we used three CNN architectures exactly alike (A, B, and C), except for the
activation function, as shown in Figure 1.

soil moisture from satellite imagery with high efficiency and accuracy. The harder, more 
important step involves identifying the best-performing architecture. Figure 1 illustrates 
the perfect design in terms of the number of layers used (this is a result of many attempts 
and tests), which are appropriate for this type of data. One of the most useful features of 
CNN is the possibility of using different activation functions for each layer. Based on this 
feature, we used three CNN architectures exactly alike (A, B, and C), except for the acti-
vation function, as shown in Figure 1.

No one can deny that there is a strong positive correlation between inputs, feature
extraction processes, and outputs. CNN has tremendous potential to extract complex
features. Accordingly, the next critical step was to select and determine the best inputs,
which is done from Sentinel bands. The choice of the most suitable and appropriate ac-
tivation functions for CNN will help to achieve better performance and the maximum
score regression. We need to ﬁrst identify the impact of each band on soil moisture re-

are: cross-ratio (CR = σ0

VV) [61], Ratio (Ratio = σ0
VV/σ0

tion index (RVI = 4σ0

(NRPB =

) [70–72]. We therefore need to know the impact of
the use of these indices as input data to the CNN model on the soil moisture retrieval.
The total number of Sentinel-1 images used for running CNN is 17,325 images. During
the ﬁtting of the model, we split our dataset randomly into two parts: 80% for training and
20% for testing. Finally, coefﬁcient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and
root mean square error (RMSE) were used to estimate how good the performance of the
prediction model was designed.

an Intel Xeon Gold 5218 Processors (16-Cores, 16M Cache), 128 GB of RAM, and an NVIDIA
Quadro P4000 graphics cards (8 GB of RAM). CNN model building was implemented by
using the python programming language. Python is an integrated, powerful, and ﬂexible
language. Moreover, it is easy to learn, write, and understand.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Inﬂuence of VH and VV Polarization as Input Data to the CNN Model on the Soil
Moisture Retrieval
With this study, we found that the most appropriate CNN architecture for Sentinel-1
data are CNN architecture (C), as elaborated later in this paper. Therefore, we sufﬁce
with presenting its ﬁndings. Figure 2 summarizes the results obtained on Sentinel-1
bands, which were achieved by using the CNN model (CNN architecture (C)) proposed
in this study. This ﬁgure illustrates the relationship between in-situ soil moisture and
predicted soil moisture, clarifying R2, MAE, and RMSE metrics, for (1) each band separately;
(2) Sigma0_VH and Sigma0_VV; (3) Gamma0_VH and Gamma0_VV; (4) Beta0_VH and
Beta0_VV; (5) all VH bands together; (6) all VV bands together; and (7) all VH and VV
bands (6 bands).
In all, we noticed that VV bands were better than VH bands for soil moisture retrieval,
but the best way is to use both at the same time (e.g., Sigma0_VH and Sigma0_VV). The
coefﬁcients of determination (R2) for Sigma0_VH, Gamma0_VH, and Beta0_VH are 0.8078,
0.8023, and 0.8002, respectively. Similarly, R2 for Sigma0_VV, Gamma0_VV, and Beta0_VV
are 0.8399, 0.8337, and 0.8323, respectively. With the use of both VH and VV bands,
R2 values have improved to 0.8664, 0.8554, and 0.8527 for Sigma0_VH and Sigma0_VV,
Gamma0_VH and Gamma0_VV, and Beta0_VH and Beta0_VV, respectively. In the light
of the current ﬁndings: Arguably, Sigma0, Gamma0, and Beta0 have the same inﬂuence
on soil moisture estimation. In essence, Sigma0, Gamma0, or Beta0 can be used to predict
soil moisture content, but the best is to use Sigma0. When comparing the result obtained
from the use of all VH bands together with the result obtained from the use of each VH
band separately, and between use of all VV bands together with the use of each VV band
separately, we will ﬁnd that (1) use of three bands (VH or VV) together causes a decrease
in soil moisture retrieval efﬁciency; (2) the R2 value has reduced to 0.777 with use all VH
bands together; and (3) the R2 value has reduced to 0.8152 with use all VV bands together.
By using all VH and VV bands, the value of R2 has amounted to 0.8277.

to predict soil moisture content, but the best is to use Sigma0. When comparing the result 
obtained from the use of all VH bands together with the result obtained from the use of 
each VH band separately, and between use of all VV bands together with the use of each 
VV band separately, we will find that (1) use of three bands (VH or VV) together causes a 
decrease in soil moisture retrieval efficiency; (2) the R2 value has reduced to 0.777 with use 
all VH bands together; and (3) the R2 value has reduced to 0.8152 with use all VV bands 
together. By using all VH and VV bands, the value of R2 has amounted to 0.8277.

Figure 2. An illustration of the effect of Sentinel-1 bands on the soil moisture retrieval accuracy over agricultural areas.
From the above, it will be clear that (1) soil moisture retrieval efﬁciency was good
with 1 input channels (Sigma0_VH or Sigma0_VV or Gamma0_VH or Gamma0_VV or
Beta0_VH or Beta0_VV); (2) it was further improved with 2 input channels (Sigma0_VH
and Sigma0_VV or Gamma0_VH and Gamma0_VV or Beta0_VH and Beta0_VV); and (3) it
was worsened with three input channels (all VH or VV bands) and with six input channels
(all VH and VV bands).
To explain that, we must be fully aware that the machine learning algorithm’s accuracy
depends on the quality of the input data [73,74]. Multiple studies reveal a positive correla-
Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 4964
9 of 17
tion between the number of features and accuracy; that is until it peaks, but then it will
turn to a negative correlation. The proper features can certainly increase the accuracy [75].
Redundant and irrelevant features may lead to confusion in the learning system [76].
Removing these features can help avoid degradation of learning performance [77].
We can convert from Beta naught (β0) to Sigma naught (σ0) or Gamma naught (γ0)
by multiplying Beta naught by a speciﬁc number, as follows: (σ0
=
β0 × sin θ) and
(γ0 = β0 × tan θ), where (θ) is the incidence angle [78,79]. We can therefore consider
Sigma naught, Gamma naught, and Beta naught as mirror bands or mirror images or
redundant images. The only differences are the minimum and maximum values of the
backscattering coefﬁcient. As a result, we notice that the values of the performance metrics
for Sigma0_VH, Gamma0_VH, and Beta0_VH look the same. Moreover, the values of the
performance metrics for Sigma0_VV, Gamma0_VV, and Beta0_VV look the same.
When we use all VH bands together as input data, the Gamma and Beta could be
regarded as redundant features of Sigma. Similarly, this also applies to the use of all VV
bands together as input data. Hence, we believe that redundant features were the main
reason for the degradation of the performance metrics (R2, MAE, and RMSE) with the use
of all VH bands together, all VV bands together, and both VH and VV bands; in comparison
with the values of the performance metrics for each band separately, Sigma0_VH and
Sigma0_VV, Gamma0_VH and Gamma0_VV, and Beta0_VH and Beta0_VV.
3.2. Inﬂuence of Cross-Ratio, Ratio, RVI, NRPB and DPSVI as Input Data to the CNN Model on
the Soil Moisture Retrieval
Figure 3 summarizes the ﬁndings obtained from the use of indicators as input data
to the CNN. The best indicators for soil moisture retrieval is Cross-Ratio (R2 = 0.7436),
followed by Ratio (R2 = 0.743), then DPSVI (R2 = 0.741), followed by RVI (R2 = 0.7351),
and ﬁnally NRPB (R2
=
0.7346). The values of the coefﬁcients of determination for
indicators ranging from 0.7436 to 0.7346. One explanation for this tiny range of the
difference is that all the indicators depended only on Sigma0, as illustrated earlier by
the equations.
As shown in Figure 3, there are substantial declines in the values of the performance met-
rics (R2 = 0.6965, MAE = 0.025, RMSE = 0.0414), due to using all indicators as input to
the CNN. Moreover, the use of all Sentinel-1 bands and indicators together (six bands and five
indicators) as input data to the CNN instead of using all Sentinel-1 bands, led to a decline in the
values of the performance metrics from (R2 = 0.8277, MAE = 0.0194, RMSE = 0.0312)
to (R2 = 0.7973, MAE = 0.0238, RMSE = 0.0338). All of this conﬁrms what has been
interpreted regarding the impact of redundant features on learning performance.
According to these results, the use of indicators instead of original Sentinel-1 bands
as input data to the CNN to retrieve soil moisture from Sentinel-1 images is not recom-
mended. We can now say that the top three inputs to CNN are Sigma0_VH and Sigma0_VV,
Gamma0_VH and Gamma0_VV, and Beta0_VH and Beta0_VV. However, the best of all is
Sigma0_VH and Sigma0_VV.

3.3. The Impact of the Activation Function 
As mentioned earlier, we will be using the three CNN architectures, and the only 
difference between them is the activation function, as seen in Figure 1. Now we will use 
the top three inputs with three CNN architectures, to select the best CNN architecture (or 
more specifically, the best activation function). 
Figure 4 summarizes and illustrates the effect of changing the activation function on 
learning performance. The best results had already been achieved by CNN architecture 
(C). While CNN architecture (B) had produced bad or modest results. The main drawback 
is that it is insensitive to high moisture. The maximum value of soil moisture, which CNN 
architecture (B) can sense or predict it is (0.603 mଷ mଷ

(B), the values of the performance metrics have decreased to ( 𝑅ଶ = 0.8381, 𝑀𝐴𝐸 =

the results of the CNN architecture (B). However, we do not recommend the use of this
architecture at all. His sensitivity to low moisture is fairly weak. CNN architecture (A)
cannot sense or predict soil moisture less than (0.1509 m3/m3). The weird stuff, which
we encountered during the use of the CNN architecture (A), is that this architecture is
sometimes unable to learn anything. When this happened, we noticed that the loss value
had always been the same (immutable value), as of epoch 3 during training. Then we
re-trained the model again from the beginning. Amazingly, we already have these results:

4. Conclusions
Agriculture is closely linked to food, water, and air. Smart agriculture is a “ray of
hope” for food, water, and environmental security. Satellites and artiﬁcial intelligence are
necessary tools to achieve smart agriculture. Due to rapid technological development in
our time and an increase in the number of satellites, we will soon be able to obtain high
spatial resolution images of the Earth once or twice a day. Artiﬁcial intelligence can analyze
and understand a large amount of data effectively and efﬁciently.
Soil moisture content is one of the decisive conditions required for crop growth and
development and its precise prediction is important for determining when to irrigate and
how much water to apply; this helps avoid problems associated with over- and under-
watering. This also contributes to an increase in areas cultivated and, hence, agricultural
productivity and air puriﬁcation. Gravimetric, neutron probe, TDR probe, FDR probe,
tensiometer probe technique are the most common techniques used for estimating soil
moisture content in situ. All of these techniques under ﬁeld conditions are accurate with
varying degrees. However, the most common challenges and problems that still exist with
these techniques under ﬁeld conditions are (1) point measurement methods; (2) regular
periodic maintenance, thus require intensive labor; (3) the need for site-speciﬁc calibration;
(4) the actual contact with the soil; (5) the costs.
Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a new approach to detect moisture content in soil
without actually being in contact with it. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)
architecture that can predict soil moisture content over agricultural areas from Sentinel-1 images.
The best values of the performance metrics (R2 = 0.8664, MAE = 0.0144, RMSE = 0.0274)
were achieved as a result of using Sigma0_VH and Sigma0_VV as input to the CNN
architecture (C). The pre-processing steps have a strong, effective, and direct inﬂuence
on soil moisture retrieval from Sentinel-1 images. Using VV bands as input data to the
CNN is better than using VH bands for soil moisture retrieval. The use of indicators
instead of original Sentinel-1 bands as input data to the CNN to retrieve soil moisture from
Sentinel-1 images is not recommended. We recommend using Sigma0_VH and Sigma0_VV
or Gamma0_VH and Gamma0_VV or Beta0_VH and Beta0_VV as input data to the CNN
to predict soil moisture content from Sentinel-1 images.

With the advent of technology, this decade is witnessing a shift from conventional approaches to the most advanced ones. The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed both the quality and quantity of the agriculture sector. Hybridization of species along with the real-time monitoring of the farms paved a way for resource optimization. Scientists, research institutions, academicians, and most nations across the globe are moving towards the practice and execution of collaborative projects to explore the horizon of this field for serving mankind. The tech industry is racing to provide more optimal solutions.

Introduction The term ‘Agriculture’ is inferred from the Latin words ‘Ager’ means ‘Land’ and ‘Culture’ means ‘Cultivation’. It is the milestone field of human civilization and is one of the benchmark areas. This field is the withstander of the economies of various nations. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), more than 60% of the human population depends on agriculture for survival and around 12% of the total land area is under agricultural production [1]. Predicted by FAO, the global population will reach the mark of 8 billion people by the year 2025 and 9.6 billion by the end of 2050 (FAO, 2009) [2]. The interpretation of this data shows that to tackle this population growth, an estimated increase of 70% in food production must be achieved worldwide by 2050 [3]. Agriculture is also the second-largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, because of fossil-based fertilizers, biomass, and machinery. In some of the developed and developing nations, the agriculture sector is the backbone of the economy. This field has a huge contribution in the growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of developing countries, in particular, some of them are listed in TABLE 1. TABLE 1 Nations Having Agriculture as a Major Part of Their GDP [4] In India, 53% of the population is dependent on the agriculture sector for employment and 61.5 % of the Indian population is primarily dependent on the agriculture sector for its livelihood [5]. Focusing on the market size, India is the second-largest fruit producer in the world. Based on certain data and statistics, the farming income in India is expected to double by 2022. Eyeing this change, there is an intra-state cluster development of certain states in terms of the agriculture sector. The various stats and numbers representing the impact of agriculture in the overall economic development of India as compared to other fields has been shown in Fig. 1. FIGURE 1. Contributions of various sectors in the Indian economy [6]. Show All At present, the demand is more than the supply generated and this curve will illustrate more unstable results in the coming years, due to increase in demand with population rise. To maintain the demand-supply curve, there will be enormous stress on the agricultural sector. Global warming and changing climatic conditions are also important factors to be taken into consideration. From the past decades, due to the increase in demand and pressure on the overall structure of the field, this area is witnessing the slow but progressive shift from traditional approaches to the most advanced technology-driven methods. The use of traditional approaches and conventional methods, as well as the changes in the environment, lay stress on the agricultural sector. Some of the challenges for the agricultural sector are given as follows: The use of traditional techniques of farming hinders the optimization of both cost and time. Depletion of the topsoil due to floods and winds resulting in the deposition of the pollutants, sediments, nitrates, and phosphates, result in causing the eutrophication and the runoff of the soil. Planting the same crop after each harvest makes the soil redundant of the essential nutrients. Water scarcity due to the climatic changes lowers the level of groundwater for irrigation, thereby disturbing the water cycle. Global climate changes due to the destruction of the tropical forests and the other vegetative species in agriculture result in the elevation of the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas levels. Lack of expertise in proper recognition of the particular plant species. There is no proper method to detect the disease at early stages, such that precautionary measures could be taken to prevent it. Therefore, because of these factors, the need for the creation of modern methods and intensification of the agricultural practices to use water, soil, minerals, and other resources efficiently becomes obligatory. The nature of the technology and devices is changing i.e. it never settles for any less. A lot of research papers addressing the challenges of agriculture in the IoT domain have been put forth. Constant developments and everlasting expectations from the existing technologies paves a great way for motivating academicians and researchers to set and attain new standards. During recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in the study and application of domains like IoT, cloud computing, machine learning, and big data, etc. Therefore, from the trends of these data sets, a constant need is felt to revisit the current standings and capacities of the new age IoT concepts. The modern-day requirements and the counteractive substitutes in the field of agriculture and changes exactly to the expectations based on the concepts of IoT must be addressed. The contribution of IoT in the agriculture field and certain gaps in resource utilization motivated us to perform a study that addresses current issues and applications of IoT in agriculture. Agriculture is expected to get immensely fortified by the advancement of technology especially by the domain IoT. Precision agriculture is the new term appended to the agriculture filed, with all the procedures being followed, addressed, and simulated in a tech-driven manner. Incorporation of the internet has started to revolutionize this field by associating devices together, now being identified as the Internet of Things. Coined in 1999 by a British visionary “Kevin Ashton”, Internet of Things is a consortium of devices connected [7]. The devices are associated with internet via Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Radio-frequency Identification (RIFD), Near Field Communication (NFC), Long Term Evolution (LTE), and other devices and communication technologies. This association helps the devices and the other objects transfer the information gathered to destined places all over the network. Precision agriculture, therefore, aims to optimize and improve agricultural processes to ensure optimum production with reliable, fast, and distributed dimensions thus providing growers a detailed overview of the ongoing scenarios in the cultivation stretches. This practice is followed to reduce energy consumption. The major areas where IoT can leave an everlasting impression are climate monitoring [8], data analytics [9], early disease detection [10], crop counting [11], smart irrigation [12], etc. With the spread of a network of devices, a communication channel can be established between the farmers, fields, and experts. By developing IoT based models, the field conditions can be monitored remotely on regular time intervals without any human intervention and after analyzing the data favorable and efficient decisions can be taken accordingly. This will help to ensure both field and market safety and security to the farmer. Also, with early monitoring of crops, disease detection can be done and thus preventive measures can be taken to save the crop beforehand. For producers it will also help in the analysis of consumer demands. Whether the product will be able to meet market expectations, thus creating an intelligent decision driven farming. An analysis of different existing articles addressing the research and development of precision agriculture is presented in TABLE 2. TABLE 2 Alaysis of Various Papers in the Field of Precison Agricuture for the Current Study In this article based on research gaps and findings obtained from articles analyzed below, a systematic survey is done. Therefore in this study, the most prominent problems of the agriculture sector, and solutions provided by modern systems are addressed and discussed in detail. The major contributions of this study are as follows: A comprehensive survey of the architectural, conceptual, and implementation details of IoT models adopted for Precision Agriculture has been carried out. Various IoT hardware platforms and other associated devices like sensors, accumulators, etc. along with their role in agriculture have been discussed in brief. Various IoT OS supported for Precision Agriculture have been discussed. The significance and key differences of MIoT in agriculture have been discussed along with related studies. Studies limited to a specific domain has been merged together for clear mapping of the domain. Sensors and their role in agriculture is discussed. Various projects/ start-up’s started all over the globe for tacking agricultural problems and providing intelligent and sustainable solutions to farmers have also been discussed. Functional concepts like limitations, improvements, future works and applications are discussed separately. The rest of the paper has been organized as in Section 2 various search and source methods used for the selections of relevant articles has been introduced, in Section 3 to get into the deep insight of the various concepts, theories, and devices related to the implementation of Internet of Things has been discussed, followed by Section 4 which gives the various related studies concerning different applications of Internet of Things in Agriculture, findings like challenges, limitations, improvements, future work, etc. with a short description of our proposed work has been given in Section 5, and finally, at last, the article ends with a conclusion. Table 3 gives the detailed nomenclature used throughout this article. TABLE 3 Nomenclature SECTION II. Sources and Search Methods The research methodology consists of going through articles based on the contribution of IoT and its related technologies for the advancement and development of the agriculture filed. For designing the overall structure of this article, the data and selected studies are chosen strictly based on a time frame. Most of the articles taken for study are sorted from 2015 to 2020. This time frame is chosen to visualize and understand the current impact of IoT in the field. In TABLE 4, a summary of the resources from where the papers have been selected is presented. TABLE 4 Summary of the E-Reserves for Obtaining the Related Research Articles Given the objective of this article, research has been conducted thoroughly by examining the existing literature work related to the subject. For developing a firm foundation, the articles containing the origin of IoT, alongside current standings, recent trends, and technologies, were considered for a study concerning their contributions to the field of agriculture. By reviewing the existing literature, a sustainable framework has been developed to overcome the existing challenges in the field. The keywords mainly used to identify the literature included Precision Agriculture, Agriculture, Plant Monitoring, Internet of Things, Smart Agriculture, Smart Farming, Irrigation, Plant Pathology, Wireless Sensor Networks, etc. The eight-year trends of the different terminologies and their search significance over the years have been extracted from Google and are presented in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. FIGURE 2. Worldwide distribution of IoT of the past eight years [19]. Show All FIGURE 3. Precision Agriculture distribution worldwide of the past eight years [19]. Show All From the figures, it can be seen that the frequency of search or usage of these two terms is somewhat stable over the past eight years. An average, 80% of people talk and search about these topics for study and other related purposes, thus establishing the growing interest worldwide in this area. So for a better understanding, in the next section, the various terminologies related to the Internet of things concepts and devise have been discussed. SECTION III. Introduction to the Internet of Things (IoT) Concepts and Theories Inspired from the technology of the internet to connect the whole world, the Internet of Things constitutes of things possessing unique identities and are connected to the internet. A cosmos of sensors, actuators, appliances, and other devices connected with each over the internet, results in making the Internet of Things (IoT). The scope of IoT is not just limited to only connecting things but to allow them to communicate and exchange data. Based on the Electronic Devices and Network Annex-IEA-4E (EDNA), by 2020 the number of connected devices will rise to 50 billion, thus resulting in the generation of high revenue. IoT works in a layered manner depending upon the problem it is addressing. Therefore, it can be define that IoT possesses a layered architecture [20]. All these layers combined are called the IoT functional blocks. Apart from the functional blocks, various communication models that aid the smooth working of an IoT model are a request-response model, publish-subscribe, push-pull, and exclusive pair [20]. Fig. 4 represents the reference architecture of IoT in agriculture and includes the following layers: device/physical layer, network layer, middleware layer, service layer, analytics layer, and end-user layer. The layered architecture includes all the hardware devices, facilities, equipment, internet, communication technologies, protocols, and data analytic algorithms. How the layers work along with each other is described below: Perception Layer: Also called physical or the device layer, this layer lies at the bottom of the architecture and constitutes of sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, gateways, routers, switches, hubs, etc. The main role of this layer is, how efficiently the sensing devices and the other equipment’s can work together to gather data. The microcontroller device acts as a controller as it performs all the networking ifunctionalities. The microcontroller also acts as a network regulating body as it regulates the networks, such that the sensors and other devices can collect data. The main aim of this layer is to capture data and transfer it to the other layer i.e., the higher abstraction layers. In terms of agriculture, the devices in the physical layer gather, soil, water, pH value, humidity, leaf wetness, and other data parameters. Also, the topology in which the devices are placed plays a major role in power consumption and efficient data collection in this layer. Network Layer: It comprises of internet and other communication technologies. The main aim of this layer is, how to achieve better communication in the platform. In terms of agriculture, the design of this layer plays an important role in a framework due to the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant to field size or the test bed size. LTE, CDMA, GSM, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, LoRa, NFC, UWB Bluetooth, and RIFD are some of the communication technologies used for agriculture purposes. ZigBee, LoRa, and NFC are the most used communication technologies employed depending upon the problem and the area to be addressed in the agro domain. NFC and Bluetooth are the most suitable for the greenhouses. Various protocols like HTTP, WWW, and SMTP serve for efficient communication in the agricultural scenarios. Middleware Layer: This layer in IoT architecture is accountable for device management, context awareness, interoperability, portability, and security-related responsibilities. In terms of agriculture scenarios, HYDRA, SMEPP act as best middleware due to their context-aware functionalities. Service Layer: Dealing with agricultural problems, cloud-assisted service layer in IoT layered architecture plays a prominent role in providing cloud storage and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). To facilitate the function of sensing, actuation, and other activities, this layer focuses on some main areas or domains such as monitoring, detection, control, decision making, recognition, etc. The service layer offers services like device monitoring, control, discovery, and data publishing services. Analytics Layer: The layer is responsible for the processing and analysis of data. This layer works as a consortium of two steps- 1) Data ingestion, is the step that performs storage, cleansing, and streaming of data and the 2) Data analytics, which performs data reporting, mining, and learning. In the analytics layer various machine learning tools, data analytic algorithms are employed to give early predictive decisions for measuring the crop yield, crop growth, disease detection, etc. These decisions can enhance farm monitoring capacity. The predictive decisions can help in the design of better decision support systems. End-User Layer: Being the topmost layer of the model, it serves the consumer or the user. To provide the interface to the users to control and monitor their model, this layer allows them to view the system status, analyze or process the data. In agro models, the farmer is the end-user. This layer provides a user-friendly experience and platform to the farmers. The services or applications in this layer are designed based on the behavioral study and pattern analysis of the user. Various intelligent approaches and data analytic studies are employed to understand the behavior of the users, as they come with different needs and offer a lot of diversity. Social media, Cloud computing, Mobile messaging are the platforms used to provide services to users, experts, and industries. Through this layer, the whole IoT based platform can be monitored, controlled, and run. The services generated from this layer are mostly the link between the user and the systems/platforms. FIGURE 4. A layered ecosystem/architecture of Agro-IoT. Show All A. Multimedia Internet of Things (MIoT) in Agriculture Based on the working, nature of deployment, and the subject IoT concepts are used to address, traditional IoT is differentiated into various forms such as IoMT, MIoT, IIoT, etc. Without the inclusion of these concepts, IoT systems cannot successfully realize the concept of ubiquitous computing. In these paradigms, the interaction and cooperation between the heterogeneous devices is facilitated. Due to the increase in the number, diversity of devices and data with time, these concepts have become more functional and prominent to develop models and techniques for coming challenges and reflect the possibilities enabled in them. All these concepts have the same main character of availability, intelligence, and devices but they only differ in their due course of action i.e., their general usage. Being an allied branch or extension of IoT, MIoT, include smart objects that are usually resource-constrained, in terms of memory, energy, and processing power. Due to the progressive reduction in size and cost of production of these devices, MIoT models are expected to be developed and deployed on a large scale. Generally, the sensors of these models are usually designed to be battery operated or solar power operated. Due to the large data sensing and analysis, these devices require high computational power. Mostly, the multimedia data includes audio, video, and image data, which possess unstructured features and is difficult to transmit and analyze on a computationally scarce network and low bandwidth conditions. Multimedia data shows different behavior compared to the scalar data due to its computational complexity and network topology bottlenecks to the Quality of Service (QoS). A lot of work has been done in IoT and its allied fields to realize the concept of heterogeneous, low-level data transmission, and communication. In agricultural frameworks, the data is mostly in the visual form e.g., pest images, plant disease images, field images, etc. The characteristic difference in scalar and multimedia data is shown in Fig. 5. FIGURE 5. Key characteristic differences between IoT and MIoT data [25]. Show All Depending upon the various parameters there are key differences between IoT and MIoT and they are discussed as: The IoT systems work mostly on non-heterogeneous devices while the MIoT functions well in case of heterogeneity. IoT data is mostly scalar, however, MIoT considers the multimedia data. Traditional IoT networks does not take into consideration the concept QoS while transmission and communication whereas in case of MIoT, QoS and QoE play a major role as the prime parameters. IoT can function well over low bandwidth channels whereas MIoT networks are in demand of high bandwidth due to bulky data. Node operation is predefined in IoT whereas in MIoT the node operation is adaptive in nature. Various authors have worked on the implementation of concepts of MIoT for agriculture. Zhang et al. [21], worked on the concept of preserving the concept of data confidentiality while realizing the challenge of low-cost data acquisition. A measurement matrix under the control of chaos and random subsampling is employed to capture the ruptured image signals. Then these sampled sub-images are assembled to form a big master image and then encrypted based on android transform and single value diffusion. Correlation, histogram, keyspace, robustness, real-time, and entropy analysis are performed to understand and realize the concept of low-level transmission. Rani et al. [22], worked on the concept of bridging the gap between the scalar and multimedia data, and for this, they developed an IoMT cross-layer protocol. This protocol considered cross-communication between the physical, data link, and routing layers. The main objective of this work was to achieve energy-efficient communication with less computational time complexity. An optimal mathematical model was developed to study the cross-layer behavior in all the three layers, therefore selecting the efficient one. A comparative study was conducted on two parameters like delay and distance. Usman et al. [23], proposed a multilayer framework based on multilevel edge computing architecture to manage, and preserve the privacy of end devices from external attacks. Authors mainly focused on the three major challenges i.e., node management, privacy-preserving, and network protection. The proposed architecture is divided into three layers with the first layer comprising of underlying network partitioned into multiple clusters to manage end-devices and Level-One Edge Devices (LOEDs). In the second layer, the LOEDs apply an efficient aggregation technique to reduce the volumes of generated data and preserve the privacy of end-devices. Local differential privacy-based technique is applied to protect the privacy of sensitive information in aggregated data. In the last layer, the mobile sinks are registered with a level-two edge device via a handshaking mechanism to protect the underlying network from external threats. Floris and Atzori [24], addressed the issue of evaluation of Quality of Experience (QoE) for IoT applications where mostly multimedia data is involved. For designing a layered architecture, authors first tried to analyze the QoE parameters or factors with applications in the relevant scenarios. Then a layered multimedia IoT architecture was proposed for QoE analysis by combing each of the analytic and contributing factors. Zikria et al. [25], presented a brief overview of the MIoT along with its challenges, solutions and future opportunities. The authors discussed the data differences between the traditional IoT and MIoT, along with the role of communication technologies. The demand for realizing the dream of MIoT and its bottlenecks were also discussed.

[26], presented a comprehensive survey on the multimedia internet of things. Authors discussed the existing role of MIoT in concern with various fields like medical, agriculture, automation, and industry, etc. The importance of QoE and QoS for multimedia transmission over IoT channels is also discussed. A better need for routing and Physical-Medium Access Control (PHY-MAC) protocols for M-IoT was also discussed. A potential discussion on open research issues related to multimedia communication in IoT was presented. Alsamhi et al. [27], presented a survey on the role of green IoT in greener and smart cities. The authors focused on how the environment pollution can be controlled along with other parameters for making living more sustainable and green with the aid of IoT concepts. AlSkaif et al. [28], presented a survey on the energy efficiency of MAC protocols in low data rate wireless multimedia sensors. The conflicting goals of WMSN were also discussed. Role and challenges of multimedia data were also discussed. A focused analysis was performed on network parameter constraints and what techniques are employed to solve them. A comparison of the energy consumption of MAC protocols in four selected application scenarios related to smart cities and environment monitoring was also presented. Libo et al. [29], worked on how with the use of multimedia data in the form of images can be employed to detect the plant diseases. Rape diseases were studied as a case study. Authors also discussed the challenges and bottlenecks faced for the transfer of multimedia data over low bandwidth channels. With machine intelligence, authors also proposed a diagnostic procedure via which the data can be transferred over wireless multimedia sensors networks. Psannis et al. [30], proposed a technique for the transfer of advanced media-based smart big data via intelligent systems. Authors in their work addressed the problem of the rapid rise of devices and heterogeneity. An encoding algorithm with HVEC standard for performance evaluation was proposed to transfer the data intelligently. B. Hardware Platforms for IoT The hardware platform for IoT comprises a set of compatible hardware capable of running certain software. The main components of a hardware platform are machine language, sensors, wireless devices, programs, and processors, protocols, etc. The processor in a hardware platform determines how much fast a framework can work. To design certain new methodologies in IoT, various hardware platforms supported are elaborated as: 1) Raspberry Pi It is a series of single-board computers developed in the UK by Raspberry foundation. There are various families of raspberry i.e., Raspberry Pi 1, Raspberry Pi 2, Raspberry Pi 3, Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi 4. All these families have different models. The Broadcom processor is used in most of the boards. It acts more like a computer system and can do multitasking [31]. 2) Arduino Uno Developed by Arduino.cc, it is a microcontroller board and is based on the ATMega32 processor. Arduino Uno possessing a USB port is a very valuable addition to the family of microcontrollers. Various versions of Arduino like Arduino Uno, Arduino Due, Arduino Leonardo, and Arduino Mega are present in the market. Out of these the most common versions are Arduino Uno and Arduino Mega [32]. 3) Node MCU It is an open-source IoT platform. It generally refers to firmware rather than the development kits. It is a low-cost open-source kit/module developed for the ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip. It is developed in the Arduino IDE environment [33]. 4) Beaglebone Developed by Texas Instruments, it is a low-cost open-source single-board computer. Its size measures 75 by 75 mm and possesses all the functionality of a basic computer. It requires 2W of power or a 5V separate power and can work smoothly without any cooling or sinks [34], [35]. 5) Banana Pi It is a low-cost credit-card-sized single-board computer developed by a Chinese company Shenzhen SINOVOIP Co. Ltd. The hardware design is hugely influenced by Raspberry Pi. It is compatible with Raspberry Pi boards as well. It can be developed both on Android and Linux [36]. The various hardware platforms of IoT with their functional specifications are given in TABLE 5. TABLE 5 Hardware Platforms of IoT and Their Specifications C. IoT Operating System (IoT OS) for Agriculture IoT operating system (IoT OS) is an operating system designed to perform within the constraints particular to Internet of Things devices. IoT OS are designed and developed in such a way that it can function under the restrictions of memory, size, power and processing capability. The main aim of IoT OS is to enable successful data transfer over the network via internet. The IoT OS for a particular framework is not chosen at random. Certain parameters such as footprint, scalability, portability, modularity, connectivity, and reliability are taken into consideration. As per the requirement of agriculture, a huge number of devices are connected having different features and also the devices have to withstand the different environments, the OS then to be chosen must be scalable, cost-efficient, and reliable. Various studies have been put forward for the role of IoT OS in network management and overall communication. Javed et al. [37], provided a detailed reviewed comparison of the operating systems designed for IoT devices based on their architecture, scheduling methods, networking technologies, programming models, power, and memory management methods, along with other features required for IoT OS applications. Musaddiq et al. [38], studied the role of small IoTOS in powering the scarce network devices. Authors also put light on the energy consumption of these devices. A detailed discussion on IoT devices and resource management is provided and some state of art IoT OSs such as Contiki, TinyOS, and FreeRTOS are also investigated. Baccelli et al.

Authors discussed the techniques and open tools such as CC analyzers and simulators which can provide intelligent metadata transfer over a network. The experimentation was performed on CloudSim and Cooja emulator of Contiki OS for the testing of a single network segment. From the experimentation, it was found that no duplicate packet transfer occurred which is a good sign for multimedia data transmission. The various IoT OS with their functional specifications are presented in TABLE 6. TABLE 6 IoT OS Platforms in Agriculture and Their Specifications D. Sensors and Their Role in Agriculture Sensors are the devices, modules, machines or subsystems capable of detecting the changes or events in the environment. They also send signals back to the receiver end. Mostly the sensors are used with other electronics. A sensors sensitivity usually indicates how much change in sensor output occurs with respect to the change in the input quantity measurements. Most sensors possess the linear transfer function. The sensitivity of a sensor is defined as the ratio between the output signal and the measured property. The resolution of a sensor is the smallest change it can detect in the quantity it is measuring. In the area of agriculture, demand of technological solutions with high aim in rising production and quality is increasing day by day. Also the solutions are required which provide optimal analysis and sustainable methods for the field development with reduced cost and time. To sustain such challenges, sensor- based technologies have proven to be of much help to tackle the above issues and challenges. Precision agriculture is an emerging area where sensor based technologies are playing a major role. Since the sensors are a major data collection agents, they play a dynamic role in agriculture. Also, it is very difficult to collect the data from an agricultural field due to the undulating field conditions that keep on changing over time. Sensors are selected or designed according the problem to be addressed or needs identified by the farmers. Agriculturalists generally use sensors to sense the soil conditions, humidity, crop conditions, minerals, pH value, water levels, and sunlight, etc. The nature and the characteristics of the component which needs to be sensed also plays a major role in the development of a sensing device. With the development of technology, machinery and easy-to-use microcontroller platforms, the usage of sensors has expanded beyond the traditional fields of measurement i.e., temperature, pressure and flow. However, the analog sensors such as potentiometers and force sensing resistors are still widely in use. Pajares et al. [54], discussed the sensors in agriculture and forestry. In the article, various related works of the sensors performed by different authors in the same domain were presented. The role and importance of the component or substance which needs to be sensed was discussed along with their characteristics and specifications. The major areas focused by authors were soil analysis, seed growth, weed detection, forest stands and reflectance, machinery for effective treatments, microorganisms, pest control, seedling breeding, growing, state of health, positioning, navigation, safety, detection and classification. Zhu et al. [55], showed that LIDAR, IMU, and Encoder (x2) can be used for designing a prototype vehicle for the agricultural domain. The authors also discussed how these sensors can be used for the development and usage of that prototype in case of undulating surfaces and rough terrains. A complete review of the wireless sensors and the network applications used in agriculture is provided. The authors also addressed the importance of sensors in the field of agriculture. Along with the sensors, the communication technologies that support sensor communications are also mentioned by Rehman et al. [56]. The sensors used in the medical and agricultural fields have also been discussed. In the case of the agricultural field, the various conditions and circumstances affecting the data collection from sensors are addressed. The various types of sensors and their platforms used by different authors in their work are also included by Chokkareddy et al. [57]. Plageras et al. [58], used efficient IoT based sensor and big data analytics for secure collection of data and communication over a channel. In the study, smart housing or building was taken as case study, and the secure data collection with the sensors was performed and analyzed. The behavior of various sensors for data collection in different scenarios in terms of IoT and cloud computing was studied by Stergiou et al. [59]. The secure communication among devices was also studied along with performance bottlenecks and challenges. The various sensors and their use in agriculture is discussed below: 1) Level Sensors They measure the substance of liquid in a cast. The cast can be any agricultural field, pond, water tank, etc. They measure data in two methodologies 1) Point level measurements: indicate only whether the constituent or level measured is above or below the sensing point or threshold. 2) Continuous measurements: specific range measurements and exact substance amount determination are performed by these sensors. In agricultural fields, the water level sensors, humidity sensors, and moisture sensors are used to measure the water content levels in a field. The point level sensors are used when the water content in the cast i.e., soil or testbed is very less i.e. in dry and arid areas, whereas the continuous level sensors are feasible for semi-arid locations. Some of the ultrasonic level sensors are also used in water treatment plants. Blank et al. [60], designed a low-level senor based fusion application for agricultural machinery design. 2) Temperature Sensor Temperature sensors measure the temperature of the environment or surroundings. They are of different types i.e. thermistors, thermocouples, resistance temperature detectors, infrared sensors, semiconductor sensors. In agriculture they measure the temperature variants in a field. Mahan et al. [61] designed an optimal temperature based field monitoring system by using a low-cost infrared sensor. 3) Proximity Sensors Detect the presence of nearby objects without any physical intervention. The sensor works by emitting an electromagnetic beam in the field and looks for any alterations in the signal. These are mainly employed in agricultural cattle grazing, counting of fruits, etc. Kim et al. [62] used a capacitive proximity sensor to optimize the harvest yield of fields. 4) Infrared Sensors Senses the changes in the environment by emitting infrared rays. They work in two approaches i.e., active and passive. An active IR sensor can both emit and detect the radiations and constitute a light-emitting diode and a receiver. The passive IR sensors can only detect the radiation and possess only a LED. In agriculture field infrared sensors can be employed to detect the presence of rodents in the orchards, count the number of plants or trees in the field, capturing satellite images of the field. Allred et al. [63], used IR sensor-based satellite imagery to map the findings and results of UAV to chart agricultural drainage systems. 5) Touch Sensors Also known as tactile sensors, work on sensing the touch. They are low-cost sensors. In the agriculture field they can be used for the detection of intrusions in the field. Depending on the target and the range, there are different types of sensors, the same are discussed in Fig. 6 and TABLE 7 below: TABLE 7 Sensors Based on Their Fields of Application FIGURE 6.

IoT in Farm Management Farm management refers to the construction and implementation of decisions for obtaining the maximum production and profit via organizational operation of decisions. This area is most benefitted by automation and the implementation of new technological methods. With farm management agricultural practices are made informative by evaluation and comparison with the other developed approaches and methods. Diedrichs et al.

Further based upon the certain characteristics we have tabularized the major findings in TABLE 8. TABLE 8 Summary of Developed Methods for Farm Management B. IoT in Irrigation Irrigation is the method of application of controlled water to the farming fields, at needed intervals. Irrigation has been a constant area where a lot of energy, money, and labor is invested in the case of farming. Detection and knowledge of water level can reduce the cost of production by half. For increasing crop yield, smart irrigation management is essential. Various optimized and precise methods have been developed by various academicians. Klein et al. [96], with the help of satellite images, worked on the implementation of closed-loop irrigation. The authors designed a real-time water requirement system, which can optimize water delivery for 140 cells located in four hectares of land. Vegetative indexes were calculated for analyzing the total water consumption and how via loops this facility can be automated. Through this study and experimentation it was found that with the integration of closed-loop strategy and advanced water analysis, the overall water consumption efficiency can be improved. Alahi et al. [97], extended research to design and develop a smart nitrate monitoring system for the monitoring nitrate content in the surface and groundwater. The authors proposed a portable sensing system with the help of a planar inter-digital sensor, associated electronics, instrumentation, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy-based analysis. Through real-time monitoring and sending data directly to the IoT web server, the proposed system possesses the capacity to monitor the impact of industrial, urban, and agricultural activity on water content and quality. The system also ensures distributed monitoring. Daskalakis et al. [98], used leaf sensing technology instead of ground soil monitoring for knowing the plant water stress. The authors proposed a low cost and low power consumption leaf moisture sensing model by sensing the leaves with the new plant backscatter sensor node/tag. The developed tag collects the information from a leaf via analog and digital conversions and then the data is transferred via remote communication to a low-cost software-defined radio reader using monostatic backscatter architecture. The data collected from this node is then connected to the irrigation system. The proposed system is powered by a flexible solar panel. Jayalakshmi and Gomathi [99], proposed a sensor-cloud based precision agriculture for intelligent water management, to enhance crop production. For the model design, moisture and stress levels of different plant organs were considered along with the behavior vegetative and reproductive organs cell growth, and its effects on the water requirement were studied. The dimensionality reduction technique was employed to choose the optimal parameters. For the case study, the wheat plant was taken. The effect of soil temperature and water suction rate was studied in the case of the plant growth. The non-adsorbing testbed was prepared by exploding the sand grains at high temperatures. With the aid of WSN, it was monitored when the plant needs to be irrigated. Angelopoulos et al. [100], developed a small scale smart irrigation prototype for a strawberry greenhouse. The prototype possesses off the shelf hardware and software requirements and was tested on large farms having multiple crops to get a data gain. The reference architecture also targets edge data distribution. The model was tested in Greece and its performance was compared against the traditional existing strawberry greenhouse methods for irrigation. Compared to the cloud-based approaches, and their incompetence to handle network traffic, security challenges, and data sharing with the third party, this model is secure and reliable and can handle large datasets. Dominguez-Nino et al. [101], worked on how to integrate sensors for developing automated software tools to undertake the routine tasks and decision-making involved in scheduling irrigation. The authors also focused on the suitability of capacitance approach soil moisture sensors and how to automatically interpret them and providing feedback to the scheduling algorithm. The proposed approach was tested in the apple orchards located at the IRTA-Lleida Experimental Station in Mollerussa, Lleida, Spain. For the study, both the physiological and agronomic properties were taken into consideration while experimentation. Krishnan et al. [102], designed an automated irrigation method. The authors developed a fuzzy logic-based system for precision irrigation by using Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) service to enable farmers to water the fields. Soil and temperature, humidity, and motor status parameters were monitored and taken for the study. For the efficiency evaluation of the system, a comparison was done between the proposed system, drip irrigation, and manual flooding. Harun et al. [103], designed an environment-friendly system named “Greenhouse Irrigation Management System” for precision irrigation in agriculture. Some critical environmental parameters such as soil moisture, pH, temperature, humidity are measured with the use of WSNs to make decisions. The sensors measure the data and based on certain threshold value result, the fields are irrigated. Olivo [104], focused on the problems associated with device growth and its effects on the control decisions. To address this issue, an architecture named “Rules Engine and Context Event Processor (RECEP)” is proposed for the dynamic processing of events originated in the context of IoT and PA. In this model the concept if optimization was used to optimize the resources to increase agricultural production. The experimental setup was set in a banana field located in Machala-Ecuador.

Some studies of the articles incorporating IoT in fields related to crop monitoring are presented in TABLE 10. TABLE 10 Summary of Developed Methods Crop Monitoring D. IoT in Disease Detection Diseases play a vital role in the economic and food crisis of a country. So to avoid this, disease detection is employed. This involves the detection of various diseases whether fungal, viral, bacterial, etc. from the stages of early to the post-harvest. Incubation of IoT has revolutionized the disease detection area in plant phenotyping resulting in major control resources available to avoid disease occurrence. Wang et al. [146], focused on addressing the problem of pests and insects. Authors proposed an IoT based model that can detect the early occurrence of the pests and diseases from visual references. Rough set theory algorithm and NN were used to model design. The proposed model was compared with existing models for accuracy and efficiency. Pandiyan et al. [147], applied the concepts of image segmentation and IoT, to develop a system/platform that can detect the diseases in plants. Authors proposed a novel platform having an Advanced Segmented Dimension Extraction (ASDE) with Heterogeneous Internet of Things procedural (HIoT) aspects, to detect the apple leaf diseases. A sign based plant disease identification model for real-time resembling of leaf diseases namely bacteria, fungi, micro-organisms, and viruses is presented. Three levels i.e. connectivity level, platform level, and service level were employed for performing data aggregation, transmission, and automatic identity identification. Leaf gestures were studied to identify the diseases in leaves. Zhao et al. [148], developed an automatic crop disease detection system capable of identifying and recognizing the leaves from a cluttered background. Combining IoT concepts and CNN, authors designed a novel approach named “Multi-Context Fusion Network (MCFN)” along with IoT deployments for crop diseased detection in wild. Kale and Sonavane [149], developed a smart and optimized smart fertilizing decision support system for smart farming. The authors addressed the problem of disproportion due to lack of judgment. Concepts of IoT and GA were used to design the system.

The proposed system focuses on plant disease detection in a real-time environment. Khattab et al. [150], developed an IoT based cognitive automatic monitoring system for detecting the epidemic diseases in plants. By combining the concepts of artificial intelligence and prediction algorithms to develop the expert system, capable of predicting, analyzing, and decision making. A layered approach was used to design the model. Soil, leaf wetness, wind speed, and wind direction sensors were employed to gather the data. The model was tested on detection of the diseases like Late Blight, Early Blight, and Powdery Mildew in tomato and potato crops. Chen et al. [151], based on AI technologies and IoT, developed a system named “RiceTalk” for the detection of Blight diseases in the rice plant. AgriTalk model was used as a base model in this work to develop this system. Compared to AgriTalk, the authors used non-image IoT devices to design this model for disease detection. Devi et al. [152], proposed a simple and efficient IoT enabled solution for developing a system for automatic disease detection.

TABLE 11 Summary of IoT Based Developed Methods for Disease Detection SECTION V. Findings Several research articles related to the role and responses of the Internet of Things in agriculture have been studied. From the literature and studies, it can be seen that immense contribution has made by IoT in the field of agriculture starting from micro areas and moving over to macro environments. Internet of Things along with the concepts of cloud computing, cluster computing, wireless sensor networks and computer vision has revolutionized the field of monitoring, crop production, disease detection, and supply chain management. Since the domain of agriculture itself is a wide domain so considering the impact IoT has or can make on this field, the search was not restricted or limited to any area. The data acquisition for agriculture systems is a multidimensional approach. There are several fields in agriculture where IoT is applied e.g., crop monitoring, diseased detection, precision irrigation, supply chain, cattle grazing, and raising, etc. To design a precision approach, the target plays a very important role in data collection. From the existing studies it is found that mostly overall 90% of the data is self-acquired by the authors with the use of wireless sensors. This data included soil data, pH values, light, water, humidity, and images. In the case of crop disease detection, leaves were taken as the primary subject of study due to their ease of availability and quantity. Nearly 80% of the leaf data was self-acquired using digital cameras and web-enabled devices. However in some studies to validate their models, authors also used the existing standard ground truth databases available. Satellite imaging and remote sensing images were also taken to understand the demography and vegetative indexes of a region. UAV drones were the most used devices along with web-enabled digital cameras and mobile devices to capture the data in the form of images and also acted for providing real-time monitoring of device location in the fields. Certain issues and challenges are faced by the authors while capturing real-time images due to environmental and lighting conditions. To avoid these issues, laboratory-based testbeds such as greenhouses were developed and their data was acquired in a closed environment. From the literature, it is seen that, to develop the prototypes certain common parameters were taken for conducting the study irrespective of the problem to be addressed. Theses parameters included soil data, pH value, humidity level, moisture content, water content. After the analysis of the studies it was found that for any agricultural system to flourish all these parameters play a combined role. These parameters were most common for the problems addressing farm management, crop monitoring, and irrigation. However in certain other parameters like leaf wetness, salinity, disease severity, fertilizer ratio, plant height, CO2 content, mineral content, and conductivity were considered while addressing the specific problems like plant disease detection, smart irrigation, seedling germination, etc. These were the devices employed to collect the data. Depending upon the problem the authors addressed, different type of sensors were employed. For soil data collection, the contact method sensors such as hygrometers, or electrodes which penetrate the soil were used to collect soil information. While as in the case of the collection of soil information via tractors or vehicles non-contact soil sensors were employed. But for the studies it can be seen that contact method sensors are the most common devices used for soil data collection. In case of soil pH value and salinity electrochemical sensors are employed. In the case of soil nitrates, CO2, and fertilizer content, topsoil depth, biomass content, organic matter are measured. For water data collection, parameters like relative humidity, leakage of pipes, dissolved oxygen, nitrates, and other oxides were measured by the authors. To accomplish this various water sensors like ultrasonic sensors were employed to measure the water levels in the tanks, ponds, and farms. Temperature and humidity sensors were used to measure the temperature of water and humidity of soil for water content. In the case of plant leaves, the leaf wetness sensors were employed to understand the moisture content of the plants. Other than these sensors, neutron sensors, time travels sensors, and capacitance sensors are also employed by some authors for measuring the water levels. In the case of supply chain and cattle grazing, tags and biosensors were employed to gather the data. To develop the prototypes, the authors used the devices based on functional capabilities. From all the devices, Arduino and Raspberry Pi were the most desirable hardware platforms for the authors. Arduino was employed to tackle simple or sequential issues that do not require complex solutions. In the case of scenarios with complex environments, Raspberry Pi boards were employed due to their capability of addressing multiple problems at the same time. For functionalities that faced time issues, Raspberry Pi boards were employed. In the case of communication technologies, LoRa and ZigBee are the most commonly used communication technologies by the authors in the platform designs due to their capabilities of handling a multitude of solutions. Lora and ZigBee use GPS to enable and detect geo-locations. They are low cost and secure for data transmission. Other than these technologies, authors also made use of cloud and cluster computing to handle a large mass of data and provide on-spot solutions to the consumers. The authors performed the processing of data in different stages. At first preprocessing on data was performed to remove any kind of outliers or anomalies in the data. To remove the imperfect data, algorithms such as noise removal with Gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise, histogram equalization were commonly used for the preprocessing of image data. However in the case of numerical data missing value imputation, the banana dataset for noise reduction was employed. To obtain the optimal data from a given set of data, data reduction was performed. The data reduction approaches e.g., dimensionality reduction, attribute subset selection, numerosity reduction, etc. were employed by various authors. To make systems capable of taking decisions, several learning algorithms like GA, CNN, NN, SVM, PNN, GANs were used to train and test the models. From the literature, it is seen that most studies and experiments were performed in countries that have agricultural economies like the USA, China, India, Brazil, Australia, etc. Most of these countries are economically stable and first world countries. They have better infrastructure and service availability. Also only 20% of the studies were focused on real-time implementation of their prototypes which indicates that most of the experimentation was conducted in a closed environment. This pattern raises concerns on how these studies can be employed in real-time environments with low infrastructure and maintenance costs. The problem of power consumption was also addressed by some studies. However there were no comparisons and reasons given on how the dream of IoT can be made real for poor and self-financing farmers. Along with this, a few studies provided the cost estimation for the deployment of the models. In the Fig. 7, the percentage distribution and contribution of IoT in different fields of agriculture are shown. From the figure it can be seen that more extensive studies are conducted in the field of crop monitoring. FIGURE 7. Percentage contribution of IoT in different fields of agriculture. Show All These studies and analysis put forth by different articles show that current/existing solutions have incorporated IoT to solve several challenges in the agricultural domain. With the incorporation of these technologies, a large number of challenges/factors for improvement have emerged. Along with the study of factors for improvement, future research directions, applications are also highlighted. The sections below explain the factors for improvement and the futuristic research directions. A. Challenges Despite the growth achieved by IoT over the past few decades, there still exist some conceptual, fundamental, and developmental issues. 1) Cost Designing a cost-optimized model is still a difficulty faced by many authors. Scientists are focusing on developing cost-efficient systems by reducing the hardware and software requirements in IoT deployments. Economic differences of countries make it difficult for farmers to deploy devices and technology. So, it is important to develop some economic models. 2) Standardization To fully utilize the technology for large range of applications, standardization of devices is essential. The present or current mechanisms do not confirm any standardization formats either for the data and process representation. Deprived of the cordial use of the semantic ontologies, machine-readable codes result in output differences due to misinterpretation and alterations from time to time. With standardization the interoperability issues of the devices, applications, systems and products can be solved. 3) Heterogeneity While designing a system, heterogeneous devices are used. Every device differs in processes and services requirements. In the case of agriculture, most models perform with heterogeneous devices, so it is important to create interaction between heterogeneous modules and communication technologies. Because of heterogeneity, the complexity of the network increases, and sometimes falsified results may appear. 4) Accessibility For developing any farming decision support system based on IoT technology and other devices, the demand for availability of existing software and hardware to be present anywhere any time is a must thing. These problems need to be addressed to ensure the availability of services anywhere and anytime. Lack of availability of the required equipment can result in chaos and delay in the services. 5) Adaptability While designing a model, especially for precision farming, it is pertinent for the devices to be adaptable with the other devices and the surroundings. Since the environmental conditions keep varying and also sometimes due to certain communication or hardware issues certain devices are not adaptable with each other. 6) Energy Optimization Energy is the most emerging issue in IoT systems, WSNs, and other devices for their communication. Till now conventional sources of energy have been supporting the designing and working models. But due to an increase in devices, the consumption of conventional energy is not a reliable solution. Non-conventional sources of energy like solar, wind, water energy harvesting schemes should also be tested, but they haven’t been of much success and new methodologies should be developed to employ them for model development. 7) Compatibility To achieve the standards of fragmentation and scalability, the developed models or software should be flexible and should run on any machine. 8) Reliability For successful and smooth working, reliability is a major concern for IoT devices in terms of data transmission. The devices need to gather and transfer reliable data as based on the data received and interpreted, the decisions are made. Reliability is still a challenge due to system failures, node failures, battery issues, or other interventions. 9) Mobility Generally the systems or models developed are static. For smooth implementation of the framework, there should be mobility as most of the devices and applications are mobile. In mobile models, the issue of maintaining connectivity is still a difficult task. 10) Environmental Conditions In agriculture there are different landforms. So it becomes difficult to adapt to those changes, and this also jeopardizes data and services. This alters the accuracy of a system. 11) Real-Time Deployment Most of the studies put forward are not employed or tested in a real-time testbed. So before deploying a system or model, real-time analysis is a must, to avoid post-deployment losses. B. Improvements Since the growth of IoT is remarkable in the field of agriculture, certain improvements can be included in the growth and developmental state to make the systems and models more efficient, reliable, and business-oriented. 1) Warding Off the Performance Degradation Generally while developing systems, customer interaction or input is not taken. As the models serve a variety of customers from dynamic backgrounds, therefore their input must be taken while developing the models. This way the performance hazards and chaos that occurs on the filed can be avoided. 2) Sharing Rich Data Globally In almost all, the IoT based models designed for precision farming, the data sharing while integrating and mapping the system design should be encouraged. This can lead to the development of an interactive model globally. This feature can also help in understanding the topographic and demographic challenges of various regions on a global level. Thus the suitable solutions can be designed with those working in resource-constrained environments. 3) Moving Towards High-Speed Communication The communication domain itself is witnessing a progressive and dynamic shift. Since the IoT models are remotely located, so better communication is a prerequisite. Therefore it is important to consider high-speed communication strategies like 5G, for making the devices more reachable with lesser delays. 4) Cost Analytic Studies for Model Design With the incumbent of IoT in agriculture, a variety of models are designed for addressing different domains such as irrigation, farm management, disease detection, and crop monitoring, etc. While designing the models various case studies are performed. As the development cost of models for these cases varies from country to country i.e., in first world countries there will be the different cost of devices and in second and third world countries it will be different. Therefore a model cost analysis will provide an idea of the purchasing power and investment a farmer from these varied economic regions can invest to develop a model. Also this can result in seeking or considering other cheaper and efficient ways to develop models. C. Future Research Directions With the advancement in the development of precision agriculture platforms with IoT and other technologies, the development of new applications or research areas is envisioned. After the study of the literature, certain potential concepts and futuristic research directions are listed and discussed below: Design of platforms in a user-friendly manner (from farmers’ perspective and ease of using) using Artificial Intelligence and other learning tools. Farmer’s perspective here means that an audit should be done well before designing the prototype. From this study a clear insight and differences between the requirements of the farmers and farming systems across the globe can be understood. To develop concepts and methodologies based on multidimensional aspects like science, expertise, experience, industry, etc. Energy harvesting or power optimization methodologies should be developed to reduce the cost of production, maintenance, and fault tolerance. It is evident that mostly the farms be it small or large, require power and energy for the working of devices. In most of the cases, the power to the devices is supplied from the main line or the power grid. But this is not a sustainable and efficient method. Thus in order to make farms self-reliant, the energy harvesting or power optimization approaches should be developed or incorporated while designing of the models. Induction of cloud sources for data gathering and processing in a reliable, systematic, and scientific manner. Develop systems that can withstand variable soil and environmental conditions. Since the agricultural environments are harsh and keep on changing with change in climatic conditions or seasons. So it is essential to develop systems which can be robust and sustainable to the changes in the external as well as internal factors. Development of user or farmer friendly apps for monitoring crop and plant health. Mostly farmers come different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds. So due to this their level of understanding and ways to perform agricultural tasks is also different. It is important to develop frameworks considering the native language of a region into consideration so the farmer and machine interaction can be improved. This will enhance enable the acceptance of precision farming methods easy as it can be seen some areas are reluctant to adopt due to this linguistic and understanding problems. Development of efficient sensor-based systems for high elevation areas. High elevation areas mostly have undulating surfaces and also in most of the countries, supply of power to these areas is still a dream. Form the literature, it can be seen that these areas have not been targeted for precision farming instead of being resource deficient. Therefore deployment and design of sensor based systems in these areas opens a scope in future of precision farming. Usage of previous and existential scientific data for the development of decision support systems in farming. Generally for designing the precision farming models, the primary data is considered. However for designing cost efficient and reliable models, the previous case studies and deployment models should be considered for the study. This means a collaborative model development methodology should be developed for understanding the nature of the work. To recognize various plant species using mixed data sets or heterogeneous data. Design of a portable and sustainable farming equipment control systems for large as well as small farms. Mostly from the study it can be seen that first world countries are welcoming in PA approaches while as in most third world and other nations, this concept is still in avoidance due to cost and shelf life of products and equipment’s. Development of reliable supply chain management methods for precision farming. D. Applications of IoT in Agriculture IoT has revolutionized the world of agriculture, and a manifold of application can be derivative of implementation of the Internet of Things in agriculture. These applications are a resultant of the architectural design chosen. These applications have been categorized and differentiated based on the subject they focus on and also the service they provide. The major sectional areas where IoT is applicable in agriculture are- observation, data collection and corroboration, governing, and management. Most of these fields work collaboratively, and all the applications involve at least two of these sections. All these sections are described below and TABLE 12 presents various IoT applications in agriculture. TABLE 12 Applications of IoT in Agriculture 1) Observation It is also called monitoring as the main aim of this section is to discern the working of various models, devices, applications, etc. With the incubation of the concept of IoT, it is the first and foremost stage to be smeared. In this phase, all the devices and equipment that are placed strategically are monitored for their work. Sensors, are the major deployment and data collection tools engaged in this phase for data collection of various field and non-field parameters. Monitoring the certain parameters, like soil salinity, pH value, volumetric water content by using various soil sensors and other essential parameters such leaf wetness sensors, color, humidity, etc. helps in the development of systems capable of performing following operations e.g., calculation of leaf area index, leaf health, leaf color, plant growth and aid in the development of automatic plant recognition systems. Other devices like water sensors aid in the monitoring of irrigation levels and requirements of the fields. Thus with such devices, smart irrigation scheduling systems are developed. Also with the gas sensors, remote monitoring devices such as UAV devices or images with hyperspectral reflectance properties, help in the estimation of biomass, nitrogen, carbon, and other essential gases content. This data can also be used to find the vegetative indexes of the filed or large demography. Heavy-duty vehicles such as thrashers, tractors, trucks etc., also need supervision and can use data analytics for farm management. Robots, autonomous vehicles, agricultural drones other equipment also need to be monitored remotely for better farm supervision. Livestock monitoring with the aid of IoT is also an important subject for precision farming. It includes cattle monitoring remotely using tags. Labour is also a major area of concern for precision farming. Since human intervention is generally prone to errors due to differences in understanding, decision making, and methodologies applied to solve a particular problem. Also the induction of human labor is cost-intensive. Therefore, with the application of IoT, human interference can be minimized and a network can be set up for monitoring thus reducing the errors and cost. 2) Data Collection and Corroboration Data is the main constituent of precision farming. It acts as both base and catalyst in the whole process. With IoT, a large number of data is collected in varying forms and formats. Sensors, cameras, and various other nodes aid in the collection of data. In precision agriculture, based on the nature of the problem, the IoT network can be designed and formulated to collect different types of data. After the data is collected, the corroboration also called documentation of the data is very important for better understanding. Corroboration is a natural application of collected data, but certain additions of different samples such as manual or machine integration are also seen. Data once collected needs to be refined and understood, labeled, and thus documented in a certain format. Documentation or corroboration of data helps in formulating statistical analysis and developing the decision support systems. Remote sensing charts and other crop assessing tools can be employed to understand the total crop yield of a particular region. Crop management can also be optimized using corroborating data. A yearly or term analysis can be performed on this data to improve precision farming. Food chain supply management can use the predictive analysis of this data for optimizing and designing new efficient strategies. The major areas where its application is seen are yield mapping for fertilization planning, field planning, agro-food traceability, site-specific measurements based on soil and water analysis, and remote vehicle monitoring for supply chains, etc. 3) Foretelling Also called forecasting is one of the major attributes or applications for decision making that is brought in agriculture with the introduction of IoT. With the IoT devices and network, real-time data analysis along with the comparison to the previously available datasets helps in the forecasting of the upcoming events in much advance. With this foretelling, various decision support systems can be designed capable of taking optimal and real time-decisions. It can also act as a preventive measure mechanism for avoiding or dealing with various upcoming unprecedented situations. With monitoring, data collection, and corroboration, foretelling can help in early disease detection, pest growth, weeding, drought, smart irrigation, and harvesting. Artificial intelligence can be employed for designing these learning systems. With IoT, a predictive analysis could be made way earlier than the harvest period for assessing crop production and consumption. Pre and post-harvest crop monitoring along with behavioral sciences and market analysis can also be employed to help site-specific farming and production increase in precision agriculture in the context of IoT. 4) Governing and Management It is an outcome of the monitoring device. Governing helps in controlling the whole system. Foretelling also plays a major role in governing. With IoT, it is important to govern the farm. Thresholds play a major role in designing a controlling strategy. Controlling is a major addendum of IoT in agriculture. Applications of controlling can be easily seen in site-specific management, working of smart irrigation models, plant growth monitoring models, and early crop analysis models and also in supply chain and smart vehicular navigation, interaction, optimization, and logistics control of farms. With governing, all the new strategies, formulae, practices and methods employed to solve the problems occurring on daily basis in farms can be monitored. These strategies can then be compared and analysed with the previous existential strategies. Therefore a knowledge base can be maintained. From the data analysis of that knowledge base, the best or the optimal strategies that can be employed to design or mould the system can be fetched. Various case studies can be performed to gather and test such information. From this the redundant techniques can be withdrawn and robust ones can be prioritised. With these methodologies and experiments, the management can be made more flexible, scalable and reliable. Also governing and management can be employed to find the best suited solutions. Due to the growth in agriculture sector, various public and private sector projects and startups are being started in various countries across the world. All these projects use artificial intelligence and IoT concepts to provide support and solutions to the growing industry of agriculture. All these projects or startups are explained in the TABLE 13. TABLE 13 IoT Based Public and Private Sector Projects/Startups for Precision Agriculture E. Our Proposed Work Inspired by the contribution of IoT in the field of agriculture, we proposed an architecture for precision farming. The layout of the architecture to be designed is proposed and shown in Fig. 8. The structure proposed for precision farming in case of farm management will constitute of different layers. The first layer would be the sensing layer, in which different types of sensors like soil, humidity, water, light, proximity, and conductive sensors will be deployed in the region of experimentation. All data from the sensors will be sent to the base station. The second layer is the network layer, which consists of gateways, internet, and other devices. This layer manages the traffic of the whole architecture. This layer collects data from the sensing layer and transfers it to the decision layer and the application layer. The third layer is the decision layer, which processes the data, manipulates it, and generates alerts or actions. The next layer is the application layer, which constitutes the firmware and the users. It receives all the inputs from other layers and the outputs are made visible to users. It also manages how the whole architecture will work or look. FIGURE 8. Proposed layered architecture for Precision Agriculture. Show All Our proposed architecture aims to observe and monitor the farm in real-time. Optimize the resource utilization, early detection of the diseases, and identification of the plant species, optimize irrigation facilities, and make definite use of pesticides and other manures. Monitor the growth of plants in each stage and take the necessary actions for the betterment of plants. The model to be designed will take into consideration the earning and investment of the small scale farmer. A scalable and cost efficient model will be designed by considering the reusability and recycling of the materials used. From the literature, it is found that the issue of interoperability and robustness is still not achieved. So, while designing the model these issues will be prioritized. Also, power supply and power consumption is a bottleneck for each model. So, from the literature it is found that energy harnessing approaches can be used to address this issue. In the proposed model, main focus will be on incorporating the concepts of energy harnessing approaches like solar energy and wind flow energy for power optimization. Harnessing solar energy for regions which have different season’s e.g., Kashmir, which has four seasons like spring, summer, autumn and winter throughout the year. So for these regions depending only on solar energy will be a bottle neck. Therefore, in the proposed work, a hybrid approach based on consumption of both wind and solar energy for reducing power consumption will be proposed. Some of the major findings of the proposed work will be: A scalable and cost efficient model will be designed by considering the reusability and recycling of materials used. The issues of interoperability and robustness issues of heterogeneous devices will be targeted. Power supply and power consumption being the bottleneck of each model will be targeted. To tackle such issues, energy conservation and energy harnessing approaches like solar and wind energy will be used. Harnessing solar energy for regions which have different season’s e.g., Kashmir, which has four seasons like spring, summer, autumn and winter throughout the year. So for these regions depending only on solar energy will be a bottle neck. Therefore in the proposed work, a hybrid approach based on consumption of both wind and solar energy for reducing power consumption will be proposed. Small scale farmers will be targeted for the development of sustainable and robust model. SECTION VI. Conclusion The Internet is revolutionizing our world.

Introduction The population of the world will increase to 9.1 billion approximately thirty-four percent as of today by the end of 2050. Food requirement will increase by 70 percent and due to rapid urbanization, land availability for agriculture will decrease drastically in the coming years. India will be the most populated country by 2050 and presently it is already lagging the domestic food production. The main reason for reduced food production is the lack of planning, unpredictable weather conditions, improper harvesting and irrigation techniques and livestock mismanagement. In the last few years, nature has experienced a drastic change in weather conditions due to global warming. The average temperature of the earth has been increased due to which there is uncertainty in climatic conditions. Frequent droughts, heavy rainfall are the biggest challenge for poor farmers. According to the government of India annual economic survey, adverse climatic conditions, reduce the farmer’s income by 20-25%. Precision agriculture [1], [2] is one of the solutions to ensure food security for the entire world [3]. Precision agriculture also abbreviated as digital agriculture is a technology-enabled data-driven sustainable farm management system. It is basically the adoption of modern information technologies, software tools, and smart embedded devices for decision support in agriculture [4] as shown in figure 1. Mechanized agriculture and the green revolution are the two key components of the first and second agriculture revolution. Precision farming is an important part of the third agriculture revolution [5]. FIGURE 1. Precision agriculture. Show All John Deere introduced this technology in 1990 for the sowing of seeds and spraying of fertilizers using global positioning system (GPS) controlled tractors. The main focus of precision farming is to reduce the production cost and environmental effects to increase the farm’s profitability. Digital technologies such as IoT [6], AI, data analytics, cloud computing, and block-chain technology play a key role in precision agriculture. In precision farming, IoT based smart sensors are deployed in the agriculture land for collecting data related to soil nutrients, fertilizers, and water requirements as well as for analysing the crop growth. Autonomous and semi-autonomous devices such as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [7] and robots are used for identifying weed and disease in the plants using computer vision techniques. Satellite images are also used in precision agriculture for monitoring the field and identifying the diseases in the plants. The data obtained from the deployed sensors [8] are processed and analyzed using ML algorithms to make farming practice more controlled and optimized. ML algorithms are also used for weather and rainfall prediction based on the data obtained from sensors, climatic records, and satellite images. This could save the lives of thousands of farmers who commit suicide because of crop loss due to uncertainty in weather conditions. Smart livestock management is an important component of precision agriculture. It helps in monitoring the health, welfare, productivity, and reproduction of animals throughout their life cycle. Sensors and cameras monitor animal’s health and computer vision techniques help in making intelligent decisions such as stopping the communal spread of diseases. Autonomous tractors and automated irrigation systems provide modern farming solutions to farmers. The widespread utilization of precision farming across the world is due to the presence of innovative machine and deep learning (DL) algorithms, high-speed internet access, and efficient computational devices. In [10] authors have discussed applications of ML for sustainable agriculture supply chain (ASC) performance. Authors have presented a unique ML-ASC framework that can guide researchers and agriculture practitioners to understand the role and importance of digital technologies in the agriculture industry. In [11] authors reviewed different ML applications in agriculture and discussed how digital technologies will benefit the agriculture industry. In this paper, the authors have presented a comprehensive review of the ML application for precision agriculture. This review article will provide an insight into the research community about the adoption of digital practices in the agriculture management system. It is anticipated that government agencies will frame policies to promote precision farming across the world. The main contribution of the article is outlined as follows: Applications of artificial intelligence and IoT in precision agriculture are discussed along with their practical implications.

TABLE 1 Key Differences of the Article With Published Articles SECTION II. Impact of Artificial Intelligence and IoT in Agriculture The term AI was first coined in the Dartmouth conference in the year 1956 by John McCarthy and he defined it as a science and engineering of making intelligent machines or more specifically intelligent computer programs. AI technology provides computational intelligence to machines so that they can learn, understand and react according to the situation. ML, DL, natural language processing (NLP), swarm intelligence (SI), expert systems, fuzzy logic, and computer vision are the subfields of AI as shown in figure 2. This field finds endless applications across different sectors of human life. Intelligent AI programs are widely explored in health-care, agriculture, finance, robotics, e-commerce and the automation industry. Samsung, Apple, and other electronics giant companies announced that they will be utilizing this technology in every device they will manufacture in the near future. IoT is another emerging technology in which smart sensors, devices are interconnected through the internet. These smart sensors can be utilized to gather data across different disciplines such as solar plants, agriculture fields, disaster-prone areas, manufacturing industry for efficient resource utilization. With the increase in population over the year’s demand for agriculture products is increasing day by day. However, with limited land availability for farming and reduce interest among the young generation to adopt farming as their profession, it has become a challenging task for the agriculture industry to satisfy the food requirement of millions of people. Now, the agriculture industry is widely adopting smart technologies like IoT and AI to efficiently cultivate organic products in limited land areas as well as to overcome the traditional challenges of farmers. FIGURE 2. Artificial intelligence techniques. Show All IoT based smart farming system is built for monitoring soil nutrients and soil moisture using sensors. ML algorithms are explored for determining the optimum amount of fertilizers required for soils before the sowing of crops. Drones are revolutionizing the agriculture industry. These drones are cameras enabled and are used for different applications such as field and crop monitoring, spraying of pesticides, and drip irrigation. The images captured by the drones over the entire lifecycle of crops can be examined using DL and computer vision algorithms for disease and weed identification. Thereafter, these drones are used for spraying pesticides over the weeds and infected crops. Over the years uncertainty in weather conditions is the main concern of farmers. Drip irrigation using drones is an efficient AI-empowered irrigation system which is basically trained on weather pattern and can effectively reduce the water problems of farmers. AI-enabled robots can be used for harvesting the crops at a much faster pace and in large volumes. Robots can reduce human labour to a large extent and can be used along with drones for monitoring the field. Livestock management is another major concern for farmers. IoT based sensors can be deployed in the field for health monitoring of cattle. This information can be utilized for protecting the bunch of cattle from diseased cattle. NLP based virtual assistant applications like chatbots can update the farmers with the latest advancement in technologies for agriculture. Farmers can finds solutions for their problems and incorporate the latest technology in their farming for improving their field productivity. Thus, AI and IoT are the two major technologies that will play a vital role in the agriculture industry. SECTION III. Machine Learning Algorithms ML is the subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. (Arthur Samuel, 1959) [12]. Alan Turing in the year 1950 proposed the concept of learning machines and wrote a research article “The Turing Test for Machine Intelligence” [13]. He performed a test and examined the machine’s ability to demonstrate intelligent behaviour similar to humans. A machine or intelligent computer program learns and extract knowledge from the data, builds a framework for making predictions or intelligent decisions. Thus, the ML process is divided into three key parts, i.e. data input, model building, and generalization as shown in figure 3. Generalization is the process for predicting the output for the inputs with which the algorithm has not been trained before. ML algorithms are mainly used to solve complex problems where human expertise fails such as weather prediction, spam filtering, disease identification in plants, pattern recognition. FIGURE 3. A Machine learning process. Show All Today, due to the availability of innovative algorithms and large data sets through internet resources industries and research communities are widely using ML algorithms for solving a diverse set of problems. DL is the subfield of the family of ML algorithms which is trained from large sets and uses an artificial neural network (ANN) to make intelligent decisions. ML algorithms are categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning as shown in figure 4. Supervised learning as the name suggests is learning with the supervisor or teacher. This set of algorithms works with labeled data-set which means corresponding to each input there are outputs. The algorithm builds an input-output relationship with this labeled data set and thereafter generalize or predicts outputs for unseen inputs. Supervised learning algorithms used for predicting the categorical value are known as classification algorithms and the algorithms that are used for predicting the numerical value are known as regression algorithms. Unsupervised learning algorithms works with unlabelled data and discovers unknown objects by grouping similar objects. The goal of an unsupervised learning algorithm is to extract hidden knowledge from the training data set thus this approach is difficult to implement than supervised learning algorithms. Reinforcement learning is another approach that learns from the environment through reward and punishment. AlphaGo, a chess-playing game developed by DeepMind utilized reinforcement learning for defeating the world’s best chess-playing computer program. FIGURE 4. Categorization of machine learning algorithms. Show All In this paper the performance of different ML algorithms are analysed and discussed in the field of agriculture. Table 2 presents different types of supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning algorithms utilized for soil and weather prediction, disease and weed identification, intelligent irrigation and harvesting techniques as well as livestock management. TABLE 2 Machine Learning Algorithms SECTION IV. Machine Learning Applications in Precision Agriculture In many countries, the farmers rely on the traditional ways of farming which is based on the reliability of the suggestions from the elderly and their experience. This method leaves farmers at the mercy of random climatic conditions which are already getting random due to global warming and uneven rainfall patterns. The manual spraying method for pesticides led to improper usage of resources and harms the environment. AI and IoT enabled precision agriculture removes the randomness and assist new age farmer to optimize every step of the farming process. Figure 5 (a) and (b) presents a pictorial view of traditional agriculture and technology enabled farm management system. FIGURE 5. (a) Traditional agriculture cycle (b) Precision agriculture cycle. Show All Gaitán [14] provided a systematic study of the impact of extreme weather events, such as hail events, cold waves, heat waves, and their impact on agricultural practices. The author reported floods, droughts, frost, hail, heatwaves, and pest outbreaks are impacted by climatic conditions. The AI systems are applicable in each farming operation as depicted in figure 4 and some of them even extend beyond the conventionally recognized steps. In this section we will discuss the state of art techniques proposed/implemented by various researchers and practitioners worldwide. A. Soil Properties and Weather Prediction Prediction of soil properties is the first and the most crucial step which influences the selection of crop, land preparation, selection of seed, crop yield, and selection of fertilizers /manure. The soil properties are directly related to the geographic and climatic conditions of the land in use and hence is an important factor to take into consideration. The soil properties prediction mostly consists of predicting nutrients in the soil, soil surface humidity, weather conditions during the lifecycle of the crop. Human activities have highly affected the properties of soil and hence our ability to cultivate the crops [15]. In general, there are 17 essential elements as listed in table 3 which play an important role in plant growth [16]. The growth of crops depends on the nutrients available in a particular soil. The soil nutrients are mostly monitored by electric and electromagnetic sensors [8]. Depending on the nutrients farmers make informed decisions as to which crop is optimal for the land. However, the nutrients can be added through fertilizers, manure, etc. but with an additional cost. Some of them may also damage the environment and have an adverse effect on the soil cycle. TABLE 3 Essential Plant Nutrients [2] A scientific analysis of soil nutrients, soil moisture, pH is important for determining the soil properties. Acar et al. [17] employed an extreme learning machine (ELM) based regression model for prediction of soil surface humidity. The author selected two terrains having area 4 KM2 and 16 KM2 located in Dicle university campus for experimental analysis. The real-time field data was extracted using polarimetric Radarsat-2 data, which was pre-processed using the SNAP toolbox [18] and features were added with the help of local measurements by separating the field into square grids. Once the pre-processing and feature extraction is done the data is passed to ELM based regression model to predict the soil surface humidity. The algorithm was tested with 5 different kernel functions and the prediction was validated using leave-one-out cross-validation technique. The experimental results confirmed the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.19% when using ‘sine’ kernel function. Wang et al. [19] deployed soft sensors based on ELM for the measurement of nutrient solution composition in the soilless cultivation method. The soilless cultivation method is an emerging planting method. It is imperative to monitor the pH value, temperature and concentration changes in nutrient solution composition as the performance of soilless cultivation is highly dependent on these parameters. The significant variables in a nutrient solution cannot be measured directly hence these are determined with the help of auxiliary variables. The authors utilized conductivity, pH value, flow rate, and temperature measurements for auxiliary measurements. These auxiliary measurements are fed to a deep belief network-based ELM which predicts the values of significant variables. For experimental analysis, the authors deployed the model to measure the concentration of SO 2− 4 , and H 2 PO − 4 in a nutrient solution. The authors reported an average RMSE of 1.2414 for predictions in SO 2− 4 and RMSE of 0.8892 for prediction of H 2 PO − 4 . Park et al. [20] utilized ML algorithms to predict the soil moisture using data from MODIS. The authors downscaled the AMSR2 soil moisture to 1KM using random forest (RF) and Cubist algorithms. An ensemble of these algorithms was used to obtain soil moisture data. The results obtained through the ML methods were compared with the statistical ordinary least squares technique. The ML model exhibited a R 2 (coefficient of determination) of 0.96 and an RMSE of 0.06, whereas a R 2 of 0.47 and a RMSE of 0.16 was associated with the statistical ordinary least squares. Reda et al. [21] explored ML algorithms to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in soil samples collected from four agricultural lands of Moroccan. Data set of near-infrared spectroscopy is utilized in comparison to traditional chemical methods as this technique reduces the computation time and resource utilization. The ensemble learning modeling algorithm presents the best performance among other regression models and back-propagation neural networks (BPNN) algorithm. The proposed algorithm presents R 2 of 0.96, RMSE of 1.92, performance to deviation (RPD) of 4.87 for SOC and R 2 of 0.94 and RMSE of 0.57, RPD of 4.91 for TN prediction. Morellos et al. [22] also utilized visible and infrared spectroscopy to determine TN, SOC, and moisture content (MC) in the arable field in Premslin Germany. Spectroscopy dataset is used for building the predictive ML model for estimating all three soil properties. Least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and cubist ML algorithms outperform principal component regression and partial least square regression multivariate methods in terms of RMSE and residual prediction deviation (RPD). LS-SVM best predict SOC and MC with RMSE of 0.062 and 0.457, RPD of 2.24, and 2.20. Cubist best predicts for TN with RMSE of 0.071 and RPD of 1.96. Andrade et al. [23] build ordinary least square regression, RF, cubist regression, XGboost prediction model for determining soil properties from portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry dataset in Brazilian coastal plains. Three soil properties total nitrogen, soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC) were analyzed using RF, ordinary least squares regression (OLS), cubist regression (CR), XGBoost (XGB). RF algorithm gives the best performance with R 2 of 0.50 for TN, R 2  0.75 for CEC and 0.56 for SOM. Deiss et al. [24] estimated the soil properties (clay, sand, pH, SOC) in northern Tanzania and USA Midwest from the spectroscopy dataset using ML algorithms. THE tuned SVM model outperforms the partial least square (PLS) regression model in terms of predicting all the soil parameters. Mahmoudzadeh et al. [25] explored the ML algorithm to predict SOC in the Kurdistan province of Iran. The simulation results suggest that RF accurately predicts SOC with R 2 of 0.60 and RMSE of 0.35% in comparison to SVM, kNN, Cubist, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML algorithm. The study also suggests that air temperature, annual rainfall, valley depth, texture of terrain surface are some of the important factors that influence SOC spread over the Kurdistan region. Veres et al. [26] explored DL architecture such as CNN for predicting the soil properties from the infra-red spectroscopy dataset. Benke et al. [27] predict soil electrical conductivity (EC) and SOC in different regional locations of Victoria, Australia using pedotransfer function (PTF) based on ML algorithm. PTF basically converts soil measurement into soil properties and provides inputs for ML simulation algorithms. In the proposed approach PTF use Generalised Linear Mixed Effects Model (GLMM) model and Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) to predict‘ the soil properties. Traditional approaches to soil properties and crop yield prediction require time-consuming field surveys and the deployment of expensive sensors. Khanal et al. [28] proposed an alternative approach in which the dataset for the prediction of soil properties and crop yield is generated using remotely sensed aerial images of agricultural land. Five soil properties, viz. pH value, magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), SOM, CEC, and crop yield were predicted using RF, SVM, Cubist, NN, Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) ML algorithms. NN presents the highest prediction accuracy for SOM having R 2 of 0.64, RMSE of 0.44 and CEC having R 2 of 0.67, RMSE of 2.35; SVM best predicts K having R 2 of 0.21, RMSE of 0.49 and Mg having R 2 of 0.22, RMSE of 4.57; and GBM best predicts pH having R 2 of 0.15, RMSE of 0.62. RF outperforms other algorithms in terms of crop yield prediction and presents higher accuracy having R 2 of 0.53 and RMSE of 0.97. Labrador et al. [29] estimate calcium and Mg content in soil using generalized regression NN and genetic algorithm (GA). The digital elevation model and satellite images were used as input to the prediction model for estimating the soil properties. Chlingaryan et al. [30] discussed different ML approaches used in precision agriculture for accurate crop yield prediction and soil nitrogen estimation over the last fifteen years. Ju-Young et al. [31] investigated a seasonal climatic forecasting model using regularized ELM to predict day-wise mean air temperature at field level for a period of 90 days. The authors selected data from Korea Metrological Administration using the Met GloSea5GC2 model [32]. The authors fed 240 days of forecast data and hindcast data from the ensemble based model to the RELM algorithm. The algorithm performance was evaluated by measuring: RMSE, mean absolute error (MAE) the model prediction vs the actual values. The authors achieved an RMSE in the range of 1.02 to 3.35 which outperformed the meteorological data which has an RMSE range of 1.61 to 3.37. Soil moisture content is an important parameter to acknowledge in the agriculture industry as it addresses precise irrigation scheduling. Stamenkovic et al. [33] build a support vector regression (SVR) prediction model to predict soil moisture content from remotely sensed hyperspectral images. Song et al. [34] proposed a macroscopic cellular automata (MCA) model and combined its deep belief network (DBN) to predict soil moisture content over a cornfield in northwest china. The simulation results of DBN-MCA outperforms the multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-MCA in terms of RMSE. Acheing [35] explored the SVR model (i.e. RBF), ANN, DNN for simulating soil water retention curve (SWRC) curve of loamy sand. Dataset of loamy sand subjected to wetting and drying condition is collected using a reflectometer and tensiometer. RBF based SVR model best predicts SWRC under both wet and dry conditions. Feng et al. [36] estimate soil temperature at various soil depths of Loess Plateau of China. Four different ML algorithms ELM, generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), backpropagation neural networks (BPNN), and RF were investigated for predicting the soil temperature. ML algorithms were trained with air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and vapour pressure and solar radiation as input parameters and the simulations show that ELM outperforms other ML algorithms in terms of RMSE, MAE, Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) and concordance correlation coefficient. Mohammadi et al. [37] explored ELM for predicting daily dew point temperature in different parts of Iran. This part of the world experience different climatic conditions throughout the year. The proposed model accurately predicts dew point temperature than SVM and ANN algorithms. Zhu et al. [38] accurately predict daily evapotranspiration in Northwest China using hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ELM model to optimize crop water requirement in agriculture. Alizamir et al. [39] accurately predicts soil temperature at different depths of 5, 10, 50 and 100 cm using ELM, ANN, classification and regression trees, group method of data handling using dataset obtained from Mersin station operated by Turkish Meteorological Service. The simulation results suggest that soil temperature can be estimated easily using air temperature upto depth of 50 cm while for depth of 100 cm additional information of solar radiation and wind speed is required. Rainfall prediction plays a critical role in the water resource management system, flood risk assessment, and the agriculture industry. Acknowledging the chaotic nature of rainfall, it is very difficult for statistical approaches to accurately predict the rainfall. Cramer et al. [40] evaluated the performance of seven ML algorithms for rainfall prediction. The statistical results show that the radial-basis function neural network (RBFNN) shows the best performance among other state of the art algorithms. Sierra and Jesus [41] predicted the rainfall in Tenerife, an island in Spain based on atmospheric synoptic patterns using different ML algorithms and found NN gave the best performance among other ML algorithms. Kamatchi and Parvathi [42] employed NN for weather prediction and proposed a hybrid recommender system for enhancing the success ratio of the system. Lazri et al. [43] build a multi-classifier model for estimating precipitation using MSG images (Meteosat second generation) and dataset obtained using radar. The proposed approach shows that the proposed multi-classifier improves the standard of classification. Shardoor and Rao [44] surveyed three different approaches i.e. ML techniques, data mining techniques, and satellite forecasting techniques for rainfall prediction. Table 4 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms for prediction of soil properties and weather prediction. TABLE 4 Different ML Algorithms for Prediction of Soil Properties and Weather Conditions B. Crop Yield Prediction A significant piece of information for any farmer is the prediction of crop yield and how the yield can be increased. pH value, soil type, and quality, weather pattern: temperature, rainfall, humidity, sunshine hours, fertilizers, and harvesting schedules are some of the parameters which play an important role in predicting the crop yield [45]. Scientifically manual farming can be considered as a feedback control system in which the corrective action is taken once a setback in a crop is observed. The crop yield will highly depend on the efficiency of the optimal utilization of the above-mentioned resources. If some kind of anomaly goes undetected in the initial stage may harm the crop yield in an unprecedented way. Singh et al. [46] assessed hailstorms on India’s wheat production and observes that in February and March 2015 alone the hailstorm events caused a decline of 8.4% in national wheat production. For financially weak farmers in a country such as India, where intermittent storage of harvested crops is a rare resource, accurate weather predictions may turn to be miraculous for farmers. ML models when systematically applied to a system act as feedforward control. With the help of accurate ML models, we can anticipate the factors which are going to affect the crop yield. Hence the corrective action can be taken before even an anomaly hits the crop production. Kamir et al. [47] used ML models to identify the yield gap hotspots in wheat production. Authors generated very high-resolution yield maps using data from various sources between 2009 and 2015. The data was collected from various sources:(a) NDVI time-series data across Australia using the MOD13Q1 data set [48], (b) rainfall and temperature data were collected from historic climate data at Australia bureau of metrology, (c) maps for observed grain yield were collected at source using intelligent harvesting machines. The dataset generated were tested with 9 ML algorithms: RF, XGBoost, Cubist, MLP, SVR, Gaussian Process, k-NN, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines. The authors combined predictions from each of the algorithms into ensembles for prediction optimization [49]. Out of these algorithms, SVR with RBFNN outperformed other algorithms and investigators were able to achieve the yield estimate with an R 2  of 0.77 and an RMSE value of 0.55t ha −1 . The results were validated using 10-fold cross-validation techniques applied to the full data set. Aghighi et al. [50] used various advanced regression algorithms to predict the yield of silage maize crops. The authors selected maize fields located at Moghan Agro-Industrial and Animal Husbandry Company (MAIAHC), which is about 28,000 hectares’ area and located in Iran. The crop yield dataset was collected for around 40 silage maize fields were collected for a period from 2013-2015. In addition to it, the historic crop yield data the authors also gathered time-series NDVI data from Landsat 8 OLI satellite. The data was fed to advanced regression algorithms: (a) Gaussian Process Regression, (b) SVR, (c) Boosted Regression tree (d) RF Regression models and the prediction form each of the regression models were compared and evaluated. Authors found out the boosted regression tree reported best evaluation parameters with an average R-value of higher than 0.87, and RMSE in a range of 8.5 to 11.10, with a mean value of 9.5 during the period 2013-14. Kuwata and Shibasaki [51] employed DL models to estimate the crop yield. Authors deployed SVR for predicting the yield of corn in Illinois. For input following dataset was employed by the authors: (a) 5 year moving average of corn crop yield, (b) The enhanced vegetation index is obtained using the MOD09A1 dataset MODIS satellite, and (c) Historic climatic data. The dataset was fed to support the vector regression model and the authors reported an RMSE of 8.204 and a correlation coefficient of 0.644 for the model. For result, validation authors conducted 10-fold cross-validation on the full data set. Kulkarni et al. [52] utilized DL models to predict rice crop yield. The authors utilized soil properties and nutrients measurements recorded over 31 years and historic rainfall data. The input data was fed to recurrent neural network models for crop yield prediction. For effective prediction the authors explored different activation functions viz. sigmoid, reLu, and linear in the neural network. Chu and Yu [53] builds an end to end summer and winter rice prediction model in 81 counties in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. The proposed BBI model works in three stages, in the first stage the original area data and time series metrological data is pre-processed and its output works as input for the second stage where BPNN and RNN (recurrent neural network) learns deep spatial and temporal features from the input data. In the third stage, BPNN learns the relationship between deep features and rice yield to predict the summer and winter rice yields. The performance of the model is evaluated in terms of error and rate of convergence, the model presents lowest error values with MAE and RMSE of 0.0044 and 0.0057 for summer rice prediction and 0.0074 and 0.0192 for winter rice prediction while the algorithm converges within 100 iterations. Feng et al. [54] proposed a hybrid approach for wheat yield prediction in new-south Wales in southeastern Australia. Multiple growth specific indicators, viz. agricultural production system simulators (APSIM), NDVI, and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index) are used before the prediction of wheat yield using regression models (multiple linear regression (MLR) and RF). APSIM+ RF hybrid model presents the best performance among other predictors in terms of prediction accuracy. Cai et al. [55] integrated two data sources, i.e. climate data and satellite data over fourteen years to predict the wheat yield in Australia using ML algorithms (SVM, RF, and NN). Simulation results show that climate data provides distinctive information in comparison to satellite data for yield prediction with R 2 of around 0.75. Planting the crops on accurate date plays an important role in improving productivity and reducing financial loss. Gumuscu et al. [56] explored three supervised ML algorithms; kNN, SVM, and decision trees for predicting planting dates; early, normal, and late for wheat crops in Turkey. The authors utilized climate data of the last 300 days to train ML algorithms and explored GA for feature selection. kNN classification ML algorithm shows robust performance and best predicts the planting dates of wheat crops. Several African, American, and Asian countries are the major producer of coffee in the world. Nevavuori et al.

The simulation result shows the superior performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of prediction intervals coverage probability and prediction interval normalized average width under uncertain weather conditions. Peng et al. [62] explored remote sensed satellite-based Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) dataset for training ML algorithms to predict maize and soybean yield in the mid-west region of the United States.

The proposed model accurately predicts the maize yield with RMSE of 12% of the average yield for predicted weather dataset and 11% of the average yield for perfect weather dataset and outperforms LASSO, shallow neural network (SNN) and regression tree (RT). Simulation results show that environmental factors have a large impact on the prediction accuracy of crop yield. In most areas of Africa, agriculture field data is scarcely available thus remotely sensed dataset is widely used for monitoring the field. Leroux et al. [64] explored the ML algorithm for predicting the maize yield in Burkina Faso with a remotely sensed dataset. A process-based crop model SARRO which is basically designed to simulate attainable agricultural yields under tropical conditions is used in this study.

These parameters are in real-time send to the cloud through IoT devices and permit the implementation of an agriculture decision-support system.

Table 5 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms for crop yield prediction. TABLE 5 Different ML Algorithms for Crop Yield Prediction C. Disease and Weed Detection Disease fungi, microorganisms, and bacteria take their energy from the plants they live on, which in turn affects the crop yield. If not detected at the right time may account for a huge economic loss to farmers. A lot of financial burden goes to a farmer in the form of pesticides, to get rid of diseases and restore the functioning of crops. Excessive use of pesticides also leads to environmental damage and the effects of the water and soil cycle of the agricultural land. Using an optimally designed AI system during crop growth period not only reduces the risk of crop disease and minimizes the economic impact, but it also results in minimizing the adverse impact of unsystematic farming on the environment. Sambasivan and Opiyo [70] used a CNN based DL model to detect disease in cassava crops for imbalanced datasets. The authors took a database of 10,000 labeled images that were pre-processed to improve the image contrast using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization algorithm.

Drip Irrigation In the modern era, irrigation for crops has been improvised using the concept of drip irrigation [100], where the system consists of thin plastic tubes placed in or above the soil along the vertical rows of the plants for nurturing the water supply to the crops. Employing the proper operational management of drip irrigation, minimizes the utilization of water supply for crop production, and provides a better yield of crops. Socio-economic and environmental demands have widely appreciated in use of drip irrigation on farmlands for agriculture, especially for the high cost valued crops i.e., vegetables and fruits. Furthermore, drip irrigation is based on the low-pressure watering system in comparison to sprinkler systems; this makes the system more efficient in terms of energy consumption [101]. Various advantages have been observed using drip irrigation in agriculture over other irrigation systems which include sub-irrigation systems or sprinkler irrigation systems. These advantages are entitled to minimal usage of water supply, usage of soluble fertilizers through a drip irrigation system, automated system, minimization of soil erosion, uninterrupted activities, minimized weed problems, facilitation of double-cropping. Precision irrigation is another innovative approach in intelligent farming where it uses the water intelligently that further helps the farmers to achieve better yield in crops with minimal water usage. It can also be featured as providing the right amount of water, at the right time and the right place in the field. It focuses its implementation based on variable rate irrigation (VRI) methods employing drips or sprinklers. [102]–[104]. Advancements in the field of on-farm sensor technologies, weather forecasting, IoT based sensor detection system of vegetation and precision-based smart irrigation produces a huge size of data that ultimately benefits the farmers in optimizing the usage of water resources, improve the yield of crops and maximizes the profit of farmers [105]. ML and DL and reinforcement learning are employed on the historical data and it provides various opportunities for real-time prediction and decision making purposes for smart irrigation which are solely based on the data collected by the sensors and IoT enabled systems [106]–[109]. Roberts et al. [110] have discussed that a sensor-based control system might create some bottleneck in terms of reducing the reliability of decision support tools on process-based crop models, which further may require costly calibration and affect in generating an uncertain representation of soil-plant-atmosphere processes. Further, ML techniques have been employed extremely well for protection analysis of hydrological processes i.e., soil moisture and groundwater levels [111], [112]. Li et al. [113] utilized ANN for estimating nitrate distribution in different types of soils under a drip irrigation system. Kavianand et al. [114] proposed a fully automated drip irrigation system based on the ARM9 processor along with different kinds of sensors equipped for monitoring the PH content and nitrogen content of the soil and controlling the irrigation of the field. Emmanuel et al. [115] establishes an experimental set-up in a greenhouse in Malaysia to monitor the growth of mustard leaf vegetable plants through IoT devices and alongside developed a data-driven model of drip irrigation system. Soil moisture, irrigation volume, evapotranspiration were measured through sensors and were given to the Raspberry Pi 3 controller for storing it in the cloud. This data was utilized by different predictive models ARX, BJ, and state-space models to predict soil moisture content for an optimized drip irrigation system. ARX model outperforms other predictive models in terms of MSE and response time. Seyedzadeh et al. [116] explored ML algorithms to optimize the uniform emitter discharge rate of drip irrigation system under varying pressure and temperature conditions. In this model operating pressure, water temperature, discharge coefficient, pressure exponent, and nominal discharge were taken as input parameters while ration of emitter discharge to nominal discharge is taken as output temperature. Authors explored four different ML algorithms for optimizing emitter discharge rate and simulation results show that LS-SVM presents best results with the least error of mean absolute error. Peng et al. [117] utilize soil moisture, soil electrical conductivity, air temperature, and light intensity parameters to build an optimized irrigation prediction model using backpropagation NN in China. The proposed prediction model presents good results with MSE of 0.00857724. The authors also identified an optimized layout and network arrangement for pipe in a drip irrigation system using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. The simulation results present that the H-shaped network layout is more suitable for field crop irrigation than the comb-shaped and fish bone-shaped layout. Drip irrigation system gives the best performance when the wetting front dimension, i.e. diameter, depth, and upward movement are optimized. Shiri et al. [118] explored soft-computing approaches viz., gene expressions programming (GEP), and RF techniques in modeling wetting front dimensions over different soil types for surface and sub-surface irrigation system. Proposed model, best predicts ETc with an improved correlation coefficient and decreases MSE and MAE. Elnesr and Alazba [119] explored ANN for predicting the wetting front dimensions from the dataset of a well-tested HYDRUS 2D/3D model. The simulation results show that the proposed model has a good correlation of 0.93-0.99. Chang et al.

The authors built an experimental set-up in a greenhouse and deployed wireless sensors for monitoring the plant growth and environmental conditions along with plant growth control actuators. Estimation of evapotranspiration (ETc) plays a vital role in water resource management system. Chen et al. [125] estimate crop actual ETc from temporal convolution network (TCN) from the dataset of lysimeters for maize under drip irrigation with film mulch. Simulation results show that the proposed model best predicts ETc with an improved correlation coefficient and decreases MSE and MAE. Table 7 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms for drip irrigation. TABLE 7 Different ML Algorithms for Drip Irrigation E. Livestock Production and Management Livestock production is basically related to the production and management of cattle i.e., sheep, pigs, etc. for human consumption in terms of meat. Livestock production and their management are based on the farming parameters of these cattle i.e., health, food, nutrition, and behaviour to optimize their production in such a way that the economic efficiency of this livestock can be maximized. In the present scenario, Artificial intelligence, IoT and Blockchain technologies [126] are widely explored to improves livestock sustainability and for analysis of their chewing habits, eating patterns, their movement patterns i.e., standing, moving, drinking and feeding habits, indicate the amount of stress the animal is going through which in turn helps in predicting the vulnerability to disease, weight gain, and production of the livestock. Furthermore, an ML-based weight predicting system can help in the estimation of their body weight 90–180 days before the slaughtering day. According to these analyses and estimations, farmers can change their diet plans and living conditions for their better growth in terms of health, behaviour, and weight gain which in turn will improve the economic efficiency of these livestock [127], [128]. Villeneuve et al. [129] build a decision support system that encounters not only real-time data but also expert knowledge for precision sheep farming. Livestock production and management can be further classified into two sub-categories, i.e., animal welfare and livestock production. Animal welfare generally deals with the animal’s health and their well-being; for this ML techniques are applied to their health monitoring feature for prospective of early disease detection. Whereas, livestock production employs the ML on the estimation of the balanced production of livestock for the producers to achieve economic benefits. Dutta et al. [130] described a procedure for the classification of cattle behaviour employing the ML techniques for data collection using collar-based sensors i.e., magnetometers and three-axis accelerometers. In this study, events such as oestrus and dietary changes on cattle have been analyzed for their well-nutrition. Pegorini et al. [131] presented an automatic identification and classification of chewing habits of claves employing ML-based techniques for analysing their health and behavioural patterns. Ebrahimie et al. [132] proposed ML predictive model for estimating Sub-Clinical Mastitis (SCM) from milking parameters in dairy herds. Mastitis is an inflammatory disease that is widely affecting the dairy industry. Author’s explored four classification models decision trees, stump decision trees, parallel decision trees, and random forest to discover SCC independent of Somatic Cell Count (SCC) which is widely used to measure SCM worldwide. RF with Gini Index criteria best predicts SCM with an accuracy of 90%. Ebrahimie et al. [133] explored the attribute weighting model (AWM) for identifying lactose concentration and electrical conductivity in milk, which are two of the major indicators of SCM in dairy cattle. Hyde et al. [134] also explored RF to predict the route of transmission of germs and classify them into contagious (CONT) or environmental (ENV) with ENV further sub-classified into non-lactating “dry” period (EDP) or lactating period (EL). The simulation results show that an accuracy of 98% was achieved for discovering CONT vs ENV and 78% for discovering EDP and EL. Esener et al. [135] utilized spectral profiles dataset to discriminates CONT and ENV strains using GA, NN, and quick classifier. Ebrahimi et al. [136] predicted sub-clinical bovine mastitis using a large milking dataset collected through an automated in-line monitoring system in commercial New Zealand dairy farm. The simulation results show that GBM outperforms other ML model and best predict sub-clinical bovine mastitis with an accuracy of 84.9%. Sharifi et al. [137] explored meta-analysis and decision trees data mining tools to discover genes that can help to find mastitis in dairy cattle. Machado et al. [138] explored the RF model to identify factors influencing the occurrence of Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) viral disease in cattle in southern Brazil. The proposed approach identifies that insemination, the number of cattle in neighbouring farms, and routine rectal palpation are among the main factors of the occurrence of this disease. Matthews et al. [139] developed an ML-based automated monitoring system for tracking animal behaviour and movement i.e., standing, moving, feeding, and drinking by employing the depth video cameras and sensors. Qiao et al. [140] explored the DL technique Mask R-CNN for examining cattle health and welfare information in precision livestock management. The proposed model extract key features from image frames, enhance the image to remove non-uniform illumination shadow influences, segment image of cattle from the background image using the Mask R-CNN DL tool, and lastly extract cattle contour lines from the segmented image. The proposed approach outperforms SharpMask and DeepMask image segmentation models with mean pixel accuracy of 0.92 and an average distance error of 33.56 pixels. Liakos et al. [141] explored ML model for predicting healthy cattle and cattle suffering from lameness utilizing basic features of cattle which includes per day habits of cattle like steps taken, overall walking, lying, and eating habits. Morales et al. [142] employed a method based on SVM for early detection, warnings, and production issues of eggs in the poultry farms. The simulation results show that the proposed technique alerts a day before with an estimation accuracy of 0.9854. The identification of livestock is an important aspect of monitoring growth and animal welfare. Hansen et al. [143] explored deep learning techniques CNN for identifying pigs faces from the dataset of digital images of pigs obtained from commercial farm environment where the parameters such as dirt and lighting are highly unpredictable. The proposed approach accurately predicts the faces with an accuracy of 96.7%. Fenlon et al. [144] build a decision support system using predictive ML algorithms to provide calving assistance in the dairy industry. Four ML techniques multimodal regression, decision trees, RF, and NN were explored to predict three calving difficulties unassisted, slight assistance, and veterinary assistance. The simulation result shows that NN and multimodal regression models accurately classify 75% of calving difficulties with an average prediction error of 3.7% and 4.5%. Fenlon et al. [145] analyzed calving difficulties in dairy herds in Ireland using ML algorithms. A dataset of parity, log days in milk, inter-service interval, difficulties faced in the last calving, herd body conditions were built to predict conceptions using artificial insemination in the Iris dairy industry. Logistic regression outperforms RF, decision trees, and Naive Bayes in predicting conception using artificial insemination. Borchers et al. [146] explored RF, linear discriminant, and NN for calving prediction in dairy cattle by examining their behaviour which includes number the of steps, lying time, standing time, transition from one state to other and total motion 14 days before the predicted calving date. Although, the innovative algorithms play a crucial role in livestock management but combining livestock data with public data will improve precision livestock farming standards [147]. Table 8 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms for livestock production and management. TABLE 8 Different ML Algorithms for Livestock Production and Management F. Intelligent Harvesting Techniques Smart harvesting systems helps the farmers to harvest agriculture goods by reducing human efforts. In this approach, technologies such as smart sensors, robotics, UAVs, and IoT devices [148], AI, and ML-based computer vision techniques are employed to intelligently harvest the crops. The research community has provided a comprehensive review of different intelligent techniques used to automate the agriculture industry [149]–[151] and have analyzed the potential and challenges of this decision support system [152]. In the last few years, different robots have been developed for harvesting fruits and vegetables [153]. Smart harvesting offers better insight into the crops and helps farmers to achieve the potential harvest of crops which leads to increased productivity. Smart harvesting system has numerous advantages in comparison to traditional harvesting approaches like it requires less labour, optimized crop yield, maximum probability, better insight into crops, reduced cost of harvesting, and cost-efficient production. A significant problem in the Japanese agriculture industry is a labour shortage. Sakai et al. [154] utilized machine vision for asparagus robot harvesting in Nagasaki prefecture. The speed of asparagus robot harvesting is three times faster than the human being. Since asparagus harvesting is modeled on their size and doesn’t require color properties thus laser sensor is used to collect 3D distance information in the proposed work. Monta et al. [155] also explored laser sensors along with color cameras for tomato harvesting through robots. Preter et al. [156] developed an autonomous system consisting of e-vehicle, cameras, robotic arm, localization system, gripper, quality monitoring, and logistic handling system, which can efficiently detect, plucks, and puts the strawberries in a box. The proposed robot prototype is fast enough to pluck the fruit in just 4 seconds. Hayashi et al. [157] practically evaluated the performance of strawberry harvesting robots in a greenhouse test field. The proposed autonomous system efficiently access the fruit position and its maturity level and pick the fruit with and without suction in a duration of two to three weeks without damaging the fruit. Horng et al. [158] proposed a smart harvesting system that employs IoT and smart image recognition systems for the detection of mature crops using object detection feature trained on MLP neural network. The mature crop can be harvested using a robotic arm whose movement is predicted using ML algorithms. Zhang et al. [159] explored Regions-CNN (RCNN) for multi-class canopy object detection in shake and catch the apple harvesting system. A dataset of RGB images was created in the commercial orchard using a Kinect v2 sensor and pre-trained RCNN is utilized for real-time detection of apple, branches, and trunks. The authors also developed an estimation algorithm to predict shaking location based on the results of RCNN. Spectral and thermal images have also been explored for the detection of fruits and vegetables [160], [161]. Zhang et al. [162] investigated eleven canopy parameters using principal component analysis (PCA) and classified the removal status of apples into mechanically harvested and mechanically unharvested. Zhang et al. [163] reviewed technology progress in the mechanical harvesting of apples which includes shake and catch, robots, and harvest assist platforms. Pise and Upadhye [164] explored Naive Bayes and SVM ML techniques for grading of harvested mangoes based on their color, size, features, quality, and maturity. Grading of fruits increases the profit of the agriculture and food industries. A mango image dataset comprising of three different colors red, green, and yellow is created and is used for training and testing the ML algorithm. The proposed approach presents limited scope as it can detect defects in a particular surface area which can be overcome by creating a dataset of rotational view images. Wu et al. [165] explored NN for recognition, classification of fruits and vegetables, and obstacle avoidance in a harvesting robot. Table 9 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms for intelligent harvesting. TABLE 9 Different ML Algorithms for Intelligent Harvesting SECTION V. IoT Applications in Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture refers to a system with minimizing direct involvement of the caretaker/farmer except when there is an urgent need or an emergency i.e. when there is a failure in the system. IoT helps in maintaining the defined standards of parameters needed for day to day work in agriculture. The parameters can be measured using the required sensors and can be uploaded to an IoT cloud for remote monitoring so that the direct involvement of farmers is minimized. The IoT cloud can be used for control purposes also, say for example in detecting and avoiding animal intrusion in the agriculture field. Sensors are an integral part of IoT for precision agriculture without which the monitoring and controlling becomes next to impossible task. Figure 6 shows the trend search of keywords “IoT in agriculture” and “sensor in agriculture” on google in the last 10 years. Apart from monitoring and controlling, IoT in agriculture is also used as data-storage technology. Parameters like properties of soil, crop yield, seasonal behaviour data, temperature changes, etc can be stored on the IoT cloud which will be helpful in analyses, prediction, and deciding on estimated crop production. FIGURE 6. Google trend response for keywords IoT in agriculture and sensor in agriculture for the last 10 years. Show All A. Sensors for IoT in Precision Agriculture IoT is defined as the interconnection of things, where one example of a thing is a sensor. A group of sensors can communicate with every other sensor and thereby with the control center. A WSN in IoT has the benefits of increasing the efficiency of production, enhancing the yield quality, detecting and avoiding plant-eating pets, detecting the fires in the farms [166]. IoT has helped in increasing the scope of farming, animal, and pet rearing along with smart irrigation [167]. Sensors form an integral part of IoT architecture in agriculture. A sensor is defined as a transducer that converts the sensed parameter (soil moisture, for example) into the equivalent electrical signal. Depending on the nature of the output signal they generate, sensors are classified as analog or digital sensors. An analog sensor’s output needs to be converted to digital before it is being fed, processed by any IoT system. On the other hand, sensors that generate signals in digital form can be directly connected to any IoT system. Table 10 compares the list of some important sensors applicable in precision agriculture. Addressing the complete list of sensors available for precision agriculture is beyond the scope of this article, although, table 10 provides the list of sensors and their parameters that are very widely used and covers almost every aspect of IoT in agriculture. A pair of sensors and actuators can be used to collect information about some of the vital parameters of precision agriculture and react to perform predefined action whenever required. IoT plays an important role in assuring that the action performed happens instantaneously with minimum delay. The factors that can affect the real-time decision making and causes a delay is the tolerance of the measuring parameter and the communication protocol used. The operating temperature where the sensors are placed have a proportional effect on tolerance. An increase temperature on either side will increase the tolerance of the measuring parameter and sensor reading will deviate the value of the measurand from the actual value. The communication protocol is used to send the readings of the sensor to the microcontroller from where the value will be uploaded to the IoT cloud. The data rate of communication protocol decides the time required for this data transfer. TABLE 10 Sensor Parameters Used in Precision Agriculture B. Wireless Sensor Networks in Precision Agriculture WSN is the collection of spatially displaced sensor deployed to monitor the physical parameters of the environment and coordinating the collected data at central location. IoT transfers the recorded data to cloud which is further processed and analyzed through intelligent algorithms. In precision agriculture integration of artificial intelligence with WSN allows real time monitoring and intelligent decision making in agriculture fields. IoT sensor network which includes soil moisture senor, electrochemical sensor, optical sensors, etc. continuously monitor the field data and works as a training data for ML and DL algorithms. Edge computing enabled AI systems assist in reducing the amount of data to be uploaded to IoT cloud by identification of meaningful data to be communicated and discarding the redundant data. Intelligent processing of data generated from nodes result in better management of sensor network In [185] author utilized AI driven sensor network to classify land as suitable, more suitable, moderately suitable and unsuitable after every cultivation. In [186] author developed a power efficient WSN using Arduino microcontroller and ZigBee module to monitor and control essential parameters that effect crop growth such as soil and weather conditions in Florida, USA. In [187] author integrating sensor nodes with AI systems to reduce the power consumption of nodes by optimizing the performance and data transmission of respective nodes. RNN based Long-Short term (LSTM) network was built which increases the runtime of a single sensor and guarantees 180 days autonomous operation using Li-ion battery. The proposed system continuously monitors the growth dynamics of plant leaves. In [188] author presents an autonomous system built with low power sensor nodes and IoT based cloud platform to estimate level of phosphorous in soil through ANN. Author incorporates dynamic power management system to maintain balance between energy consumption and estimation accuracy. In [189] author presents GA optimized WSN for precision agriculture applications. Thus, we conclude that integrating artificial intelligence with WSN, IoT plays a key role in assuring the best yield of crops. SECTION VI. Assessment and Evaluation of Knowledge-Based Agriculture System In this section ML algorithms used by different researchers in the precision agriculture system are analyzed. The agriculture industry is facing many challenges across the world, and a knowledge-based agriculture system allows sustainable use of resources by the farmers aiming to get maximum output from the agriculture land. There are two basic stages in precision agriculture, i.e. pre-processing stage and processing stage. In the pre-processing phase market trends are studied and based on geographical conditions and soil properties of the land seeds are selected and the land is prepared for precision agriculture system. In the post-processing stage machine vision techniques are explored for disease and weed identification while intelligent techniques are used for irrigation and harvesting. In this article, author reviewed and discussed 70 articles where multiple ML algorithms are presented for performance optimization of the agricultural cycle. Figure 7 shows the classification of articles based on different applications of precision agriculture. FIGURE 7. Classification based on agriculture cycle. Show All Figure 8 depicts the cumulative distribution of the ML and DL models used by researchers in precision agriculture. The graph depicts the broad categorisation of the techniques with their applications to agricultural cycle. It has been observed that in majority of the literature the researchers have applied multiple algorithms for classification and parameter prediction. Regression models and ANN together make up around 65% of the AI techniques employed by researchers. Hence, it is important to investigate the techniques used and compared by the authors. The individual best performing algorithms have already been covered in appropriate sections, however the figure 8 depicts the distribution of the various regression algorithms and DL models throughout the literature. ELM algorithm is widely explored in prediction of soil properties such as soil moisture, soil temperature, surface humidity, ETc. ANN accurately predicts the rainfall and crop yield across different regions of globe. DL based CNN model finds wide applications for accurate disease and weed classification in agriculture crops. ANN model best predicts the nitrate content and water requirement in drip irrigation system. SVM regression model estimates the emitter outflow discharge under varying temperature and pressure conditions. Decision Tree algorithm accurately identify the chewing habits and predicts SCM in dairy herds. CNN have widely explored for livestock identification. Metaheuristic optimized ML algorithms are also explored by researchers in precision agriculture. FIGURE 8. ML techniques used in precision agriculture applications. Show All In the reviewed articles, authors have used around 22 different regression algorithms for prediction, however 5 most commonly used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 9. Remaining 17 algorithms which are used either only for comparison or employed as a support algorithms have been classified into others. FIGURE 9. Regression algorithm in precision agriculture. Show All DL models have contributed significantly and outperforms ML classification algorithms in classification of crop disease and weed as well as for livestock diseases identification. Figure 10 shows CNN, ANN and RNN algorithms explored in precision agriculture. In the reviewed articles, authors have used around 10 different DL/NN algorithms for prediction/classification, however 8 most commonly used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 10. Remaining 2 (LeNet, and Caffee) algorithms which are used either only for comparison or employed as a support algorithms have been classified into others. FIGURE 10. Classification algorithm in precision agriculture. Show All A. Performance Comparison of ML Algorithms in Precision Agriculture The application of ML and DL algorithms highly depends on the agriculture cycle and the dataset involved. This section discusses the advantages and limitations of various ML and DL algorithms such as regression and classification algorithms based on the agriculture cycle involved. 1) Soil Properties and Weather Prediction The application of AI techniques in prediction of soil parameters and weather is dependent on various factors. The researchers generally employ around 3 to 4 algorithms in for prediction and select the algorithms which has most accurate prediction and is robust to factors such as: noise, non-linearity, outliers etc. the most commonly employed algorithms are ELM, RF, SVR, and cubist algorithm. Advantages of using ML in prediction of soil properties and weather pattern: Non-linear dataset – these predictions often attributes a non-linear dataset which can be utilized for accurate prediction by regression algorithms such as: ELM, RF, SVR Large dataset – the dataset for is often obtained from satellite which can be well handled by the regression algorithms with less convergence time and accurate predictions. Insensitivity to outliers – Weather patterns often encounter outlier events which may affect the prediction accuracy, however algorithms such as ELM, NN are robust to outliers and provide accurate predictions. Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML exhibit low error indices such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of accuracy for statistical analysis. Challenges and limitations in prediction of soil properties and weather pattern: Varying geographical conditions poses a challenge for universal design of the prediction algorithms. Soil parameters prediction is highly dependent on the sample selection philosophy. Dataset selection and filtering is a challenge for researchers with non-computing background. 2) Crop Yield Prediction The application of AI techniques in prediction of crop yield is a mammoth task and lack of availability of a universal model makes designing of the algorithm challenging. The most promising algorithms for crop yield prediction are regression algorithms, and neural networks. Advantages of using ML in crop yield prediction: Complex dataset – crop yield prediction involves enormous dataset composing of satellite data and/or historic data. Faster and accurate predictions can be made by utilizing the AI techniques such as regression algorithms (SVR, RF) Neural networks (CNN). Parameter variation – the crop yield depends on a lot of parameters, like climatic factors, soil quality, NDVI, altitude, air parameters. The AI based prediction systems handle the parameters dependency efficiently. Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML exhibit low error indices such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of accuracy for statistical analysis. Challenges and limitations in prediction of crop yield: Varying parameters and complex datasets pose a challenge for universal design of the prediction algorithms. Dataset selection is critical due to the complexity; as an improper selection of data may result in underfit/overfit prediction pattern. 3) Disease and Weed Detection The applications of AI techniques in disease and weed detection primarily depends on the advances in image processing. CNN’s are the most prominent choice for building a disease identification system. Training dataset will govern the performance of the algorithm, although these are available in open-source format, users have to be cautious while using the dataset. Advantages of using ML in detection of weed and disease in a crop field: Prediction accuracy – AI offer accurate detection of disease and weeds with an accuracy of 99% which is better compared to manual/classical techniques. Robust prediction – the algorithms can predict the disease/weed even with smartphone images, which is commonly available with farmers. Easy configuration – with CNN being the most common and reliable technique, designing a disease/weed detection system is not a complex job unlike other systems discussed in text. Challenges and limitations in detection of weed and disease in a crop field: The accuracy of prediction depends on the quality of training dataset some of which is available as an open-source dataset, but is applicable to only a limited number of crops. Improperly labelled data may result in a disastrous prediction system, as the training of the system plays a major role in the performance of the system. Overtraining the model may result in a sensitive prediction system. 4) Drip Irrigation Smart irrigation systems are not only crop friendly but are environmental friendly too. The combination of IoT with the AI not only reduces the manual intervention but also utilizes the available in an optimum way to ensure no adverse effect to environment. Regression and Advantages of using ML in drip irrigation for an agricultural field: Optimum resource utilization – accurate estimation of irrigation requirements results in a system which optimizes the resource (water, electricity) utilization (NN algorithms). Crop protection – optimized irrigation practices minimizes water related damage to the crops and hence increases the crop yield. Robust to weather variations – an accurately designed AI based (Regression algorithms) irrigation system handles the random weather events in a better way when compared with the non-AI based irrigation methods. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation for an agricultural field: Accurate prediction sometimes depends on the number of sensors and hence increases the initial investment of the farmers. An incorrect sensor placement in the filed affects the accuracy of the system, hence sensor optimization becomes imperative in designing a smart irrigation system. The architecture of prediction system highly depends on the dataset; hence no universal guidelines can be laid out for system design. 5) Livestock Production and Management The livestock management primarily focuses on the well-being of the farm animals and uses advanced image recognition (CNN) algorithms, and regression techniques to detect and predict the disease/ disease spread. Advantages of using ML in livestock production and management: Decreased risk of diseases – AI systems assists in identifying the livestock diseases and also helps in combating the disease, by predicting the root of diseases and transmission (Regression algorithms). Minimization of disease spread – timely diagnosis and treatment reduces the risk of spreading the disease. Psychological analysis – advanced image recognition and behavioural analysis (CNN techniques) help is detecting the stress in animals ensuring heath of the livestock. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation for an agricultural field: With varying geographic and climatic conditions the attributes of the cattle and diseases changes hence, no universal system can be designed to cater to the diversities. Some viruses are difficult to predict even using the state-of-art prediction algorithms. 6) Intelligent Harvesting The applications of AI techniques in harvesting is primarily an assistive technology for automatic harvesting systems. Harvesting prediction system largely relies on the advances in image processing and CNN’s are the most prominent choice for building these systems. Advantages of using ML in intelligent harvesting: Assistive technology – AI in conjunction with existing harvesting robots exhibit high accuracy in harvesting. Image processing – the identification of harvesting relies on the state-of-art image processing algorithm (CNNs) and hence the developments in the image processing algorithms result in direct accuracy enhancement of intelligent harvesting techniques. Universal algorithms – the AI harvesting techniques largely depend on image recognition methods, hence CNNs can easily be deployed for implementing intelligent harvesting techniques. Challenges and limitations in intelligent harvesting: The accuracy of the prediction systems largely depends on the training dataset, hence accurately labelled dataset is a primary requirement of implementing an intelligent harvesting system. Inaccurate harvesting recognition system result in economic loss for farmers, as a delay in harvesting might lead to an overripe crop or early harvesting might lead to rejection of the product. SECTION VII. Challenges and Limitations of Artifical Intelligence in Precision Agriculture Artificial intelligence has the potential of playing an important role in meeting the food requirement of entire world. However, there are certain challenges which are hampering its adoption in agriculture industries which are outlined as follows: A recent government survey in India estimated that literacy rate of Indian farmers is very low therefore bridging the gap between farmers and technology is a challenging task. Farmers are less motivated to come out from their comfort zone and learn digital skills to improve their farming standards. Agriculture lands are mostly situated in rural areas. Implementation of IoT architecture and WSN which requires cloud services for data storage and analysis is a big issue in rural areas where reliable internet connectivity is not available. Accurate prediction and classification through cognitive ability of machines is difficult in varying geographical conditions. Initial set up of digital farming which includes hardware and software requires huge investment. Deployment of smart sensors and other electronic gadgets requires heavy energy consumption. SECTION VIII. Future Trends of Artifical Intelligence and IoT in Precision Agriculture Agriculture industry is globally US$5 trillion industry and now it has been revolutionized with artificial intelligence and IoT technologies. These innovative tools are assisting famers to improve crop yield, monitor soil parameters, livestock health and temperature conditions, control pests and improve other agriculture related tasks. Conventional ML and DL models such as SVM, RF, ANN finds difficult to accurately estimate soil parameters and weather conditions in varying ecosystem. Therefore, swarm intelligence optimized robust and adaptive ML and DL algorithms such as SVM-PSO, ANN-GWO algorithms can be explored to effectively forecast different parameters in precision agriculture. In large agriculture fields swarm intelligence inspired autonomous system can be built for crop health and growth monitoring. UAV swarm can be utilized for near real time field and livestock monitoring through computer vision and DL algorithms and accordingly swarm of UAV can be used for spraying of pesticides and fertilizers in the infected crops. Greenness of crops can be identified through UAVs installed cameras and an automated irrigation system can be built in large agriculture fields. Swarm of mobile robots can be used in the agriculture fields to efficiently automate task such as harvesting, weed identification and elimination, etc. Metaheuristic algorithms can be explored for nodes localization in agriculture fields in order to optimize the sensor deployment in the field and keep the minimize cost to farmers. Offline service chatbots can be built to assist farmers in developing countries where farmers don’t have good internet connectivity. These chatbots can assist farmers by providing timely advice based on expert recommendations and will help to resolve their specific farming problems. Artificial intelligence assisted renewable energy plants can be installed in agriculture lands to maximize the power output of clean energy in unpredictable weather conditions. This will allow for sustainable agricultural practices. Artificial intelligence can also be explored in vertical and soilless agriculture. In near future artificial intelligence systems, robotics and smart sensor technology will automate the whole farming process starting from seed sowing to intelligent fruits and vegetables harvesting and packaging. SECTION IX. Conclusion Precision agriculture is empowering the farmers with technology intending to get optimum outputs with precise inputs. IoT enabled smart sensors, actuators, satellite images, robots, drones are some of the key technological revolutions that boosted the agriculture industry. These components play a vital role in collecting real-time data and accordingly making decisions without human support. Artificial intelligence which is the automation of intelligent behaviour is continuously benefiting our planet and helping humans in various aspects of life. In this paper, authors have reviewed ML applications for precision agriculture. The impact of AI and IoT in smart farm management is discussed with a brief introduction to ML algorithms which are most commonly used in precision agriculture. Regression algorithms are the backbone for soil properties, weather, and crop yield prediction. DL algorithms such as CNN and ML classification algorithms such as SVM, Decision trees, and RF were explored for the identification of disease and weeds in the plants. Smart irrigation systems and harvesting techniques play an important component in precision agriculture as these techniques quickly complete the work and reduces human labour. Drones and robots enabled with a digital camera are employed for this work. Livestock management is an important concern for farmers across the world. Knowledge-based agriculture system which includes smart IoT devices and AI tools efficiently handle livestock management. As a scope of future work, NLP based chatbots can be built for famers and more ML, DL and hybrid algorithms can be explored in the agriculture industry for sustainable use of available resources.

Abstract: Progress in agricultural productivity and sustainability hinges on strategic investments
in technological research. Evolving technologies such as the Internet of Things, sensors, robotics,
Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Big Data, and Cloud Computing are propelling the agricul-
tural sector towards the transformative Agriculture 4.0 paradigm. The present systematic literature
review employs the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
methodology to explore the usage of Machine Learning in agriculture. The study investigates the
foremost applications of Machine Learning, including crop, water, soil, and animal management,
revealing its important role in revolutionising traditional agricultural practices. Furthermore, it
assesses the substantial impacts and outcomes of Machine Learning adoption and highlights some
challenges associated with its integration in agricultural systems. This review not only provides
valuable insights into the current landscape of Machine Learning applications in agriculture, but it
also outlines promising directions for future research and innovation in this rapidly evolving ﬁeld.
Keywords: Agriculture 4.0; machine learning; PRISMA; systematic reviews and meta analytics
1. Introduction
Agriculture 4.0 [1–5], also known as “Digital Agricultural Revolution” [6], represents
a paradigm shift in agriculture, leveraging cutting-edge technologies to optimise various
aspects of farming operations. These technologies encompass the Internet of Things (IoT),
Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, cloud computing, Decision Support System (DSS),
advanced sensing technology, and autonomous robots [1,6,7]. Sensors and robotics play a
crucial role in collecting essential ﬁeld data, which is then transmitted to a local or cloud
server via IoT technology for storage, processing, and analysis. Big data and AI-based
techniques can be used to convert these data into valuable insights. To facilitate user
interaction and informed decision making, a DSS equips users with the necessary tools to
optimise the agricultural system and undertake appropriate actions.
Machine Learning (ML), a subset of AI, has shown great potential in enhancing various
aspects of Agriculture 4.0. It can be deﬁned as a computer program or system that can
learn speciﬁc tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so [8–10]. It is a process that
involves the use of a computer to make decisions based on multiple data inputs [8]. In this
case, data mean a set of examples. Labeled data is often used for supervised learning tasks

(where the model learns from labeled examples), and unlabeled data might be used for
unsupervised learning tasks (where the model ﬁnds patterns and structures in the data) [9].
ML indeed beneﬁt from large amounts of data to achieve meaningful accuracy in
their tasks. In the context of agriculture, obtaining vast and diverse data can be sometimes
challenging yet pivotal for the success of ML models. IoT sensors are instrumental in
collecting a diverse range of agricultural data as they can be strategically deployed across
ﬁelds to capture relevant information regarding, for instance, soil conditions, climate
variables, crop health, and livestock metrics [1]. The widespread adoption of IoT technology
facilitates continuous and real-time data acquisition, enabling the generation of extensive
datasets over time. However, it is essential to consider that the data should be collected
with sufﬁcient quality to ensure its representativeness in the speciﬁc case study at hand.
For instance, in crop management, studying the different stages of the crop is important for
developing models that are accurate and applicable to real-world scenarios. Obtaining such
representative datasets may take time, but it is a necessary investment for the effectiveness
and reliability of ML applications in agriculture. Furthermore, collaborative initiatives
and partnerships with farmers, agricultural institutions, and research organisations can
contribute to the pooling of data resources.
A general ﬂow for the creation of ML models and their deployment in agriculture is
illustrated in Figure 1. The initial phase involves the retrieval of agricultural data from
diverse sources, forming the foundational input for subsequent ML processes. These data
are then divided into ‘training’ and ‘testing’ datasets. The training dataset becomes the
substrate for instructing the ML model, while the testing dataset serves as an evaluation
mechanism, assessing the model’s performance and ensuring its accuracy and reliability.
The outcome of these processes is a robust ML model capable of making classiﬁcations, pre-
dictions, or decisions tailored to speciﬁc agricultural contexts. Subsequently, the validated
model is ready for deployment across various agricultural domains, including crop (i.e.,
optimising crop yields and health), water (i.e., ensuring efﬁcient utilisation of irrigation
resources), soil (i.e., maintaining soil health and fertility), and animal management (i.e.,
monitoring and improving livestock health and productivity).
Figure 1. General flow for the creation of Machine Learning models and their application in agriculture.
Several prevalent ML algorithms have emerged within the context of Agriculture 4.0.
These encompass well-known methods such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Ma-
chine (SVM), Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN), and an array of Deep Learning (DL)
variations [1]. These algorithms play a key role in reshaping the agricultural domain,
taking innovation and efﬁciency to new heights. While there has been extensive literature
discussing the potential of ML in agriculture, the existing body of work often lacks a sys-
tematic and consolidated overview of the applications, impacts, outcomes, and challenges
of ML integration in this dynamic ﬁeld. A review made by [9] concluded that 61% of
the analysed articles used ML techniques for crop management (22% disease detection,
20% yield prediction, 8% weed detection, 8% crop quality, and 3% species recognition),
19% for livestock management (12% livestock production and 7% animal welfare), 10%
for soil management, and 10% for water management. Inspired by this study, the search
for a current and comprehensive understanding of the landscape of ML applications in
agriculture motivated the undertaking of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) in 2023.

This effort seeks to elucidate the latest advances, trends, and challenges in this dynamic
ﬁeld, with the aim of contributing valuable insights to the agricultural research community.
The present SLR, conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology [11,12], addresses this
research gap by providing a meticulous analysis of the state-of-the-art applications of ML in
agriculture. By doing so, this review not only contributes to the existing body of knowledge,
but it also offers valuable insights to researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders aiming to
leverage ML technologies for sustainable and efﬁcient agricultural practices. PRISMA is
internationally recognised for its systematic framework, which effectively mitigates bias
and increases the reliability of systematic reviews by providing a structured protocol for
the identiﬁcation, selection, and synthesis of studies. Adhering to the PRISMA guidelines
was fundamental to maintaining the highest standards of methodological rigor, leading
to an overall improvement in the validity and reliability of the results. To help guide this
review, the following research questions were formulated:
•
RQ1: What are the most used ML algorithms in agriculture?
•
RQ2: What are the impacts and outcomes of integrating ML in agriculture?
•
RQ3: What are the challenges and future directions associated with integrating ML in
agriculture and agricultural systems?
The present document is organised as follows: Section 2 (Principles and Methods)
details the PRISMA methodology, including the search strategy, inclusion, and exclusion
criteria, data extraction process, and quality assessment of selected studies. Section 3
(Results and Discussion) discusses the results of the SLR. Section 4 (Machine Learning
Trends) presents the most used ML models and algorithms of the SLR. Section 5 (Machine
Learning in Agriculture) provides an overview of the ML techniques used, as well as
speciﬁc applications, according to the domains outlined in Section 3. Section 6 (Challenges
and Research Opportunities) discusses the challenges associated with implementing ML
in agricultural systems. Finally, Section 7 (Conclusions, Limitations, and Future Work)
summarises the main ﬁndings of the present SLR and how they contribute to the current
understanding of ML in agriculture.
2. Principles and Methods
This SLR adheres to the well-established PRISMA guidelines, which describes how
to collect and analyse data from available studies. The PRISMA Statement is a systematic
framework encompassing 27 items in the form of a checklist, along with a four-phase
ﬂow diagram that serves as an invaluable tool for guiding researchers in the preparation
of reviews and meta-analyses [11]. In the present section, each phase of the systematic
review process is detailed, seamlessly aligned with the four fundamental phases outlined
in the PRISMA methodology. These include the identiﬁcation (Section 2.1), screening
(Section 2.2), eligibility (Section 2.3), and inclusion phase (Section 2.4). Lastly, an overview
of the PRISMA framework itself (Section 2.5) is provided, offering a holistic understanding
of the structured approach adopted in this study.
2.1. Identiﬁcation Phase
The identification phase represents the initial identification of records via various sources.
To facilitate this step, a search string was formulated (Table 1). Final string: (“Agricultur*” OR
“Farm*”) AND (“Machine Learning”) AND (“application” OR “implementation” OR “case
study” OR “experimental” OR “practical”).
The search encompassed records indexed in the speciﬁed repositories (Web of Science
(WoS) and Scopus) up until the 1st of July, 2023, and the search string was adjusted to the
syntax of each digital repository. The wildcard symbol (“*”) was incorporated at the end
of certain words in the search string, enabling the retrieval of all possible variants of the
respective term. The boolean “AND” was employed to connect keywords originating from
different groups within the search string, while “OR” was used to link keywords within
the same group.

In IC1, the digital repositories WoS and Scopus were selected as they are highly valued
databases, due to their scientiﬁc and technical content, but also because they are closely
related to the areas of knowledge associated with the objective of this article. The chosen
search period, in IC2, was determined based on the signiﬁcant progress and contributions
to the ﬁeld of integrating ML in the agricultural sector. Regarding IC3, the restriction to
examining article titles, abstracts, and keywords was made with careful deliberation. This
focused approach is predicated on the premise that these sections encapsulate succinct yet
crucial information regarding the content and relevance of the articles, thereby facilitating
the efﬁcient identiﬁcation of the pertinent literature. In IC4, the emphasis on scientiﬁc
journal articles stems from a strategic assessment of the academic landscape in the speciﬁc
domain of interest as they generally have a greater impact than other types of documents.
Lastly, in IC5, the selection of English as the exclusive language criterion arises from its
ubiquitous adoption as the lingua franca of global scientiﬁc discourse.
2.2. Screening Phase
In the screening phase, a systematic process is employed to evaluate the identiﬁed
records against the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table 3). The decision
to focus exclusively on Q1 journal articles reﬂects a commitment to ensure the highest
standard of research quality.

string from Table 1. Through a rigorous screening and eligibility phase (Tables 3 and 4,
respectively), a ﬁnal selection of 272 articles was identiﬁed for in-depth analysis. Figure 2
illustrates the PRISMA ﬂowchart reporting the different phases of the systematic review
and the respective results.

of content relevant to agriculture (EC1) and Machine Learning applications (EC2), and inclusion of
full-text versions (EC3).
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Statistical Analysis
The number of publications by year and country are represented in Figures 3 and 4,
respectively. According to Figure 3, the number of publications in the WoS and Scopus
databases has generally increased over the years, with a signiﬁcant jump from 2019 to 2020
and a consistent upward trend until 2022.
In Figure 3, the pre-PRISMA analysis of WoS publications showed steady growth,
from 274 in 2019 to a peak of 862 in 2022. This trend indicates a growing interest in research
efforts of ML science in agriculture during this period. Scopus publications exhibited a
parallel increase, starting at 408 in 2019 and culminating at 1127 in 2022. This upward trend
can be attributed to signiﬁcant advancements in advanced technologies that have emerged
within the agricultural sector, owing to the emergence and widespread acceptance of the
Agriculture 4.0 paradigm [1]. However, it is important to note that in 2023, there was a
decrease in the number of publications compared to the previous year. This decrease can
be attributed to the fact that the search was conducted in the beginning of July 2023 and
the data do not capture the full extent of publications for the entire year.
By examining these trends, we have uncovered a compelling narrative of how research
efforts have evolved in tandem with the technological landscape. Technological advances
Agronomy 2023, 13, 2976

and their adoption in the agricultural sector have played a key role in driving this increase
in interest and research activity. Notable advances in IoT, sensors, and robotics have
catalysed the adoption of ML in various facets of agriculture. In addition, political changes,
economic ﬂuctuations, and global events may have inﬂuenced the trajectory of research in
this ﬁeld. Lastly, the application of the PRISMA methodology has resulted in a noticeable
reduction in the overall count of publications for each year. While this might initially
appear as a decrement, it signiﬁes an intentional effort to ensure a higher and more reliable
quality of studies. This approach reinforces the credibility and validity of the selected
research, ultimately enhancing the robustness of the systematic review.
Figure 3. Distribution of the selected publications by year (before and after PRISMA).
Furthermore, Figure 4 highlights the top seven countries that have made substantial
contributions in terms of published articles. Before PRISMA, the number of publications
in the WoS database varies for each country, with China having the highest count of 619,
followed by the United States of America (USA) with 552 and India with 305. The number
of publications in the Scopus database also varies for each country, with India having the
highest count of 882, followed by China with 654 and the United States with 541. After
PRISMA, China and the United States lead the pack in terms of publication output, with 96
and 30 publications, respectively. On the other hand, countries such as India, Australia, the
United Kingdom (UK), Germany, and Italy have relatively lower publication counts. These
nuanced insights into the geographical distribution of research contributions enrich the
understanding of the global landscape of ML applications in agriculture, underlining the
need for international collaboration and knowledge exchange in this dynamic ﬁeld.
Regarding the journals, the present SLR included 272 papers from 62 different journals.
Figure 5 illustrates the top 10 journals, along with the corresponding counts of publications
from each journal. From this analysis, “Remote Sensing” had the highest count of publica-
tions with 73 publications, followed by “Computers and Electronics in Agriculture” with
46 publications and “Agricultural Water Management” with 14 publications. It is further
stated that the mean impact factor (Clarivate [13]) is 6.22, indicating the average inﬂuence
of the journals. The range of impact factors spans from a minimum of 2.4 (Journal: “Mathe-
matics”) to a maximum of 16.6 (Journal: “Nature Communications”). This range highlights
the diversity of inﬂuence of the selected journals, which signiﬁes the breadth and depth
of academic engagement in this ﬁeld. These insights not only enrich the understanding
of the academic landscape, but it also serves as a testimony to the rigor and quality of the
research efforts encompassed in this analysis.

At last, Figure 6 shows the count of publications in various categories (according
to Clarivate [13]). The category “Geosciences” has the highest count of publications,
with 82 publications. “Agriculture” is the second-highest category, with 55 publications,
followed by “Agronomy” with 23 publications. This categorical distribution of publications
provides valuable information on the various domains that intersect with ML applications
in agriculture. It highlights the multifaceted nature of research efforts in this ﬁeld and
underlines the key role of interdisciplinary collaboration in the realisation of Agriculture 4.0
and the advancement of agricultural technologies.

3.2. Application Domains in Agriculture
The distribution of application domains in agriculture, based on the SLR, is represented
in Figure 7.
Figure 7. Distribution of application domains in agriculture (after PRISMA): crop, water, soil, and
animal management.
As it is possible to see, the largest portion, accounting for 74.6%, is dedicated to
Crop management. The Water management domain represents 21.7%, followed by the Soil
management and Animal management domains, with 16.5% and 12.5%, respectively. The
total percentage of each domain represents the proportion of articles that primarily focus
on that speciﬁc domain. However, certain articles can be multidisciplinary in nature,
addressing more than one domain within the agricultural context. Furthermore, ﬁve sub-
domains were outlined, representing a distinct area of focus within the crop domain: Crop
quality (33.8%), Crop mapping/recognition (27.9%), Crop yield (20.6%), Crop disease (8.8%), and
Pest/weed detection (1.8%).
Moreover, it was possible to identify the most used crops and animals in this analysis:
•
Crop type:
–
“Plants” with 46.36% of the total count. In this group, it is possible to ﬁnd the
following: wheat (13.91%), maize (12.17%), rice (6.09%), vineyards (3.04%), grass
(3.04%), rapeseed (2.61%), sugarcane (2.17%), tea (1.74%), cotton (0.87%), peach
leaf (0.87%), alfalfa (0.87%), bok choy (0.43%), barley (0.43%), Arabidopsis (0.43%),
jujube (0.43%), parsley (0.43%), green coffee plant (0.43%), mushrooms (0.43%),

–
“Grain, seeds and nuts” with 6.04% of the total count: grains (3.01%), nuts—not
speciﬁed (2.17%), pea seeds (0.43%), and radish seeds (0.43%).
•
Animal type: cows and dairy cows (21.21%), chickens, broilers, and hens (18.18%),
sheep (15.15%), ﬁsh (9.09%), pigs (9.09%), bees (6.06%), steers (3.03%), gorillas (3.03%),
heifers (3.03%), horses (3.03%), lambs (3.03%), small ruminants (3.03%), and invasive
insects—not speciﬁed (3.03%).
The meticulous analysis of crop and animal types provides valuable insights into
prevailing trends and focus areas for ML applications in agriculture. The prominence of
“Plants” as the most studied crop category underlines the crucial role of ML in optimising
various plant-based agricultural practices. Wheat, maize, and rice emerge as the main
areas of focus, reﬂecting the importance of staple crops in agricultural research. In addition,
the inclusion of specialty crops, such as vineyards and tea, exempliﬁes the diversity of
agricultural contexts in which ML-based interventions are making substantial contributions.
In the animal context, cows dominate the category, followed by poultry and sheep. The
prevalence of interdisciplinary approaches in Agriculture 4.0 is evident in the analysis. In
addition to traditional crops and livestock, the inclusion of categories such as bees and
invasive insects demonstrates the innovative application of ML in various agricultural
contexts, from agriculture to pest management.
4. Machine Learning Trends
The present section provides crucial insights towards answering to RQ1 (What are
the most used ML algorithms in agriculture?). As it is known, various ML algorithms can be
used for statistical modeling, data analysis, classiﬁcation, regression, and dimensionality
reduction processes. In the context of this SLR, Figure 8 provides an overview of the most
used ML algorithms employed in the agricultural scope.
From the analysis of Figure 8, RF [14,15] emerges as the most widely used ML algo-
rithm, representing 19.2% of the overall distribution. Its versatility and robustness make it
a favored choice for handling complex problems. SVM [16,17] ranks second with 15.9% as
it is known for their effectiveness in both classiﬁcation and regression tasks. The Gradient
Boosted Tree (GBT) [18,19] (8.3%), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) [20,21] (7.3%)
also demonstrate signiﬁcant usage and adoption in the agricultural sector. In descend-
ing order of frequency, the ML approach categories present in the SLR, as well as their
respective algorithms, are:
1.
Ensemble Learning: this category has the largest percentage in the SLR with 35.6% of
the total distribution. Ensemble Learning [22–24] emerges as a key force for improving
the performance and generalisation of ML models, making them more robust and
reliable. This category includes RF (19.2%, frequency: 127), GBT (8.3%, frequency:
55), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) (4.5%, frequency: 30), AdaBoost (0.9%,
frequency: 6), Bagging (0.8%, frequency: 5), CatBoost (0.6%, frequency: 4), Stacking
(0.3%, frequency: 2), and “not speciﬁed” ensemble methods (0.3%, frequency: 2). Of
all the algorithms within this category, the RF presents the highest frequency. While
the Decision Tree (DT) [25] offers a simple and interpretable model, RF leverages the
power of multiple DT to provide robust predictions and classiﬁcations that are crucial
for the optimisation of various agricultural processes. These processes can include
crop yield estimation, disease detection, and land cover classiﬁcation based on remote
sensing data.
2.
Artiﬁcial Neural Networks: the second category within the scope of this SLR consti-
tutes 24.9% of the overall content and encompasses a range of inﬂuential algorithms
that fall under the domain of ANN [26,27]. The algorithms covered in this category
include CNN (7.3%, frequency: 48), ANN-not speciﬁed (6.4%, frequency: 42), Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (3.0%, frequency: 20), Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
(1.8%, frequency: 12), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) (1.7%, frequency: 11), You Only
Look Once (YOLO) (1.2%, frequency: 8), Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) (0.9%, fre-
Agronomy 2023, 13, 2976

quency: 6), DL-not speciﬁed (0.6%, frequency: 4), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (0.5%,
frequency: 3), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) (0.3%, frequency: 2), Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN) (0.2%, frequency: 1), and Encoder and Autoencoder
(0.2%, frequency: 1). These algorithms are powerful tools capable of learning complex
patterns, thereby facilitating accurate predictions and advancing the capabilities of
numerous applications. Among these algorithms, the one that stands out the most is
CNN, known to be specialised for image data analysis [28], making them valuable for
tasks like crop disease identiﬁcation, plant species recognition, and weed detection [1].
3.
Support Vector Machine: the third most prominent category, accounting for 15.9%
(frequency: 105), is the SVM. This algorithm holds signiﬁcant popularity and
widespread application for tasks encompassing both classiﬁcation and regression
procedures [29]. SVM underscores its signiﬁcance in guiding informed decisions
for bolstering agricultural productivity in the era of Agriculture 4.0 [1]. Through its
adeptness in crop mapping, yield estimation, and disease detection, SVM contributes
to the ongoing transformation of agriculture into a more precise, efﬁcient, and re-
silient practice, aligning seamlessly with the evolving demands of a dynamic global
food landscape.
4.
Dimensionality Reduction: this category represents 6.2% of the total distribution
and includes three different algorithms that can aid in dimensionality reduction [30]
and feature engineering [31] from agricultural datasets, namely Partial Least Squares
(PLS) algorithm (3.9%, frequency: 26), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (1.2%,
frequency: 8), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) algorithm (1.1%, frequency: 7).
5.
Generalised Linear Models: comprising 6.0% of the total distribution, this category
underscores the signiﬁcance of statistical models that transcend the constraints of
simple linear regression. Of this category are Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) (2.3%,
frequency: 15), Logistic Regression (1.4%, frequency: 9), Ridge Regression (1.2%,
frequency: 8), Cubist Regression (0.8%, frequency: 5), and Multivariate Adaptive
Regression Splines (MARS) (0.3%, frequency: 2).
6.
Nearest Neighbour: this category exclusively employs the k-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN) algorithm (4.5%, frequency: 30). Among the various algorithms in the ﬁeld of
ML, the KNN algorithm stands out as one of the simplest yet extensively employed
methods for classiﬁcation purposes [32,33]. Its adaptive and comprehensible design
contributes to its popularity in various classiﬁcation tasks.
7.
Bayesian Models: this category focuses on Gaussian distributions and probabilistic
models. These methods leverage the principles of Gaussian processes [34] (2.0%,
frequency: 13) and Naïve Bayes (NB) [35] (2.3%, frequency: 15). These techniques
offer solutions that adapt to the complexities of diverse datasets and applications.
8.
Decision Trees: constituting 4.1% (frequency: 27) of the overall distribution, these tree-
like structure algorithms are versatile tools that facilitate data-driven decisions [25].
9.
Multi-task Learning: represents 0.3% (frequency: 2) of the total distribution and
its objective is to enhance the outcomes of several interconnected learning tasks by
utilising valuable insights shared among them [36,37].

5. Machine Learning in Agriculture
The current section is dedicated to addressing RQ2 (What are the impacts and outcomes
of integrating ML in agriculture?), with a detailed analysis of the distribution of application
domains in agriculture (as mentioned in Section 3.2). For each domain (and sub-domain,
in the case of crop management), the authors selected ﬁve to seven articles based on their
relevance, impact, and ability to provide insights that contribute to the overall understand-
ing of the subject. This sample size is considered reasonable as it allows for the inclusion
of key ﬁndings and trends within each domain without overwhelming the review with
an exhaustive list of articles. Section 5.5 summarises the main ﬁndings from each domain,
providing a brief overview of the impact that ML technologies have had on modernising
agricultural practices.
5.1. Crop Management Domain
Crop management is associated to several agricultural practices that profoundly
inﬂuence the growth and yield of cultivated crops. These practices encompass a wide
range of activities, starting with the meticulous sowing process, extending to the vigilant
maintenance of crops throughout their growth and development phases, and concluding
with the phases of harvest [1]. The optimisation of crop management strategies is essential
to increase agricultural productivity, thereby addressing the escalating global requisites for
sustenance, textile ﬁbers, energy sources, and fundamental raw materials [38].

crop management and their impact on enhancing agricultural practices.
5.1.1. Crop Quality
Within this study, crop quality refers to the characteristics of crops that determine their
value and suitability. Improving crop quality via ML involves monitoring and managing
crop’s growth, nutrient levels, organoleptic characteristics, and others parameters.
By examining Table 5, it becomes evident that ML-based techniques have harnessed
their computational prowess to effectively manage complex datasets encompassing a wide

The synergy between cutting-edge ML algorithms and real-time data, including images and
meteorological information, has propelled substantial advancements in the agricultural
sector. This convergence has unlocked remarkable progress, allowing for more precise
evaluations of crop quality based on current conditions and attributes. Furthermore, ML
methods demonstrate their adaptability by excelling in the prediction and evaluation
of crop quality using non-destructive approaches. This innovative strategy obviates the
need for intrusive testing while simultaneously facilitating seamless real-time quality

5.1.2. Crop Mapping and Recognition
Crop mapping and recognition refers to the process of identifying and mapping
different crop types within agricultural ﬁelds. It involves using various data sources
(such as satellite imagery, aerial and/or proximal photography, and spectroscopy) to
detect and classify different crops and their spatial distribution. With ML techniques, it is
possible to create accurate and detailed crop maps and identify the unique characteristics
of each crop, which can be valuable for agricultural planning, resource management, and
yield estimation.
Drawing insights from Table 6, it becomes evident that the application of ML-based
techniques extends its computational capabilities into the domain of crop mapping and
recognition, revolutionising how agricultural landscapes are understood and managed.
The ability to process intricate data, coupled with real-time insights, enhances the precision

of land during a growing season. Ensuring high crop yields is of utmost importance for
addressing global food challenges and meeting the demands of a growing population [38].
There has been a growing application of ML methods to estimate crop yield, aiming to
facilitate farming planning, resource allocation (such as water, fertilisers, and pesticides),
enhance storage management and marketing strategies, and tackle the pressing challenges
of food security in the forthcoming years [1].

domain focuses on the utilisation of advanced technologies, such as sensors, imaging
systems, and ML algorithms, to detect and mitigate the presence of unwanted organisms
that can negatively impact crop growth and yield.
From Table 9, it is possible to understand that ML techniques can help analyse complex

As water resources become increasingly ﬁnite and their management more complex,
the fusion of cutting-edge technology with robust data analytics holds great promise in
promoting more sustainable water management practices. IoT technology, sensors and
actuators networks, data analytics, and predictive models have enabled farmers to monitor
water quality, soil moisture levels, weather forecasts, and Crop Evapotranspiration (ETc)
rates [71].

5.3. Soil Management Domain
Agricultural land is the extent of land considered suitable for agricultural production,
covering both crop cultivation and livestock rearing [1]. By embracing the principles of
Agriculture 4.0, the integration of IoT sensors for real-time parameter measurements, AI-
driven data analysis techniques, and DSS for informed decision making equips farmers
with the tools to effectively oversee their ﬁelds in a manner that is both efﬁcient and
sustainable [1,79]. ML-based techniques can process vast amounts of soil-related data
(such as soil composition, texture, and moisture measurements) and generate insights into
optimal irrigation schedules, nutrient management strategies, and soil health assessments.
In the present study, the soil management domain represents 16.5% of the entirety,
as illustrated in Figure 7, and refers to the study and management of soil properties,
composition, and conditions within agricultural systems. As is clear from Table 11, ML
techniques possess the ability to predict soil properties and behaviours, empowering
farmers to make well-informed choices pertaining to soil fertility, structure, moisture levels,
and nutrient concentrations, all aimed at enhancing crop growth and yield. Additionally,
by leveraging computer vision and the remote sensing data, ML simpliﬁes the monitoring
of both crops and soil conditions. This technological synergy allows for a comprehensive
assessment of crop health, growth stages, and potential stressors. Beyond remote sensing,
one particularly notable application of ML involves the utilisation of cell phone images, as
demonstrated in the study by [80]. This innovative approach showcases the potential of
ML to develop efﬁcient proximal soil sensors capable of swiftly and accurately predicting
crucial soil properties. By harnessing readily available technology, this advancement
exempliﬁes the adaptability and practicality of ML solutions in modern soil management

5.4. Animal Management Domain
Animal (livestock and aquatic) production is a crucial part of agriculture, not only
because it provides food and dairy products, but it also supplies other high-quality goods,
such as wool and leather. Global demand for animal products is expected to increase
further due to population growth [38], meaning that agrifood industries must optimise
production practices by ensuring the welfare and safety of animals and increasing the
capacity to prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat animal diseases. Considering this, there is a
growing awareness that animal management can no longer be performed via traditional
means and requires the adoption of new digital technologies.
The present SLR shows that the animal management domain comprises 12.5% of the
research scope (Figure 7). The contents of Table 12 encompass a selection of seven articles
dedicated to the utilisation of ML techniques in the domain of animal management. Smart
animal monitoring systems have been viewed with great interest in the academic commu-
nity, agrifood industries, and markets. Sensor-based animal wearables, computer vision
systems, and other detection devices can capture the status of animals and environment
in real time, which can be analysed afterwards with the aid of AI-based mechanisms to
control and predict animals’ health, welfare, production, etc. Livestock monitoring includes
information related to animals’ behaviour, physiology, clinical status, and performance [87],
while in aquaculture, the desired information is more focused on water quality (water
temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen content, ammonia, salt, etc.) [88,89].

providing valuable insights into animal health, behaviour, and overall wellbeing. This
data can be processed and interpreted to control and predict various aspects of animal
management, including health, welfare, and production.
6. Challenges and Research Opportunities
The present section focuses on answering RQ3 (What are the challenges and future direc-
tions associated with integrating ML in agriculture and agricultural systems?). The integration
of ML in agriculture, although promising, still presents some challenges. In a study made
by [1], various challenges were identiﬁed that need to be addressed to enable a successful
transition towards Agriculture 4.0 paradigm. These are stratiﬁed into ﬁve main levels,
namely device, data, network, application, and system. Of these levels, one that relates to
the implementation of ML in agricultural systems is the data level. Table 13 provides an
overview of some identiﬁed challenges covering a wide range of critical aspects related to
the integration of ML in agriculture, along with possible solutions and further research.

Explanation
Proposed Solutions/Research Opportunities
Data
accessibility
Encompass the efﬁcient management of data, ensur-
ing it is readily available to be used. For example, a
delay in accessing data due to storage issues could
hinder the real-time capabilities of ML applications.
Optimising data management systems and storage solu-
tions, ensuring both efﬁciency and security.
Data accuracy
Accurate data are critical for training ML models.
Inaccurate data can lead to incorrect predictions or
recommendations.
Ensuring that data are accurate, credible, and trustwor-
thy by exploring methods for data validation and quality
assurance.
Data
completeness
Incomplete data may result in biased or incomplete
ML models. For example, missing data points in
a crop monitoring dataset may hinder the model’s
ability to accurately predict crop yield.
Exploring techniques for data imputation/extrapolation
to address missing data in agricultural datasets.
In-
vestigating methods for optimising models’ perfor-
mance in the presence of incomplete information (e.g.,
Feature Engineering).
Data
consistency
Consistent data ensures that ML models are reliable
and reproducible. For example, inconsistent label-
ing of images in a crop disease detection dataset
could lead to incorrect classiﬁcation.
Exploring data validation and cleaning techniques to en-
sure consistency in agricultural datasets. Developing tech-
niques that can identify and rectify inconsistencies.
Data context
ML models need to be trained on data that are
relevant to the speciﬁc agricultural task at hand.
For example, using weather data from a different
region may not provide accurate predictions for
local farming conditions.
Investigating techniques for adapting ML models based
on the speciﬁc agricultural context. A possible approach
could be the use of Transfer Learning as it involves lever-
aging pre-trained models on similar tasks or domains and
ﬁne-tuning them using local data.
Data security
and privacy
Agricultural data are often sensitive information
that requires compliance with data protection
regulations.
Exploring mechanisms that encompass data anonymisa-
tion, access control, and compliance with evolving data
protection regulations will be crucial in building a founda-
tion of trust for ML-driven agricultural solutions.
Data timeliness
Delayed/outdated data can lead to non-optimal re-
sults, impeding the potential beneﬁts derived from
ML-driven insights. However, it should be noted
that there are scenarios in which historical data can
be of signiﬁcant use as it can offer invaluable in-
sight into long-term trends, cyclical patterns, and
the cumulative effects of farming practices.
Exploring methods for real-time data acquisition and pro-
cessing that can adapt and make decisions based on the
most up-to-date data, ensuring timely responses in ML
applications. However, depending on the case at hand, a
hybrid approach can be used, striking a balance between
integrating real-time and historical data. This involves
using real-time data for immediate decision making and
integrating historical data for long-term strategic planning.
Human–
machine
collaboration
ML-based systems should enhance, rather than re-
place, human expertise in agriculture. Designing
systems that facilitate seamless collaboration be-
tween stakeholders is an emerging area of research.
Designing collaborative decision making frameworks that
seamlessly integrate ML insights with human expertise.
Developing interfaces that empower users to interact with
and guide ML models in agricultural tasks.
Interpretability
and
explainability
ML-based systems pose a signiﬁcant challenge
in gaining the trust and acceptance of farmers,
stakeholders, and the agricultural industry.
It
is important to understand how models achieve
their outputs.
Ensuring that ML models are transparent and that their
inner workings are accessible. This means providing in-
formation on the features, variables, and algorithms that
contribute to a model’s results. Techniques such as SHAP
values [97] or LIME [98] can be useful to identify which
features are most inﬂuential in a model’s predictions.
Limited literacy
Generally, aged workers may have limited literacy
on digital technologies that could cause resistance
or difﬁculties in adopting and effectively utilising
technologies from the Agriculture 4.0.
Investing on training methods (e.g., workshops, courses),
knowledge transfer, and skill-building in the context of
ML-based technologies. Designing user-friendly interfaces
tailored to older workers.
Resource
constraints
ML-based systems often necessitate real-time pro-
cessing and decision making. Remote regions or
resource-constrained enterprises may lack the com-
putational resources required for data processing.
Developing lightweight and efﬁcient models that can op-
erate effectively in low-resource scenarios. Investigating
techniques for distributed and edge computing.

7. Conclusions, Limitations, and Future Work
7.1. Conclusions
Our study revealed notable ﬁndings when addressing RQ1 (What are the most used ML
algorithms in agriculture?). As expected, RF emerged as the most prevalent ML algorithm,
constituting 19.2% of the overall distribution. This popularity can be attributed to its
versatility and robustness, which render it highly adept at handling intricate agricultural
challenges. Following closely, SVM held the second position at 15.9%. Renowned for their
efﬁcacy in both classiﬁcation and regression tasks, SVM have garnered substantial traction
within the agricultural domain. GBT and CNN exhibited noteworthy adoption rates of
8.3% and 7.3%, respectively, further highlighting their signiﬁcance in the agricultural sector.
By answering to RQ2 (What are the impacts and outcomes of integrating ML in agriculture?),
it was possible to uncover a range of transformative effects arising from the integration
of ML applications in the agricultural domain. Namely, we observed a substantial in-
crease in the efﬁciency of agricultural production attributed to ML-based precision farming
techniques, mainly with regard to advances in resource allocation strategies, ensuring
that inputs such as water, fertilisers, and pesticides are used judiciously. Consequently,
the environmental footprint of agricultural practices has been positively inﬂuenced by
the incorporation of ML technologies. Through data-driven decision making, farmers
can implement sustainable practices that reduce resource consumption and limit environ-
mental impacts. For example, ML-powered precision irrigation systems can adaptively
regulate water use based on real-time soil moisture data, promoting water conservation
and maintaining optimal soil conditions. In addition, the integration of ML has substan-
tially strengthened the agricultural sector’s capabilities in managing diseases, pests, and
weeds. ML algorithms have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in the early detection and
classiﬁcation of plant diseases, allowing for timely intervention and mitigation measures.
This not only safeguards crop health, but it also mitigates potential yield losses. Overall,
the integration of ML in agriculture represents a paradigm shift, propelling the sector
towards a more efﬁcient, sustainable, and technological future. The beneﬁts go beyond
mere productivity gains, encompassing a holistic transformation of agricultural practices
to align with contemporary food safety and environmental management requirements.
This bodes well for the resilience and adaptability of the agricultural sector in the face of
evolving global challenges.
Given the growing potential of ML integration in agriculture, there are several open
issues and promising avenues for future research. By answering RQ3 (What are the challenges
and future directions associated with integrating ML into agriculture and agricultural systems?),
it was possible to identify and explore some of these challenges and provide mitigation
strategies. These include ensuring adaptable ML models, optimising data accessibility,
and maintaining data accuracy, completeness, and consistency. Contextualising data us-
age, addressing security and privacy concerns, and ensuring timely data are also vital.
Additionally, promoting human–machine collaboration, enhancing interpretability, and
overcoming limited digital literacy among ordinary farmers are essential areas for atten-
tion. It is imperative to design ML applications with user-friendly interfaces that require
minimal technical expertise. Incorporating intuitive visualisations and simple dashboards
can enhance accessibility for farmers with limited literacy. Additionally, outreach programs
and training initiatives tailored to the speciﬁc needs of agricultural communities can be im-
plemented. Workshops, demonstrations, and educational campaigns can empower farmers
with the knowledge and skills to effectively utilise ML-based technologies in their day-to-
day practices. Moreover, in resource-constrained environments, developing lightweight
models and exploring distributed computing methods are crucial steps toward a successful
integration of ML in agriculture. Addressing these challenges will lead to a more effective
and widespread implementation of ML technologies in the agricultural sector.
In summary, the integration of ML in agriculture produces substantial beneﬁts, ranging
from improved agricultural production and resource allocation to the better detection of
diseases and pests and reduced environmental impacts. These advances pave the way for
Agronomy 2023, 13, 2976

a more sustainable and adaptable agricultural sector, ready to meet the demands of the
future. As data-driven approaches continue to ﬂourish, the agricultural landscape is on
the brink of a more sophisticated and dynamic future, where technology and tradition
converge harmoniously for the betterment of global agriculture.
7.2. Limitations
The extent of this review has been constrained to encompass Q1 articles, inadvertently
leading to a decrease in the overall count of papers incorporated within the analysis.
Due to the exclusion criteria used while performing the retrieval of identiﬁed research
from the electronic databases, it is possible that some relevant publications might have
been left out of the study. Hence, it is advisable that forthcoming researchers consider a
broader range of literature sources (for example, ScienceDirect repository) to enrich the
review’s inclusiveness.
7.3. Future Work
Future research into the integration of ML in agriculture should focus on harnessing
different data sources (such as satellite/drone imagery, IoT-based sensor data, and weather
station information) for a better understanding of agricultural systems. In addition, the
integration of ML with robotics and automation presents an opportunity for intelligent, self-
learning systems capable of performing complex tasks for farmers or agricultural industries,
such as the development of autonomous fruit-picking machines. Future efforts should
focus on creating affordable and scalable ML solutions for regions with limited resources,
ensuring that the beneﬁts of the technology reach smallholder farmers and communities in
developing areas. These research directions will move the ﬁeld forward, leading to more
sustainable, efﬁcient, and resilient agricultural systems. Interdisciplinary collaboration
between ML experts and professionals from speciﬁc ﬁelds, such as agronomy or chemistry,
can lead to solutions tailored to agricultural challenges. Lastly, it would be interesting
to carry out in-depth studies assessing the socio-economic impacts of the widespread
adoption of ML in agriculture, including their effects on employment, economic viability,
and equity in access to technological resources.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.

3.6. IoT Network Architectures and Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) for Real-Time Irrigation
Real-time irrigation management systems heavily rely on the efficient and reliable transmission of data from sensors and weather stations to the cloud for processing and decision-making. However, agricultural environments present unique challenges to wireless communication, including adverse weather conditions, physical obstacles, and the limitations of wireless technologies. These challenges necessitate robust and adaptive solutions to ensure the consistent and timely flow of data, enabling truly autonomous irrigation scheduling.
Environmental factors, such as heavy rain, fog, and strong winds, can significantly disrupt wireless communication by attenuating or even blocking radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance (Ed-daoudi et al., 2023; Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). Dense vegetation, buildings, and uneven terrain create further complications by causing multipath propagation and shadowing effects (Yim et al., 2018; Gautam and Pagay, 2020). The study by Yim et al. (2018) on LoRa networks in a tree farm environment exemplifies these challenges, revealing reduced communication range and data reliability compared to theoretical expectations. This underscores the need for carefully selecting and optimizing communication protocols and network parameters to ensure reliable data transmission in such environments.
The study by Guzinski et al. (2014a) using a modified TSEB model further highlights the importance of high-resolution data in accurately capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of energy fluxes influenced by environmental factors. This emphasizes the need for advanced data acquisition and processing techniques that can effectively represent the complexities of agricultural settings.
The limitations of traditional wireless communication technologies, such as limited range and network congestion, pose additional challenges for large-scale agricultural operations. Long-distance data transmission can be hindered by range limitations, while network congestion arising from numerous sensors transmitting concurrently can lead to delays and data loss, hindering real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). Addressing these challenges requires the exploration of advanced networking technologies that can optimize spectrum utilization, mitigate interference, and improve reliability and efficiency.
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) offer promising solutions for optimizing wireless communication in agricultural settings. CRNs empower devices with the ability to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). Research has explored the potential of CRNs in predicting Radio Frequency (RF) power to avoid noisy channels and optimize spectrum utilization (Iliya et al., 2014; Iliya et al., 2014). These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of combining optimization algorithms with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the accuracy and generalization of RF power prediction, enabling CRNs to make informed decisions about channel selection and avoid interference.
DSA complements CRN technology by dynamically allocating unused spectrum, further enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion (Shi et al., 2023). The numerical model developed by Shi et al. (2023) showcases the potential of CRNs and DSA for optimizing wireless communication in challenging environments.
The integration of CRNs and DSA into the IoT network architecture requires careful consideration of spectrum sensing techniques, network topology, and data security. Research on cooperative spectrum sensing suggests that distributed approaches, where sensor nodes collaborate and share information, can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectrum sensing, particularly in dynamic environments (Trigka and Dritsas, 2022; Khalid & Yu, 2019). This collaborative approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the radio environment and facilitates the identification of available frequency bands for data transmission.
The choice of network topology also impacts the performance and scalability of CRN-based irrigation systems. Mesh networks, where sensor nodes are interconnected and relay data for each other, offer enhanced resilience and coverage compared to star topologies where nodes communicate directly with a central gateway (Akyildiz & Vuran, 2010). However, mesh networks can be more complex to manage and may introduce additional routing overhead. The trade-off between network resilience and complexity needs to be carefully evaluated to select the most appropriate topology for a specific agricultural setting.
Data security and privacy are paramount concerns in IoT-based irrigation systems due to the sensitive nature of agricultural data (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential for protecting data integrity and ensuring system trustworthiness. Research on secure spectrum leasing and resource allocation algorithms for CR-WSN-based irrigation systems has demonstrated the potential of these technologies for enhancing security and efficiency (Hassan, 2023; Afghah et al., 2018).
In conclusion, the development of effective and reliable real-time irrigation management systems requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the challenges of data transmission in agricultural environments. The integration of robust and adaptive communication protocols, optimized network architectures, and advanced networking technologies like CRNs and DSA, along with a focus on data security and privacy, can contribute significantly to achieving the goal of autonomous and efficient irrigation scheduling.
4. AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN THE CLOUD
4.1. Data Quality and Preprocessing
Data quality is paramount in automated irrigation systems as it directly influences the effectiveness of decision-making and water use efficiency. Issues like missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers arising from sensor malfunctions, environmental interference, or network problems (Lv et al., 2023) can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models used for irrigation scheduling and management.
Real-time data cleaning techniques are essential for addressing these challenges. Kalman filtering proves particularly effective in handling missing values and correcting erroneous readings by recursively estimating the system's state based on previous measurements and current sensor data, taking into account noise and uncertainty (Kim et al., 2020). Moving average techniques, by averaging consecutive data points, provide a more stable representation of the underlying trend, filtering out short-term fluctuations (Chhetri, 2023). For outlier detection, adaptive thresholding methods offer a dynamic approach, adjusting thresholds based on the statistical properties of the data to effectively identify anomalies and minimize false positives (Bah et al., 2021). These techniques are crucial in maintaining the integrity of real-time data streams and ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analyses.
Adaptive data preprocessing is essential for managing the diversity of data sources and formats commonly found in irrigation systems. Data normalization techniques, such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization, ensure that all features contribute equally to the analysis by transforming data values to a common scale (Pradal et al., 2016). This is crucial for preventing features with larger values from dominating the analysis and ensuring that all features are given equal consideration. Similarly, feature scaling methods, like standardization or normalization, optimize the range of feature values to improve the performance and convergence of machine learning models (Tortorici et al., 2024). By scaling features to a similar range, the influence of outliers is reduced, and the model's ability to learn from the data is enhanced.
Data fusion techniques play a critical role in integrating information from diverse sources, creating a more comprehensive and reliable dataset for irrigation management. Dempster-Shafer theory, a generalization of probability theory, allows for the expression of both uncertainty and the degree of conflict in evidence, making it suitable for fusing uncertain and conflicting data from heterogeneous sources (Sadiq and Rodriguez, 2004). This is particularly relevant in irrigation systems where data from different sensors may provide slightly different or even contradictory information due to sensor variations or environmental factors. Bayesian inference offers another powerful framework for combining information from multiple sources, updating the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available. By applying these techniques, data from soil moisture sensors, canopy temperature sensors, weather stations, and other sources can be integrated to provide a holistic understanding of crop water requirements and environmental conditions, leading to more informed and accurate irrigation decisions.
The impact of data quality extends beyond model accuracy to the robustness of machine learning models under varying conditions. Robust models should maintain consistent performance even when faced with data inconsistencies or unexpected situations. Techniques like data augmentation and domain adaptation can enhance model robustness by exposing the model to a wider range of data variations during training. Data augmentation involves generating additional training data by applying transformations or introducing noise to existing data, making the model more resilient to noise and variations in the real-world data. Domain adaptation techniques aim to adapt a model trained on one domain (e.g., a specific crop or geographic location) to perform well on another domain with different data characteristics. This is particularly relevant in irrigation management, where models may need to be applied to different crops, soil types, or climatic conditions.
The choice of data cleaning, preprocessing, and fusion techniques should be carefully considered based on the specific characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data. By selecting and implementing appropriate techniques, the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of machine learning models can be significantly improved, leading to more efficient and sustainable irrigation management practices.
4.2. Scalable and Autonomous Deployment using Containerization Strategies
The transition from data collection and transmission to efficient data processing requires a robust infrastructure capable of handling diverse workloads and data volumes. Containerization technologies, specifically Docker and Kubernetes, offer a promising solution for deploying and scaling data processing and machine learning modules within cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). Docker provides a standardized way to package applications and their dependencies into self-contained units known as containers, ensuring consistent and reproducible execution across different platforms (Rosendo et al., 2022). Kubernetes, acting as a container orchestrator, manages their deployment, scaling, and networking across a cluster of machines (Rosendo et al., 2022). This combination presents several advantages for automated irrigation management systems.
Firstly, containerization facilitates efficient resource utilization and scalability. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies, containers enable the isolation of resources and prevent conflicts between different modules (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This isolation allows for the efficient allocation of resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to each container based on its specific needs. Kubernetes further enhances scalability by allowing for the automatic scaling of containers based on real-time demand, ensuring the system can adapt to varying workloads and data volumes, preventing bottlenecks, and ensuring responsiveness to changing conditions (Karamolegkos et al., 2023).
Secondly, containerization promotes portability and reproducibility. By packaging applications and their dependencies into a single unit, containers make it easy to move and deploy them across different cloud environments without the need for environment-specific configurations (Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This portability simplifies the development and deployment process, reducing the time and effort required to set up and manage the system. Additionally, containers ensure reproducibility by providing a consistent execution environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This eliminates variability and ensures that the system will behave consistently across different deployments (Zhou et al., 2023).
Optimizing container orchestration and resource allocation is crucial to minimizing latency and maximizing throughput in real-time data processing pipelines. Techniques like auto-scaling and dynamic resource allocation play a critical role in this context (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Werner and Tai, 2023; Kumar et al., 2024). Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of container instances based on real-time demand, ensuring that sufficient resources are available to handle peak workloads while avoiding over-provisioning during periods of low demand (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2024). Dynamic resource allocation enables the fine-grained adjustment of resources allocated to each container based on its specific needs and the current workload (Werner and Tai, 2023). This ensures efficient resource allocation and provides each container with the necessary resources to perform its tasks effectively.
Performance monitoring tools, such as Kubernetes Metrics Server and Prometheus, are essential for gaining insights into the performance of containers and the overall system (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kuity & Peddoju, 2023). These tools provide valuable data on key performance indicators, such as CPU and memory usage, network traffic, and application-specific metrics. By monitoring this data, administrators can identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation strategies, and continuously improve system performance (Hethcoat et al., 2024). This data-driven approach ensures that automated irrigation management systems can operate efficiently and reliably.
By integrating containerization technologies with optimization techniques and performance monitoring, automated irrigation management systems achieve the scalability, autonomy, and efficiency required for effective real-time data processing and decision-making. This approach facilitates a seamless and responsive system that can adapt to changing conditions and contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity.

4.3. Deploying ML Models for Data Processing
Transitioning from data collection, preprocessing, and transmission, the deployment of machine learning (ML) models marks a pivotal stage in the automated irrigation management pipeline. This stage entails utilizing cloud platforms to facilitate real-time data processing and inference, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimal irrigation management and ultimately contributing to fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
Several architectures and frameworks exist for deploying ML models on cloud platforms, each offering unique advantages and catering to different requirements. TensorFlow Serving, for instance, provides a high-performance system specifically designed for serving TensorFlow models (Abadi et al., 2016). This framework enables efficient and scalable inference, making it suitable for real-time applications where low latency and high throughput are crucial. For instance, in a large-scale irrigation system with numerous sensors generating data continuously, TensorFlow Serving can efficiently handle the high volume of inference requests and provide timely predictions for irrigation scheduling. Similarly, Apache MXNet Model Server offers a flexible and efficient solution for deploying models trained with MXNet, supporting a wide range of deep learning models and inference backends (MXNet Developers, 2015). This versatility makes it suitable for complex irrigation systems that may utilize different types of ML models for various tasks, such as predicting crop water requirements, detecting plant stress, or forecasting weather conditions. ONNX Runtime, on the other hand, provides a cross-platform inference engine compatible with various ML frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet (Microsoft, 2017). This versatility enables the deployment of models in diverse environments, facilitating interoperability and reducing the need for model conversion. For example, an irrigation system that uses models trained in different frameworks can utilize ONNX Runtime to deploy them on a single platform without the need for time-consuming and error-prone model conversion processes.
Choosing the appropriate architecture or framework depends on several factors, including the specific ML framework used for model training, the desired level of performance and scalability, and the need for cross-platform compatibility. For instance, if the primary concern is low latency and high throughput for real-time inference, TensorFlow Serving might be the optimal choice for TensorFlow models. However, if flexibility and support for various deep learning models are required, Apache MXNet Model Server could be more suitable. In cases where cross-platform compatibility is essential, ONNX Runtime offers a versatile solution.
Once the ML model is deployed, optimizing its performance and resource utilization becomes crucial for ensuring the efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems. Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, offer effective methods for reducing the size and computational requirements of ML models without compromising accuracy (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Pruning involves eliminating unnecessary connections or neurons from the model, effectively streamlining its structure and reducing computational complexity. This can be particularly beneficial for deep learning models, which often have a large number of parameters and can be prone to overfitting. By removing redundant or less important connections, pruning can improve modelgeneralizability and reduce inference time. Quantization, on the other hand, involves reducing the precision of model parameters, typically from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower-precision formats such as 8-bit integers. This reduction in precision leads to smaller model sizes and faster inference speeds, making it particularly beneficial for resource-constrained environments or real-time applications. For instance, in edge computing scenarios where ML models are deployed on devices with limited computational resources, quantization can enable efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, hardware acceleration through the utilization of GPUs or TPUs can significantly enhance model performance by leveraging specialized hardware designed for parallel processing (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). GPUs, with their massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth, excel at accelerating matrix operations and convolutions, which are fundamental computations in many deep learning models. This acceleration can significantly reduce inference time and enable real-time processing of sensor data for timely irrigation decisions. TPUs, specifically designed for deep learning workloads, offer even greater performance and energy efficiency for specific model architectures. These hardware accelerators can drastically reduce inference time, enabling near real-time decision-making and enhancing the responsiveness of automated irrigation systems. For example, in a scenario where immediate response to changing weather conditions or soil moisture levels is critical, hardware acceleration can ensure that irrigation decisions are made and executed promptly.
In addition to model compression and hardware acceleration, distributed training techniques play a crucial role in optimizing the training process for large-scale ML models. Techniques such as Horovod and BytePS enable the distribution of training across multiple machines, effectively parallelizing the process and reducing training time (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). This is particularly beneficial for complex models with a large number of parameters or when dealing with large datasets. By leveraging distributed training, irrigation management systems can train more sophisticated models and improve their predictive capabilities, leading to more accurate and efficient irrigation decisions. For instance, a system that utilizes a deep learning model with millions of parameters can benefit from distributed training to reduce training time from days to hours, enabling faster model iteration and improvement.
Integrating the deployed ML models with other components of the automated irrigation management pipeline is essential for achieving a fully autonomous and cohesive system and addressing the need for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system. Standardized protocols, such as MQTT and CoAP, provide lightweight and efficient communication channels for exchanging data between these components (Poojara et al., 2023; Jimenez et al., 2020a; Gour et al., 2023). MQTT, with its publish-subscribe architecture, enables real-time data streaming and event-driven communication, making it suitable for transmitting sensor data, control signals, and inference results (Raikar & M, 2023). This enables the ML model to receive real-time updates on soil moisture, weather conditions, and plant health, allowing for dynamic adjustments to irrigation schedules based on the latest data. CoAP, designed for constrained devices and low-power networks, offers a web-transfer protocol for resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient communication between sensors, actuators, and the ML models (Raikar & M, 2023). This is particularly relevant in situations where sensors or actuators have limited processing power or battery life, as CoAP minimizes communication overhead and energy consumption. Additionally, RESTful APIs provide a standardized interface for accessing and controlling the ML models, enabling seamless integration with other software components and facilitating system management and monitoring (Wang et al., 2022). This allows for easy integration with existing farm management systems or third-party applications, creating a unified platform for comprehensive irrigation management.4.4. Online Learning in the Cloud
The complexities of real-time data processing in irrigation management necessitate the exploration of advanced techniques to continuously learn and adapt to the dynamic nature of agricultural environments. Online learning algorithms offer a promising solution, enabling the continuous update and improvement of machine learning models based on incoming real-time data. This adaptability is crucial for addressing the challenges of changing environmental conditions, such as weather patterns and crop growth stages, and optimizing irrigation decision-making to enhance water usage efficiency and crop productivity.
Several online learning algorithms have demonstrated potential for real-time data processing and model adaptation in the context of irrigation management. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) facilitates the incremental update of model parameters with each new data point, allowing for efficient adaptation to changing data distributions (Bottou, 2010). This incremental learning process ensures that the model remains responsive to the latest conditions, minimizing the risk of outdated predictions and improving the accuracy of irrigation decisions. Passive-Aggressive algorithms, on the other hand, adjust model parameters only when a misclassification occurs, providing a computationally efficient approach for handling large data streams (Crammer et al., 2006). These algorithms offer a robust approach to handling noisy data, a common challenge in real-world sensor readings, by making small adjustments only when the model's prediction deviates significantly from the actual value (Fei et al., 2019). Online Random Forests extend the concept of random forests to the online setting, enabling the incremental construction and update of decision trees as new data arrives (Saffari et al., 2009). The continuous evolution of the ensemble ensures that the model remains relevant to the changing environment, capturing intricate relationships between variables and leading to more informed irrigation decisions.
Research in various domains highlights the importance of online learning for real-time data stream analytics. Snyder et al. (2020) explored the application of online learning techniques for identifying relevant tweets in real-time, improving situational awareness for first responders. The proposed interactive learning framework allows users to continuously label the relevance of incoming tweets, enabling the real-time refinement of the underlying machine learning model. This user-guided approach aligns well with the dynamic nature of irrigation management, where models need to continuously adjust to varying environmental conditions and crop water requirements. Similarly, research in the field of cyber-physical systems (CPS) underscores the need for online learning algorithms to effectively extract insights and knowledge from continuously generated data streams (Fei et al., 2019). These capabilities are crucial for enabling feedback loops between physical processes and cyber elements, facilitating the integration and optimization of CPS in irrigation management systems.
To implement online learning in cloud-based irrigation management systems, various architectures and frameworks can be considered. Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis provide scalable and fault-tolerant platforms for processing real-time data streams, allowing for the development of online learning pipelines that continuously ingest and analyze data to update machine learning models (Zaharia et al., 2012; Carbone et al., 2015; Amazon Web Services, 2023). These frameworks leverage serverless computing paradigms, automatically scaling resources based on the volume and velocity of incoming data, ensuring efficient resource utilization and responsiveness to fluctuations in demand (Fei et al., 2019).
Effectively managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off is crucial for optimizing online learning in irrigation management. Techniques such as Multi-armed bandits (Sutton & Barto, 2018), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018) can be employed to balance the allocation of resources between exploring new irrigation strategies and exploiting the current best-performing approaches. These techniques enable the identification of optimal irrigation policies, adapting to changing environmental conditions and maximizing long-term rewards.
In conclusion, online learning techniques, coupled with scalable cloud-based architectures, offer a powerful solution for real-time data processing and continuous adaptation in irrigation management systems. By leveraging algorithms like SGD, Passive-Aggressive, and Online Random Forests, along with stream processing frameworks like Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis, irrigation management systems can effectively handle the complexities of real-time data, optimize water usage, and enhance crop productivity in the face of dynamic environmental conditions.

5. GENERATING AND APPLYING IRRIGATION INSIGHTS 
5.1. Real-Time Generation of Actionable Irrigation Insights
The transition from data collection and processing to actionable irrigation insights requires the extracting spatial features from images, allowing for the analysis of satellite or drone imagery to assess crop health, detect water stress, and provide insights into irrigation needs (Os deployment of advanced predictive models capable of generating precise and site-specific irrigation recommendations.roosh et al., 2016).
Furthermore, the integration Deep learning models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and of data from diverse sources, including IoT sensors and cloud-based platforms, plays Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have demonstrated excellent performance in capturing complex relationships a critical role in enhancing the accuracy and resolution of real-time irrigation insights. Data fusion techniques, such as Kalman filtering, offer a robust approach for combining information between input variables and predicting crop water requirements (Keller, 2023; Naphade et al., 2022). These models can effectively from multiple sensors, accounting for noise and uncertainty, and providing a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements (Cohen et al., 2005; Mö handle the temporal dependencies present in time-series data, such as soil moisture andeller et al., 2007). By integrating data from soil moisture weather data, and learn to predict future water needs based on historical patterns and current sensors, weather stations, and remote sensing platforms, ML models can generate more accurate conditions. Ensemble methods, such as Random Forests, also offer a robust approach to and site-specific irrigation recommendations, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity prediction by combining multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce the risk of overfitting.
The heterogeneity, uncertainty, and quality issues inherent in real-time data streams require careful consideration and the implementation of effective strategies to ensure the reliability of generated (Singh et al., 2016).
The integration of irrigation insights. Data preprocessing techniques, such as outlier detection and missing value imputation, IoT sensor data with cloud-based data sources is crucial for enhancing the accuracy and resolution of irrigation insights. IoT sensors, such as soil moisture probes and weather stations are essential for preparing the data for analysis and preventing erroneous data from influencing the model, provide real-time, localized data on crop and environmental conditions, while cloud's predictions (Fiksel, 2003). Additionally,-based sources, such as weather forecasts and satellite imagery, offer broader spatial and the selection of appropriate ML models and data fusion techniques should be tailored to the specific temporal perspectives (López-Morales et al., 2020). characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data to mitigate uncertainty and ensure the robustness Data fusion techniques, such as Kalman filtering, play a critical role in combining these of generated insights.
To address computational complexity and latency challenges in real-time irrigation insight generation, techniques such as edge computing, model compression, and hardware accelerators heterogeneous data sources to generate more accurate and comprehensive irrigation recommendations (Cohen et al., offer promising solutions. Edge computing enables the distribution of processing tasks closer to the data 2005; Möeller et al., 2007 source, reducing latency and enabling faster response times (Mishra, 20). By incorporating data from multiple sources, irrigation models can better account for spatial variability20; Zhang et al., 2020). Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, can significantly reduce the size and computational requirements of in soil moisture, microclimate conditions, and crop water requirements, leading to more ML models without compromising accuracy, making them suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge precise and efficient irrigation scheduling.
The seamless integration of ML-generated insights with IoT-enabled irrigation control systems requires the adoption of appropriate architectures and protocols that facilitate devices (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Hardware lightweight, real-time communication. The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT accelerators, such as GPUs and TPUs, provide specialized hardware designed for parallel processing) protocol and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are well-suited, enabling faster inference speeds and facilitating real-time data analysis (Premkumar for this purpose, offering efficient and reliable communication channels for exchanging data between sensors, & Sigappi, 2022). The combined utilization of these techniques can significantly improve the efficiency and responsiveness of real-time irrigation insight generation, contributing actuators, and ML models (Muangprathub et al., 2019; Osroosh et al., 2016). to the overall goal of achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
The implementation MQTT's publish-subscribe architecture enables real-time data streaming and event- of these strategies and techniques for real-time generation of actionable irrigation insights provides a solid foundation for developing automated and data-driven irrigation management systems that can effectively addressdriven communication, while CoAP's lightweight design and low overhead make it suitable the global food challenge by optimizing water resource utilization and maximizing agricultural productivity.
for resource-constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks. By utilizing these protocols, irrigation systems can achieve seamless integration between ML models and IoT devices, enabling the automated application of irrigation insights based on real-time data and predictions.
Industry-leading products and services for smart irrigation demonstrate the practical application of these technologies. Smart irrigation controllers, such as Rachio, leverage weather data and soil moisture sensors to automatically adjust irrigation schedules based on real-time conditions, reducing water waste and promoting water conservation (Verdouw et al., 2023). Cloud-based irrigation management platforms, such as CropX, offer advanced analytics and decision support tools, providing farmers with insights into crop water requirements, soil health, and irrigation performance (Weikmann et al., 2023). These platforms often incorporate machine learning algorithms to generate predictive models and provide farmers with data-driven recommendations for optimizing irrigation strategies.
The analysis of these products and services highlights the growing trend toward data-driven, automated irrigation management. By integrating IoT, machine learning, and cloud computing, these solutions enable farmers to make more informed and efficient irrigation decisions, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture.

Introduction One of the biggest problems that open field/soil-based agriculture has had to face since the rise of civilization is the reduction in available land. The human population is expanding at a startling rate. To feed the growing population, agricultural output must rise. In addition, drier conditions. Frequent drought conditions, unpredictable climate and weather patterns, rising temperatures, river pollution, wasted water, declining ground water level, etc. are threatening factors when using traditional farming technique in some of the cultivable areas like Thiruvallur, outer regions of Kanchipuram, Chennai etc. So, a method of growing plants without soil, known as hydroponics, is proposed. Hydroponics is a type of hydro culture in which plants are grown in nutrient-free water with minimal soil. As a rule, less water and land are needed for farming. Hydroponics also makes terrace farming a reality, which can provide a steady supply of healthy produce [1]. Hydroponics intelligence allows the system to function without human input. The result is a rise in agricultural output per unit of water and arable land. IoT, or the interconnection of things, is what allows machines to communicate with one another automatically. A prediction algorithm using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) could increase the accuracy of automated processes [2]. SECTION II. Literature Review This article discusses the research works that are being done to implement an Intelligent Internet of Things- by utilising IoT and machine learning technologies, based hydroponics system. Developing smart hydroponics system. A. Iot in Hydroponics The term “Internet of things” (IoT) refers to the concept of connecting people and things via the internet and storing data gathered in the cloud for future analysis. Farmers can now automate the hydroponic growing process thanks to the Internet of Things. Monitoring and controlling variables such as water level, pH, temperature, and light intensity are all possible with the help of the Internet of Things [3]. Shreya Tembe(2015), [4] has developed an Internet of Things-based hydroponics system. The sensors in the system are interfaced with a Wi-Fi module for monitoring, and the automated part of the system includes sprinklers for pests, a humidity adjustment unit, and a pH up/down pump according to the plant's needs. S. Keerthana [5]., has created an environment-driven control technique that can successfully reduce CO2 concentration, raise water level, and lower temperature. This technique makes use of sensors, LED lighting, a water pump, and water spray. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on historical data from an IoT-based hydroponics system to predict the appropriate control action. Supervised learning algorithms, in particular, can be used to learn patterns and relationships between input variables. (e.g., sensor data, environmental conditions) and output variables (e.g., control actions, system performance). The general approach to predicting control actions using machine learning involves the following steps: Step 1. Data collection: Gather information from sensors and other sources throughout the hydroponics system. Temperature, humidity, pH levels, nutrient levels, and other environmental variables may be included in this data. Step 2. Data pre-processing: Clean and pre-process the data to ensure that it is in a suitable format for machine learning algorithms. This may involve removing missing values, normalizing the data, and transforming variables as needed. Feature engineering: Identify and extract relevant features from the data, such as statistical summaries or time-series features that can be used to train machine learning models. Step 3. Model selection: Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm for the task at hand. For example, a decision tree algorithm may be suitable for predicting discrete control actions, while a regression algorithm may be better for predicting continuous variables such as nutrient levels. Step 4. Model training: On the pre-processed data, train the chosen machine learning model. This entails dividing the data into training and validation sets, fitting the model to the training data, and assessing its performance on the validation data. Step 5. Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy or mean squared error. If the model is not performing well, additional pre-processing or feature engineering may be necessary. Step 6. Control action prediction: Once a satisfactory model has been trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict appropriate control actions based on input sensor data. These control actions can be communicated to the hardware components of the hydroponics system to regulate environmental conditions and optimize plant growth. Overall, predicting appropriate control actions in an IoT-based hydroponics system entails collecting and pre- processing data, identifying relevant features, selecting and training machine learning models, and evaluating and using the trained models to predict control actions. B. Machine Learning in Hydroponics Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), allows computers to act autonomously after being taught how to perform a specific task. It does this by teaching the computer to perform specific actions in the beginning, a machine must learn how to think and reason like a human being in order to think like a human mind. K. P. Ferentinos [6] has developed a deep neural network model that uses parameters of farming as input and has the ability to predict the conductivity and pH of the nutrient solutions. According to the literature review, one of the shortcomings of the older system was that the automation that was developed using IoT lacked the intelligence necessary to base on the trained parameters, generate the appropriate control action for the hydroponic environment. The machine intelligence developed in hydroponics was not designed for an internet of things system. The system in this implementation is only concerned with applying machine learning algorithms. like Bayesian and ANN, in order to predict the appropriate control action based on the trained parameters [7]. The main objective of the work was not to regulate the hydroponic environment. As a result, the focus of this work is on creating an intelligent hydroponics system that is based on the Internet of Things and in which the control actions are based on real-time parameters that are gathered from the hydroponics system's sensors. A Raspberry Pi is used to process data in order to work on a controller and a prediction algorithm for this control action. Fig. 1. Circuit for collecting data from traditional forming Show All Fig. 2. Block diagram for implementing iot based hydroponics Show All C. Proposed Method The values of the parameters, Fig. 1. such as moisture, pH, temperature, light intensity, and water flow, are uploaded to the cloud using Node MCU. The parameters that are collected include: moisture, pH, temperature, light intensity, and water flow. The human mind generates decisions for the future based on the past experiences and information that it has been exposed to, and these decisions are influenced by the past. In the field of hydroponics, the algorithm for machine learning can be utilised in a variety of settings. ESP-01, DHT-11, and Controller Mega 2560 are components of the smart fodder hydroponics system.

Show the connections between other parts and the controller mega 2560 pins. The Ardunio Mega 2560 and the Firebase real-time database are connected by ESP-01. SECTION III. Recurrent Neural Network The only direction of mapping in a multi layered perceptron (MLP) is from input to output vectors. As a result of its unique structure, RNN is able to map each input to an output based on the entire history of inputs. Sequence predictions are built into RNNS's. RNNs can process a sequence of inputs thanks to their internal cell state memory. Humidity, temperature, and water level can all be predicted with an RNN model. The accuracy of the Hydroponics system can be improved through the use of IoT to regulate the system using the algorithm's output [8]. To determine whether or not an event is normal or abnormal, the RNN takes as input the data collected by the sensors. RNNs are built from layers upon layers of nodes that resemble neurons. A real-valued weight can be assigned to each connection. RNN generates a value error with every sequence it processes. In order to learn, RNNs employ a method called Back-Propagation over time, which is enabled by the activation function. An algorithm called back propagation uses the model's output to determine the optimal weight for each neuron, thereby producing the most precise prediction possible. Hidden state is an internal cell state within each node in an RNN. Each time step in the RNN is made up of a unit with a fixed activation function. It is the job of the activation function to determine whether or not each neuron in the network should be activated in order to make predictions based on the information it has been given. Each neuron's output is rounded to the nearest 1 or −1 by activation functions. In RNN models, activation functions tend to be non-linear. Due to their derivative function, which is related to the inputs, non-linear activation functions allow for back propagation.[9]. The Sigmoid and Tanh are employed here Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Architecture of rnn with 2 hidden layesa Show All Sigmoid Function The logistics function is expressed as the following equation, where S stands for the sigmoid function, and its domain is from 0 to 1. S=1/(1+ e −X ) (1) View Source Tanh Function The range of the logistics function is from −1 to 1, and it can be expressed in the equation that has been provided. In RNN, activations reach the hidden layer from both the current input and hidden layers below, where T denotes the tanh function. These activations are sent up from the hidden layers. T=2/(1+ e −2x )−1 (2) View Source A. Working of RNN Activation of a layer going back one step in time. This secret state stores the historical information regarding the network at the specified time step. Utilizing the recurrence relation 3 allows for the hidden state to be brought up to date at each time step. h t =fw/( x t + h t−1 ) (3) View Source where the input state is represented by xt, the previous state by ht-1, and the current state by ht. This created hidden state is then used to create another hidden state, and so on. In this case, the network will receive four inputs. At each time step, the same weight and function are used. The formula for applying the Activation function (tanh)at time t is given in Equation 4. h t =tanh( W hh h t−1 )+ w xh x t ) (4) View Source Wxh stands for the weight at the input neuron and wh represents the weight at the recurrent neuron. The unit activations that result are propagated through the hidden to output layer. After calculating the final current state after all time steps, the output state is calculated using in Equation 5. y t = w hy h t (5) View Source Why is the weight at the output layer, where yt is the output? Let yt be the predicted output of the network at any time step and yt 1 be the actual output. The difference between model values and actual values E t = − y ′ t log( y t ) (6) View Source This error value is used in the gradient descent weight updation algorithm. B. Disadvantage of RNN Although the basic RNN is effective, it has a significant flaw. Back-Propagation can cause the following problems in deep networks: Vanishing Gradients: This type of issue occurs when the weight change (gradients) becomes very small. Exploding Gradients: This problem occurs when gradients become excessively large as a result of back propagation. LSTM networks are an RNN network extension that basically expands their memory. C. Long Short Term Memory The layers of an RNN are built using the units of an LSTM, which is known as an RNN-LSTM network. By introducing various activation function layers known as gates, the LSTM recurrent unit retains all prior knowledge while eliminating irrelevant data value in Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Architecture of RNN-LSTM Show All The current input is denoted by Xt, the previous output is denoted by Ht-1, the current output is denoted by Ht, and the current cell state memory is denoted by Ctis. D. Working of RNN-LSTM D. Working of RNN-LSTM Additionally, each LSTM recurrent unit maintains a vector known as the Internal Cell State, which lists the data that the preceding LSTM recurrent unit decided to keep. The previous current state, previous internal state, and current input are fed into the LSTM. The values of four different gates are calculated using the following function, where (sigmoid) and tanh are activation functions. Forget gate(ft): no longer useful information is removed. f t =σ( W xf X t )+ W hf h −t−1 + W ci c t−1 + b f ) (7) View Source input gate(it): This gate contains additional information that is useful to the cell state. i t =σ( W xi X t + W hi h t−1 + W ci c t +  b i ) (8) View Source Output gate (ot): Useful information is extracted from the current cell state and provided as an output. o t =σ( w xo X t + W ho h t−1 + W co c t−1 + b o ) (9) View Source As shown in equation 11, the current internal cell state (Ct) is calculated by element-wise multiplying the forget gate by the previous internal cell state, adding that result, and finally subtracting the vector of the input gate. C t = f t c t−1 +itanh( w xct X t + W hc ht−1+ b c ) (10) View Source Equation 12 demonstrates how to calculate the current hidden state (ht) by multiplying the output gate by the hyperbolic tangent of the current internal cell state vector. h t = o t tanh(ct) (11) View Source The RNN-LSTM network also produces an output error value called Et at each time step. This output is what is used to train the network utilising gradient descent. In the event that the gradient begins to converge on zero, the weights of the gates can be modified accordingly in order to bring it closer to the value 1. E. Advantage of LSTM-RNN Over RNN LSTM are a specialised subtype of RNN that are able to learn long-term dependencies and make accurate predictions based on time series data. Problems with exploding and vanishing gradients, which can arise during the training of traditional RNNs, are addressed by this method. Therefore, LSTM RNN is superior to RNN when it comes to making predictions in hydroponics systems. SECTION IV. Implementation and Analysis To implement and analyse an RNN-LSTM, you can follow these steps: Data Preparation: Prepare the data that is required to use for training and testing the RNN-LSTM. This can involve tasks such as cleaning the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and encoding it in a suitable format for the RNN-LSTM. Model Architecture: Define the RNN-LSTM architecture. The number of layers, the number of units in each layer, the activation function, and the loss function must all be specified. Table I. Data collected from traditional forming Training: Train the RNN-LSTM using the training data. This involves specifying the number of epochs, the batch size, and the optimizer. Monitor the training process by keeping track of the loss and accuracy metrics. Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the RNN-LSTM using the testing data. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Analysis: Analyse the results of the evaluation and identify areas where the RNN-LSTM performed well and where it can be improved. Use this analysis to fine-tune the model and repeat the training and evaluation steps as needed[10]. Deployment: Once you are satisfied with the performance of the RNN-LSTM, deploy it in a production environment. Some popular tools and frameworks for implementing and analyzing RNN-LSTMs include TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. These tools provide a range of pre-built models, as well as APIs for customizing the model architecture, training, and evaluation. The conventional method of farming makes use of an Electronic circuit that can measure both the temperature and the relative humidity of the air. During the process of automating using IoT, these values were logged for use in setting thresholds. The Node MCU ESP8266 is used to collect the values that the sensor provides. This determines the minimum acceptable value of temperature and humidity for the implemented region so that plants can grow to their full potential in that environment[11]. IoT makes it possible to control the motor that is pumping the water to the pipeline so that flow occurs only when the motor is turned ON. This can be done by measuring the flow of water. This controlling process could be carried out based on the temperature and humidity value respectively. The sprinkler might turn on if the temperature is high enough to exceed the predetermined threshold of 28 degrees Celsius. This is done so that the high temperature is maintained[12]. In a similar fashion, if the humidity of the soil is below the threshold, the water flow through the drip link may be turned ON in order to raise the moisture level of the soil and maintain it at a level sufficient to meet the needs of the plant in order for it to grow successfully. Fig. 5. Hydroponic setup Show All 4.2 Implementation if Hydroponics Forming The work use a variety of materials like pipe, end dummy, coconut fibre, etc. After the calculated distance between holes has been drilled (0.75 feet per hole), the coconut coir and dust mixture is tightly packed in the polyethylene cover. The packet is inserted into the hole depicted in Fig. 5 above. Seeds of cereals and pulses were sown into the packets, the setup was moved to get proper sunlight after 10 days, and the water level and other parameters were continuously monitored by respective sensors, and the data were uploaded to the cloud. Hydroponics technique called Nutrient film technique is implemented. The system is made fully automatic by controlling the sprinklers and the flow of water through the pipeline in accordance with the instantaneous information gathered from the sensors (Temperature and Humidity) Fig 6. Fig. 6. Data collected from traditional forming Show All A. Prediction Algorithm The RNN-LSTM network is fed the collected hydroponics data. This algorithm has been created in Jupyter notebook. RNNs are a type of neural network that is designed to work with sequential data, such as time series data or natural language text[13]. The main idea behind RNNs is to use the previous step's output as an input to the current step. This enables the network to keep an internal state that stores information from previous steps. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of RNN designed specifically for dealing with long-term dependencies. LSTMs address the vanishing gradient problem, which occurs when the gradients used to update the network weights become very small, making long-term dependencies difficult for the network to learn. The use of memory cells and gates to control the flow of information through the network is a key feature of LSTMs. The memory cell is a unit that stores data over time, and the gates control how much data is stored or discarded at each step. B. Sigmoid Function Needed The sigmoid function is a mathematical function that is used frequently in machine learning and artificial neural networks [14]. It is a non-linear function that transforms an input value into a value between 0 and 1. The sigmoid function has the following formula: f(x)=1/(1+ e ∧ (−x)) (12) View Source where x is the input value. In artificial neural networks, the sigmoid function is frequently used as an activation function. The activation function determines a neuron's output given its inputs. The sigmoid function is especially useful because it converts any input value to a number between 0 and 1, which can then be interpreted as a probability or confidence score. In logistic regression, the sigmoid function is used to model the probability that a binary output variable (e.g., whether an email is spam or not) takes a particular value given some input variables (e.g., the words in the email). One of the limitations of the sigmoid function is that its output saturates at 0 or 1 for very large or very small input values, respectively. This can make it difficult for the network to learn when the input values are very large or small. Additionally, the sigmoid function is not zero-cantered, which can make it difficult to learn in deeper networks. Overall, the sigmoid function is a useful tool in machine learning and neural networks, but it is important to understand its limitations and when it is appropriate to use it[15]. C. The RNN-LSTM Works on Detecting Faults in Hydroponics RNN-LSTM, or Recurrent Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory, is a type of neural network that is well-suited for sequence data processing, making it an effective tool for detecting faults in hydroponics systems. In the case of lettuce plantation being grown using nutrient film technology, RNN-LSTM can be used to detect and diagnose faults in the system based on sensor data collected over time. In general, RNNLS TM works by processing sequential data, such as time series data, where each data point is dependent on the previous data points in the sequence. The RNN-LSTM consists of multiple layers of nodes or neurons, and each node in the network receives inputs from the previous layer of nodes and passes its output to the next layer of nodes. In the case of detecting faults in hydroponics systems, the RNN-LSTM can be trained using sensor data collected from the system. The sensor data can include parameters such as pH, nutrient concentration, temperature, and water flow rate. By feeding this data into the RNN-LSTM, the network can learn to detect patterns and anomalies in the data that may indicate faults in the hydroponic system. For example, if the sensor data indicates a sudden drop in pH levels or a change in nutrient concentration, the RNN-LSTM can analyze this data and determine if it represents a fault or anomaly in the system. The network can then provide an alert or notification to the grower or system operator, allowing them to take action to address the issue before it becomes a more serious problem. Overall, the RNN-LSTM is an effective tool for detecting faults in hydroponic systems, such as the lettuce plantation being grown using nutrient film technology. By analyzing sensor data over time, the network can learn to detect patterns and anomalies in the data, providing early warning of potential faults or issues in the system. The RNN-LSTM algorithm's error value output could be used to operate the sprinkler in a hydroponics setup. Until this error value is reset to zero, the sprinkler will remain in the ON position. Figure 9 depicts the MATLAB output. Thus, the prediction algorithm's error values can be used to calibrate the hydroponics farming environment to optimal conditions for the plant species in question. The outcomes obtained through the utilisation of hydroponics have unforeseen benefits. The investigation into the utilisation of deep neural networks for the purpose of analysing hydroponic parameters in order to control actions proved to be crucial. The dataset included 5000 real-time entries, each of which contained a value for a metric such as pH, temperature, humidity, light intensity, or water level. Over a period of 10000 epochs, the input was trained. Generated the appropriate control action with a label ranging from 0 to 7. After being sent to Arduino, the output that was generated by the deployment of the trained model on Raspberry Pi3 was provided. The information and the forecast were saved in a database called Firebase, which is hosted in the cloud [16]. As an AI language model, there is no access to the specific database details of any particular research study. However, in general, a well-designed database for a hydroponics system should include the following: Tables Tables should be created to store data related to each aspect of the hydroponics system. For example, there may be a table for sensor readings, a table for system settings, and a table for user data. Columns Each table should have relevant columns that store specific types of data. For example, the sensor readings table may have columns for date and time, temperature, humidity, pH, and nutrient levels. Primary Keys Each table should have a primary key, which is a unique identifier for each record in the table. Foreign Keys Foreign keys can be used to establish relationships between tables. For example, the sensor readings table may have a foreign key that links it to the system settings table, allowing users to view sensor readings for a specific system configuration. Indexes Indexes can be used to improve the performance of database queries by allowing for faster data retrieval. Backups Regular backups should be performed to ensure that data is not lost in the event of a system failure or other issue. Overall, the design of the database should be based on the specific needs of the hydroponics system and the types of data that need to be stored and retrieved. The database should be carefully designed and optimized to ensure reliable and efficient operation of the hydroponics system [17], [18]. D. Web Technology is Applied in the Proposed Design In the proposed design mentioned in the abstract, web technology is applied to provide a user interface for monitoring and controlling the hydroponics system remotely. This allows users to access and control the system from any device with a web browser and an internet connection, such as a smartphone, tablet, or computer. The use of web technology in the design allows for easy and convenient access to the system, without the need for specialized software or hardware. This means that users can monitor and control the system from anywhere, at any time, as long as they have internet access. The web technology used in the design may include a web server, a database, and a user interface or dashboard that displays data and allows for system control. The web server handles requests and responses from the user interface, while the database stores and retrieves data related to the hydroponics system, such as sensor readings, system settings, and user preferences [19], [20]. The user interface or dashboard allows users to view real-time data from the hydroponics system, such as temperature, humidity, and nutrient levels. Users can also adjust system settings, such as nutrient concentration or water flow rate, directly from the dashboard. Additionally, the dashboard may include alerts or notifications for system events, such as low nutrient levels or system faults. Overall, the use of web technology in the proposed design allows for convenient remote monitoring and control of the hydroponics system, providing users with easy access to real-time data and system control. E. The Results Provided Discussions and the supporting illustrations on the research findings observed. As an AI language model, I don't have access to the specific results and findings of any particular research study. However, some general guidance is provided on how a research study should report and discuss its findings. In general, the results section of a research study should provide a clear and concise presentation of the data and findings. This can include tables, figures, and statistical analysis to support the results. The discussion section should then provide a more detailed interpretation and explanation of the results, including any limitations of the study and implications for future research. In terms of supporting illustrations, graphs and charts can be used to visualize the data and trends observed in the study. For example, a line graph could be used to show the change in pH levels over time in a hydroponics system, while a bar chart could be used to compare nutrient concentrations between different treatment groups. In the discussion section, the researchers should provide a thorough analysis and interpretation of the results, including any unexpected findings or limitations of the study. The discussion should also link the results back to the research question or hypothesis, and consider the broader implications of the findings for the field of hydroponics. Overall, a well-written results section and discussion section should provide a clear and thorough presentation of the data and findings, and allow the reader to fully understand the implications and significance of the study. SECTION V. Conclusion The hydroponics system can be controlled remotely through the cloud, with the control being determined by the readings from the sensors. The RNN-LSTM deep learning algorithm served as the foundation for the prediction models that were utilised in this investigation. The system, which includes the sprinkler motor and the light, is controlled manually through the cloud based on the results obtained from these prediction models. The trained RNN-LSTM could be utilised to control nutrient solutions in closed-loop soilless cultures, with the control being based on the prediction of future values of temperature, humidity, and light. This work contributes to an increase in productivity and helps to raise awareness among farmers about ways in which they can improve their farming in areas with fewer cultivable acres and fewer water resources. There is no requirement for the farmers to perform continuous monitoring of the cultivation process. This work can also be carried out on a terrace and turned into an activity for the household, in order to enable as many people as possible to participate in farming and benefit from it. The use of hydroponics has simplified the process of farming significantly. In conventional farming, more labour may be required, whereas in hydroponic farming, the only thing that is necessary is a vertical farming setup rather than labour. The error values generated by the deep neural network will be utilised in the upcoming work to automate the entire hydroponics farming process.

Introduction Advances in network engineering and communication systems have enabled the use of wireless communication networks in the control of physical systems. These networks transmit the sensor measurements from the sensors to the controller and the control actions from the controller to the actuators. Although flexible and easy to maintain, adoption of wireless communication systems introduces new avenues for faults into the system. For instance, the communication link between a given sensor and the controller might break down or an adversary might perform sophisticated attacks on a subset of the communication channels to jeopardise the performance of the closed-loop system. Furthermore, advances in control engineering has enabled us to design and deploy larger cyber-physical systems consisting of many individual elements working in synchrony. It is evident that, at any moment, a fault might exhibit itself in one of the elements. Therefore, a systematic approach is required for monitoring the communication channels, the sensors, and the actuators to identify faulty or mischievous elements. A common method for fault detection is to generate residuals using state estimators, unknown input observers, or system identification methods under various faults scenarios. Following that, the most likely faults can be identified using a maximum likelihood test. For instance, if it is desired to find a faulty sensor, a bank of Kalman filters can be designed where each Kalman filter uses all but one of the sensors. Here, it is assumed that there is enough redundancy in the output measurements so that the system remains observable in the absence of one sensor reading. Evidently, the residuals of the Kalman filters containing faulty sensors behaves differently than of the rest. This way, the faulty sensors can be detected. A brute-force approach consists of checking all the sensors separately. However, group testing methods have been also developed to identify faulty sensors [1]. The group testing approach shows that the number of Kalman filters that need to be developed is in fact far lower than the number of the sensors. Therefore, computational resources can be saved. Group testing was developed as a method for testing individual with rare diseases in a combined manner (by mixing their blood samples) to identify the infected individuals using fewer tests (in comparison to testing them individually) [2]. Since then, group testing has found its way to many applications, such as communication engineering [3], data forensic [4], DNA analysis [5], and fault detection [6]. with the exception of [1], group testing has not been used in fault detection in dynamical systems. Furthermore, in [1], the construction of the set of tests (for group testing) and the eventual maximum likelihood test for decoding the test results are combinatorial and are thus computationally intensive. In this paper, it is proved that randomly generated tests can obtain the same result with a high probability. In fact, the probability of failure can be reduced by increasing the number of tests. It is proved that the number of the required tests (for successfully detecting the faulty sensors with a high probability) scales logarithmically with the number of the sensors and quadratically with the maximum number of faulty sensors. With the aid of the results of [7], in this paper, it is also proved that the problem of decoding the faulty sensors based on the random tests can be cast as a linear programming problem and therefore can be solved reliably and efficiently even for large scale systems. This problem is in close relationship to compressive sensing [8], [9], where few measurements are used to reconstruct a large, yet sparse (in some domain), vector of unknowns. Compressive sensing has been more recently applied to group testing [10], [11]. However, these results have not been utilized within the context of fault detection and cyber-security, which is the topic of this paper. Compressive sensing has been also utilized within control community [12]–[14]. However, the focus of those results has been on the observability and the state estimation of sparsely-representable dynamical systems. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II explains the problem formulation. The results are presented in Section III. Finally, numerical results are presented in Section IV and the paper is concluded in Section V. SECTION II. Problem Formulation Consider the discrete-time linear time-invariant1 dynamical system x[k+1] y[k] =Fx[k]+Gu[u]+w[k], =Hx[k]+v[k]+f[k], View Source where x[k]∈ R n is the state of the system, u[k]∈ R m is the control input, w[k] is the process noise (modelling the effects of stochastic exogenous inputs and model uncertainties), y[k]∈ R p is the output measurement, v[k]∈ R p is the measurement noise (modelling the effect of sensing uncertainties and imperfections), and f[k]∈ R p models the sensing faults or malicious behaviours. It is assumed that w[k] and v[k] are independent i.i.d.2 zero mean Gaussian variables with covariance Q and R , respectively. A Kalman filter with a subset of measurements denoted by y K [k];=( y i [k] ) i∈K with K⊆{1,…,p} can be used to estimate the states of the system. The prediction step for the Kalman filter for this combination of outputs is given by x ^ K [k|k−1]=F x ^ K [k−1|k−1]+Gu[k−1], P K [k|k−1]=F P K [k−1|k−1] F ⊤ +Q, View Source where the estimates x ^ K [k|k−1] and x ^ K [k−1|k−1] , respectively, denote E{x[k]| y K [0],…, y K [k−1]} and E{x[k−1]| y K [0],…, y K [k−1]} , and P K [k−1|k−1] and P K [k|k−1] , respectively, denote the variance of E{x[k−1]| y K [0],…, y K [k−1]} and E{x[k]| y K [0],…, y K [k−1]} . The update step of the Kalman filter is also given by x ^ K [k|k] L K [k] P K [k|k] = x ^ K [k|k−1]+ L K [k]( y K [k]− H K x ^ K [k|k−1]), = P K [k|k−1] H ⊤ K ( H K P K [k|k−1] H ⊤ K + R K ) −1 , =(I− L K [k] H K ) P K [k|k−1], View Source where H K is a matrix containing subset of the rows of H corresponding to the sensor measurements in the set K and R K is the co-variance of v K [k] , i.e., the part of the measurement noise v[k] contained in the contributing to the selected outputs y K . Now, if the pair ( F, H K ) is observable and f K [0]=0 (i.e., the outputs in K are fault free), the residual of this Kalman filter y K [k]− H K x ^ K [k|k] is an i.i.d. Gaussian random variable with zero mean and covariance H K P K [k|k] H ⊤ K +R [15]. Therefore, the χ 2 -test or the Neyman-Pearson test can be utilized to figure out if the output measurements in K contain any faulty sensors to not. Define z i ∈{0,1} to be a boolean variable such that z i =0 if sensor i is not faulty (i.e., f i [k]=0 for all k ) and z i =1 otherwise. The Kalman filter approach above can be used to compute ξ K =( ⋁ j∈K z j )∨ ζ K , (1) View Source where ζ K is a Bernoulli random variable with mean q (i.e., the probability of the event ζ K =1 is equal to q ) capturing the false detection. Note that, without loss of generality, the tests can be fine tuned so that they have the same probability of false detections. Problem 1 Find a family of tests K t , t=1,…,T , such that the set of faulty sensors can be reconstructed from the noisy boolean measurements of the form (1) with a high probability. Now that problem formulation has been formalized, we can present the results of the paper. This is the subject of the next section. SECTION III. Main Results For a set of tests K t , t=1,…,T , define A∈{0,1 } T×p such that a ij , i.e., the entry in i -th row and j -th column of A , is equal to one if and only if j∈ K i . Hence, the boolean expression in (1) for a given test set K i can be rewritten as ξ K i =( ⋁ j=1 p ( a ij ∧ z j ))∨ ζ K i . View Source Note that there is an equivalent between each row of the matrix A and each test K i . Therefore, these entities can be used interchangeably. Following [7], recovering the exact vector of faults z:=( z i ) p i=1 can be achieved through solving the following non-linear integer program: ( z ^ , ζ ^ )∈ argmin z ¯ ¯ ¯ , ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ s.t.   ∥ z ¯ ¯ ¯ ∥ 0 +α∥ ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ ∥ 0 , z ¯ ¯ ¯ ∈{0,1 } p , ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ ∈{0,1 } T , ξ K i =( ⋁ j=1 p ( a ij ∧ z ¯ ¯ ¯ j ))∨ ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ i , ∀i∈{1,…,T}, ∥ z ¯ ¯ ¯ ∥ 0 ≤d, (2a) (2b) (2c) (2d) (2e) View Source where d∈N denotes the maximum number of faults that can be present and α>0 is a constant balancing between the number of faults ∥ z ¯ ¯ ¯ ∥ 0 and the number of the miss identifications ∥ ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ ∥ 0 . For the noiseless case, that is if ζ i =0 , it can be shown that the optimization problem (2) can be transformed into: z ^ ∈ argmin z ¯ ¯ ¯ s.t.   ∥ z ¯ ¯ ¯ ∥ 0 , z ¯ ¯ ¯ ∈{0,1 } p ξ K i = ⋁ j=1 p ( a ij ∧ z ¯ ¯ ¯ j ),∀i∈{1,…,T}, ∥ z ¯ ¯ ¯ ∥ 0 ≤d, (3a) (3b) (3c) (3d) View Source The optimization problem (3) can be utilized in this case to find the true vector of faults z:=( z i ) p i=1 if T = (elog2) d 2 log(p) [7], [16]. In this case, in fact a combinatorial method must be utilized to carefully construct a matrix A (or the tests K t , t=1,…,T equivalently) to ensure that the faults are always identifiable. Furthermore, a necessary condition on the number of the required tests for identification of the faults is T≥ d 2 log(p)/log(e(d+1)/2) [7], [16]. Although powerful at reducing the number of required tests (in comparison to a brute-force approach), this method however is impractical for large-scale system due to two reasons. First, the computational complexity of designing the tests is high. Secondly, the optimization problem (3) is difficult to solve because of (i) the integer constraints in (3b), (ii) the non-linear nature of the equality constraint in (3c) and the inequality constraint in (3d), and (iii) the non-differentiable non-convex nature of the cost function. Therefore, this method can only be utilized for small systems with few faults (which is not in line with the motivation behind the use of group testing). To alleviate some of these issues, the optimization problem in (3) can be relaxed (or convexified) to get z ^ ∈ argmin z ¯ ¯ ¯ s.t.   ∥ z ¯ ¯ ¯ ∥ 1 , z ¯ ¯ ¯ ∈[0,1 ] p , A i z ¯ ¯ ¯ =0,∀i∈{1,…,T}: ξ K i =0 A i z ¯ ¯ ¯ ≥1,∀i∈{1,…,T}: ξ K i =1 ∥ z ¯ ¯ ¯ ∥ 1 ≤d. (4a) (4b) (4c) (4d) (4e) View Source Before moving any further, a few definitions must be presented. For any two boolean vectors a,b∈{0,1 } n , the union of a and b is given by a boolean vector c∈{0,1 } n in which c j = a j ∨ b j for all 1≤j≤n . Further, a is said to be contained by b if {i| a i =1}⊆{i| b i =1} . Definition 1: k -DisjunctA boolean matrix A is called k -disjunct if the union of any k columns of A does not contain any other column from A . This condition for boolean vectors is similar at heart to the linear independence. A boolean matrix is k -disjunct if no group of any k columns from it can reconstruct any other of its columns. Proposition 1 The solution of (4) is a solution of (3) if A is d -disjunct. Proof The proof is a direct application of [7]. ■ Proposition 1 shows that the the relaxation in (4) takes away the complexity of solving (3) while not introducing any conservatism in terms of identifying faulty sensors if the measurement matrix (or the corresponding family of tests) is d -disjunct. However, the procedure for forming matrix A to be d -disjunct still remains complex. In what follows a random procedure for constructing the family of the tests so that the measurement matrix meets the condition of Proposition 1 is considered. Let a randomly generated matrix A be generated such that a ij is a Bernoulli random variable with mean γ (i.e., the probability of the event a ij =1 is equal to γ ). For these random matrices, the following result can be proved. Proposition 2 P { A is d -disjunct} ≥1−1/ p δ for all T≥ (16+8δ) d 2 ln(p) . Proof Let A j denote the j -th column of A . We claim that if min j |{i| A j i =1}|≥α and max j 1 ≠ j 2 |{i| A j 1 i =1}∩{i| A j 2 i =1}|≤β , then A is ⌊(α−1)/β⌋ -disjunct. To prove this claim, let us select an arbitrary set of ⌊(α−1)/β⌋ columns A j from matrix A . Now, any other column of matrix A , denoted by A ℓ , can share at most β non-zero elements with any column from our selection. Noting that there are ⌊(α−1)/β⌋ columns in the selection, A ℓ can at most share β⌊(α−1)/β⌋≤α−1 non-zero elements with the selection. Noting that A ℓ has at least α non-zero entries, there exists at least one non-zero element in A ℓ that cannot be matched by any of the columns from the selection. Therefore, A ℓ cannot be contained by the selection of the columns. Hence, the matrix A is ⌊(α−1)/β⌋ -disjunct. In the remainder of this proof, we show that these conditions are met with a high probability for the random matrix A . By Chernoff bound [17, Ch.4], it can be deduced that P{|{i| A j i  = 1}| ≤ γT/2}≤exp(−γT/8) because E{|{i| A ȷ i =1}|}=γT . This shows that P{∃j:|{i| A j i =1}|≤γT/2} ≤ ∑ j=1 p P{|{i| A j i =1}|≤γT/2} =pP{|{i| A j i =1}|≤γT/2} ≤pexp(−γT/8). View Source Similarly, with the aid of Chernoff bound [17, Ch. 4], it can bededuced that P{|{i| A j 1 i =1}∩{i| A j 2 i =1}|≥2 γ 2 T}≤ exp(− γ 2 T/3) because E{|{i| A j 1 i =1}∩{i| A j 2 i =1}|}= γ 2 T . Therefore, it can be proved that P{∃ j 1 , j 2 :|{i| A j 1 i =1}∩{i| A j 2 i =1}|≥2 γ 2 T}  ≤ ∑ j 1 ≠ j 2 P{∃ j 1 , j 2 :|{i| A j 1 i =1}∩{i| A j 2 i =1}|≥2 γ 2 T}  ≤p(p−1)exp(− γ 2 T/3)  ≤ p 2 exp(− γ 2 T/3). View Source Finally, with the aid of these two inequalities, it can be shown that P{ max j 1 ≠ j 2 |{i| A j 1 i =1}∩{i| A j 2 i =1}|≤2 γ 2 T  and  min j |{i| A j i =1}|≥γT/2} =1−P{∃ j 1 , j 2 :|{i| A j 1 i =1}∩{i| A j 2 i =1}|≥2 γ 2 T or ∃j:|{i| A j i =1}|≥γT/2} ≥1−(P{∃ j 1 , j 2 :|{i| A j 1 i =1}∩{i| A j 2 i =1}|≥2 γ 2 T}  +P{∃j:|{i| A j i =1}|≥γT/2}) ≥1− p 2 exp(− γ 2 T/3)−pexp(−γT/8). View Source Now, notice that ⌊ γT/2−1 2 γ 2 T ⌋≥ γT/2−1 2 γ 2 T −1. View Source Hence, ⌊(γT/2−1)/(2 γ 2 T)⌋≥d (recall that A must be d - disjunct for a successful recovery), we must guarantee that γT/2−1 2 γ 2 T −1≥d. View Source For γ=1/d , this condition is equivalent to T≥2 d 2 /(5d+4) . A sufficient condition for this inequality is to select T≥ 2d/5 because 2d/5≥2 d 2 /(5d+4) for all d≥0 . Thus, P { A is d -disjunct} ≥1− p 2 exp(− γ 2 T/3)−pexp(−γT/8) if T≥2d/5 . Now, note that if T=c d 2 ln(p) and if γ=1/d , it can be seen that exp(−γT/8)=exp(−cdln(p)/8)= p −cd/8 . Thus, pexp(−γT/8)≤1/(2 p δ ) if c≥8( log p (2)+δ+1)/d . Similarly, if T=c d 2 ln(p) and γ=1/d , we get exp(− γ 2 T/3)=exp(−cln(p)/3)= p −c/3 . Therefore, p 2 exp(− γ 2 T/3)≤1/(2 p δ ) if c≥3(2+δ+ log p (2)) . Combining all these inequalities shows that P { A is d -disjunct} ≥1−1/ p δ if c≥8δ+8+8 log p (2) . Finally note that log p (2)=ln(2)/ln(p)≤ln(2)/ln(2)=1 for all p≥2 . Therefore, P { A is d -disjunct} ≥1−1/ p δ if c≥16+8δ . This concludes the proof. ■ Theorem 1 The solution of (4) is a solution of (3) with at least probability 1/ p δ if T≥24 d 2 ln(p) . Proof The proof follows from the application of the results of Propositions 1 and 2. ■ It should be noted as opposed the deterministic algorithms for generating matrix A , in the stochastic case, there is a non-zero probability for not being able to recover the faulty outputs correctly. However, this probability can be pushed arbitrarily close to zero. We need to also study the observability of the system using the random test sets. To do so, we need to define a sense of redundancy among the sensors. Definition 2: k -observableA pair of matrices ( F,H ) is k -observable if ( F, H K ) is observable for any K with cardinality k . Again, we would like to mention that there is an equivalence between A and the family of tests ( K i ) T i=1 . Therefore, these entities can be used interchangeably. Proposition 3 Let ( F,H ) be k -observable. Then P {( A, H K ) is observable} ≥1−1/ p δ for a Bernoulli test K (corresponding to the rows of the matrix A ) if k≤p/d−2δln(p) . Proof For a given test K , a sufficient condition for ( F, H K ) to be observable is to have |K|≥k . The Chernoff bound [17. Ch.4] shows that P{|K|≥k}≥1−exp(− (p−kd ) 2 p 2dp ), ∀k≤ p d . View Source To ensure P{|K|≥k}≥1−1/ p δ , we must ensure that exp(− (p−kd ) 2 p 2dp )≤ 1 p δ . View Source This condition is satisfied if k≤p/d−2δln(p) . This concludes the proof. ■ Proposition 3 shows that to ensure observability with the randomly selected outputs, the systems needs to have a high level of redundancy if d>0 . For instance, for d=2 , the system must be (p/2−2δln(p)) -observable, i.e., more than half of the sensor measurements must be redundant for observability. However, the condition implies that the system must be (p−2δln(p)) -observable for d=1 , which is not extremely conservative. Reducing the conservatism of this condition remains an important avenue for future research. Fig. 1.

Probability of successful recovery (captured by the colours) as a function of the number of the tests T for the noiseless case with p=100 . Show All For noisy cases, i.e., if ζ K i are non-zero with a non-zero probability, the optimization problem (4) is no longer useful. In this case, the following alternative must be solved: ( z ^ , ζ ^ )∈ argmin z ¯ ¯ ¯ , ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ s.t.   ∥ z ¯ ¯ ¯ ∥ 1 +α∥ ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ ∥ 1 , z ¯ ¯ ¯ ∈[0,1 ] p , ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ ∈ R p ≥0 , A i z ¯ ¯ ¯ = ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ i ,∀i: ξ K i =0 A i z ¯ ¯ ¯ + ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ i ≥1, ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ i ≤1,∀i: ξ K i =1 ∥ z ¯ ¯ ¯ ∥ 1 ≤d. (5a) (5b) (5c) (5d) (5e) (5f) View Source In the next section, we demonstrate the applicability of these results over a large scale dynamical system. SECTION IV. Numerical Example The applicability of the developed algorithms is demonstrated on a water channel with N pools. The model and the parameters of the pools are borrowed from [18], [19]. Each pool can be modelled by y i (s)= c in,i s e − t d,i s h i (s)− c out,i s h i+1 (s)+ c out,i s ζ i (s), View Source where c in,i and c out,i are the discharge rates of the gates between neighbouring pools, t d,i is the delay associated with the transport of water along each pool, ζ i (s) is the overall off-take flow load on pool i,  h i (s) is the flow of water from pool i−1 to pool i , and y i (s) denotes the water level in pool i . The transfer function of the delay is replaced with its first-order Padé approximation. This is due to that the closed-loop dynamics of the channel with local PI3 controllers is insensitive to the open-loop modelling error associated with the Padé approximation of the delay (because the loop-gain at frequencies where the approximation error is significant is small) [20]. Each pool is assumed to be locally controlled by h i (s)= κ i ( η i s+1) s( ρ i s+1) ( u i (s)− y i (s)), View Source where κ i ,  η i , and ρ i are appropriately selected control parameters, and u i (s) is the reference signal of pool i . The aggregate model of the system is discretized with the sampling time of 30 sec (or 0.5 min) with a zero-order hold on the reference signals. Following that, the model of the whole system is given by x[k+1]=Ax[k]+Bu[k]+w[k], View Source where w[k] is a process noise modelling the effect of local disturbances, such as off-take uncertainties, and physical phenomenons, such as wind. The variance of the process noise is set as Q=0.01I . The outputs of the system y[k] are the measurements of water level at all the pool and the water flow among all the pools. The variance of the measurement is equal to R=0.0025I . We consider the case where the sensors of the pool can simultaneously drop, e.g., due to communication issues. Thus p=N (as there are N pools). Furthermore, it is assumed that the maximum number of sensor faults is d=2 . Finally, to ensure observability of the system, it is assumed that each test involves the measurements of the last pool. This can be motivated by that the last pool is monitored separately to see if its sensors are faulty or not while the rest of the pools being remote locations cannot be accessed for regular service. A. Noiseless Measurements We start by demonstrating the noiseless case divorced from the underlying dynamical system. Consider the case where p=100 and noiseless measurements of the form (1) are available. Further, it is assumed that two simultaneous faults are present. Figure 1 illustrates the probability of successfully detecting the faulty measurements (empirically estimated using 1000 simulations) versus number of tests. Evidently the probability of successful recovery improves with increasing the number of the tests. There is a threshold after the linear programming algorithm almost surely recover the faulty entries almost surely. Figure 2 shows the probability of success versus both the number of the tests T and the number of fault locations p . As expected the number of the required tests to be able to extract the location of the faults reliably grows slowly with the number of the fault locations p . Fig. 3. Probability of successful recovery as a function of the number of the tests T for the noisy case with p=20 and χ 2 -test over a window of 10 samples. Show All B. Noisy Measurements Consider the case there are N=20 pools in the irrigation network. We use the Kalman filters in Section II to investigate if the sensors in each pool are faulty or not. We use the χ 2 -test over a window of 10 samples to decide if there is a fault present or not, i.e., it is deemed that a fault is present if, for some k , 1 20 ∑ t=0 9 ( y K [k−t]− H K x ^ K [k−t|k−t] ) ⊤ ×( H K P K [k−t|k−t] H ⊤ K +R ) −1 ×( y K [k−t]− H K x ^ K [k−t|k−t])≥2. View Source In what follows, the faulty outputs are determined using the linear programming problem in (5) with α=10 . Figure 3 illustrates probability of successful recovery (empirically estimated using 1000 simulations) as a function of the number of the tests T for the noisy case with p=20 . As expected, the probability of successful recovery is an increasing function of T . However, the probability of successful recover does not reach one even for T=20 . This is because no matter what there is always false detection due to stochastic nature of the problem and the use of the Kalman filters for fault detection. SECTION V. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, randomly generated tests were used to identify faulty sensors with a high probability. This method requires fewer tests required tests for successfully detecting the faulty sensors with a high probability in comparison to the brute-force method of checking all the sensors separately. In fact, the number of the tests scales logarithmically with the number of the sensors and quadratically with the maximum number of faulty sensors. The identification of the faulty sensors can also be done by solving a linear program.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.

3.6. IoT Network Architectures and Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) for Real-Time Irrigation
Real-time irrigation management systems heavily rely on the efficient and reliable transmission of data from sensors and weather stations to the cloud for processing and decision-making. However, agricultural environments present unique challenges to wireless communication, including adverse weather conditions, physical obstacles, and the limitations of wireless technologies. These challenges necessitate robust and adaptive solutions to ensure the consistent and timely flow of data, enabling truly autonomous irrigation scheduling.
Environmental factors, such as heavy rain, fog, and strong winds, can significantly disrupt wireless communication by attenuating or even blocking radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance (Ed-daoudi et al., 2023; Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). Dense vegetation, buildings, and uneven terrain create further complications by causing multipath propagation and shadowing effects (Yim et al., 2018; Gautam and Pagay, 2020). The study by Yim et al. (2018) on LoRa networks in a tree farm environment exemplifies these challenges, revealing reduced communication range and data reliability compared to theoretical expectations. This underscores the need for carefully selecting and optimizing communication protocols and network parameters to ensure reliable data transmission in such environments.
The study by Guzinski et al. (2014a) using a modified TSEB model further highlights the importance of high-resolution data in accurately capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of energy fluxes influenced by environmental factors. This emphasizes the need for advanced data acquisition and processing techniques that can effectively represent the complexities of agricultural settings.
The limitations of traditional wireless communication technologies, such as limited range and network congestion, pose additional challenges for large-scale agricultural operations. Long-distance data transmission can be hindered by range limitations, while network congestion arising from numerous sensors transmitting concurrently can lead to delays and data loss, hindering real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). Addressing these challenges requires the exploration of advanced networking technologies that can optimize spectrum utilization, mitigate interference, and improve reliability and efficiency.
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) offer promising solutions for optimizing wireless communication in agricultural settings. CRNs empower devices with the ability to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). Research has explored the potential of CRNs in predicting Radio Frequency (RF) power to avoid noisy channels and optimize spectrum utilization (Iliya et al., 2014; Iliya et al., 2014). These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of combining optimization algorithms with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the accuracy and generalization of RF power prediction, enabling CRNs to make informed decisions about channel selection and avoid interference.
DSA complements CRN technology by dynamically allocating unused spectrum, further enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion (Shi et al., 2023). The numerical model developed by Shi et al. (2023) showcases the potential of CRNs and DSA for optimizing wireless communication in challenging environments.
The integration of CRNs and DSA into the IoT network architecture requires careful consideration of spectrum sensing techniques, network topology, and data security. Research on cooperative spectrum sensing suggests that distributed approaches, where sensor nodes collaborate and share information, can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectrum sensing, particularly in dynamic environments (Trigka and Dritsas, 2022; Khalid & Yu, 2019). This collaborative approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the radio environment and facilitates the identification of available frequency bands for data transmission.
The choice of network topology also impacts the performance and scalability of CRN-based irrigation systems. Mesh networks, where sensor nodes are interconnected and relay data for each other, offer enhanced resilience and coverage compared to star topologies where nodes communicate directly with a central gateway (Akyildiz & Vuran, 2010). However, mesh networks can be more complex to manage and may introduce additional routing overhead. The trade-off between network resilience and complexity needs to be carefully evaluated to select the most appropriate topology for a specific agricultural setting.
Data security and privacy are paramount concerns in IoT-based irrigation systems due to the sensitive nature of agricultural data (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential for protecting data integrity and ensuring system trustworthiness. Research on secure spectrum leasing and resource allocation algorithms for CR-WSN-based irrigation systems has demonstrated the potential of these technologies for enhancing security and efficiency (Hassan, 2023; Afghah et al., 2018).
In conclusion, the development of effective and reliable real-time irrigation management systems requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the challenges of data transmission in agricultural environments. The integration of robust and adaptive communication protocols, optimized network architectures, and advanced networking technologies like CRNs and DSA, along with a focus on data security and privacy, can contribute significantly to achieving the goal of autonomous and efficient irrigation scheduling.
4. AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN THE CLOUD
4.1. Data Quality and Preprocessing
Data quality is paramount in automated irrigation systems as it directly influences the effectiveness of decision-making and water use efficiency. Issues like missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers arising from sensor malfunctions, environmental interference, or network problems (Lv et al., 2023) can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models used for irrigation scheduling and management.
Real-time data cleaning techniques are essential for addressing these challenges. Kalman filtering proves particularly effective in handling missing values and correcting erroneous readings by recursively estimating the system's state based on previous measurements and current sensor data, taking into account noise and uncertainty (Kim et al., 2020). Moving average techniques, by averaging consecutive data points, provide a more stable representation of the underlying trend, filtering out short-term fluctuations (Chhetri, 2023). For outlier detection, adaptive thresholding methods offer a dynamic approach, adjusting thresholds based on the statistical properties of the data to effectively identify anomalies and minimize false positives (Bah et al., 2021). These techniques are crucial in maintaining the integrity of real-time data streams and ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analyses.
Adaptive data preprocessing is essential for managing the diversity of data sources and formats commonly found in irrigation systems. Data normalization techniques, such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization, ensure that all features contribute equally to the analysis by transforming data values to a common scale (Pradal et al., 2016). This is crucial for preventing features with larger values from dominating the analysis and ensuring that all features are given equal consideration. Similarly, feature scaling methods, like standardization or normalization, optimize the range of feature values to improve the performance and convergence of machine learning models (Tortorici et al., 2024). By scaling features to a similar range, the influence of outliers is reduced, and the model's ability to learn from the data is enhanced.
Data fusion techniques play a critical role in integrating information from diverse sources, creating a more comprehensive and reliable dataset for irrigation management. Dempster-Shafer theory, a generalization of probability theory, allows for the expression of both uncertainty and the degree of conflict in evidence, making it suitable for fusing uncertain and conflicting data from heterogeneous sources (Sadiq and Rodriguez, 2004). This is particularly relevant in irrigation systems where data from different sensors may provide slightly different or even contradictory information due to sensor variations or environmental factors. Bayesian inference offers another powerful framework for combining information from multiple sources, updating the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available. By applying these techniques, data from soil moisture sensors, canopy temperature sensors, weather stations, and other sources can be integrated to provide a holistic understanding of crop water requirements and environmental conditions, leading to more informed and accurate irrigation decisions.
The impact of data quality extends beyond model accuracy to the robustness of machine learning models under varying conditions. Robust models should maintain consistent performance even when faced with data inconsistencies or unexpected situations. Techniques like data augmentation and domain adaptation can enhance model robustness by exposing the model to a wider range of data variations during training. Data augmentation involves generating additional training data by applying transformations or introducing noise to existing data, making the model more resilient to noise and variations in the real-world data. Domain adaptation techniques aim to adapt a model trained on one domain (e.g., a specific crop or geographic location) to perform well on another domain with different data characteristics. This is particularly relevant in irrigation management, where models may need to be applied to different crops, soil types, or climatic conditions.
The choice of data cleaning, preprocessing, and fusion techniques should be carefully considered based on the specific characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data. By selecting and implementing appropriate techniques, the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of machine learning models can be significantly improved, leading to more efficient and sustainable irrigation management practices.
4.2. Scalable and Autonomous Deployment using Containerization Strategies
The transition from data collection and transmission to efficient data processing requires a robust infrastructure capable of handling diverse workloads and data volumes. Containerization technologies, specifically Docker and Kubernetes, offer a promising solution for deploying and scaling data processing and machine learning modules within cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). Docker provides a standardized way to package applications and their dependencies into self-contained units known as containers, ensuring consistent and reproducible execution across different platforms (Rosendo et al., 2022). Kubernetes, acting as a container orchestrator, manages their deployment, scaling, and networking across a cluster of machines (Rosendo et al., 2022). This combination presents several advantages for automated irrigation management systems.
Firstly, containerization facilitates efficient resource utilization and scalability. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies, containers enable the isolation of resources and prevent conflicts between different modules (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This isolation allows for the efficient allocation of resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to each container based on its specific needs. Kubernetes further enhances scalability by allowing for the automatic scaling of containers based on real-time demand, ensuring the system can adapt to varying workloads and data volumes, preventing bottlenecks, and ensuring responsiveness to changing conditions (Karamolegkos et al., 2023).
Secondly, containerization promotes portability and reproducibility. By packaging applications and their dependencies into a single unit, containers make it easy to move and deploy them across different cloud environments without the need for environment-specific configurations (Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This portability simplifies the development and deployment process, reducing the time and effort required to set up and manage the system. Additionally, containers ensure reproducibility by providing a consistent execution environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This eliminates variability and ensures that the system will behave consistently across different deployments (Zhou et al., 2023).
Optimizing container orchestration and resource allocation is crucial to minimizing latency and maximizing throughput in real-time data processing pipelines. Techniques like auto-scaling and dynamic resource allocation play a critical role in this context (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Werner and Tai, 2023; Kumar et al., 2024). Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of container instances based on real-time demand, ensuring that sufficient resources are available to handle peak workloads while avoiding over-provisioning during periods of low demand (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2024). Dynamic resource allocation enables the fine-grained adjustment of resources allocated to each container based on its specific needs and the current workload (Werner and Tai, 2023). This ensures efficient resource allocation and provides each container with the necessary resources to perform its tasks effectively.
Performance monitoring tools, such as Kubernetes Metrics Server and Prometheus, are essential for gaining insights into the performance of containers and the overall system (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kuity & Peddoju, 2023). These tools provide valuable data on key performance indicators, such as CPU and memory usage, network traffic, and application-specific metrics. By monitoring this data, administrators can identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation strategies, and continuously improve system performance (Hethcoat et al., 2024). This data-driven approach ensures that automated irrigation management systems can operate efficiently and reliably.
By integrating containerization technologies with optimization techniques and performance monitoring, automated irrigation management systems achieve the scalability, autonomy, and efficiency required for effective real-time data processing and decision-making. This approach facilitates a seamless and responsive system that can adapt to changing conditions and contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity.

4.3. Deploying ML Models for Data Processing
Transitioning from data collection, preprocessing, and transmission, the deployment of machine learning (ML) models marks a pivotal stage in the automated irrigation management pipeline. This stage entails utilizing cloud platforms to facilitate real-time data processing and inference, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimal irrigation management and ultimately contributing to fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
Several architectures and frameworks exist for deploying ML models on cloud platforms, each offering unique advantages and catering to different requirements. TensorFlow Serving, for instance, provides a high-performance system specifically designed for serving TensorFlow models (Abadi et al., 2016). This framework enables efficient and scalable inference, making it suitable for real-time applications where low latency and high throughput are crucial. For instance, in a large-scale irrigation system with numerous sensors generating data continuously, TensorFlow Serving can efficiently handle the high volume of inference requests and provide timely predictions for irrigation scheduling. Similarly, Apache MXNet Model Server offers a flexible and efficient solution for deploying models trained with MXNet, supporting a wide range of deep learning models and inference backends (MXNet Developers, 2015). This versatility makes it suitable for complex irrigation systems that may utilize different types of ML models for various tasks, such as predicting crop water requirements, detecting plant stress, or forecasting weather conditions. ONNX Runtime, on the other hand, provides a cross-platform inference engine compatible with various ML frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet (Microsoft, 2017). This versatility enables the deployment of models in diverse environments, facilitating interoperability and reducing the need for model conversion. For example, an irrigation system that uses models trained in different frameworks can utilize ONNX Runtime to deploy them on a single platform without the need for time-consuming and error-prone model conversion processes.
Choosing the appropriate architecture or framework depends on several factors, including the specific ML framework used for model training, the desired level of performance and scalability, and the need for cross-platform compatibility. For instance, if the primary concern is low latency and high throughput for real-time inference, TensorFlow Serving might be the optimal choice for TensorFlow models. However, if flexibility and support for various deep learning models are required, Apache MXNet Model Server could be more suitable. In cases where cross-platform compatibility is essential, ONNX Runtime offers a versatile solution.
Once the ML model is deployed, optimizing its performance and resource utilization becomes crucial for ensuring the efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems. Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, offer effective methods for reducing the size and computational requirements of ML models without compromising accuracy (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Pruning involves eliminating unnecessary connections or neurons from the model, effectively streamlining its structure and reducing computational complexity. This can be particularly beneficial for deep learning models, which often have a large number of parameters and can be prone to overfitting. By removing redundant or less important connections, pruning can improve modelgeneralizability and reduce inference time. Quantization, on the other hand, involves reducing the precision of model parameters, typically from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower-precision formats such as 8-bit integers. This reduction in precision leads to smaller model sizes and faster inference speeds, making it particularly beneficial for resource-constrained environments or real-time applications. For instance, in edge computing scenarios where ML models are deployed on devices with limited computational resources, quantization can enable efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, hardware acceleration through the utilization of GPUs or TPUs can significantly enhance model performance by leveraging specialized hardware designed for parallel processing (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). GPUs, with their massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth, excel at accelerating matrix operations and convolutions, which are fundamental computations in many deep learning models. This acceleration can significantly reduce inference time and enable real-time processing of sensor data for timely irrigation decisions. TPUs, specifically designed for deep learning workloads, offer even greater performance and energy efficiency for specific model architectures. These hardware accelerators can drastically reduce inference time, enabling near real-time decision-making and enhancing the responsiveness of automated irrigation systems. For example, in a scenario where immediate response to changing weather conditions or soil moisture levels is critical, hardware acceleration can ensure that irrigation decisions are made and executed promptly.
In addition to model compression and hardware acceleration, distributed training techniques play a crucial role in optimizing the training process for large-scale ML models. Techniques such as Horovod and BytePS enable the distribution of training across multiple machines, effectively parallelizing the process and reducing training time (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). This is particularly beneficial for complex models with a large number of parameters or when dealing with large datasets. By leveraging distributed training, irrigation management systems can train more sophisticated models and improve their predictive capabilities, leading to more accurate and efficient irrigation decisions. For instance, a system that utilizes a deep learning model with millions of parameters can benefit from distributed training to reduce training time from days to hours, enabling faster model iteration and improvement.
Integrating the deployed ML models with other components of the automated irrigation management pipeline is essential for achieving a fully autonomous and cohesive system and addressing the need for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system. Standardized protocols, such as MQTT and CoAP, provide lightweight and efficient communication channels for exchanging data between these components (Poojara et al., 2023; Jimenez et al., 2020a; Gour et al., 2023). MQTT, with its publish-subscribe architecture, enables real-time data streaming and event-driven communication, making it suitable for transmitting sensor data, control signals, and inference results (Raikar & M, 2023). This enables the ML model to receive real-time updates on soil moisture, weather conditions, and plant health, allowing for dynamic adjustments to irrigation schedules based on the latest data. CoAP, designed for constrained devices and low-power networks, offers a web-transfer protocol for resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient communication between sensors, actuators, and the ML models (Raikar & M, 2023). This is particularly relevant in situations where sensors or actuators have limited processing power or battery life, as CoAP minimizes communication overhead and energy consumption. Additionally, RESTful APIs provide a standardized interface for accessing and controlling the ML models, enabling seamless integration with other software components and facilitating system management and monitoring (Wang et al., 2022). This allows for easy integration with existing farm management systems or third-party applications, creating a unified platform for comprehensive irrigation management.4.4. Online Learning in the Cloud
The complexities of real-time data processing in irrigation management necessitate the exploration of advanced techniques to continuously learn and adapt to the dynamic nature of agricultural environments. Online learning algorithms offer a promising solution, enabling the continuous update and improvement of machine learning models based on incoming real-time data. This adaptability is crucial for addressing the challenges of changing environmental conditions, such as weather patterns and crop growth stages, and optimizing irrigation decision-making to enhance water usage efficiency and crop productivity.
Several online learning algorithms have demonstrated potential for real-time data processing and model adaptation in the context of irrigation management. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) facilitates the incremental update of model parameters with each new data point, allowing for efficient adaptation to changing data distributions (Bottou, 2010). This incremental learning process ensures that the model remains responsive to the latest conditions, minimizing the risk of outdated predictions and improving the accuracy of irrigation decisions. Passive-Aggressive algorithms, on the other hand, adjust model parameters only when a misclassification occurs, providing a computationally efficient approach for handling large data streams (Crammer et al., 2006). These algorithms offer a robust approach to handling noisy data, a common challenge in real-world sensor readings, by making small adjustments only when the model's prediction deviates significantly from the actual value (Fei et al., 2019). Online Random Forests extend the concept of random forests to the online setting, enabling the incremental construction and update of decision trees as new data arrives (Saffari et al., 2009). The continuous evolution of the ensemble ensures that the model remains relevant to the changing environment, capturing intricate relationships between variables and leading to more informed irrigation decisions.
Research in various domains highlights the importance of online learning for real-time data stream analytics. Snyder et al. (2020) explored the application of online learning techniques for identifying relevant tweets in real-time, improving situational awareness for first responders. The proposed interactive learning framework allows users to continuously label the relevance of incoming tweets, enabling the real-time refinement of the underlying machine learning model. This user-guided approach aligns well with the dynamic nature of irrigation management, where models need to continuously adjust to varying environmental conditions and crop water requirements. Similarly, research in the field of cyber-physical systems (CPS) underscores the need for online learning algorithms to effectively extract insights and knowledge from continuously generated data streams (Fei et al., 2019). These capabilities are crucial for enabling feedback loops between physical processes and cyber elements, facilitating the integration and optimization of CPS in irrigation management systems.
To implement online learning in cloud-based irrigation management systems, various architectures and frameworks can be considered. Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis provide scalable and fault-tolerant platforms for processing real-time data streams, allowing for the development of online learning pipelines that continuously ingest and analyze data to update machine learning models (Zaharia et al., 2012; Carbone et al., 2015; Amazon Web Services, 2023). These frameworks leverage serverless computing paradigms, automatically scaling resources based on the volume and velocity of incoming data, ensuring efficient resource utilization and responsiveness to fluctuations in demand (Fei et al., 2019).
Effectively managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off is crucial for optimizing online learning in irrigation management. Techniques such as Multi-armed bandits (Sutton & Barto, 2018), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018) can be employed to balance the allocation of resources between exploring new irrigation strategies and exploiting the current best-performing approaches. These techniques enable the identification of optimal irrigation policies, adapting to changing environmental conditions and maximizing long-term rewards.
In conclusion, online learning techniques, coupled with scalable cloud-based architectures, offer a powerful solution for real-time data processing and continuous adaptation in irrigation management systems. By leveraging algorithms like SGD, Passive-Aggressive, and Online Random Forests, along with stream processing frameworks like Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis, irrigation management systems can effectively handle the complexities of real-time data, optimize water usage, and enhance crop productivity in the face of dynamic environmental conditions.

5. GENERATING AND APPLYING IRRIGATION INSIGHTS 
5.1. Real-Time Generation of Actionable Irrigation Insights
The transition from data collection and processing to actionable irrigation insights requires the extracting spatial features from images, allowing for the analysis of satellite or drone imagery to assess crop health, detect water stress, and provide insights into irrigation needs (Os deployment of advanced predictive models capable of generating precise and site-specific irrigation recommendations.roosh et al., 2016).
Furthermore, the integration Deep learning models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and of data from diverse sources, including IoT sensors and cloud-based platforms, plays Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have demonstrated excellent performance in capturing complex relationships a critical role in enhancing the accuracy and resolution of real-time irrigation insights. Data fusion techniques, such as Kalman filtering, offer a robust approach for combining information between input variables and predicting crop water requirements (Keller, 2023; Naphade et al., 2022). These models can effectively from multiple sensors, accounting for noise and uncertainty, and providing a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements (Cohen et al., 2005; Mö handle the temporal dependencies present in time-series data, such as soil moisture andeller et al., 2007). By integrating data from soil moisture weather data, and learn to predict future water needs based on historical patterns and current sensors, weather stations, and remote sensing platforms, ML models can generate more accurate conditions. Ensemble methods, such as Random Forests, also offer a robust approach to and site-specific irrigation recommendations, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity prediction by combining multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce the risk of overfitting.
The heterogeneity, uncertainty, and quality issues inherent in real-time data streams require careful consideration and the implementation of effective strategies to ensure the reliability of generated (Singh et al., 2016).
The integration of irrigation insights. Data preprocessing techniques, such as outlier detection and missing value imputation, IoT sensor data with cloud-based data sources is crucial for enhancing the accuracy and resolution of irrigation insights. IoT sensors, such as soil moisture probes and weather stations are essential for preparing the data for analysis and preventing erroneous data from influencing the model, provide real-time, localized data on crop and environmental conditions, while cloud's predictions (Fiksel, 2003). Additionally,-based sources, such as weather forecasts and satellite imagery, offer broader spatial and the selection of appropriate ML models and data fusion techniques should be tailored to the specific temporal perspectives (López-Morales et al., 2020). characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data to mitigate uncertainty and ensure the robustness Data fusion techniques, such as Kalman filtering, play a critical role in combining these of generated insights.
To address computational complexity and latency challenges in real-time irrigation insight generation, techniques such as edge computing, model compression, and hardware accelerators heterogeneous data sources to generate more accurate and comprehensive irrigation recommendations (Cohen et al., offer promising solutions. Edge computing enables the distribution of processing tasks closer to the data 2005; Möeller et al., 2007 source, reducing latency and enabling faster response times (Mishra, 20). By incorporating data from multiple sources, irrigation models can better account for spatial variability20; Zhang et al., 2020). Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, can significantly reduce the size and computational requirements of in soil moisture, microclimate conditions, and crop water requirements, leading to more ML models without compromising accuracy, making them suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge precise and efficient irrigation scheduling.
The seamless integration of ML-generated insights with IoT-enabled irrigation control systems requires the adoption of appropriate architectures and protocols that facilitate devices (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Hardware lightweight, real-time communication. The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT accelerators, such as GPUs and TPUs, provide specialized hardware designed for parallel processing) protocol and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are well-suited, enabling faster inference speeds and facilitating real-time data analysis (Premkumar for this purpose, offering efficient and reliable communication channels for exchanging data between sensors, & Sigappi, 2022). The combined utilization of these techniques can significantly improve the efficiency and responsiveness of real-time irrigation insight generation, contributing actuators, and ML models (Muangprathub et al., 2019; Osroosh et al., 2016). to the overall goal of achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

for resource-constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks. By utilizing these protocols, irrigation systems can achieve seamless integration between ML models and IoT devices, enabling the automated application of irrigation insights based on real-time data and predictions.
Industry-leading products and services for smart irrigation demonstrate the practical application of these technologies. Smart irrigation controllers, such as Rachio, leverage weather data and soil moisture sensors to automatically adjust irrigation schedules based on real-time conditions, reducing water waste and promoting water conservation (Verdouw et al., 2023). Cloud-based irrigation management platforms, such as CropX, offer advanced analytics and decision support tools, providing farmers with insights into crop water requirements, soil health, and irrigation performance (Weikmann et al., 2023). These platforms often incorporate machine learning algorithms to generate predictive models and provide farmers with data-driven recommendations for optimizing irrigation strategies.
The analysis of these products and services highlights the growing trend toward data-driven, automated irrigation management. By integrating IoT, machine learning, and cloud computing, these solutions enable farmers to make more informed and efficient irrigation decisions, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture.

  Explanation: The paper investigates how automated irrigation systems can help address the global challenge of producing food in a sustainable manner. Previous research has shown that automated irrigation systems can improve water efficiency and increase agricultural productivity by using data analytics to make real-time decisions about irrigation scheduling. This study analyzes data from 31 commercial agricultural fields over three consecutive years to assess the performance of automated irrigation systems in the Republican River Basin in Nebraska, USA.

The study found that:

* Automated irrigation systems can save water by reducing the amount of water applied to crops. In some cases, irrigation applications exceeded the amount recommended by scientific methods and the mean annual allocated irrigation depth by the local water management agency.

* Automated irrigation systems can improve crop yields by ensuring that crops receive the right amount of water at the right time. This can lead to increased profits for farmers and reduced environmental impacts.

* Automated irrigation systems can help to protect water quality by reducing the amount of fertilizer and other chemicals that leach into groundwater.

Abstract Effective agricultural water management requires accurate, continuous, and transparent accounting of water use in irrigated agroecosystems, especially in water-limited regions where moratoriums may be imposed. Advances in sensor technologies, networking, and data analytics can aid in fulfilling this task by automatically collecting, analyzing and reporting real-time data to infer irrigators’ practices and behaviors, crop water requirements, water applications and use. In this research, an automated irrigation water withdrawal and water use monitoring and data collection system was deployed to monitor actual irrigation dynamics for 31 commercial and large-scale agricultural production fields for three consecutive years. Production scale fields (representing a total of 1050 ha) included center pivot (P), gravity (surface/furrow) (G) and subsurface drip-irrigated (S) fields. On average, irrigation was initiated 40–70 days after planting (DAP) and terminated by 120–140 DAP. The proportion of irrigation systems operating simultaneously and peak water abstraction were highest (70–90 %) during July and August. Mean depth of water applied across all fields was 243, 264 and 284 mm in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Site-specific monitoring of precipitation, soil moisture, and evaporative demand and a soil-water balance model resulted in mean seasonal irrigation requirement estimates of 394, 242 and 184 mm, in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively; for maize; and 307, 163 and 219 mm in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, for soybean. Despite reduction of calculated mean irrigation requirement in 2014 and 2015 by 40–50 %, actual irrigation applications by producers did not change considerably and irrigation applied exceeded irrigation water requirements in 80 % of the fields, suggesting needs for irrigation water management technology implementation and associated educational programs in the region. Some fields showed irrigation applications exceeding the mean annual allocated (moratorium) irrigation depth (305 mm), implying that irrigation decisions are still largely driven by non-scientific and/or technical methods. While substantial farm-to-farm heterogeneity makes it challenging to robustly benchmarking regional water footprint and irrigator behavior, it also creates an opportunity for developing and implementing methodologies and strategies for real-time monitoring of farm-level irrigation dynamics. New advances in technologies with telemetry capabilities as well as internet of things (IoTs) can be leveraged to effectively create databases, track and compare water usage to better plan, allocate, distribute, monitor and manage limited water resources for enhancing agricultural productivity. These processes can also be used for education and demonstration for irrigation professionals to enhance adoption of such technologies. This research has the potential for technology and strategy transfer for advanced water management to other regions in the United States and globally. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords AutomationEvapotranspirationIrrigationMaizeSoil moistureSoybeanTelemetryWater management 1. introduction Due to the nature of the novel goal of producing food, fiber and fuel demand of rapidly-growing world’s population, agricultural irrigation, in many cases, is the largest customer of global freshwater resources with 70–80 % of the total water withdrawal from ground and surface water resources globally (OECD, 2021; Gordon et al., 2010). In many cases, it is stated by different researchers, scientists and other non-experts in water resources engineering, agricultural water management, agricultural engineering disciplines that “irrigated agriculture consumes 70–80 % of water withdrawn water resources,” which is not accurate and is misleading as not all water withdrawn from ground or surface water resources is consumed by plants and a considerable portion of water withdrawn and delivered to the production fields through irrigation systems returns to its sources. The amount of water withdrawn that returns to the source is a function of numerous factors, including irrigation method, soil characteristics, crop type and crop growth stage, climate conditions, soil and crop management practices, effectiveness of irrigation management, irrigation method, etc. On a rough estimate, in the United States, about 42 % of the total water withdrawal is for irrigation purposes (ERS, 2015), which is experiencing increasing pressure for improved efficiency to produce significantly more food and fiber and other commodities. In addition to proper assessment, forecasting, planning, effectively managing limited freshwater resources requires transparency in accounting and analysis of irrigation water withdrawal and use characteristics at appropriate scales. This immense and critical task is typically accomplished by site-specific measurement of environmental, biophysical, and micrometeorological parameters or by estimation of irrigation water requirements by relying on empirical and other approaches. Irrigation water requirement in agriculture can be defined as the adequate amount of water that must be artificially supplied to the crop for achieving ideal crop growth, quality and desired yield in cases where the amount of precipitation and stored soil-water are not sufficient to meet crop water demand for achieving potential yield. The primary unknown in order to accurately determining irrigation water requirement is crop water use or crop evapotranspiration (ETc), which is driven by weather conditions (solar radiation, relative humidity, air temperature, wind speed, vapor pressure deficit), soil and crop management practices (including tillage practices, seeding rate, row spacing, etc.), crop type and growth (including leaf area index, leaf orientation etc.), soil properties (soil texture, field capcity, permanent wilting point, water holding capcity), root development (root density, rooting depth), soil-water availability, time of the year, time of the day (for hourly time step) and other factors. ETc can be measured via advanced techniques such as lysimeters, surface renewal, Bowen Ratio Energy Balance Systems, and Eddy Correlation Systems (Steduto and Hsiao, 1998, Irmak and Irmak, 2008, Irmak, 2010, Li et al., 2008, Snyder et al., 1996). Despite high representativeness and accuracy, these measurement techniques can be quite laborious, expensive, require trained professionals, time-consuming and can be used only on certain areas due to their nature of operations. As convenient alternatives, estimation methods such as two-step approach (i.e., ETc = reference ET x crop coefficient) can be used to calculate ETc. However, this approach is subject to assumptions that do not consider variability in soil and crop practices, variety differences, and other factors that different commercial fields are managed with. Moreover, evaporative demand at a particular site may vary considerably than what is calculated at a nearby weather monitoring site, due to microclimate impacts from specific management practices, e.g., tillage (Irmak et al., 2019), irrigation method (Cavero et al., 2009), terrain characteristics, etc. This results in compromising of the site-specificity of ETc and irrigation requirements that are needed for precise assessment and management of water in producers fields. In contrast, several sensor technologies, network, and data advances make it possible to observe and record irrigation water withdrawal, ETc as well as irrigator behaviour at individual farms simultaneously by avoiding the complications encountered in the abovementioned technical approaches that rely on energy balance principles. Several critical variables that drive ETc and irrigation water withdrawal can be measured independently and site-specifically to render robust data on regional irrigation-related characteristics in real- or near real-time. These technologies include atmometers (ETgauges) that can be deployed in-field to measure site-specific evaporative demand by closely resembling plant’s resistance to ETc (Alam and Trooien, 2001, Magliulo et al., 2003, Irmak et al., 2005a, Chen and Robinson, 2009), soil moisture sensors installed in the crop root zone to report soil-water depletion (Wetzel and Chang, 1987) and precipitation gauges. In addition, measurement of flow rate and volume of water pumped by an individual producer aids in determining and improving irrigation water productivity (IWP), crop water productivity (CWP), determining pumping plant efficiency; detecting various technical and operational well, pump, pipes and irrigation system malfunctions that result in improved irrigation water delivery and use. A variety of flow measurement devices are available to measure instantaneous and total flow rate applied to a particular field throughout the growing season. Various state water management agencies such as, Water Management Districts, Natural Resources Districts (NRDs), etc., have been established to monitor irrigation water consumption by implementing the management plans and strategies in their specific areas. In Nebraska, NRDs regulate groundwater resources and Department of Natural Resources (DNR) regulates surfacewater resources. The difference between NRDs and irrigation districts is that NRDs are responsible for regulating groundwater and developing rules for withdrawal, allocations, etc., whereas irrigation districts are usually responsible for delivering the water to the irrigators. For example, in Nebraska, regulations are imposed by NRDs to install water meters on the irrigation systems which helps keep a check on producers to monitor and/or limit their water withdrawal to the allocated amount with respect to the allocated amount. However, these rules and regulations vary in respective geographic areas of concern and are decided by the local NRDs according to the requirements in the concerned area. In some NRDs, flowmeters are required on all wells and/or on new wells, and some NRDs require flowmeters in sub-areas or in certain areas, whereas irrigation water allocation/moratorium rule are employed by some NRDs. For example in the larger Republican River Basin, Upper, Middle and Lower Republican NRDs impose different amount of water allocations (moratoriums). Based on the Stakeholders Advisory Committee (2016), the Lower Republican NRD (LRNRD) established a moratorium (restriction on the amount of water irrigators can pump during a given time) on new irrigation well drilling on December 9, 2002. No new irrigation wells have been drilled since that date. District established a moratorium on adding new irrigated lands on December 31, 2004. No new irrigated land has been added since that date. All groundwater irrigated areas were certified in 2004 and all wells were metered by April 1, 2005. The Lower Republican NRD has the lowest groundwater allocation in the state. The present allocation is 230 mm/yr. NRD allocates a 5 year block for 1143 mm and the water may be used however the irrigator chooses during that 5 years unless there is an allocation cap. NRD allows up to 230 mm to be carried over the end of an allocation period to the next allocation period. Unless otherwise provided, imposition of penalties for exceeding the allocation amounts shall be at the discretion of the NRD Board and may include, but are not limited to: (a) A reduction (in whole or in part) of a person’s allocation of groundwater; (b) A reduction (in whole or in part) of a person’s certified irrigated acres; and (c) Decommissioning of water wells. Penalty for exceeding carry over include deducting 50 mm carryover deducted for every inch of carry-over used above 190 mm. The Middle Republican NRD (MRNRD) is and will continue to enforce all of the management actions that have been described in the handout such as: Moratorium on new irrigation wells and acres; Abiding our 4th generation of the Integrated Management Plan; helping producers with programs for their irrigated land; implementing allocations and penalties; and much more that we have been doing for years already within our district. The MRNRD currently has 1524/5-yr allocation rule imposed. In cases when unused amount of water remained from the allocated amount, it is carried over to the next allocation cycle. If an irrigator has exceeded his/her allocation, the allocation for the next allocation period shall be reduced by the number of acre inches, by which said allocation was exceeded in the prior period. A penalty of 25.4 mm for every inch over the first 76 mm and 50 mm for every mm over 76 mm of overuse will be applied. Moratoriums in the Republican River Basin do not consider the cropping pattern grown in a given year, although most district has maize-soybean rotation. Based on the Republican River Basin-Wide Plan (2018), the Upper Republican NRD (URNRD) has prohibited new irrigation wells since 1998. Any replacement irrigation well, replacement livestock well, replacement industrial well or replacement public water system must be at least 183 m from any domestic well or range livestock well, 805 m from a public water supply well, and 305 from any irrigation well, commercial livestock well or industrial well. No wells can be connected without prior approval from the URNRD. In all three NRDS, any person who violates a cease-and-desist order issued by the district pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. §46–707(h) may be subject to a civil penalty assessed pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. §46–745. To monitor water withdrawal by irrigators, NRD personnel travel long distances and manually read the meters installed at the registered wells once a year after the irrigation season and record the readings. These readings are used to keep a check on the water pumped to keep a sustainable balance between water use and water supply which ensures the region’s economic viability, social and environmental health/environmental services, safety, and welfare. These practices of manual data collection, though effective, are very labor intensive and expensive. It is also subject to human error, and annual readings are not enough to provide sufficient information to find the relation between the water usage during the crop growing season and crop water requirements. Furthermore, these manual readings provide data and information only after the season is over and are not effective to make in-season or real time monitoring or assessments. Taking totalized readings only once a year after the irrigation season does not provide detailed data on how water is used during the crop growing season in relation to crop water requirements. This critically important need to better assess, forecast and manage water resources can be fulfilled by implementing an automated water use monitoring and data collection system which can compile, record, and communicate irrigation flow rate/water withdrawal data, along with critical site-specific drivers of irrigation water use. Recent developments of smart meter technologies that are capable of remotely reading meters in real-time and archiving the records in a central database provides great opportunity to change the way irrigation water use is monitored and documented. The smart meter technology is already being used by public utility providers (electricity, gas, domestic water supply) to reduce the expenses of periodic trips to each physical location to read a meter. The new technologies transmit hourly water consumption data to the city’s billing system by wireless network. This real-time water use information allows city’s water managers to monitor water use and detect leaks and other issues quickly. Water consumers are also able to view their daily water usage data online and learn ways to conserve water. Despite the great potential of smart meter to provide reliable and real-time water-use information, the technology has not been applied in the management of irrigation water use by irrigation and water resources management organizations. Application of this technology in the management of the nation’s irrigation water use has several potential benefits including reduced cost of data collection, documentation and analyses and real-time data for better irrigation management strategies. In addition to irrigation water use data, other information such as rainfall, soil moisture and ETc are required for management and performance evaluation of irrigation systems. When such data are measured by sensors with wireless data transmission capability, it becomes possible to automate the collection, documentation, and storage of the data to a central database. The timely water use information coupled with analysis can give both irrigation managers and farmers better control of water-use. Smart meter technologies allow farmers to view their irrigation information through handheld, mobile and network technologies via wired or wireless platforms, radio frequency, or powerline transmission. In this research, we demonstrated the use of such an automated system to analyze irrigation analytics across commercial agricultural production fields within an important irrigated crop production region, i.e., Republican River Basin, Nebraska, United States, which is divided into three Natural Resources Districts (NRDs) among which MRNRD is the largest and intensively irrigated. The largest source of irrigation water in the MRNRD is groundwater with 3000+ registered wells, and the area is facing significant challenges associated with water needs and quality. The objectives of this research were to demonstrate the deployment and use of a novel and an automated near real-time water withdrawal and use monitoring and data collection system and decipher the complex irrigator behavior and pattern of irrigation water use in the region. Specifically, critical aspects of regional irrigation are studied such as the start and termination of irrigation season, frequency of the irrigation in a crop growing season, and depth of irrigation water applied. Finally, irrigation water depths directly observed at producer fields were compared and assessed against irrigation requirement estimates obtained using viable and scientific methodologies. The irrigator behaviour in decision making is assessed against both true irrigation requirements as well as water allocation (Moratorium). Such large-scale deployment of technologies and extensive water withdrawal and use analyses on large scale production fields as well as irrigator behaviors with respect to water allocations are unique and have not been studied before. The anticipated benefits from this project are reduced cost of data collection, documentation and analyses; real time data availability for better irrigation management strategies; improvement in groundwater quality from reduced irrigation and reduced chemical leaching potential to water resources; and reduced soil erosion from reduced runoff. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Research area The Republican River Basin is located along the border of Kansas and Nebraska and encompasses portions of three states. The total drainage area sums up to 64,800 km2 of which 31 % is in northeastern Colorado, 30 % in northwestern Kansas, and 39 % in southwestern Nebraska (Fig. 1). The drainage area within Nebraska overlaps with four Natural Resources Districts (NRDs): Upper Republican, Middle Republican, Lower Republican, and Tri-Basin NRD, while smaller areas also overlap with Little Blue and Twin Platte NRDs. The area for this research is the MRNRD. The MRNRD encompasses all of Hayes, Hitchcock, and Red Willow Counties, most of Frontier, and the southern one-third of Lincoln County (Fig. 1). The total land area covered by MRNRD is 9950 km2 (995,332 ha) comprising of 53 % of rangeland and 46 % of cropland. The major crops in this region are maize, winter wheat, sorghum, and soybean. The growing season generally lasts between 150 and 160 days. The major soil types in the area are a Coly-Uly and Colby-Ulysses associations of silt loam texture, silty Hord, McCook, Hobbs and Valentine and Valent sands in the northwestern part. The 30-year normal (1991–2020) annual precipitation and temperature for the region are 546 mm and 10.1 °C, respectively (PRISM, 2021). Over 3000 registered irrigation wells in the MRNRD (Fig. 1) are required to be equipped with a flowmeter. For this research, 31 fields that have well permits were selected for a 3-year pilot assessment distributed across MRNRD. Twentysix fields were irrigated with center pivots, 3 with gravity (surface) and 2 with subsurface drip- irrigation (SDI) (Fig. 1).

Instrumentation and data sources 2.2.1. Instrumentation and development of irrigation water-use data acquisition system In this research, all producer collaborators’ fields were named with their respective irrigation method such as center pivot irrigation (P1, P2,…) gravity (furrow) irrigation (G1, G2,…) and subsurface drip irrigation (S1, S2,…) (Table 1) to avoid using actual producers’ names. These field names were also used in the telemetry and online/cloud platforms to protect the identity and privacy of the collaborators. The irrigation water-use data acquisition system was designed to automate the gathering of irrigation water-use and other information such as rainfall, crop type, planting date, ETc and soil moisture data into a central irrigation water use database platform. The system uses the most appropriate and cost effective, yet advanced satellite telemetry/wireless technology for delivering up to date irrigation water flow, soil moisture, ETc, and rainfall data from the sensors installed in the field to a central monitoring computer. The components of the irrigation water use data acquisition system are shown in Picture 1. All research fields were equipped with flowmeters on the irrigation pipelines to measure, record, and communicate irrigation flow data every 15 min. The telemetry system allows monitoring water withdrawal quantities and enables to set alerts/alarms to indicate high or low water withdrawal, which can be concurrently tracked for each field. The collected data are processed and output via easy-to-understand graphs showing the irrigation water pumped in each farm in relation to water allocation limits, crop water use and average irrigation withdrawals of the neighboring farms. Farmers can login to the system online using a username and password to view their own irrigation water withdrawal data and associated information.

The research used the existing totalizer flowmeters (TFM) installed in the research fields. The flowmeters were propeller-type manufactured by McCrometer (Great Plains Meter, Inc., Aurora, NE, USA) and have a measurement accuracy of ± 2 % of discharge and repeatability of ± 0.25 %. To obtain this accuracy of discharge, we ensured that the TFM were installed correctly, following the manufacturer’s specifications. At each selected irrigation well, a TFM was installed inline in a full-flowing, acceptable test section of pipe on the discharge side of the pump where the measurement of water velocity was made (Picture 2). The flowmeter location was in a straight, constant diameter length of pipeline without turbulence to prevent obstructions (elbows, valves, pumps, and changes in pipe diameter) for a certain distance upstream and downstream from the flowmeter installation point. Distances required usually were related to the diameter of the discharge pipe at the measurement location. The desired distance upstream for the flowmeters without a straightening vane installed was 10 pipe diameters and for flowmeters with a straightening vane, it was 5 pipe diameters. To allow automated flowmeter readings, data logging and telemetry transmission, a pulse transmitter unit was installed at the bases of the existing flowmeters (Picture 3). The transmitter unit transmits pulses representing irrigation flow rate (pulse range: 4–20 mA) to the telemetry unit through a cable. On-site calibration was performed for each installed pulse transmitter unit in each field. Download : Download high-res image (721KB) Download : Download full-size image Picture 2.

Assembled remote telemetry unit, rain gauge and solar panel in the field. The remote telemetry units (RTUs) used in this data acquisition system was standalone GPRS stations (Model A755 GPRS SDI-12, Adcon Telemetry, Vienna, Austria) (Picture 3). Each station has two input ports and was connected through cables to receive data signals from the flowmeter and from either rain gauges or atmometers (ETgauge) as needed. Data signals are first stored in the memory of an RTU. An RTU has its own intelligence in the form of a built-in microcontroller, which periodically performs several tasks. For example, it interrogates the sensors, stores the measured data and checks the local battery status continuously. RTU is equipped with a GSM modem, which allows for real-time wireless communication with a base station. Reverse communication is also possible from the base station. The stations were configured to record data with 15 min intervals and set to deliver the recorded data to the telemetry gateway at hourly intervals to provide near real-time data. The power for the unit comes from an internal NiMH battery which is charged using a compact solar panel. Rain gauge (Model RG1 200, McCrometer, Inc., Aurora, NE, USA) that was used is compatible with the RTU and has a capacity to maintain an accuracy of within 2 % of rainfall up to 60 mm. ETgauge is an ET measurement device in the local field conditions. The electronic version of ETgauge (Model E, ETgauge Company, Loveland, CO, USA) was used. It has a performance accuracy of ± 1 % of evaporated water. The Watermark soil moisture sensors (Irrometer Co., Riverside, CA, USA) were used to measure soil matric potential (kPa) in each field and sensors were connected to Watermark monitor/dataloggers (model 900 M, Irrometer Co., Riverside, CA, USA) to log soil moisture data on an hourly basis. SMP data were converted to soil water content (%vol) using the soil-water retention curves developed by Irmak, 2019a, Irmak, 2019b for the research area soils for each field. Telemetry Gateway (Model A850, Adcon Telemetry, Austria) was used in the research (Picture 3). It forms the core of the data acquisition system as a base station. The Gateway acts as a network controller and at regular intervals (typically 15 min, but this can be changed) it requests data via modem from the RTUs in the field network. The Gateway also stores the incoming data in its memory, allowing it to supervise large numbers of RTUs and keep their data for a period of time before data are downloaded to a ProServer for long-term storage in a central database and for processing. One Telemetry Gateway (Model A850) can handle up to 1000 RTU field stations. Communication between the remote telemetry unit and the Telemetry Gateway is through cellular communication system's global system for mobile communication. This data acquisition system is run by the addVANTAGE Pro software (Adcon Telemetry, Vienna, Austria) which controls various functions in the RTUs and the Gateway (Picture 4). The software collects data from the Telemetry Gateways and makes it available for viewing or for specialized analysis. The server is responsible for downloading data from the Telemetry Gateway, storing into the database, starting and stopping raw data processing, and servicing clients as they connect to the system.

Meteorological data, field-specific measurements of soil matric potential, evaporative demand and precipitation Four agricultural weather stations were selected for the computation of reference and crop evapotranspiration. For this purpose, daily weather data from 2013 to 2015 at Brule Plate Valley, Champion, McCook, and Dickens sites were obtained from the High Plains Regional Climatic Center-Automated Weather Data Network (HPRCC-AWDN). The meteorological variables included in this dataset were maximum and minimum air temperatures, wind speed, relative humidity, and incoming shortwave radiation. The magnitudes of average growing season meteorological variables recorded at each site for the three growing seasons are presented in Table 2. Crop growing season was considered as May 1 to September 20, based on the most common historical planting and harvesting dates in the region.SMP in each field was measured on an hourly basis using Watermark granular matrix sensors installed at four depths in the root zone profile (30, 60, 90 and 120 cm). ETgauges were installed in five representative fields for site-specific reference ET measurements, designed to simulate ET from plant canopy in a way that closely mimics plant’s resistance to ET (Irmak et al., 2005a, Irmak et al., 2005b). Tipping-bucket rain gauges were also installed in these five representative fields for site specific precipitation data. Geographic Information System (GIS)-based tools were used to record, organize, and analyze these datasets geographically within the research area. The management practices adopted by individual growers which included crop type, acreage and cultivar information (maturity), planting and harvesting dates, seeding rate, tillage practices, fertilizer type and application, crop yield, etc. were obtained via personal communication with the producer partners.

Crop classification Information on the crop grown in the selected fields was obtained through the use of survey forms circulated and collected annually. Additionally, the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) provided by USDA-NASS was considered as an appropriate tool to collect crop type information. The CDL is a raster-based, geo-referenced, crop-specific land cover data layer created annually for the continental United States using moderate resolution satellite imagery and extensive agricultural ground truthing data. CDL-derived crop type data were verified against survey-collected crop type data, and a perfect agreement was found for available 51 field-year combinations, ensuring confidence in use of CDL data. The total number of fields planted with maize was 28 (90 %) in 2013; 24 (77 %) in 2014 and 21 (67 %) in 2015; and, soybean was 3 (10 %) in 2013; 7 (23 %) in 2014 and 7 (23 %) in 2015 (Table 3). Additionally, there were 3 (10 %) fields in 2015 cultivated with winter wheat. However, our analyses was limited to the fields growing maize and soybean, due to their dominance in the region.

Precipitation and site-specific reference evapotranspiration The precipitation data were obtained from three sources: NOAA-GHCN (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - Global Historical Climatology Network), HPRCC-AWDN and NeRAIN (Nebraska Rainfall Assessment and Information Network). Among these sources, 101 weather stations in 2013, 99 in 2014, and 96 in 2015 were selected to determine precipitation depth for spatial interpolation. A proportion of the selected weather station sites were outside the geographic boundary of the MRNRD, ensuring accurate interpolation along the borders. Inverse distance weighing (IDW) interpolation technique was implemented for spatial interpolation using the Spatial Analyst Toolset provided in ArcGIS 10.2 (ArcGIS 10.2, ESRI, Redlands, California). Interpolation resulted in 459 spatial datasets (rasters) of daily precipitation for the region across the research period, which were used to develop monthly and growing season total precipitation datasets and field-level daily, monthly and growing-season precipitation were extracted using GIS tools. Grass- and alfalfa-reference evapotranspiration (ETo and ETr) was estimated using the standardized American Society of Civil Engineers-Environmental and Water Resources Institute (ASCE-EWRI) Penman-Monteith (PM) equation (ASCE-EWRI-PM) (ASCE-EWRI, 2005). This equation requires four primary meteorological observations: air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation: (1) ETref = standardized reference crop evapotranspiration (mm d-1). Rn = net radiation at the reference surface (MJ m-2 d-1). G = soil heat flux density at the soil surface (MJ m-2 d-1, assumed to be zero for daily time step). T = mean daily air temperature at 2 m height (°C). u2 = daily wind speed at 2 m height (m s-1). es = vapor pressure at 2 m height (kPa). ea = mean actual vapor pressure at 2 m height (kPa). es-ea = vapor pressure deficit (VPD, kPa). Δ = slope of the saturation vapor pressure-temperature curve (kPa °C-1). γ = psychometric constant (kPa °C-1). Cn = constant that changes with the reference crop (1600 and 900 for ETr and ETo, respectively). Cd = denominator constant that changes with the reference crop (0.38 and 0.34 for ETr and ETo, respectively). Apart from the estimation of reference ET, efforts were made to measure reference ETo and data were telemetrically recorded at five of the selected fields using ETgauges. In this research, number 30 green canvas cover was used to simulate ETo. In order to prepare complete records and assess the robustness of ETgauge measurements, intercomparisons between ETgauge-measured (at field P2) and ASCE-EWRI-PM-estimated ETo (at Dickens HPRCC weather site) for three research years were made (Fig. 2). A strong agreement was observed among the measured and estimated ETo with a mean RMSE of 0.99 mm d-1 and R2 ranging from 0.78 to 0.88, indicating that estimated ETo can serve as a proxy for the measured ETo (or vice versa) with good accuracy for research fields/locations where ETgauges could not be deployed for more local reference ET measurements.

The solid black line represents 1:1 relationship. 2.5. Crop evapotranspiration ETc is the product of ETo and crop coefficient (Kc) (Eq. (2)), which is determined according to the crop type and the crop growth stage: (2) ETc = crop evapotranspiration (mm d-1). ETo= grass-reference evapotranspiration (mm d-1). Kc = crop coefficient. Kc differs for the different growth stages of the crop as well as varies with climate, soil, crop type and varieties, irrigation methods and management practices. The crop growth is generally divided into four stages: initial stage, crop-developmental stage, mid-season stage and late season stage. In this research, the crop coefficient curves (maize and soybean) were used as the function of days after planting (DAP) as shown in Fig. 3. These curves were measured and developed by the senior author (S. Irmak) in Nebraska as a part of the Nebraska Water and Energy Flux Measurement, Modeling and Research Network (NEBFLUX; Irmak, 2010) project. Developed polynomial equations were used in this research to calculate Kc values. For maize, the Kc values were 0.15–0.20 in the initial stage and extended up to 1.02 in the mid-season (July), again reducing to 0.48 in the late season. For soybean, the Kc values start with 0.20, increasing up to 0.94 in July and decreasing to 0.28 in the late season. The Kc values reported in Fig. 3 are generally within the range of values reported in the literature. Sharma and Irmak (2012a) used the same crop coefficient equations to determine long term (1986–2009) growing season (1 May to 30 September) ETc and net irrigation requirements. The actual plating dates were used for the fields for which the actual producer-reported data were available, which resulted in better field-specific estimations.

Soil-water balance Irrigation water requirement for each field site was calculated using a soil-water balance equation: (3) P = precipitation (mm). I = irrigation water requirement (mm). U = upward soil moisture flux (mm; assumed zero as the depth of the groundwater is approximately 33 m below the surface). Ron = surface run-on (mm; assumed zero). Roff = surface run-off (mm). D = deep percolation (mm) below the crop root zone. ΔSWS = change in soil water storage in the soil profile (mm) from the beginning to the end of the season. ETc = crop evapotranspiration. Total soil-water storage (SWS) was calculated for the effective root zone depth which was considered as 1.20 m for both maize and soybean. Predominant soil textural classes in selected fields were silt loam, loamy sand, sandy loam, and sand in 12, 4, 9, and 6 fields, respectively. The soil-water characteristic equations (Irmak, 2019a, Irmak, 2019b) were used to convert soil matric potential (SMP, kPa) to volumetric water content (VWC, %vol) for each soil and are presented below: (4) (5) (6) (7) The surface run-off from each field was estimated using the USDA-NRCS curve number method (USDA-NRCS, 1985). There were four different soil textures as discussed above and the maize and soybean were considered as straight row crops with good hydrologic condition. Curve number value for the sandy loam, loamy sand, and sand was used as 67. For silt loam, it was considered as 78. All calculations were done seasonally at each field site by solving Eq. (8) to calculate the irrigation water requirement (I) required for each field individually in each season: (8) 3. Results and discussions 3.1. Precipitation The magnitudes of mean growing season precipitation across the MRNRD for the years 2013–2015 are presented in Fig. 4. Growing season precipitation varied from 295 to 593 mm across the research region. The year 2013 was the driest with mean precipitation of 301 mm across all the research fields. The mean precipitation amounts in 2014 and 2015 were 423 mm and 418 mm, respectively. Maximum precipitation was recorded in field S3 (345 mm) in 2013, field P26 (546 mm) in 2014, and field G3 (508 mm) in 2015. The fields (G1, G2, G3, P16, P17, P23, P24, P25) with higher mean precipitation occurring in Frontier County, which lies in the eastern part of MRNRD (Fig. 4). Fields P26 and S1 lie in Red Willow County (southeastern part of MRNRD) and received highest precipitation in 2014.

Initiation, termination and length of irrigation season One of the most important decision in irrigation application is the onset and termination of the irrigation season. The start of irrigation in a season usually depends on the antecedent moisture availability in the soil profile and crop growth stage. The last irrigation of the season depends on the maturity stage of the crop, soil-water availability in the soil profile and evaporative demand. Since these factors are subject to change both spatially and temporally, it is expected that the timing of first and last irrigation events would also vary in different fields. Primarily, these dates depend on the management practices of the irrigator as well as the planting date and climate conditions. The planting dates varied from April 26 to May 21 between the research fields. The first and last irrigation in a season was tracked from the data communicated via the telemetry system for all three years. Fig. 6, Fig. 7 show the first and last irrigation, respectively, represented as days after planting (DAP). It was observed that the first irrigation varied from 4 to 82 DAP (Fig. 6). In 2013, 55 % (6 out of 11) producers irrigated from 50 to 60 DAP. 27 % of them irrigated from 41 to 44 DAP whereas two of them (fields P15 and S1) irrigated at 70 and 82 DAP, respectively. In 2014, three of them were irrigating at 45, 46 and 47 DAP, respectively. Field P26 was irrigated 4 DAP which was very early in the season whereas field P16 was irrigated on 65 DAP. In 2015, eight fields were irrigated first time on 38–54 DAP and the gravity field G1 was irrigated on 67 DAP. Similarly, the last day of irrigation was also observed for the same fields. The last day of irrigation in all the three years ranged from 112 (field G2) to 141 (field P3) DAP (Fig. 7), which is a duration of 49 days. Almost 90 % of the fields in 2013 terminated irrigations between 118 and 136 DAP, with the exception of field G2 in which irrigation was terminated 112 DAP. In 2014, the range was between 114 DAP and 135 DAP. In 2015, 78 % of the fields terminated irrigation season between 125 DAP to 131 DAP whereas fields P1 and P3 applied their last irrigation on 137 and 141 DAP respectively (Fig. 7).

Length of irrigation season, defined as the total number of days that water was pumped for the purpose of irrigation in a season. The number of fields selected in this analysis were 25 in 2013, 25 in 2014, and 22 in 2015 from the common period (May 1 to September 20) in all three years. The maximum and minimum length of irrigation season was observed in SDI-irrigated field S3 (86 days in 2015) and gravity field G2 (14 days in 2014) respectively (Fig. 8). A significant difference was observed in the length of irrigation season among the selected fields demonstrating the role of management practices, climatic variables, and irrigator’s decision-making in irrigation application. For example, In field S3, the length of irrigation season in 2015 was quite high as compared with 2013 and 2014 which increased the irrigation depth applied in 2015. However, the precipitation was 32 mm higher in 2015 than in 2013 and was 61 mm lower than in 2014. Hence, it was observed that precipitation timing or amount likely has little impact on the irrigator’s decision making. Instead, the observed differences in the initiation, termination, and length of irrigation season across fields that were even planted within the same time frame (last week of April to the first week of May) demonstrates the role of individual decision-making of the irrigator. This can vary almost arbitrarily across irrigators, most likely due to their time-share among other activities on the farm, such as fertilizer application, pesticide applications, fungicide application, tillage, and other soil and crop management practices.

Frequency distribution of irrigation applications In the research region, the crop planting dates usually range from the last week of April to the first week of May. Most producers planting at the same date with same or similar varieties would also need to irrigate at the same time, especially the ones experiencing the same distribution of precipitation and evaporative demand. Simultaneous irrigation application by a high proportion of producers not only results in high water abstractions from the aquifer, but also increases the energy demand at that particular time. It remains crucial to determine the peak water demand and its timing in a particular region for efficient allocation by the authorities. Fig. 9 shows the percentage of irrigation systems operating during each month of the growing season. It was observed that July and August were the months when the highest number of irrigation systems (70–90 %) were operational in all three years. However, in September, which is the last month of the growing season, 71 %, 45 % and 61 % of the systems were operating in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. The lowest number of irrigation systems that was in operation was in May due to early crop growth not requiring supplemental moisture other than contribution from stored crop root zone moisture from spring precipitation. In fact, there were no irrigation systems operating in 2013 in May and a small percentage in 2014 (23 %) and even smaller percentage (16 %) in 2015. On average of three years, most of the precipitation occurred in May (104 mm) and June (109 mm) and lowest occurred in July (55 mm), August (80 mm) and September (34 mm) when plant leaf area index and consequently, ETc rates are the highest.

Number of irrigation systems operating in each month of the growing season from the selected thirty-one systems. 3.4. Depth of irrigation applied The irrigation systems selected for irrigation depth calculations were 25 in 2013, 25 in 2014, and 22 in 2015. The information on crop type in each field and each season is presented in Table 3. The total water depths applied by all individual irrigators in each season are shown in Fig. 10 along with the mean annual allocated (moratorium) irrigation depth (black line) by MRNRD. The irrigation amount allocated to each irrigator in MRNRD is 1524 mm per five years or a annual mean allocated depth of 305 mm, assuming uniform annual distribution. There were considerable differences in irrigation applications between the fields for the same crop type and between the years for the same fields. In 2013, nine of the 25 CP fields were irrigated by approximately 300 mm or more, approaching the mean allocated depth. Gravity system fields were irrigated considerably more than the CP fields by about 90 mm in 2013. Field P9 was irrigated with 386 mm, which was the only CP field irrigated significantly higher than its neighbors as well as more than the annually allocated irrigation depth in 2013. However, about 40 % of the selected fields were irrigated less than 200 mm in 2013. The irrigation depth in gravity system field G2 was reduced to 345 mm in 2014 and 307 mm in 2015 as compared with 391 mm in 2013. However, in field G1, the irrigation was increased to 415 mm in 2015 as compared with 390 mm in 2013. In the CP fields in 2014, the irrigation depth was almost equal or more than the previous year. Field P9, P5 and P10 were irrigated the most with 398, 375 and 352 mm, respectively, in 2014. In 2015, irrigation depth in field P1 was about 500 mm, which was considerably higher than the previous two years and all other selected fields. However, most of the systems irrigated around or less than 300 mm in contrast to the field P9 for which the irrigation depth was around 400 mm in all the three consecutive years (Fig. 10). In SDI fields S1 and S3, the irrigation depth was 164 and 199 mm in 2013, and 208 and 195 mm in 2014, respectively, which was considerably less than the gravity and center pivot fields. There was no difference observed in irrigation depth due to the crop type planted in the research fields. The average irrigation depth was observed to be 243, 264 and 284 mm in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. There were 40 % of fields each year exceeding the mean annual allocated irrigation depth threshold. Download : Download high-res image (387KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10.

The black horizontal line represents the mean annual allocated (moratorium) irrigation depth by MRNRD, assuming uniform annual distribution of 1524 mm allocation per five years. 3.5. Evaporative demand and crop evapotranspiration (ETc) Daily ETr values in the growing period (April 27 to September 20) for each year are presented in Fig. 11. Daily ETr values of all the four stations were observed to be very similar to each other and the variability observed in seasonal ETr was not higher than the inter-annual variability observed at an individual site, indicating that ETr did not vary substantially across the MRNRD. Since computation of reference ET requires extensive climate data measurements and the region did not have adequate number/density of these measurement sites, the computation of field-scale ETr was not carried out. The black line in Fig. 11 represents the average ETr values of all four stations for the three consecutive growing seasons. The growing season total ETr for 2013, 2014 and 2015 was 1175, 1005 and 958 mm, respectively. The most probable reasons for the higher ETr in 2013 can be the warmer air temperatures, higher solar radiation, higher wind speed, higher vapor pressure deficit and lower relative humidity as compared with 2014 and 2015 (Table 2).

Average daily maize and soybean ETc along with standard deviation among the thirty-one fields for three research years is presented in Fig. 12. For maize, the growing season total ETc ranged from 676 to 756 mm in 2013; 615–659 mm in 2014; and 608–624 mm in 2015 with an average of 733, 648 and 621 mm in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. For soybean, the growing season total ETc ranged from 629 to 680 mm in 2013; 535–597 mm in 2014; and 544–571 mm in 2015 with an average of 663, 577 and 560 mm in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. On average, maize ETc was 10 % higher than the soybean ETc in all three years, similar to the results found in Sharma and Irmak (2012b) for the long-term (1986–2009) large-scale assessments for MRNRD area. ETc in 2013 was relatively higher than in 2014 and 2015 for both crops. The average ETc for maize in 2013 was 85 mm and 112 mm higher than those determined for 2014 and 2015, respectively. For soybean, average ETc was 86 mm and 103 mm higher in 2013 than in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The ETc variations observed within the fields were primarily due to the differences in the planting dates and the crop type as other parameters/variables were similar for all fields.

Daily crop (maize and soybean) evapotranspiration (ETc) calculated using the two-step approach along with standard deviation among the selected thirty-one fields from May 1 to September 20 for 2013, 2014 and 2015. 3.6. Calculated irrigation requirement vs. producers’ actual application The actual irrigation depth applied for each field was compared to the computed irrigation water requirements as estimated using two-step approach and the soil-water balance (Fig. 13) that used information and data obtained specifically for each field. In 2013, irrigation requirement was greater than irrigation applied in all fields, except field G2. In 2014 and 2015, irrigation applied exceeded the irrigation water requirements in 80 % of the fields. There were three fields in 2014 and in 2015, where irrigation requirement was more than actual amount of irrigation water applied. On average, irrigation requirement in maize fields were 394, 242 and 184 mm in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, whereas the average amount of irrigation water withdrawal was 267, 292 and 264 mm in the same years, respectively. Similarly, irrigation requirement in soybean fields was 307, 163 and 219 mm in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, whereas the average amount of water pumped was 234, 251 and 274 mm in the same years, respectively. It is observed that on average, maize irrigation requirement was 61 % and 47 % in 2014 and 2015, respectively, as compared with 2013 whereas irrigation applied was 109 % and 99 % in 2014 and 2015, respectively, as compared with 2013. Similarly, soybean irrigation requirement was 53 % and 71 % in 2014 and 2015, respectively, as compared with 2013 whereas irrigation applied was 107 % and 117 % in 2014 and 2015, respectively, as compared with 2013. The inter-annual variation in irrigation requirement was substantial, but it was relatively insignificant in irrigation application. Given the same site characteristics, irrigation requirement is mostly affected by environmental factors such as evaporative water demand (vapor pressure deficit), precipitation and stored soil-water. The magnitudes of these variables were considerably different between the three years which govern the magnitude of irrigation requirement. Ideally, the changes in irrigation requirement should be reflected in irrigation application by producers, provided that continuous and appropriate monitoring of soil moisture and/or crop water use is performed as these metrics will respond to the various factors governing plant water uptake. In contrast to this, our observations of irrigation application show that most producers did not consider following any established irrigation scheduling approach, resulting in suboptimal (greater or lower) amount of water being applied to their fields. For example, field P10 was under-irrigated (by 78 mm) in 2013 while it was over-irrigated by 70 mm in 2014 and by 105 mm in 2015. Field P3 was under-irrigated by 210, 104 and 35 mm in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. SDI-irrigated field S3 was under-irrigated by 170 mm in 2013 whereas it was over-irrigated by 73 and 42 mm in 2014 and 2015, respectively, indicating the need for implementing agricultural water management technologies and associated educational programs, training and demonstrations to enable optimum use of limited water resources and enhance crop water productivity.

Applied irrigation water vs. water allocation Fig. 14 shows the cumulative amount of water pumped in each field in three years along with the allocated water per five years as well as an annual mean allocated water, assuming uniform distribution of 305 mm per year. There were few fields that pumping more irrigation water than allocated in 2013, which increased in 2014. There were seven fields in 2015 which crossed the 3rd year mean allocated amount, with the field P9 almost pumping the fourth-year allocated amount. According to the trend observed in Fig. 14, it is expected that a reasonable proportion of fields would have exceeded the five-year allocated water depth in the region. Nevertheless, 70 % of the producers applied irrigation water well within their restricted water allocations. If producers pumped more than 305 mm of water per year for multiple years, they risk consuming their 5-year allocation sooners, which also risks not having enough (or any) water available for crop production in the 4th and/or 5th year, which can have significant negative consequences to farm income. Thus, implementing scientifically-based water management technologies and strategies to account for stored soil moisture and effective use of precipitation as well as implanting effective soil management practices (e.g., reduced till or no-till) can aid not only increasing crop water productivity, but can aid in ensuring the total allocated water amount can be used appropriately in a given year.

Summary and conclusions Field-specific irrigation water withdrawal and use data are essential for effective agricultural water management and for development of policies and regulations governing the use of water, predicting changes in water demand in response to changing climatic conditions, cropping systems and irrigation management scenarios. Good decision-making in irrigation water management is dependent upon data that can provide real-time information about crop water needs, irrigation applications, crop growth and development stage and weather patterns. Irrigation water-use data are also used to more effectively manage finite groundwater supplies in regions where surface and groundwater supplies are either over-appropriated (demand exceeds supply) or fully-appropriated (demand are supply are critically equal). The field-specific automated irrigation water use monitoring and data collection system deployed in this research provide real-time and site-specific metrics reflecting irrigation analytics and irrigator behavior throughout the growing season. Various metrics calculated from the obtained datasets such as initiation, termination, and length (duration) of irrigation season, irrigation application frequency and irrigation depth show that there can be substantial farm-to-farm heterogeneity even within relatively small irrigated regions. Thus, it is challenging to robustly benchmark regional water footprint and irrigator behavior across larger scales owing to the high degree of farm-to-farm variability, unaccounted variables (irrigation vs. other farm operations) that are used (or not used) for decision-making by irrigators. Surprisingly, it was also observed that irrigation depths estimated using scientifically-based and widely used procedures such as the two-step approach of computing ETc and site-specific soil-water balance showed little agreement with actual applied irrigation depths by the producers. Only few farms followed the trend of year-to-year and farm-to-farm variation captured in estimated irrigation depths. Monitoring and accounting for farm-specific evaporative demand, soil moisture and precipitation amounts did not lead to accurate representation of irrigator decisions. This observation is strong evidence that irrigation decisions by users are not backed by data and scientific protocols, and are largely driven by condition of crop, feel of soil, personal calendar schedule, neighbor practices, or no irrigation management protocol at al. Despite increase in technologies that can be used for agricultural water management decision-making, in this research, irrigator decisions did not seem to reasonably follow patterns of water use metrics like soil moisture and/or crop water use or evaporative demand. Thus, standard estimations of crop water footprint should be carefully assessed prior to representing actual water use across large regions. Our observations demonstrate the need for greater momentum for real-time monitoring of farm-level irrigation dynamics and their integrative reporting. Advances in Internet of Things (IoT) can be leveraged to connect these data-streams to effectively report, privately or publicly host, and utilize quantitative information on irrigation water use and irrigation behavior across agroecosystems. Automated water dynamics system deployed in this research can aid in more effectively planning and managing the quantity and distribution of limited water resources, especially in regions with pumping allocations.

  Explanation: This review summarizes the various methodologies and applications of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in analyzing and classifying hyperspectral images for agricultural purposes. Hyperspectral imaging is a non-destructive and contactless technology that provides valuable information about the structure and composition of an object. The high-dimensionality and large volume of hyperspectral data can make it challenging to process, analyze, and classify. 3D-CNNs are a type of deep learning model that have proven to be effective in handling such high-dimensional data.

The review highlights the challenges associated with using 2D-CNN and 1D-CNN models for hyperspectral image classification, including their inability to fully capture the spatial-spectral information present in the data. 3D-CNNs, on the other hand, can effectively utilize both the spatial and spectral dimensions of the data, resulting in more accurate and robust classification performance.

The review also emphasizes the need for further research in this area, particularly in developing techniques for handling the limited availability of labeled hyperspectral data, optimizing 3D-CNN models for computational efficiency, and reducing the cost of hyperspectral imaging hardware.

Abstract Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a non-destructive and contactless technology that provides valuable information about the structure and composition of an object. It has the ability to capture detailed information about the chemical and physical properties of agricultural crops. Due to its wide spectral range, compared with multispectral- or RGB-based imaging methods, HSI can be a more effective tool for monitoring crop health and productivity. With the advent of this imaging tool in agrotechnology, researchers can more accurately address issues related to the detection of diseased and defective crops in the agriculture industry. This allows to implement the most suitable and accurate farming solutions, such as irrigation and fertilization, before crops enter a damaged and difficult-to-recover phase of growth in the field. While HSI provides valuable insights into the object under investigation, the limited number of HSI datasets for crop evaluation presently poses a bottleneck. Dealing with the curse of dimensionality presents another challenge due to the abundance of spectral and spatial information in each hyperspectral cube. State-of-the-art methods based on 1D and 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) struggle to efficiently extract spectral and spatial information. On the other hand, 3D-CNN-based models have shown significant promise in achieving better classification and detection results by leveraging spectral and spatial features simultaneously. Despite the apparent benefits of 3D-CNN-based models, their usage for classification purposes in this area of research has remained limited. This paper seeks to address this gap by reviewing 3D-CNN-based architectures and the typical deep learning pipeline, including preprocessing and visualization of results, for the classification of hyperspectral images of diseased and defective crops. Furthermore, we discuss open research areas and challenges when utilizing 3D-CNNs with HSI data.

Introduction Plant diseases pose significant threats to global food production, with potential yield losses of up to 30% and substantial economic impact [56]. This can have a devastating impact on farmers and communities, particularly in low-income countries where access to food is already challenging. Precision agriculture and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) offer promising solutions for preventing crop damage and losses, ultimately contributing to efforts to promote sustainability and reduce the impact of diseases on food production. HSI, also referred to as imaging spectrometry, combines two distinct technologies, imaging and spectroscopy, to provide both spatial and spectral information, simultaneously. Spectral information can provide rich information about biochemical and biophysical attributes of the agricultural crops. This is due to the higher spectral resolution of hyperspectral sensors compared to multispectral and RGB ones. As a result, this feature can lead to better discrimination of objects of similar colors, higher accuracy in complex classifications, and the ability to predict chemical composition and provide information about the interior of an object [67]. However, the interpretation of spectral data can be complex, especially when analyzing and comparing multiple samples over extended periods. One approach to simplify spectral analysis is the usage of spectral indices. Spectral indices are mathematical expressions that combine several spectral bands into a single value, providing an easier representation of the data. For example, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) computes the ratio between Near Infrared (NIR) and Red (R) bands of hyperspectral channels as follows: (1) With the help of spectral indices, one can effectively identify trends and changes in the data without requiring an in-depth comprehension of the underlying scientific principles governing spectral data, thus enabling a simpler data analysis, enhancement of features, standardization, comparability, and calibration of data. In the agricultural industry, two common spectral indices are the already mentioned NDVI and the Green Chlorophyll Index (GCI). The former is used to monitor vegetation growth and health and the latter quantifies the amount of chlorophyll in plants. Further indices have been defined, usually in the context of remote sensing, to support research for example on agriculture, soil, vegetation, water and forestry. A comprehensive database of spectral indices that is searchable by application area and hyperspectral sensor is provided in Henrich et al. [24]. From a data-perspective, a hyperspectral image is a stack of images, known as a hyperspectral cube or a data cube. Each image of this cube represents the response of the imager to one of the distinct hyperspectral channels [5]. This is illustrated in Fig. 1. It shows a 3D data cube P with dimensions , where M and N represent the axes of spatial information and λ represents the spectral dimension [74]. In the hyperspectral cube, each pixel, given by its spatial coordinates, is a vector of length λ that indicates the reflected radiation of a specific part of the object.

It is a three-dimensional array where each pixel represents a spectrum containing a range of wavelengths. This spectrum can act as a fingerprint and provides information about biophysical and biochemical characteristics of the imaged object. The high-dimensionality of this data cube poses a challenge to traditional machine learning approaches, resulting in reduced accuracy due to their inability to extract complex features. Moreover, the performance of these approaches heavily depends on manual feature engineering. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been proven to achieve high classification accuracies in image classification tasks and to work well with the high-dimensionality of HSI data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of 3D-CNN-based models utilized in the classification of non-UAV-based hyperspectral images of diseased and defective crops. This review is intended to assist computer vision experts and agriculture-domain researchers seeking to address HSI classification tasks for crops under stress. The paper is organized as follows. In the following Section, we outline the investigation protocol used in this review. In Section 3, we briefly describe the structure of CNNs and their most important concepts. Following the typical data pipeline associated with CNNs, Sections 4 to 7 review data preprocessing, band and feature selection, network architecture design, and data visualization. This provides a convenient overview of its individual steps for plant classification problems using 3D-CNNs. Finally, Section 8 highlights the research gaps and limitations associated with the application of 3D-CNNs for HSI data classification. 2.

Moreover, the review explores the use of 3D-CNN-based architectures for identifying specific defects in crops, such as decay in blueberries [52], bruise and brown spots in fruits [50], [28], heat stress in rice [19], as well as black, fermented, shell, and broken coffee defects in beans [13]. By harnessing the power of 3D-CNN-based models, we can effectively address challenges of classifying diseased and defective using hyperspectral images. This can result in the preservation of product quality, prevention of yield losses, and ensuring food safety standards. 3. CNN structure and concepts A CNN is comprised of a series of layers each consisting of several neurons. As shown in Fig. 2, each layer is the input for the next layer in the network. Key building blocks of a CNN are convolution layers, detector layers, and pooling layers. A convolution layer uses convolutional kernels to extract low-dimensional features from the input data while preserving the spatial relationship between the input data pixels. Fig. 3 depicts the movement directions of 1D (spectral), 2D (spatial), and 3D (spatial-spectral) kernels within the hypercube. A detector layer applies a non-linear function like Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) to learn non-linear representations. Pooling layers make features invariant by reducing the dimensionality of data.

Download : Download high-res image (48KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Movement direction of convolution process using 1D, 2D, and 3D kernels in hypercube. A schematic overview of movement directions for (a) 1D, (b) 2D, and (c) 3D convolutions in CNNs over hypercube is shown. The X and Y directions indicate the movement of the kernel across the spatial dimensions, and Z direction shows the movement across the spectral dimension. Classification methods based on 1D-CNN (spectral feature-based) and 2D-CNN (spatial feature-based) cannot efficiently classify hyperspectral data as neither utilizes spatial and spectral features together. However, a 3D-CNN can extract spatial-spectral features from the volumetric data. This is due to its ability to incorporate the spectral dimension in addition to the spatial dimensions, which enables it to model and learn more complex spatiotemporal representations. On the flipside, a straightforward generalization of kernels to their 3-dimensional versions increases the number of operations that must be performed to apply a kernel by a factor of l. Not only the application of these kernels is computationally more costly, but also their training becomes more challenging, as the kernel has more parameters. Taking no other model-changes into account (as, for example in Qiao et al. [52]) we would have to shorten kernel-sides by to keep computational complexity at roughly the same level. In the following, a description of previous review papers that deal with the topics of CNNs, hyperspectral data, and applications in agriculture and plant research is given. The work of Signoroni et al. [63] is aimed at domain professionals seeking comprehensive insights into the integration of hyperspectral acquisition techniques and deep learning architectures for specific tasks across diverse application domains. This resource caters to machine learning and computer vision experts, offering a nuanced understanding of how deep learning technologies are tailored to effectively process and analyze hyperspectral data, keeping them up-to-date with the latest advancements. In Jiang and Li [29] an examination of how different CNN architectures have been employed in the assessment of plant stress, plant development, and postharvest quality. This review categorizes the studies according to the technical advancements achieved in terms of imaging classification, object detection, and image segmentation. As a result, it highlights cutting-edge solutions for specific phenotyping applications, offering valuable insights into the current state of the field. An overview of state-of-the-art CNN models and visualization techniques for disease diagnosis in plants is given in Joseph et al. [31]. The review given in Gill et al. [21] delves into the plant stress phenotyping, specifically examining the utilization of machine learning and deep learning methodologies. The study encompasses a wide range of high throughput phenotyping platforms, exploring the integration of data from diverse sources. However, it does not discuss 3D-CNN architectures. Finally, a review paper that combines all three topics was provided in Wang et al. [80]. In that work, the authors provide an overview of the application of hyperspectral imaging in agriculture, encompassing areas such as ripeness and component prediction, classification themes, and plant disease detection. Additionally, the study examines recent advancements in hyperspectral image analysis specifically in the context of deep learning models. The review not only highlights the achievements in this field but also outlines the existing challenges associated with deep learning-based hyperspectral image analysis. Moreover, the study presents future prospects and potential directions for further research in this domain. In this review, we update and complement the paper of Wang et al. [80] with a particular focus on 3D-CNNs and the entirety of the process of creating a high-performant model, including preprocessing of data, band selection, exploration of model architectures, and data visualization. A deep learning pipeline for HSI classification typically consists of several stages, including data preprocessing, band and feature selection, model design, model training, testing, and evaluation (see Fig. 4). Data preprocessing involves enhancing the quality of raw HSI data, for example, through noise removal, radiometric calibration, and dimension reduction. Feature extraction transforms the raw data into a new space of features, which is expected to be more discriminative for the classification task. Band selection defines a subset of the original spectral bands that is the most relevant for the classification task. Model design is the configuration of hyperparameters of the CNN model, for example, the number and sequence of convolutional layers and dense layers, the activation functions to be used, and the usage of dropout or skip connections. During the training step, the model is optimized by iteratively adjusting its internal parameters (weights and biases) to minimize the error between its predicted output and the actual output on the input data. Finally, the model is evaluated to learn patterns and relationships in the data and to make accurate predictions on new unseen data. Download : Download high-res image (90KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Typical deep learning pipeline for HSI data classification. First, the discriminative features and bands are extracted from preprocessed HSI dataset of crop. Then, the dataset is split to training, validation, and testing sets. The training dataset is used to train the 3D-CNN model, the validation dataset is employed to assess the model's performance and fine tune its parameters, and the testing dataset serves to evaluate the final performance and generalization ability of the trained 3D-CNN model on unseen data. 4. Data preprocessing Data preprocessing is a critical step in hyperspectral data analysis, aimed at optimizing the quality and quantity of the data. This step enhances the suitability of the data for downstream tasks such as classification and feature extraction. Preprocessing techniques include patch extraction, radiometric correction and calibration, smoothing, dimension reduction, and background removal. Data augmentation also falls under preprocessing and has the goal of increasing the volume of training data. 4.1. Patch extraction Patch extraction is a technique that involves dividing an image into smaller images or patches. In the context of HSI, patch extraction has significant advantages for efficient and targeted analysis of specific regions of interest within an image. By extracting image patches that contain pixels with similar properties, researchers can focus their analysis on areas of the image that are most relevant to diseased or defective areas. To give a concrete example, Nagasubramanian et al. [45] utilized patch extraction to analyze hyperspectral images of soybean crops. In their study, they extracted spatial patches of size 64×64×240 from an original image of size 500×1600×240, where the first two dimensions define the spatial resolution of the image and 240 denotes the number of spectral bands. By analyzing the properties of pixels within these patches, they were able to extract features that were more representative of the target disease which ultimately improved the accuracy and efficiency of their analysis. Furthermore, patch extraction helps to expand the number of images when there is a lack of data. It also reduces computational time, as processing hyperspectral images of large sizes can be computationally demanding [51], [28]. 4.2. Data augmentation Imbalanced and scarce data is a common problem in many machine learning applications (see, for example, [1]) and HSI is no exception. Imbalanced data, a special case of data scarcity, refers to the situation where the number of samples in each class or category of the data is not evenly distributed. This can lead to a bias towards the overrepresented classes in the analysis results, which is particularly problematic if the minority class is of interest. To address imbalanced HSI data, one common approach is resampling [47], which involves either oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class to balance the class distribution. Resampling can be done randomly or using more advanced techniques such as Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) [12] or Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) sampling [23]. Other widespread data augmentation approaches include transformation techniques such as mirroring [42], rotation [42], [13], horizontal and vertical flipping [13], [50], and color jittering [50]. Along with above-mentioned methods, patch extraction (Section 4.1) can also be used to address imbalance HSI dataset. 4.3. Radiometric calibration and correction Radiometric calibration is an essential step in the accurate operation of hyperspectral cameras. It aims to establish a quantitative relationship between the response of the camera sensor (the radiation sensor) and the actual reflectance (radiation level) of an object in a given environment. The calibration process involves assigning a “true” value for either radiation intensity or reflectance to the digital numbers given by the camera that represent recorded outputs for each pixel and spectral channel. To that end, calibrated reflectance standards are utilized, which usually consist of a matte Lambertian reflecting surface to ensure that reflected light is uniform in all directions [60]. The calibration process is then performed as follows: After selecting a radiation source that emits a known type and amount of radiation, the detector is placed in close proximity to the source to measure the radiation. Next, using calibration factors provided by the manufacturer or based on known mathematical formulas (see, for example, [51]) for the particular detector, the expected response of the detector is determined. The measured response of the detector is then aligned with the expected response based on the known radiation level using calibration factors. This calibration process should be repeated periodically with different radiation sources to ensure the continued accuracy and reliability of the detector's measurements. Even with calibration performed, hyperspectral cameras are susceptible to radiometric errors that can arise from a variety of sources, including sensor drift, electronic interference, light source, and data transmission and recording issues. For example, one of the common radiometric errors which relates to the camera's sensor is stripping. Each sensor consists of multiple individual detectors that sometimes do not function properly due to being out of calibration. Consider a push broom (along-track) camera where its sensor has multiple detectors aligned in a row. When one of them is calibrated slightly different from the adjacent detector the striping effect can occur. In this case, lines predominantly consisting of varying shades of dark and bright pixels formed. Radiometric correction can register and rectify incorrect pixel brightness. To achieve this, a series of procedures are employed including noise correction, de-striping, line-dropout correction [17], and black and white image correction [19], [10], [13], [28]. Fig. 5(b) shows the calibrated hyperspectral image of lettuce using the following computation, (2) where, Raw HSI Data is the image taken by the hyperspectral camera without modification, Dark Ref is the image captured by closing the camera's lens, and the White Ref is the imaged white reference with even and maximum reflectance across the spectral range.

Smoothing Smoothing, also known as filtering, is a technique in HSI to improve the quality of the data by reducing noise and artifacts and enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of the data. This technique in HSI can be broadly classified into two categories: spatial smoothing and spectral smoothing. Spatial smoothing techniques selectively smooth out certain features in an image by applying filters that amplify or attenuate certain spatial frequencies [17]. Common spatial smoothing techniques include Gaussian filtering, mean filtering [54], median filtering, bilateral filtering [9], and anisotropic diffusion filtering [39]. Spectral smoothing techniques operate on the spectral domain of an HSI image by smoothing the intensity values of neighboring spectral bands. As in spatial smoothing the goal is to remove noise [77], reduce artifacts, and enhance features in the image. Common spectral smoothing techniques include moving average filtering [77], Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering [78], Fourier filtering, wavelet filtering, and principal component analysis (PCA). For example, Cao et al. [10] eliminated the random noise that was present in the spectral data of the different region of interests (ROIs) using SG filtering. The filtering process makes it easier to identify the true signal of the sample and remove interference caused by size and structure differences between the ROIs. Similarly, Jung et al. [33] and Jia et al. [28] used a SG filter to smooth out the spectral data and reduce the effect of noise. As Vaiphasa [77] points out, care must be taken when applying smoothing techniques. The subjective selection of smoothing filters in hyperspectral remote sensing studies can negatively impact the statistical properties of the spectral data, which can, in turn, affect subsequent analyses. To preserve the statistical properties of the HSI data, the selection of smoothing filters should be done through a comparative t-test method that identifies the filter with the least statistical disturbances. By using this approach, it is possible to mitigate the negative effects of smoothing filters and ensure the reliability of subsequent analyses based on statistical class models. 4.5. Dimension reduction The large number of spectral bands within hyperspectral data often makes it challenging to process and analyze HSI data. Dimensionality reduction techniques retain relevant information, while allowing the model to work on smaller hypercubes downstream. These techniques are split into linear and non-linear ones. 4.5.1. Linear techniques Linear dimension reduction in HSI refers to a set of statistical and machine learning techniques that aim to find a lower-dimensional linear manifold in the high-dimensional space that captures the essential spectral information of the data [35]. By embedding the data into this lower-dimensional linear space, the dimensionality of the data is reduced while preserving as much of the spectral information as possible. PCA and Random Forest (RF) are two examples of this technique, and demonstrations of both can be seen in Cao et al. [10]. The process of PCA involves first zero-centering the input spectral matrix (i.e., the matrix of the spectral bands) and computing its covariance matrix. Next, the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are calculated, and the eigenvalues are sorted in descending order. The top k eigenvalues are then selected and the corresponding eigenvectors space computed. The k-dimensional data is obtained by projecting the original spectral matrix into the new space using the selected eigenvectors. On the other hand, an RF evaluates the importance of each wavelength by randomly replacing it and measuring its effect on the accuracy of the thus trained CNN model. To accomplish this, the RF builds many decision trees, and each tree is trained on a different subset of the data. The algorithm calculates the importance score for each wavelength by measuring the change in the prediction error rate before and after randomly replacing the wavelength in the out-of-bag data. The wavelength with the highest importance score is selected, and this process is repeated until the desired number of wavelengths is achieved. The dimensionality of the hyperspectral data is thus reduced, while retaining the most important information for accurate predictions. Further linear algorithms for dimension reduction of HSI data are described in Fırat et al. [18] and encompass Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and PCA-based algorithms like Incremental PCA (IPCA), Sparse PCA (SPCA), and Randomized PCA (RPCA). 4.5.2. Non-linear techniques Non-linear techniques can handle data with complex and non-linear structures. Yang et al. [83] classified these techniques into Kernel-based and manifold learning [83]. Kernel-based techniques, like Kernel PCA (KPCA), use non-linear mappings to transform data into higher-dimensional feature spaces first on which linear techniques can be applied. Manifold learning algorithms, on the other hand, aim to directly discover the intrinsic non-linear structure of data. See Khodr and Younes [35] for well-known manifold learning techniques, including Isometric Feature Mapping (Isomap), Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), Local Tangent Space Alignment (LTSA), Diffusion Maps, Sammon's Mapping (SM), and Locality Preserving Projections (LPP). 4.6. Background removal The data captured in hyperspectral images contains both foreground, called the ROI, and background objects. In scenarios where the target object does not cover the entire scanning area the signals from background objects can interfere with the data analysis, i.e., the background can contain noise that needs to be filtered out [78]. This is especially true when dealing with images that exhibit color gradients. By masking the background from the data, researchers can focus on the spectral signature of the ROI. This leads to improved target detection in classification task. It also reduces the computational complexity of subsequent processing steps including the training 3D-CNN models [51]. There are various traditional techniques to extract he ROI from the hyperspectral image. These techniques can be classified into several categories based on their underlying principles and are discussed separately below. 4.6.1. Spectral similarity-based methods These methods work based on the similarity between the spectra of the pixels within an image. Examples of such methods include Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) [37] and Spectral Information Divergence (SID) [53]. SAM computes the spectral angle (3) between the target reference spectrum R and each pixel spectrum T for all spectral bands λ in the hyperspectral image. This results in a similarity measure that is insensitive to illumination variations [2]. On the other hand, SID works based on the concept of information theory (entropy). It compares the spectral information content of each pixel to a reference spectral information content. In general, SAM is better suited for well-defined spectral variations and low background noise, while SID is more robust to complex background noise and illumination variations. 4.6.2. Statistical-based methods These methods leverage statistical techniques to identify ROIs that share similar spectral properties and produce a set of uncorrelated components capturing different aspects of spectral variability within the image. For example, Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) [43] is specifically designed to reduce the impact of noise in the data by separating the noise and signal components of the HSI data. This makes it particularly useful for operating on noisy HSI data but at the expense of more computational time. Another technique, ICA (see Section 4.5.1), aims to separate the mixed signals into their independent components, providing a more flexible approach to identify subtle spectral differences between ROIs. Finally, PCA [13] decomposes the original HSI data into orthogonal components that represent the directions of maximum variance in the data. In general, PCA is computationally more efficient than ICA and MNF, as it involves a simpler mathematical transformation that uses standard matrix operations. 4.6.3. Spatial-based methods These methods exploit the spatial correlation present in the image to differentiate between pixels within and outside the ROI. Typically, these methods apply morphological operations or spatial filtering techniques to extract features such as edges or texture, which are then used to segment the image into ROIs. The Morphological Attribute Profile (MAP) [14] and the Spatial-Spectral Endmember Extraction (SSEE) algorithm [49] are examples of spatial-based methods that use mathematical morphology and spatial filtering, respectively. SSEE first identifies the endmembers, or pure spectral signatures, present in the HSI data, and then uses a spatial clustering algorithm to group adjacent pixels with similar spectral properties into ROIs. On the other hand, MAP applies a series of morphological opening and closing operations to the image to identify connected regions of pixels with similar morphological attributes, such as size and shape. These connected regions can then be used as ROIs. These methods are computationally efficient and can be useful in scenarios where spectral information alone is not sufficient for accurate ROI extraction, such as in cases of low spectral contrast or high noise levels. 4.6.4. Hybrid methods These methods combine techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the ROI extraction process. One approach can be combining statistical-based techniques such as PCA, ICA, or MNF with spatial-based techniques such as MAP or SSEE. For example, by combining MAP and PCA we can exploit both the spatial and spectral information [70] in the HSI data for ROI extraction. These hybrid methods can be effective in cases where neither spatial nor spectral methods alone are sufficient for accurate ROI extraction. 4.6.5. Machine learning-based methods Machine learning algorithms can also be used to extract the ROI. This process involves training a model using labeled data to identify and extract regions with specific spectral characteristics. Once trained, the model can be used to predict the presence of those characteristics in unlabeled data and extract ROIs. This procedure is computationally efficient and allows for the extraction of subtle and complex patterns that may not be easily identifiable through traditional methods. Some instances of such techniques are Support Vector Machines (SVM) [6], RF [7], and CNN [40], [79]. 4.6.6. Software-assisted manual annotation Manual definition of the ROI can be assisted by software specifically built to handle HSI data. Amongst these are for example ENVI [38] and Spectronon [55] as commercial products, as well as the MATLAB Hyperspectral toolbox. Examples for open-source and free software are SeaDAS [46], the Orfeo ToolBox [11], and RSGISLib [8]. These packages provide HSI data analysis for a wide range of tasks discussed before. An example of software-assisted annotation is the work of Jin et al. [30] in which the authors generated an ROI using ENVI by manually selecting the tissues or areas of interest in the false color images of HSI data. Researchers can utilize such software in addition to the above discussed algorithms. For example, Gao et al. [19] developed an open-source software which is specifically designed for analyzing HSI data of seeds. It is able to remove the background of the HSI data and produces a binary mask using a user-defined minimum and maximum intensity threshold along with a component-searching algorithm. The results are an accurate segmentation of the seeds even when they overlap. 5. Band and feature selection The selection of spectral bands in HSI is another crucial preprocessing step for classification tasks. It entails the identification of a subset of the most discriminative spectral bands from all available bands. This process is instrumental in reducing data dimensionality by eliminating redundant bands, thereby significantly reducing the computational overheads of downsteam tasks. Furthermore, the careful selection of spectral bands can also reduce the effects of noise in the data. In general, based on the survey of Sun and Du [71], band selection mechanisms can be categorized into six groups as follows (another classification of methods is presented in Sawant and Prabukumar [58]). 5.1. Ranking-based selection Ranking-based band selection methods evaluate the significance of each spectral band based on a predetermined criterion and choose the most important bands in a sorted order. These methods can be categorized into two types: supervised and unsupervised. In supervised ranking-based methods, labeled training samples are utilized to determine the importance of each spectral band, while in unsupervised ranking-based methods, statistical properties of the data are used for the same purpose. One example of such method is spectral differentiation. Qi et al. [51] employed first and second order differentiation to decrease the computational complexity of HSI data containing 204 bands. The first derivative can effectively pinpoint areas in the spectrum where the rate of change is highest. This indicates the presence of sharp spectral features such as absorption or emission lines. Moreover, it allows for the selection of bands that capture these features and thus, provide critical information for classification or detection tasks. The second derivative is useful for identifying regions of the spectrum where the rate of change of the first derivative is highest, signifying the presence of spectral curvature. The selection of bands that capture the shape of the spectral signature, based on this information, can enhance the differentiating power in classification or detection tasks. Likewise, Jung et al. [33] achieved an increase in accuracy using spectral differentiation and expansion of the input in the vertical direction of the raw data. This technique was applied in addition to SG smoothing (see Section 4.4) to further improve data quality. 5.2. Searching-based selection Searching-based band selection methods involve the creation of a criterion function such as Euclidean distance and Bhattacharyya distance [26] to evaluate the performance of each spectral band based on a specified optimization objective. The first step involves creating an initial subset of bands, followed by an assessment of the criterion function for the subset. The next step is applying a searching strategy to identify the best subset of bands that maximizes the criterion function, and evaluating the selected subset based on data classification performance. This iterative process continues until the desired level of performance is reached. Searching-based methods largely depend on the quality of the criterion function and the optimization strategy employed. Incremental searching [81], [57], updated searching [20], [62], and eliminating searching [68] are among the commonly utilized strategies. 5.3. Clustering-based selection Clustering-based methods for hyperspectral band selection group bands into clusters and select representative bands from each cluster to create a final subset. These algorithms can be unsupervised [27], [82], supervised [44] or semisupervised [66], [65]. The selection of representative bands is typically performed using information measurements, such as mutual information or Kullback–Leibler divergence. Commonly used clustering techniques are K-means, affinity propagation, and graph clustering. K-means selects the best cluster centers that minimize the sum of distances to a set of putative center candidates. Affinity propagation selects exemplars by considering the correlation or similarity among bands and the discriminative capability of each band. 5.4. Sparsity-based selection Sparsity-based techniques for band selection rely on sparse representation or regression to identify representative bands. The most common of these methods are discussed separately below. 5.4.1. Sparse nonnegative matrix factorization-based methods These methods [41] break down the hypercube into a set of building blocks, which are both nonnegative and sparsely encoded. This promotes a feature extraction process that combines these building blocks to create a parts-based representation of the original data. The goal of this method is to identify the most informative bands of the HSI data matrix by optimizing an objective function that includes sparsity constraints. 5.4.2. Sparse representation-based methods Sparse representation-based methods [86], [72] use pre-defined or learned dictionaries to select informative bands of the HSI data matrix based on their sparse coefficients. These methods rank the bands according to the frequency of their occurrence in the sparse coefficient histograms. In some cases, sparse representation-based methods can also be designed to solve multiple tasks simultaneously, and an immune clonal strategy can be used to search for the best combinations of informative bands. 5.4.3. Sparse regression-based methods Sparse regression-based techniques [69], [15] transform the band selection problem into a regression problem and estimate the most representative bands by solving a sparse regression problem. These methods can also include sparsity constraints to encourage the selection of only the most informative bands for the regression model. 5.5. Embedding-learning based selection Embedding-learning based methods aim to learn a low-dimensional representation of the spectral data, also known as an embedding, that captures the most salient features of the data. There are several types of embedding learning-based methods that can be used for band selection, including autoencoders [75], Deep Neural Networks (DNN) [87], and CNNs [61]. Autoencoders learn a compact representation of the input data by training a neural network to encode the input into a lower-dimensional space and then decode it back into the original space. DNN, on the other hand, consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. This architecture enables the network to learn complex patterns and features in a hierarchical manner, empowering it to extract high-level representations from the input data. Meanwhile, CNNs can learn spatially invariant features from image data. These techniques aim to learn a set of parameters that minimize an objective function that measures the model's performance on a particular task, such as classification or target detection. Band selection is integrated into the optimization process by constraining the learning algorithm to focus on a subset of the available bands, or by assigning weights to each band that reflect its relevance to the task at hand. The resulting model can then be utilized to predict the class label of new samples or to detect the presence of specific targets in the image. For example, Chen et al. [13] employed a DNN based binary classification to identify the foreground and background regions of the HSI data. Subsequently, connected component labeling algorithms and edge contours were used to isolate the ROI from the image for further analysis. Moreover, Jia et al. [28] implemented a CNN-based band selection module that works based on a group convolution technique, which involves applying a 1×1 one-dimensional convolution (equivalent to a scalar multiplication) to each band of the input hyperspectral image independently. This technique helps to overcome the problem of mutual interference between different channels. The weights of the convolutional kernel are updated in the early stage of the network training using a loss function and an auxiliary classifier (see also the next Section 6). The weights represent the importance of each band, with a higher absolute value of weight indicating greater importance of the corresponding band. 5.6. Hybrid-scheme based selection Hybrid-scheme based methods involve combining multiple band selection techniques to select the most appropriate bands. A popular combination is clustering and ranking [84], [16], where clustering is used to group bands and ranking is used to select the most important bands within each cluster. Other hybrid methods combine clustering with searching or combine ranking with searching to further optimize band selection. 6. Network architecture design: feature extraction and classification The objective of neural network architecture design is to create a model that can effectively learn from the input data and generalize well to new, unseen data. In order to achieve this for HSI classification, a network architecture must be developed that can capture the complex spectral and spatial information present in the data. As an integral aspect of designing a neural network, the decision of the number of layers to use is a crucial one. While the inclusion of more layers in a network has been shown [76], [32] to improve performance, it can simultaneously present several challenges. A notable challenge arises from the potential occurrence of vanishing or exploding gradients [73], where the gradient signal becomes too small or too large as it backpropagates through the layers during training (see also Subsection 6.2.1). Such a phenomenon makes it difficult for the network to learn and adjust its weights effectively. Moreover, as the number of layers and parameters increases, the risk of overfitting rises, which is characterized by the network's ability to perform exceptionally well on the training data, but not generalize well on unseen data. Consequently, the network may become computationally expensive to train and use due to its high processing power and memory requirements. Additionally, gradient computation time increases, thereby impeding the training's efficiency. Hence, careful consideration of these challenges and trade-offs is imperative to designing a network that balances complexity and performance. For this review, we classified 3D-CNNs into hybrid and non-hybrid structures. A network is hybrid if it includes either specific module(s) that improve feature extraction, accuracy, and performance or if it integrates 2D-CNN within the 3D-CNN architecture. In the following, we present 3D-CNN models for the classification of diseased and defected crop using HSI data. A summary of these architectures is also given in Table 1, Table 2. 6.1. Non-hybrid networks Nagasubramanian et al. [45] presented a 3D-CNN model to classify healthy and diseased crop. This model consists of two convolution layers with max pooling layers, and two Fully Connected (FC) layers, trained using the Adam optimizer. To prevent overfitting, dropout mechanisms were used after the first max pooling and first FC layer. A Weighted Binary Cross Entropy (WBCE) function of the form (4) was implemented to address imbalanced training data. Here y and represent binary variables for whether the ground truth and predicted result belong to a given class, respectively (see also Section 4.2 for a discussion on how to counteract imbalances in datasets). Using the coefficient β the WBCE loss function assigns higher weights to the minority class, for example, the false negatives rate decreases if β is set higher than 1, while setting it smaller than 1 reduces the false positive rate. Although the above technique can classify and detect diseased crop, detection of asymptomatic diseased crops at early stage and differentiating it from the healthy crops can be more challenging. In this respect, Jung et al. [33] developed a 3D-CNN model that improves classification accuracy of the asymptomatic diseased crop without modification and preprocessing of input HSI data. The model consists of four 3D convolution layers in which the first and fourth layers each are followed by a 3D max pooling layer and a batch normalization. The rest of the convolution layers are only followed by batch normalization. The output of the last 3D convolution layer is passed through a global average pooling and two dense layers. In Jung et al. [33] the results were improved further by preprocessing the input HSI data which went through spectral differentiation, vertical expansion, and smoothing. Automating the classification procedure of HSI data using software can effectively mitigate the time-consuming process of implementing a deep learning pipeline. In this respect, Gao et al. [19] developed an open-source software that classifies seeds at pixel level using 3D-CNN. Though at first it was developed for a specific crop (rice), the test experiments over other seeds are promising. This software utilizes a 3D-CNN that consists of two 3D convolution layers, with two and four 3D convolution kernels for the first and second layers, respectively. The output is then flattened via one FC layer and classification is performed using a softmax function. However, this software as part of its feature extraction process does not consider the global feature relationship which can improve its ability to recognize and classify seeds accurately. Nguyen et al. [47] implemented a 3D-CNN for classification of a small size dataset. The feature extraction part is implemented based on AlexNet [36] and constitutes 5 convolutional layers followed by a flattening layer. The input layer takes an input of size 512×512×203, where 203 stands for number of bands. The first two convolutional layers are followed by a max pooling layer and a batch normalization. After that each convolutional layer is followed by a max pooling layer and after the last max pooling layer batch normalization and flattenings is applied before feeding the result into a RF or SVM for binary classification (healthy or diseased crop). 6.2. Hybrid networks 6.2.1. 3D-CNN architectures based on ResNet To address the challenges of vanishing or exploding gradients Qiao et al. [52] proposed to leverage residual convolutional blocks within a 3D deep ResNet architecture. This approach reduces the number of channels through the use of identity residual blocks and a convolutional residual blocks. The identity residual block maintains the same input and output dimensions, while the convolutional residual block changes the number of channels. The use of a l×l×l convolution kernel as the shortcut in the convolutional residual block reduces the number of parameters and computational complexity. To further improve efficiency, Qiao et al. [52] adopt a bottleneck structure, that reduces the number of required convolution operations. Each convolutional layer is followed by a batch normalization layer to prevent vanishing gradient and enhance convergence rate. The network uses Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) as the non-linear activation function, which addresses the problem of dying neurons in ReLU. In order to identify the appropriate hyperparameters, the authors employed a Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) as an optimization algorithm. The TPE utilizes a probabilistic model to approximate the distribution of the objective function and guides the search for optimal hyperparameters. For the classification, a 7×7×1 global pooling layer and a FC are utilized. This model halves the number of parameters and improves the computational time up to 10%. Moreover, the study of Pourdarbani et al. [50] over performance of well-known architectures in detection of defective crop demonstrates that residual connections achieve higher accuracy, while training faster despite having more parameters. 6.2.2. Hypernet-PRMF network Liu et al. [42] presented a feature pre-extraction and a multi-feature fusion block to extract peanut characteristics from hyperspectral data. The feature pre-extraction includes constructing a Peanut Recognition Index (PRI) based on two informative bands to distinguish healthy, moldy, and damaged peanuts. The multi-feature fusion block is a technique used in image segmentation to fully extract spatial and spectral features from HSI data. This technique involves using multiple types of convolution kernels including 2D convolution for common texture features, separable convolution for increased feature diversity, depthwise convolution for band feature extraction, and 3D convolution for spectral change information. The convolutions are concatenated after normalization and activation functions to enhance diversity and improve recognition accuracy. Moreover, the authors employed feature pre-extraction and multi-feature fusion block techniques in their proposed peanut recognition model, called Hypernet-PRMF network. This model works at both peanut- and pixel-level recognition. The model consists of four parts: feature pre-extraction, down-sampling, up-sampling, and prediction. The feature pre-extraction part enhances the differentiation between different peanut features. The down-sampling part reduces the size of the image while increasing the number of convolution kernels, whereas the up-sampling part reconstructs the image while reducing the number of convolution kernels. The prediction works based on the softmax function and the class of maximum predicted probability is chosen as the final recognition result. The model achieves pixel-wise recognition accuracy with the use of the watershed segmentation algorithm. This technique has the potential to be employed for detection of other crops like sorghum. 6.2.3. Spectral dilated convolution 3D-CNN Cao et al. [10] proposed a spectral dilated convolution (SDC)-3D-CNN model to detect crop's asymptomatic diseases at an early stage. This model consists of SDC modules along with residual blocks that prevent the gradient vanishing problem. SDC extends the idea of dilated convolution which expands the receptive field of convolution kernels without augmenting the model's parameterization. Receptive field is the portion of the input space needed to create a filter at any convolutional layer. The 3D-SDC extends the receptive field of convolutional kernels to the spectral dimension. It works based on the principle of applying a filter to an input with intermittent intervals, which are dictated by the spectral dilation rate. The network was tested with top 50, 100, 150, and 200 significant wavelengths extracted by RF and Principal Components (PCs) of the same ranking by PCA along with different spectral dilation rate to detect healthy, asymptomatic, and symptomatic crop. The experiment result shows higher detection performance of the network using top the 50 important features extracted by RF at a dilation rate of 5. 6.2.4. Merged 2D- and 3D-CNN architectures Chen et al. [13] developed a 2D-3D-CNN for real-time crop defect detection. This network is the detection module of a real-time coffee-bean defect inspection algorithm (RT-CBDIA). The network consists of a 2D-CNN and a 3D-CNN, the former one is responsible to extract spatial features and the latter one is accountable for extraction of spectral features. Combining these two networks can boost feature extraction by providing robust and discriminative spectral-spatial features. The 3D-CNN is comprised of two convolution blocks with the same structure as in the 2D-CNN except that 3D convolutions and pooling layers are used. The two networks run simultaneously and their last pooling layers will be merged and fed to a FC layer and then a dropout layer to avoid overfitting. Finally, a softmax layer determines each crop health status. Likewise, Qi et al. [51] fully extracted spatial-spectral features by merging 2D- and 3D-CNN architectures using AttentionBlock [85] and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)-ResNet [25]. To accomplish this, the model first creates a neighborhood block of size 11×11×10 around a center pixel from the input image. Then, 2D convolution operations are used to extract spatial correlation features from the neighborhood block, and 3D convolution operations are used to capture spectral correlation features. The model uses four 2D convolutional layers and four 3D convolutional layers to capture feature maps of various spatial and spectral dimensions. By using different sizes of convolution kernels and downsampling steps, varied types of information can be captured. Finally, the extracted feature maps are fused together to create a final set of feature maps that contain valuable and pertinent information required for effective classification. Herein, AttentionBlock and SE-ResNet play important role, as outlined immediately below. An AttentionBlock is used to highlight important information in the fused spectral space feature map. It works by considering the similarity between each pixel in the feature map and weighting the relevant pixels with higher importance. This is achieved through a series of 2D convolutions with a kernel size of 1×1 to transform each pixel into an λ-dimensional vector, where λ represents the number of feature channels in the input tensor. The similarity between any two pixels is then calculated using the dot-product of their transformed vectors, and the results are weighted using a softmax function. The output of an AttentionBlockt is a feature map that emphasizes the relevant information while suppressing irrelevant information. This process allows AttentionBlocks to focus on the relevance between pixels in the entire feature map, rather than just the spatial range of the convolution kernel size used in traditional convolution and pooling operations. This results in better classification results with little computational complexity. In order to enhance the representational power of CNNs, SE modules as a type of attention mechanism can adaptively recalibrate the feature maps. It does so by capturing channel-wise feature dependencies through a squeeze operation, followed by an excitation operation that learns how to weight the importance of each feature map. This mechanism allows the model to pay more attention to salient channel features and disregards the less significant ones. By integrating AttentionBlocks and SE-ResNet, the network of Qi et al. [51] can better generalize in classification and achieve higher accuracy. Moreover, in the context of detection of two similar crop diseases that are indistinguishable to the naked eyes, a recent study by Jia et al. [28] developed a new network called Y-Net. The Y-Net model takes in 10×10×203 hyperspectral data cubes as input and it consists of a channel attention mechanism, a band selection module with auxiliary classifier, a 3D-2D-CNN architecture, and a classification module. A CNN architecture is employed to conduct the band selection, where 1×1 1D convolutions are assembled to modify the parameters of the convolutional kernel in the early phase of the network training. The magnitude of the weight of the convolution kernel is indicative of the relevance of the band, with greater absolute weight values signifying more distinctive bands. The use of group convolution helps in preventing any hindrance from nearby bands, while the ReLU activation function is adopted for fast network convergence without the problem of saturation. The output of this step will be given to an auxiliary classifier that enables early-stage weight updating in the band selection block. The auxiliary classifier module updates the loss function of the Y-Net model: (5) where y is the ground truth label, is the predicted label, and θ and β are hyperparameters that control the trade-off between the two losses and the sparsity of the band selection module, respectively. is the weight of the band in the band selection module and n is the number of total bands. The loss is a combination of the cross entropy losses of the final classifier and the auxiliary classifier and the sum of the weights of the band selection module. The purpose of this combination is to control the classification accuracy while updating the weights of the band selection layer. The adjustment factor θ gradually decreases as the number of training iterations increases. The presence of this adjustment factor enables the Y-Net model to update the weights in the band selection module in the early stages of training and gradually shift towards training the final classifier to learn a more accurate classification model. Additionally, the auxiliary classifier helps to constrain the weight sparsity of the band selection module, ensuring that the score of unimportant features is close to zero. The results of Jia et al. [28] show that by removing nonessential and nondiscriminative bands the accuracy of the Y-Net model increases and reduces the model size and the number of parameters. Moreover, since the band selection module is integrated into an overall architecture, the training time does not significantly increase. 7. Visualization techniques for HSI classification decisions Visualization techniques can be employed to observe the contribution of pixels in the classification decision. These techniques allow us to identify the pixel locations associated with the most important spectral bands that play a crucial role in the final classification results. Saliency maps [64] are one of the essential and traditional visualization tools to identify the most sensitive regions (crucial pixels) in an image with respect to a model's predictions. This technique works by computing the gradient of the output class score with respect to the input image. This gradient represents how much each pixel in the input image contributes to the final classification decision. Next, the absolute values of these gradients are summed across the channels to obtain a saliency map, which highlights the most salient regions of the input image for the predicted class. For example, Nagasubramanian et al. [45] discovered that saliency maps can help to locate the most sensitive pixel locations in infected crop images, which are often the severely infected areas. Conversely, both healthy and infected crop images had saliency map gradients that were primarily focused around the mid-region of the crop stem, highlighting the stem's importance in crop classification. Moreover, Cao et al. [10] observed that the significant wavelengths extracted by RF from raw HSI data overlaps the saliency-sensitive wavelengths. More importantly, saliency maps can determine significant wavelengths for classification which are not extracted by RF. Another visual explanation technique for CNN decision is the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) [59]. It was introduced as an improvement over CAM [88]. CAM involves modifying a pre-existing CNN model by replacing the final FC layer with a global average pooling layer, which retains essential channel information while reducing the spatial dimensions. This modification enables the utilization of feature maps from the preceding layer. By applying learned weights to these feature maps through global average pooling, CAM generates a map that highlights the crucial regions associated with the predicted category. However, CAM provides a coarse localization of the important regions within an image. It highlights the regions that contribute most to the predicted class, but it does not provide precise boundaries of those regions. To address this limitation, Grad-CAM was introduced as an extension to CAM. Grad-CAM enhances the CAM approach by incorporating gradient information. Similar to CAM, Grad-CAM also utilizes a global average pooling layer after the last convolutional layer to obtain importance scores for each channel in the feature maps. However, instead of learning separate linear models for each class, Grad-CAM calculates the gradients of the predicted class score with respect to the feature maps. These gradients are used to weigh the feature maps and enables Grad-CAM to identify more intricate features that play a significant role in the classification decision. In addition, there are further statistical techniques that help in analyzing the importance of individual features (spectral bands) of HSI data in a classification. Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) [34], [19] is one of such methods that uses decision trees in calculating feature importance. It builds decision trees in a leaf-wise manner, meaning that the algorithm grows the tree by adding new leaves one at a time which is computationally faster compared to level-wise approach by selecting the best split based on the maximum reduction in loss function for all leaves in the tree. Therefore, LightGBM calculates the importance of each feature by evaluating how much it contributes to the reduction in loss function across all trees. The feature importance score is calculated by summing up the number of times a feature is used to split the data across all trees, weighted by the improvement in accuracy achieved by each split. Features that are used more frequently and result in larger improvements in accuracy are assigned higher importance scores. 8. Discussion and conclusion In this study, we conducted a comprehensive review of 3D-CNN-based models applied in the domain of agriculture using non-UAV-based HSI data. Our analysis delved into diseased and defective crops, focusing on the structures and efficiencies of the models, the quantity of datasets utilized, and the necessary preprocessing steps. This review indicates the advantages of 3D-CNNs in capturing spatial-spectral information within hyperspectral data, enabling them to outperform 1D- and 2D-CNN in hyperspectral image classification. With the aim of assisting computer vision experts and agriculture-domain researchers in tackling HSI classification tasks for crops experiencing stress, this comprehensive review provides valuable insights and guidance. In general, HSI holds great potential for detecting subtle changes in crop growth and development, making it a promising technique for diagnosing crop diseases and defects. Despite this potential, our study indicates that there is still limited research conducted that use 3D-CNNs in this context. Furthermore, the studies that are performed are often very application-specific and it is unknown how well the performed methods and models generalize to a broader range of applications. We identify three major challenges that must be overcome to achieve a broader adoption of HSI in general and the usage of 3D-CNN for HSI classification problems: limited availability of hyperspectral data, computational complexity of 3D-CNN models, and the costs of hyperspectral imaging hardware. In the following we address each of these challenges in more detail and offer ideas on how to overcome or avoid them. Limited availability of varied hyperspectral data on diseased and defective crops presents a significant challenge for researchers, farmers, and stakeholders in the agriculture industry who rely on data to make informed decisions. The lack of data in this area of the research hampers efforts to understand the extent of the problem and develop effective solutions. It makes it difficult to track the progress and success of any initiatives aimed at improving crop health and reducing the prevalence of disease and defects. To address this issue, there is a need for increased investment in data collection and data sharing, as it has been done in the past, for example, for RGB-data (e.g., Beck et al. [4], [3]). Large-scale HSI data collection and publicly available datasets will allow research groups to develop the next generation of models, even if they have no access to the otherwise required hardware and plant material. Even with small datasets there are also techniques to models beyond the specific application case they had been trained on. In recent years, transfer learning and active learning techniques have been increasingly used together to tackle the challenges posed by limited data. By leveraging knowledge from pre-existing models, transfer learning can enhance the accuracy of models trained on limited HSI data. On the other hand, active learning involves selecting and annotating informative samples to improve the effectiveness of models trained on small HSI datasets. By combining the two techniques, transfer learning and active learning can address the bottleneck of limited HSI data and enable the development of robust 3D-CNN models capable of accurately classifying HSI data. The computational complexity of 3D-CNN models is a barrier for their deployment in the field, for example, in edge computing devices or even as part of an embedded system in UAVs or agricultural equipment. Real-time diagnosis could significantly enable farmers to quickly detect and respond to disease outbreaks, which can help to prevent the spread of disease and reduce crop losses. This requires, however, researchers to explore ways to optimize their models for speed and efficiency, particularly their memory-footprint. This can be achieved through advancing the capabilities of single board computers, particularly their GPU and AI accelerators, on the one side, as well as developing lightweight models on the other side, for example, by reduction of used bands or grouping of bands into indices. Identifying the spectral bands that are most informative for detecting a varied range of diseases and defects would play an important role in reducing the model's training computational time, decreasing the number of parameters, achieving higher accuracy and generating a more lightweight model. Despite the valuable insights hyperspectral imaging provides regarding the condition and health of crops, deploying this technology is relatively costly compared to RGB and multispectral imaging technologies. The higher expense is primarily attributed to the increased processing power required to analyze the HSI data and the extensive range of spectrum offered by hyperspectral cameras. One approach to consider for cost reduction is the limitation of the number of bands in hyperspectral cameras, as not all spectral bands may be equally crucial for disease and defect detection. Therefore, instead of having an imaging device that supports full range of wavelengths from the visible to the infrared spectrum, we can deploy imaging systems that work with essential wavelengths rather than hundreds of spectral bands. In this respect, some companies already provide the facility to design customized multispectral systems, which work with bands that had been identified to be the most discriminative (see Hamila et al. [22] for a 3D-CNN model training advantage of this approach). Therefore, developing methods for identifying the most informative spectral bands would also be cost beneficial. Furthermore, by leveraging Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms [48], the need for required infrastructure to process HSI data using 3D-CNN can be eliminated. Additionally, leading MLaaS providers can integrate pre-built 3D-CNN models into their offerings for training HSI data, thereby reducing the time and effort required for model development, especially for individuals in the agriculture domain who may have limited machine learning expertise. In summary, the application of 3D-CNNs with hyperspectral data for disease and defective crop detection is a promising research area with several open research questions. Collecting and sharing HSI data on scale, identifying informative spectral bands, developing transfer and active learning techniques, and implementing light-weight architectures are some of the key research areas that can be considered for future work. The advancement of this research will lead to more accurate and efficient disease and defective crop detection, which can have significant impacts on the agricultural industry.

Abstract Underwater concrete structures face significant challenges due to their complex living environment, among which cracks are a critical factor. According to the fundamental principles of water irrigation and electric heating method, we introduced a novel approach that leveraged the cooling law of the point heat source in the monitoring tube to estimate the flow velocity along the irrigation pipe, to further detect cracks based on the variations in axial flow velocity. Numerical simulations were initially conducted to investigate the effects of factors such as the size effect, flow velocity along the irrigation pipe, combination scheme of the monitoring tube and irrigation pipe, and heating power on the cooling law of the heat source, to further determined an optimized monitoring scheme. A series of model tests was then conducted based on this optimized scheme. First, the relationship between cooling discrimination index and axial flow velocity was calibrated. Then, by adjusting the water pressure, the leakage rates under different crack widths could be obtained, allowing for the derivation of a fitting formula to estimate the crack width using the water pressure and leakage rate. Finally, in double crack specimen, the proposed multi-crack identification method, along with the calibration relationship and fitting formula, was used to perform the crack inversion. The inverted crack widths showed good agreement with the actual crack widths, with an RMSE value of 0.0212 mm.

Introduction The development and utilization of underwater space have become increasingly important for convenient transportation, resource regulation, and energy development due to improved social production efficiency. Underwater structures such as sea-crossing bridges, water pipelines, dams, and offshore platforms are continuously constructed, and these underwater structures extensively use concrete due to the excellent compressive performance and cost-effectiveness of concrete [1]. However, wading-concrete structures face numerous challenges in their complex living environment, especially the occurrence of cracks. Underwater concrete is prone to cracking due to the corrosive nature of seawater, coupled with wave loads and temperature differentials inside and outside the structure [2]. These cracks not only accelerate the corrosion of underwater concrete and the reinforcement but also reduce the durability of the concrete, thereby compromising the integrity and load-bearing capacity of the overall structure [3], [4]. The timely detection and monitoring of cracks and their development status is crucial to preventing significant economic losses and safety hazards. Therefore, crack detection in underwater concrete is critical for maintaining the normal use of structures and ensuring their safety. Non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques have been widely used for the preventive maintenance of underwater structures. Traditional NDT methods primarily rely on visual inspection by human inspectors, who must dive underwater to visually examine the structure's surfaces within close range. This method poses personnel safety risks and requires a high level of expertise, potentially leading to errors and missed defect detection [5]. In recent years, underwater robots have been developed and used for the crack detection of underwater concrete structures [6], [7], [8]. Inspectors can remotely operate these robots from shore, eliminating personnel safety risks while increasing the inspection scope in terms of time and spatial coverage. By combining digital image processing techniques, crack detection from images collected by underwater robots has become more efficient, intelligent, and robust compared to traditional methods. Notably, underwater robot positioning and maneuverability still pose challenges [9], [10], especially in complex terrains and environments. Moreover, factors such as water turbidity, aquatic flora and fauna, and cleanliness of the structure surfaces can affect the quality of the collected images. However, image processing of underwater cracks faces several challenges. Traditional digital image processing methods cannot accurately identify underwater cracks due to image distortion [11]. Deep learning algorithms [12], [13] have shown more efficiency and robustness compared to traditional methods, but have limitations in terms of calibration and scene restrictions, limiting their widespread use in engineering applications. Other mainstream NDT methods for underwater structure analysis include ground-penetrating radar (GPR)[14], ultrasonic testing [15], and alternating current field measurement (ACFM)[16], [17]. However, these methods also have limitations. For example, the effectiveness of GPR will depend on the propagation medium of electromagnetic waves underwater and will be susceptible to environmental interference. Additionally, the attenuation and scattering effects of electromagnetic waves during propagation limit the depth range of GPR detection. Ultrasonic testing will be susceptible to noise interference underwater. When using ultrasonic imaging technology [18], [19] to detect defects in underwater structures, the sensors need to be in close contact with the concrete surface. However, detection efficiency remains relatively low, even in multi-channel imaging systems. As a recently developed NDT method, ACFM can detect defects by analyzing the influence of alternating current flow on the magnetic field distribution near the flaws. Furthermore, owing to its excellent noise resistance and sensitivity, this method can be used to detect welds in underwater structures. However, ACFM technology relies on the electrical conductivity of the material under test, and its direct application on concrete surfaces remains a challenge due to the low conductivity of concrete. Embedded sensors [20] have been widely utilized in the field of structural health monitoring (SHM), enabling the long-term and real-time monitoring of the internal structure condition, differentiating them from NDT methods that focus on surface and near-surface inspections. Among these sensors, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors [21], [22] have been extensively used due to their high sensitivity, real-time capabilities, and long-term stability, and monitoring approaches based on lead zirconate titanate piezoelectric (PZT) sensors have been increasingly assessed for underwater concrete structures [23], [24]. As such, by leveraging the piezoelectric effect of the materials, the qualitative identification of cracks can be achieved by analyzing the differential electrical signals generated at crack locations [25]. However, these embedded sensors have limited measurement coverage and cannot be easily repaired or replaced, making large-scale deployment challenging in engineering projects. A new approach for crack monitoring has been proposed by taking advantage of the unique environment of underwater concrete structures. This method involves embedding monitoring components that induce changes in thermodynamic parameters or heat transfer boundary conditions around the crack locations and utilizes heat transfer principles for crack identification. Chen et al. proposed a temperature tracing method based on thermal conduction theory, and this specific approach involved embedding a series of monitoring tubes with porous casings near the concrete surface [26]. Cracking of the concrete led to an increase in the water content within the porous casings, resulting in an increase in the thermal conductivity of the medium surrounding the cracks. The crack location could then be identified based on the difference in cooling rates of the heat source before and after cracking. However, this method exhibited lower sensitivity, with the accuracy of crack localization depending on the spacing of the casings, and the crack width could not be determined. Zhu et al. addressed these limitations by using hollow casings instead of porous casings, which increased the difference in cooling rates before and after cracking, thus, enhancing sensitivity [27]. Zhang et al. further conducted test studies on crack width monitoring using hollow casings and showed that this method could only identify the crack width in a flowing water environment, and the monitoring sensitivity depended on the distance between the measurement points and the crack. However, the method performed poorly when the crack width was less than 1.0 mm [28]. To address these issues, Chen et al. proposed a water irrigation and electric heating method, where the irrigation pipe was placed adjacent to the monitoring tube [29]. By actively creating a post-crack seepage environment using water pressure, the heat transfer boundary conditions were altered. Crack localization was then determined according to the distribution characteristics of the cooling discriminant index, and crack width could be determined based on the relationship between leakage rate and crack width. Compared to the casing method, this method improved the range of crack identification and localization accuracy. However, this method showed difficulty identifying the width of each crack when multiple cracks were present along a monitoring line when based solely on the total leakage rate. Therefore, based on the correlation between the flow velocity along the irrigation pipe and the cooling law of the heat source in the monitoring tube, in this study, we proposed a multi-crack identification method. This method not only allowed for systematic and efficient crack localization and width identification but also enhanced the measurement accuracy of the monitoring system, filling the gap in temperature tracing for the measurement of multi-crack widths. To achieve this, the monitoring scheme of water irrigation and electric heating method was optimized, by building upon a systematic study of the influencing factors on the cooling law of the heat source in the monitoring tube. A series of model tests was then conducted using the optimized monitoring scheme, which verified the effectiveness of this method for identifying multiple cracks. 2. Monitoring system and process 2.1. Monitoring system and principle The monitoring system used for water irrigation and electric heating consisted of a heating system, a temperature-measurement system, and an irrigation system, as shown in Fig. 1. The heating system was comprised of ceramic heating tubes within the sensing-heating elements, a heating series circuit, and a regulated power supply. The temperature-measurement system consisted of FBG sensors, a sensing series circuit, and an FBG demodulator. The irrigation system was composed of an irrigation pipe connected to a water tank, which provided constant water pressure, and the constant-pressure tank could be replaced by an automatic water supply, boosting the device in actual projects. For new construction projects, the monitoring tube and the irrigation pipe were embedded in the interior of the structure during the concrete pouring stage. For existing structures, they could be embedded by slotting on the concrete surface or fixed on the surface of the structure with plain concrete covering. The irrigation pipe was composed of a brittle material, such as ceramic or corundum, to ensure that it ruptured when the concrete cracked, while the monitoring tube required high tensile strength to prevent damage after concrete cracking. The monitoring tube was pre-filled with water, and the integrated sensing-heating circuit could be dragged to move the sensing-heating element to the designated position for measurement. In addition, the sensing heating element could be removed for maintenance or replacement, in the event of a malfunction.

When the sensing-heating element was located at P3, as shown in Fig. 1, heat transfer from the heat source to the surrounding medium occurred through thermal conduction, as the water within the irrigation pipe remained stationary below the crack. The conduction heat transfer could be described by the following differential equations: (1) where T is the temperature; t is the time; k denotes the thermal conductivity of the medium in different directions; ρ is the density of the medium; c is the specific heat of the medium; and Sh is the heating power per unit volume of the heat source. According to Equation (1), the cooling rate of the heat source at P3 primarily depended on the temperature gradient and thermal conductivity of the surrounding medium. When the sensing-heating element was located at P1 in Fig. 1, the heat from the heat source could be transferred through both conduction and convection, and the differential equation for convective heat transfer within the fluid could be expressed by (2) where ρw is the density of water, cw is the specific heat of water, v is the velocity of water, and Φ is the viscous dissipation function, related to the viscosity coefficient of water. According to Equation (2), the cooling rate at P1 was not only related to the temperature gradient and thermal conductivity of the surrounding medium but was also dependent on the flow velocity of water inside the irrigation pipe. Under other constant conditions, a higher flow velocity resulted in a faster cooling rate from the heat source. When the sensing-heating element was located at P2, as shown in Fig. 1, the rupture of the irrigation pipe caused water to flow along the surface of the monitoring tube, increasing the range of convective heat transfer. At this point, the heat transfer from the heat source was influenced by the convective heat transfer effect in both the v0 and vc flow directions. Therefore, the cooling rate at P2 was faster compared to P1. Based on the temperature tracing principle mentioned above, the heat transfer modes of underwater concrete would differ between locations close to and far away from the cracks, resulting in cooling rate variations of the heat source. Therefore, crack localization and width identification could be achieved by analyzing the cooling law of the heat source at the measurement points. Chen et al. assessed the cooling law of the heat source and defined a discriminant index, denoted as ξv, to reflect its cooling rate, as represented by Equation (3)[30]. Linear fitting was performed on the period, which showed good linearity of the time history curve of lg(T-Tθ), and the absolute value of the slope ξv of the fitted line increased with the acceleration of the cooling rate of the heat source, serving as a cooling discriminant index: (3) where T is the temperature of the measuring point, T0 is the initial temperature for cooling, and Tθ is the ambient temperature. 2.2. Identification process for multiple cracks When multiple cracks occurred along a monitoring line, as shown in Fig. 2, P1, P2, and P3 were considered the measurement points located further away from the cracks. The cooling rate of the heat source at these points was not influenced by the flow velocity inside the cracks but primarily depended on the flow velocity along the irrigation pipe. A higher axial flow velocity resulted in a faster cooling rate of the heat source, and as a result, a larger absolute value of the discriminant index ξv. Therefore, based on the calibration relationship between ξv and the axial flow velocity, the flow velocities v1, v2, and v3 at the corresponding positions of P1, P2, and P3 could be determined. The velocities followed the order v1 > v2 > v3. Based on this characteristic, we preliminarily inferred that cracks existed between P1 and P2, as well as between P2 and P3. Subsequently, the sensing-heating integrated circuit was dragged to change the positions of the measurement points, and mobile distributed measurements were conducted in the areas where cracks were likely to occur. By analyzing the distribution characteristics of ξv at the measurement points, the precise location of the cracks could be determined.

After inversely estimating the axial flow velocities at measurement points P1 and P2, based on the calibration relationship, the seepage rates qw1 and qw2 at cracks #1 and #2 could be determined according to the principle of mass conservation, respectively, as shown in the following equation: (4) where Af is the cross-sectional area of the irrigation pipe. According to Equation (4), a linear correlation was observed between the seepage rate and axial flow velocity. Therefore, the axial flow velocity could be indirectly calibrated through the calibration relationship between ξv and the seepage rate (ξv-qw). When the water pressure was constant, the seepage rate would increase with the widening of the cracks. Similarly, when the crack width was the same, the seepage rate increased with increasing water pressure. Mutual influence was observed among the seepage rate, crack width, and water pressure. Consequently, when the seepage rate and water pressure were constant, the crack width could be inversely estimated based on the calibration relationship between the seepage rate, crack width, and water pressure (qw-w-pg). A flowchart for multi-crack identification is illustrated in Fig. 3. First, cracks were preliminarily identified through the variation of water level within the irrigation pipe. Following cracking, the irrigation pipe underwent a transition from an initially dry state to a water-filled state due to seepage through the cracks. Subsequently, the sensing-heating element was moved to different measuring points along the monitoring circuit for measurements, enabling crack localization based on the distribution characteristics of ξv at measuring points. Finally, utilizing two pre-calibrated relationships, namely ξv-qw and qw-w-pg, facilitated the inversion of multi-crack widths.

Numerical simulations To investigate the influencing factors on the cooling law of the point heat source in the monitoring tube, and to optimize the monitoring scheme, a finite element numerical analysis was conducted for the fluid–solid coupled heat transfer in the region far from the cracks, and the ANSYS Fluent platform was used to solve the heat transfer calculation model. The simplified diagram of heat transfer in the region far from the cracks is shown in Fig. 4. The water inside the irrigation pipe was assumed to as constant-viscosity and an incompressible fluid. When heat transfer was involved, in addition to solving the mass and momentum conservation equations, an additional energy conservation equation had to be solved. The governing equations for the computational model shown in Fig. 4 could be expressed by Equation (5): (5) Download : Download high-res image (93KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4.

Numerical model The numerical model for heat transfer in the region far from the cracks was established based on Fig. 4, with the cross-section of the concrete structure consisting of a square with a side length of 150 mm, and the longitudinal length of the model was 300 mm. An outer fluid layer was created around the concrete structure to simulate the external water environment, with a sensing-heating element located in the middle of the monitoring tube, and the distance from the center of the sensor to the surface of the concrete was 40 mm. The numerical model for the region far from the cracks, as well as the corresponding dimensions, are shown in Fig. 5. Download : Download high-res image (200KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Numerical model for the region far from the cracks and corresponding dimensions. The model was divided into different regions, including the addition of a boundary layer for the fluid domain inside the irrigation pipe. A polyhedral meshing technique was used with a maximum mesh size of 5 mm. After diagnosing the mesh quality, finite element analysis calculations were conducted using Fluent software. The following assumptions were made. First, the water inside the irrigation pipe was incompressible and exhibited steady flow. Second, the thermodynamic parameters of the materials and the viscosity of the water did not vary with temperature, pressure, and time. The initial conditions were set as follows. (1) The wall surfaces were treated as adiabatic boundary conditions; (2) the inlet consisted of a velocity inlet, while the outlet was a pressure outlet with the gauge pressure set to 0; and (3) the ambient temperature Tθ was set to 300 K. The thermodynamic parameters of various materials in the model are shown in Table 1. Due to the significant influence of thermal conductivity on heat transfer efficiency, the selection of simulation materials for the monitoring tube and the irrigation pipe primarily considered the magnitude of the thermal conductivity. The values of relevant parameters were referred from literature [27] and the standard material library built into Fluent. Table 1.

The material parameters for the monitoring tube and irrigation pipe corresponding to each case are listed in Table 1. Table 2. Calculation cases.

(1) During the heating stage, constant power was applied to the ceramic heating tube, which was then stopped after 180 s. (2) Transitioning to the cooling stage, the temperature at t = 180 s was taken as the initial temperature for the cooling stage at the monitoring point, and the calculation concluded at t = 1000 s. (3) By altering the inlet velocity, the above calculation steps were repeated to obtain the temperature–time data during the cooling stage for each case at different flow velocities. The following settings were applied for the model calculations, according to the above computational steps. (1) The pressure solver was selected with a transient time type, without considering gravity effects. (2) The energy equation was enabled, employing the Realizable k-ε turbulence model. (3) The material properties were assigned to each element, and the ceramic heating tube element was designated as a heat source with a time-varying power function (P = 1 × 107 W⋅m−3 for 0 ≤ t ≤ 180 s, and P = 0 for t > 180 s). (4) The center point of the ceramic heating tube element was designated as the monitoring point, and the temperature–time data at this point was recorded. (5) The Simplic algorithm was employed, and the calculations were executed after initialization. The time step size was set to 1 s, with a total of 1000 time steps. 3.2. Factors affecting the cooling law of the heat source 3.2.1. Size effect The boundary conditions of the model were assumed as adiabatic walls. In practice, consideration of the heat transfer range of the heat source will be necessary to ensure the rationality of the model size. As a result, the cross-sectional dimensions of the numerical model were modified to investigate the size effect by comparing the simulation results. The distance between the center of the heat source and the near surface of the concrete was maintained at 40 mm, while the side length of the cross-section of the concrete was increased to 300 mm.

Schematic diagram of the size variations in Case 5. The models with two different cross-section sizes in Case 5 were successively simulated, and the temperature contours of the profile at the monitoring point under different flow rates were obtained at a cooling time of 800 s. Fig. 7(a) presents the temperature contours of the model with a size of 150 mm, when the water in the irrigation pipe was stationary, and Fig. 7(b) and (c) show the temperature contours when the water in the irrigation pipe was flowing. We observed that during the cooling stage, heat gradually diffused from the heat source to the surrounding medium, and the flow of water in the irrigation pipe significantly accelerated the cooling rate of the heat source. Moreover, the faster the flow rate in the irrigation pipe, the faster the cooling rate of the heat source. After 800 s of cooling, the internal temperature of the model approached the ambient temperature of 300 K, and heat transfer remained within the computational domain.

According to the calculation steps, the time history curves of lg(T-Tθ) during the cooling stage were obtained at the monitoring point for the enlarged size model (300 mm) and the original size model (150 mm). A comparison of the simulation results is presented in Fig. 8. The simulation results of the two models were highly consistent, and the calculated discriminant indices were identical. Therefore, we determined that assuming an adiabatic boundary condition for the wall surface was appropriate when the cross-sectional size of the model was taken as 150 mm.

Flow velocity along the irrigation pipe Six different flow velocities were simulated for each case to investigate the effect of flow velocity along the irrigation pipe on the cooling law of the point heat source far from the cracks, corresponding to flow rates of 0, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 mL·min−1. By following the calculation steps, the time-course data of temperature T at the monitoring point under different cases could be obtained, and the time history curves of lg(T-Tθ) during the cooling stage were determined for each case. The simulation results for Case 5 are shown in Fig. 8(a). We observed that a higher flow velocity inside the irrigation pipe led to a faster cooling rate at the monitoring point, with 0 mL·min−1 corresponding to the stagnant state of the water inside the irrigation pipe and serving as a reference for determining the magnitude of flow velocity. During the 200 to 500 s cooling interval, linear fitting was applied to the time history curve of lg(T-Tθ), as shown in Fig. 9. The results indicated that the R-squared values of the fitted lines for the 200 to 500 s cooling interval were above 0.99, suggesting that the slope of the fitted line in this interval could be used as the discriminant index ξv to characterize the magnitude of flow velocity inside the irrigation pipe.

Combination scheme of irrigation pipe and monitoring tube The irrigation pipe and monitoring tube combination schemes are presented in Table 2. In Case 1, which corresponded to the original setup in [29], both the irrigation pipe and monitoring tube were cylindrical and had linear contact, and the sensitivity of the monitoring system was relatively low. Therefore, in subsequent cases, both the irrigation pipe and monitoring tube were changed to square tubes to increase the contact area and enhance the convective heat transfer effect. Additionally, Case 2 differed from Case 3 in terms of the irrigation pipe material, Case 3 differed from Case 4 in the wall thickness of the irrigation pipe, and Case 3 differed from Case 5 in the monitoring tube material. Simulations were conducted for these five cases, and the temperature–time data at the monitoring point were obtained under different flow rates. Finally, the time history curves of lg(T-Tθ) were obtained, as shown in Fig. 10. Download : Download high-res image (444KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Time history curves of lg(T-Tθ) during the cooling stage for the cases under different flow rates. When the water inside the irrigation pipe was stagnant, as shown in Fig. 10(a), the cooling trend at the monitoring point was slow, indicating that heat conduction was the dominant heat transfer mechanism. When the water inside the irrigation pipe started to flow, as shown in Fig. 10(b) and (c), the cooling trend at the monitoring point accelerated with increasing flow rate. In Case 1, the contact area between the monitoring tube and irrigation pipe was small, resulting in the weakest convective heat transfer effect and the slowest cooling rate compared to the other cases. In Cases 2 and 3, the irrigation pipes were composed of ceramic and corundum, respectively. Corundum had a higher thermal conductivity compared to ceramic, where the higher the thermal conductivity, the stronger the heat conduction effect, resulting in a faster cooling rate in Case 3 compared to Case 2. In Case 4, the irrigation pipe wall thickness was reduced by 1 mm compared to Case 3. The thermal conductivity of water was lower than solid materials. Although the convective heat transfer area increased in Case 4, the flow velocity was lower under the same flow rate. Therefore, the cooling trend in Case 4 was basically consistent with Case 3. In Cases 3 and 5, the monitoring tubes were composed of carbon fiber and stainless steel, respectively. The thermal conductivity of the stainless steel was significantly higher than carbon fiber. When the water inside the irrigation pipe was stagnant, the cooling curve of Case 5 exhibited the fastest initial descent rate. When the water inside the irrigation pipe was flowing, Case 5 presented the most significant cooling trend change. 3.2.4. Heating power To investigate the effect of heating power on the cooling law of the heat source, three input powers were set, namely, 0.5 × 107, 1 × 107, and 2 × 107 W⋅m−3. The temperature contours of the profile at the monitoring point for Case 5 were obtained after heating for 180 s, as shown in Fig. 11. With a fixed heating time, the higher heating power resulted in a higher initial temperature during the cooling stage, and the maximum initial temperatures for the three power levels were 313.2 K, 326.3 K, and 352.7 K.

The time history curves of lg(T-Tθ) during the cooling stage under the three different powers and various flow rates are shown in Fig. 12. When the flow rates were identical, the cooling curves obtained under different powers were essentially parallel to each other, and the calculated discriminant index ξv values were the same. This indicated that when using ξv as a discriminant index for the flow velocity inside the irrigation pipe, the influence of heating power could be eliminated.

Optimization of the monitoring scheme As presented in Section 3.2, five different cases were established by varying the monitoring tube and irrigation pipe combination. The effects of factors such as the flow velocity along the irrigation pipe, contact area between the monitoring tube and the irrigation pipe, and thermal conductivity of the medium on the cooling law of the heat source were assessed. The influence of size effect and heating power was also considered. We observed that as the flow velocity inside the irrigation pipe changed, the magnitude of variation in ξv increased, indicating higher sensitivity and better performance of the monitoring system. The variation pattern of ξv with the flow velocity along the irrigation pipe was simulated for all five cases, as shown in Fig. 13. We observed that among the five cases, Case 5 showed the most significant variations in discriminant index ξv with respect to the flow velocity. Therefore, the scheme corresponding to Case 5, which comprised the monitoring tube and irrigation pipe, was chosen as the optimized scheme for further numerical simulations and model tests.

Crack location identification 3.4.1. Numerical model To investigate the thermal effects near the cracks, numerical models with different crack widths were established according to the optimized scheme, as shown in Fig. 14. The longitudinal length of the numerical model was 400 mm, and the crack was positioned at the center height of the model, with parameter w representing the crack width, and three cases were considered: w = 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mm. In the monitoring pipe, the sensing-heating element was moved along the vertical direction with the crack center serving as the origin, resulting in different monitoring points. The distance between the monitoring point and the crack center was denoted as y. Download : Download high-res image (49KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 14. Numerical model with a crack based on the optimization scheme. 3.4.2. Simulation results Different cooling patterns at different measurement points were simulated for models with three different crack widths under various flow rates, and the distribution of ξv along the monitoring line was obtained through fitting, as shown in Fig. 15. We observed that the simulated results for the three crack widths were consistent under the same flow rate. As the monitoring point grew closer to the crack center, the absolute value of ξv increased, and the absolute value of ξv increased with increasing crack flow rate. Therefore, crack localization could be achieved by analyzing the distribution characteristics of ξv along the monitoring line, and the crack localization accuracy could be improved by increasing the crack flow rate. When the monitoring point was located 80 mm below the crack, where no water flow occurred, the cooling rate of the heat source decreased. In this case, the magnitude of ξv was no longer affected by seepage and could be used as a reference value. When the monitoring point was 50 mm above the crack, the value of ξv became stable, indicating that the cooling pattern was not influenced by crack flow and was only related to the flow velocity inside the irrigation pipe. Therefore, ξv at locations away from the crack (y + ≧ 50 mm) could be used for calibrating and inverting the axial flow velocity. Furthermore, compared to the numerical model without cracks, the presence of the crack in the numerical model resulted in external water flow. However, the ξv values for both models at the same axial flow velocity were essentially identical, indicating that the flow state of the external water had minimal effect on the cooling rate of the heat source.

Specimen Tests were conducted using the optimized scheme, according to the numerical simulation results. The dimensions of the reinforced concrete beam are shown in Fig. 16. The monitoring tube and irrigation pipe were composed of stainless steel and corundum, respectively, and both consisted of square tubes with an outer side length of 18 mm. To facilitate a connection between the irrigation pipe and the circular delivery pipe, a heat-shrinkable tube was used to connect the irrigation pipe and circular PE-RT pipe near the top surface of the concrete. The connection section was embedded inside the concrete to ensure a leak-free joint, as verified in practice. The bottoms of the monitoring tube and the irrigation pipe were sealed with hot-melt adhesive. Download : Download high-res image (133KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 16. Diagram of the test specimen. 4.2. Test process The test site is shown in Fig. 17. The specimen was placed horizontally in a prefabricated stainless steel water tank, and two circular holes on the side of the water tank were used to install the drainage pipes. The lower drainage pipe was equipped with a valve, which remained closed during the test and was only opened to drain the water when removing the specimen after testing. The upper drainage pipe was used to discharge the leaking water, and the leakage flow rate was measured using a graduated cylinder. The valve and the pressure gauge were installed between the delivery pipe and the irrigation pipe, and the sensing-heating element was placed inside the monitoring tube. Next, a three-point bending test was conducted on the specimen using a reaction frame and hydraulic jack to induce cracking at specific locations. Water was then added to the water tank, and the water supply was stopped when the upper drainage pipe started leaking. At this point, the valve on the delivery pipe was opened to inject water into the irrigation pipe, and the crack leakage water flowed out from the upper drainage pipe. Once the pressure gauge readings and leakage flow rate stabilized, testing commenced. Download : Download high-res image (240KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 17. Test site. The testing procedure was as follows. (1) The fiber optic connectors and circuit connectors of the integrated circuit were connected to the demodulator and the regulated power supply, with a sampling frequency of 1 Hz and a voltage of 12 V. (2) The demodulator was started and testing began when the displayed wavelength value stabilized on the computer. Testing was conducted for at least 1 min under ambient temperature, and the average wavelength value within that minute was used as the corresponding wavelength λθ for the ambient temperature. (3) The regulated power supply used for heating was started, then turned off after 3 min, to initiate the natural cooling process. (4) The drainage volume was measured using a graduated cylinder, and the wavelength data was monitored. The test was stopped once the temperature stabilized during the cooling process. (5) The valve on the delivery pipe was adjusted to change the leakage rate, and the integrated circuit was moved to change the measurement point. The testing procedure was repeated as outlined above, and with each test iteration, the leakage rate or measurement point was changed. 4.3. Test results The FBG sensor in the sensing-heating element was specifically packaged to avoid strain interference, allowing it to be solely sensitive to temperature. The temperature change T caused a corresponding change in the reflected wavelength λ of the FBG, with the following relationship: (6) where KT is the temperature sensitivity coefficient of the FBG sensor. Due to the linear correlation between the wavelength measured under the same sensing point and the temperature, Equation (3) could be expressed as (7) where λθ and λ0 denote the wavelength corresponding to ambient temperature and the initial wavelength during the cooling stage (nm), respectively. 4.3.1. Calibration between ξv and axial flow rate The cracking location was located in the middle of the specimen, and the measurement point was moved to a position 20 cm above the crack. Because the measurement was far away from the crack, the cooling behavior at this point was not influenced by the crack seepage, and depended only on the axial flow velocity. Testing was initiated once the water pressure and seepage rate stabilized, by adjusting the valve to change the flow velocity in the irrigation pipe. The time-domain data of the wavelength during the 200 to 500 s cooling interval at the measurement point were obtained according to the test. The corresponding discrimination index ξv was obtained by fitting the wavelength data during this cooling interval, using Equation (7). A linear correlation could be established between the axial flow velocity and the flow rate, therefore, the axial flow velocity could be calibrated by calibrating the flow rate. The calibration relationship between ξv and the flow rate qw is shown in Fig. 18. Download : Download high-res image (91KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 18. Calibration relationship between ξv and qw. We observed that the distribution pattern of ξv with respect to the flow rate was generally consistent with the numerical simulation results. However, the numerical values of ξv were overall lower, and this discrepancy could be attributed to the following reasons. (1) The material parameters used in the numerical simulation were based on the recommended values from standard databases, which potentially differed from the actual material properties. (2) The thermodynamic characteristics of the medium were influenced by temperature and pressure variations, but the numerical simulation was simplified, and the medium had constant properties. (3) The actual reinforced concrete beam was not a homogeneous medium, and the influence of reinforcement was not considered in the numerical simulation. 4.3.2. Calibration of qw -w-pg and mathematical model fitting To achieve the identification of multiple crack widths, we established a calibration relationship and mathematical model between the crack flow rate qw, crack width w, and water pressure pg for individual crack. The crack width was observed using a crack microscope, while continuously applying load to the specimen. A total of nine width values were recorded in the range of 0.28 to 1.23 mm, and for each crack width, the valve was adjusted to vary the water pressure. After the pressure gauge and flow rate values stabilized, we recorded the flow rate corresponding to each water pressure at the given crack width. The calibration relationship and mathematical model between qw, w, and pg are shown in Fig. 19. According to the calibration results, we observed that the flow rate increased in a power-law manner with increasing crack width and water pressure. This pattern aligned with the trends observed in the experimental cases documented in reference [29]. Download : Download high-res image (209KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 19. Calibration of qw-w-pg and mathematical model fitting. 4.3.3. Double crack monitoring To validate the effectiveness of this method in identifying multiple cracks, another specimen was fabricated, as shown in Fig. 16, which indicated that the concrete mix proportion and reinforcement were consistent with the calibration test. Two cracks were induced by loading the specimen at distances of 60 and 30 cm from the bottom. After cracking, loading was applied to the middle of the specimen to simultaneously expand the widths of the two cracks, resulting in two different cases. From the top of the specimen downward, the crack widths for Case 1 were 0.20 and 0.27 mm, while for Case 2, the crack widths were 0.25 and 0.33 mm. Measurement points were arranged at 10 cm intervals, 10 to 80 cm above the bottom of the specimen, and tests were conducted for both cases. During testing, the water pressure was maintained at 57.8 kPa for both cases. According to the test results, the corresponding ξv values were calculated for the measurement points in the two cases, as shown in Table 3, and the distribution of ξv along the height of the specimen is presented in Fig. 20. Table 3. Values of ξv (10−3) corresponding to the two cases at the measurement points. Case Height (cm) Empty Cell 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 1 −1.3978 −1.4129 −1.4734 −1.3692 −1.3833 −1.5440 −1.2504 −1.2415 2 −1.4440 −1.4880 −1.5653 −1.4081 −1.4442 −1.9023 −1.2433 −1.2215 Download : Download high-res image (96KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 20. Distribution of ξv along the height of the specimen. As shown in Fig. 20, under identical water pressure, the flow rate increased with increasing crack width. Therefore, the ξv values for Case 2 were generally higher than for Case 1. When the measurement points were located at heights of 80 and 50 cm, far from the cracks, the cooling rate of the heat source at these points was only related to the axial flow velocity, with a larger ξv value indicating a higher flow rate within the irrigation pipe. When the measurement points were located at the height of the cracks, the ξv values for both cases significantly increased due to the enhanced convective heat transfer effect. When the measurement points were located below a height of 20 cm, which was unaffected by the convective heat transfer effect, the ξv values for both cases were essentially identical. According to the above analysis, the distribution of ξv was consistent with the pattern observed in the numerical simulation, indicating that the proposed method could effectively achieve multi-crack localization. According to the calibration results in Section 4.3.1, the ξv values at heights of 80 and 50 cm on the specimen were inverted using the fitting equation in Fig. 18 to obtain the flow rates at these two locations. Then, the crack flow rates were calculated for each case, according to Equation (4). By applying the water pressure and seepage flow rates to the calibration equation in Fig. 19, the widths of the two cracks in Cases 1 and 2 were subsequently inverted. From the top of the specimen downward, the inverted crack widths for Case 1 were 0.19 and 0.30 mm, and for Case 2 were 0.23 and 0.35 mm. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the measured values and actual values for the four sets of data was 0.0212 mm, indicating that the measurement error was within an acceptable range for engineering applications. This demonstrated that the proposed method, based on the optimized scheme, could effectively achieve multi-crack localization and width identification. Potential sources for measurement errors included: (1) Inconsistent longitudinal gap between the monitoring tube and the irrigation pipe. A larger gap correspondingly weakened the convective heat transfer effect, resulting in underestimated crack width identification results. Therefore, the vertical alignment of the monitoring tube and the irrigation pipe was crucial and led to a consistent longitudinal gap between them. (2) Fluctuations in the heating power during the heating phase. The temperature rise of the heating tube was related to the heating power, and fluctuations in the heating power potentially influenced the monitoring results. Therefore, ensuring the stability of the power supply was crucial during testing. 5. Discussion In this paper, when the distance between two cracks is 30 cm, the monitoring results were satisfactory. When the distance between two cracks was relatively small, in one scenario where the spacing of measurement points was sufficiently dense, it was still possible to identify the positions and quantity of cracks based on the distribution characteristics of ξv. However, due to the mutual influence between the cracks, it became challenging to accurately identify the axial flow velocity between the two cracks, and consequently, the accurate determination of the widths of the two cracks was hindered. Another scenario was when the spacing between measurement points was large, resulting in the absence of measurement points between two cracks. In this case, the two cracks would be identified as a single crack, and the obtained crack width could only be used to assess the degree of cracking. During field testing, discrepancies might have existed between the irrigation water temperature (Tv) and the ambient temperature of underwater concrete (Tθ). Therefore, when the multi-crack identification method proposed in this paper was applied for field testing, the impact of temperature discrepancies on the cooling law of the heat source was taken into account. In cases where significant temperature discrepancies were observed, temperature compensation was recommended to be performed when monitoring underwater concrete cracks. Calibration tests were conducted at different irrigation water temperatures to establish the relationships between ξv, Tv, and Tθ. Subsequently, utilizing the re-calibrated discriminant relationships, the crack widths of underwater concrete could be inverted. 6. Conclusion A new method for identifying multiple cracks in underwater concrete was proposed in this work, based on the thermodynamic phenomenon where the flow velocity along the irrigation pipe affected convective heat transfer and consequently influenced the cooling rate of the heat source in the monitoring tube. First, numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the effects of size, axial flow velocity in the irrigation pipe, monitoring tube and irrigation pipe combination, and heating power on the cooling behavior of the heat source. An optimized monitoring scheme was then determined among the five simulated calculation cases based on the findings. Calibration between the discrimination index ξv and the axial flow velocity, as well as calibration between the seepage rate, crack width, and water pressure, was subsequently performed using the optimized scheme. Finally, dual-crack detection was carried out according to the proposed multi-crack identification method and calibration relationships. Crack inversion was performed for four sets of data corresponding to the two cases of dual-crack widths. The following conclusions were drawn. (1) The absolute value of the cooling discrimination index ξv increased with increasing flow velocity along the irrigation pipe, however, the increasing trend gradually slowed down. (2) Increasing the contact area between the monitoring tube and the irrigation pipe, as well as their thermal conductivity, enhanced the sensitivity of ξv to the axial flow velocity. (3) Calibration results indicated that the flow rate increased in a power-law manner with increasing crack width and water pressure. (4) Both numerical simulations and model tests showed that ξv underwent a sudden change near the cracks, which could be used for crack localization. (5) The model test results of dual-crack detection demonstrated good agreement between the crack widths inferred by the proposed multi-crack identification method and actual crack widths, with an RMSE value of 0.0212 mm.

  Extract 1: Traditionally, detecting faults in wireless networks depended on human operators analyzing and interpreting alerts, based on fixed thresholds that activated alarms when limits were exceeded. These were not suitable for automated irrigation systems, which require autonomous operation and immediate fault detection and remediation to prevent damage or water waste. Therefore, automated fault detection techniques were developed to monitor field devices and network performance data in order to extract important patterns and detect faults in real time.
  Extract 2: By using automated fault detection techniques, it is possible to reduce or even eliminate downtime, improve efficiency, and reduce the maintenance costs associated with irrigation systems. This technique includes periodic checks of equipment, monitoring system performance, analyzing historical data to identify patterns or trends, and predicting future events. These techniques not only help in detecting faults but also in preventing them by identifying potential problems before they occur.

In all of these different application domains, the core technology and the core technological ideas remain the same; the only thing that changes is the type of sensors that would be used. Traditional manufacturing posed different challenges like unavailability of real-time data, unbalanced workload, and longer changeover time. Smart factory tries to overcome these challenges by integrating IoT and operational technology (OT). The chapter also presents how IIoT can help in transforming present-day healthcare and making healthcare much more affordable, much more efficient, and much more autonomous. IIoT solutions can be used to alleviate some of the problems that are encountered by people with respect to health. There are different sensors like ECG sensor, blood pressure sensor, glucose-monitoring sensor, and temperature sensor that can be procured by patients themselves for monitoring their health conditions at their homes. Further, these systems can be internetworked so that if any patient has a critical condition, different levels of alerts would be sent to the hospital to which this patient is registered. The chapter also discusses IIoT implementation in the food industry. The process involves sowing seeds, growing crops, applying fertilizers, applying pesticides, maturity of crops, harvesting crops, food grain processing, packaging of food grains, and transporting to a wholesale market and finally to the retail market. This is called the supply chain from field to plate. IIoT devices can be used in the agricultural field for monitoring the sowing of seeds, for growth of crops, for applying fertilizers, and for irrigation. These devices can also be used at each step. We describe each of these applications in detail in this chapter. Keywords IoT IIoT Cloud computing Big data analytics Smart factory Access provided by University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

The main aim of IoT is to interconnect different smart objects so that they are uniquely identified and able to interoperate between themselves. In these smart objects, intelligence is embedded. IIoT is an application of IoT in the industries to modify various existing industrial systems. IIoT links the automation system with enterprise, planning, and product life cycle. IIoT borrows some of the features of IoT and some from the vision of Industry 4.0 and tries to have a separate vision and technology for itself. So Industry 4.0 gives a framework for automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies. So, Industry 4.0 basically tries to improve the automation and data exchange in manufacturing and technologies; it tries to incorporate concepts from cyber physical systems, IoT cloud computing, and so on. IIoT and IoT are not the same [2] as IoT focuses on consumer-level services and consumer-level products whereas IIoT has the focus on the enterprise. IoT traditionally focuses on the convenience of the individuals, and IIoT focuses on the efficiency, safety, and security of operation. In terms of machine-to-machine (M-2-M) communication, its use is limited in IoT, whereas M-2-M communication is extensively used in IIoT; the whole industrial operation in a plant is automated. So, one machine talking to another machine is quite extensive in the industrial sector IIoT. Some of the integral components for building IIoT are machine learning, big data technology, M-2-M communication, and automation. So machine learning involves learning from the existing data and then trying to make predictions so as to make things better in the future. The machine-to-machine communication is about two machines communicating with each other for getting a particular work or a task accomplished without any human intervention. So, a robotic arm opening the door of a refrigerator and then performing certain other tasks in the refrigerator are an example of machine to machine. So, maybe the robotic arm goes and opens the door of the refrigerator and checks whether there is sufficient milk in the milk pot of the refrigerator or not; if there is no sufficient milk, then the system as a whole will send an SMS to the milk person. So, we have machine-to-machine communication and automation without human intervention. So, these are the different aspects of IIoT. So, IIoT is supported by a huge amount of data collected from sensors, and it is based on wrap-and-reuse approach rather than rip-and-replace approach. We are not building a new system from scratch; we use the existing industrial systems; wrap them with sensors, actuators, and so on; and make things efficient. In IIoT, we try to reengineer the existing systems and the processes and we do not build anything brand new from scratch. IIoT combines the second generation of Internet (where things are connected), fourth generation of industrial automation, and cloud computing. So, cloud has become a very popular technology since about more than half a decade and it is being used in the industrial sector as well. So, cloud offers computational environments, computational infrastructure, computational platforms, and computational software in addition to regular storage. Using cloud one can get access to everything in an industry without basically having to purchase these of their own. In the IIoT network, we have physical objects, different systems and subsystems, platforms, and applications that are interconnected. IIoT networks can communicate with one another, external environment, and different people. The acquisition of IIoT has led to the availability and affordability of sensors, processors, and other technologies, which facilitate the capture of and access to real-time information. IIoT has a plethora of applications like transportation [3–4], power plant security and safety [5], inventory management and quality control [6], facility management [7], milk processing and packaging industries, healthcare, manufacturing industries, and food industry. But in this chapter, we only focus on the three applications: healthcare, manufacturing industries, and food industry. 2 Requirements of IIoT There are four broad requirements of IIoT. We need the hardware and software connectivity and a cloud platform with respect to processing, infrastructure, and data storage. Application development and big data analytics are very important. All these different sensors and actuators are fitted to these different machines and manufacturing equipment. They throw in a huge volume of data in real time that can reveal a lot of information. Data also have other characteristics, such as they come in huge velocities, and there are different types of such data, like speech, images, and video, all coming at the same time need to be handled, and so on. By mining such data using big data analytics, one can predict different things to make these industrial processes much more efficient. Another IIoT requirement is with respect to access, i.e., one can access anything, at anytime, from anywhere in IIoT. So here end-to-end security is important. User experience has to be taken into account as one of the fundamental requirements for building IIoT, i.e., what users exactly want, how their problems can be addressed and solved, how through the use of IIoT system users can do things better and how their experience as a whole can be improved. Transition to smart machines: By adding sensors and actuators we are making the machine smart. Asset management is very important; through asset management, different sensors and actuators (which are the industrial assets) can be managed in a much more efficient way. We now take a deep dive into the issues and challenges [8] in the adoption of IIoT: There are data integration challenges, so here we refer to a large number of machines. These different machines have their own heterogeneity in place. Integration of these heterogeneous data coming in high volumes and velocities is a herculean task. Cyber security is very important because we are referring to a connected world, where there is connectivity between (i) machines themselves, (ii) machine and human beings, and (iii) machines and human beings. Due to this connectivity, it is quite likely that some vulnerabilities are introduced in the overall network, making it possible for different types of attacks and newer types of attacks to be launched. There is lack of standardization; large automation supplier firms do not encourage open standardization as it will reduce customers’ reliance on them. So, small automation supplier firms basically lack the capability to incentivize this huge step. Lack of standardization leads to different issues related to device interoperability and semantic interoperability. So, different machines supporting different IoT devices need to talk to each other and they have been made by different vendors. Legacy installations are a very crucial aspect to be considered. Technology is evolving fast. Industries have a huge legacy machine base and these machines have been operating successfully since decades. With the incorporation of IIoT, we need to have support for these newer technologies and newer machines being procured. So fast-evolving technology should coexist with the legacy equipment without leaving any kind of vulnerability in the whole integrated system. The next issue with IIoT adoption is lack of skilled workers. The workers do not have IIoT-related skills, like data integration. The technologies associated with IIoT are new in nature, so workers should have fast and diverse knowledge about these technologies. Now we discuss the different design considerations for building IIoT. 3 Design Considerations for IIoT To use an IoT device for industrial applications, the following design objectives [9] have to be considered: Energy: Time for which the IoT device can operate with the limited power supply Latency: Time required to transmit the data Throughput: Maximum data transmitted across the network Scalability: Number of devices supported Topology: Communication among the devices, i.e., interoperability Safety and security: Degree of safety and security of the application So, now we discuss some of the application areas of IIoT like healthcare industry, manufacturing industry, and food industry. 4 IIoT Applications: Healthcare 4.1 IIoT in Healthcare Earlier, people used to die due to lack of healthcare. People used to forget about their health due to busy life, and this has also happened in the recent past. Additionally, the number of diseases has also increased in recent times. So, we have our IIoT solutions that could be used to alleviate some of the problems that are encountered by people with respect to health. So, IIoT solutions can help in making healthcare easier and affordable. There are different sensors [10] such as the ECG sensor, blood pressure sensor, glucose-monitoring sensor, and temperature sensor that are currently available in the market; these are affordable and can be procured by patients themselves for monitoring their health conditions at their homes or these could also be purchased by different healthcare facilities, hospitals, and so on. If any patient has a critical condition, different levels of alerts would be sent to the healthcare facilities or hospitals to which these patients are registered. 4.1.1 Concerns in Healthcare Regarding IIoT There are different healthcare concerns with respect to their implementation of IIoT. Populations are aging all over the world, different diseases are increasing, and medical expenses are also increasing. These are some of the generic healthcare challenges, but from an IIoT perspective as well. Catering to these requirements is also a challenge; scalability of IIoT solutions will have to be taken into consideration not only in terms of numbers, but also in terms of diversity. So, all generic healthcare challenges also have implications on IIoT implementation in the healthcare industry. 4.1.2 IIoT Implementation for Old Population Looking at the age groups, populations are growing older; between 2017 and 2050, the persons aged over 60 years are expected to increase more than double. By 2050, the number of elderly persons is expected to grow to 2.1 billion worldwide which is a huge number. We have a growing population and it will invite taking care of their health. Monitoring of elderly people’s health condition has to be done efficiently. So, telecare applications, smartphone, or telemedicine basically can help elderly people to live safely. So, we can have telemedicine solutions [11] being deployed in the homes of these elderly persons so that the doctors can remotely monitor the condition of these elderly people from their homes. This applies to not only elderly people but also other population. 4.1.3 IIoT Implementation for Increase in the Diseases Not only the number of diseases but also the types of diseases are increasing day by day. So, we need to have a suitable and efficient large-scale monitoring system that will cater to the particular problem and address that problem. So, nowadays, we talk about having telecare applications, smartphone applications, and telemedicine applications for elderly people. We are also talking about these kinds of solutions for catering to the other segments of the population. So, continuous monitoring of patients’ health can be done, and this can also help in reducing the number of cases of hospitalization. Sensors can collect blood pressure, respiration, pulse rate, heart rate data, and weight data continuously and as and when required; if any alarm has to be triggered, this can be done in a much more efficient manner, and this can be done if any abnormal solution is detected or any abnormality is going to arise in the future. 4.1.4 IIoT Reduces the Expenditure IIoT-based solutions for healthcare can help in reducing the expenditure; different wearable healthcare devices can help in reducing the cost of health checkup; remote continuous monitoring of patients using smart sensors would be made possible. In hospitals and other healthcare units, smart beds can be deployed which can send notification to the doctor about the patient’s activity. 4.1.5 Cloud-Enabled IIoT Healthcare Solution There are different layers in the IIoT healthcare architecture. It starts from acquiring the data from the sensors; at the very bottom; sending the sensed data; processing the data; storing the data and getting different information knowledge etc. about what is going on, underneath from the data and trying to make more sense out of the data, through information processing, knowledge processing and so on. Now we discuss the cloud-enabled IIoT healthcare architecture. On one end we are going to have all devices which are typically sensor enabled, i.e., the smart sensors and then some gateway. So, from these sensors, the data are going to be sent to the IoT-enabled cloud platform where different analytics will be performed. Not just analytics, but health data verification can be performed and the data can be stored and also processed in a computer or a computational resource in the cloud and so on. And there are lot of other different things that could also be done at the cloud and finally we are going to have this two-way communication and we are going to have healthcare applications which are going to be the beneficiaries from the cloud where analytics is performed. At the application end, different patient data about their health condition such as ECG, EMG, then may be pulse oximeter data, and many other different types of healthcare data could be made available after suitable processing and analytics. So, this is going to be the data flow architecture at very high level for healthcare IoT. 4.1.6 Benefits of IIoT in the Healthcare Now we discuss the benefits of IIoT in healthcare. With IIoT, one can monitor the patient’s health condition remotely. So, remote healthcare is possible. Remote real-time continuous monitoring of patients’ health condition 24 × 7 is possible. Hospital staff can predict the arrival of a patient in their emergency units; it is also possible to have a hygiene monitoring system which can detect the cleanliness of the hospital and the healthcare facility. Medical staff can provide quality medical services with a small budget using IIoT. So, these are some of the benefits that IIoT implementation in healthcare can provide. 4.2 IIoT-Based Healthcare Devices 4.2.1 Wireless ECG Monitors Wireless ECG monitors are there which can collect biosignals from ECG devices; the collected data could be sent to the cloud; and medical staff can analyze the health-related data in real time. In fact, we can have some programs which can autonomously analyze the data that are coming in and can send alerts. So, one example of a wireless IoT-enabled ECG sensor [12] is QardioCore. QardioCore is a wireless device for ECG monitoring. 4.2.2 Glucose Level Monitoring Device IIoT is very useful in glucose level monitoring [13], particularly for diabetes patients as they need to check the glucose level quite often. Particularly, the ones who have higher degrees of diabetes are required to check the blood sugar quite often. So, if we have an automated IoT-enabled system to which the patients can be fitted, then automatically the data from these different patients can be made available to doctors who are treating the diabetes patients and so on; an example of continuous glucose monitoring device is the Dexcom. Dexcom devices can help in continuous glucose monitoring. 4.2.3 IIoT-Based Blood Pressure Monitor Similarly, we have IIoT-based blood pressure monitors. Using IIoT devices the patient’s blood pressure is measured in real time. Doctors can monitor the patient’s blood pressure in real time; can get alerts if the blood pressure is beyond a particular threshold; and, depending on the blood pressure data, can prescribe medicines to the patients. One such example of blood pressure monitoring system is iHealth BP5. 4.2.4 IIoT-Based Body Temperature Sensor In body temperature monitors, wearable sensors are there to continuously monitor the human body temperature. This sometimes is very much required for some patients who are suffering from diseases which make the patients vulnerable to a sudden increase or sudden decrease in the body temperature. So, there are different body temperature sensors in the market. One such body temperature sensor is by Kinsa. So, they have their smart thermometer which is an IoT-based body temperature monitoring device. 4.2.5 IIoT-Based Asthma Treatment For oxygen saturation monitoring, particularly for asthma patients, this is very important; oxygen saturation can be monitored with the help of IoT devices such as pulse oximeter. So, pulse oximeter can help in measuring the oxygen saturation, so this pulse oximeter could be integrated with connectivity solutions such as Bluetooth, which can send continuously the data of the oxygen saturation level of the patient who is being monitored. 4.2.6 IoT-Based Contact Lenses IoT-based contact lenses are also there in the market. There are different IoT-based contact lenses which also offer Wi-Fi connectivity with smartphones so that the condition of the patient, their eye condition, their sugar level, etc. could also be monitored. 4.2.7 Smart Inhalers IoT-based asthma treatment solutions are already in the market. Smart inhalers are a very essential requirement of asthma patients, and hence they are being manufactured. ADAMM is an intelligent asthma monitoring device that has been developed. This particular device can keep track of the body temperature, coughing rate, heart rate, etc. which are preliminary symptoms of an asthma attack. 4.2.8 Smart Phone-Based Healthcare Solution Different smartphone-based healthcare solutions are already available. Smartphone devices connected to electronic devices such as sensors can help in collecting the data of patients. Smartphone is used to monitor the health of users and detect diseases. Smartphone healthcare apps provide low-cost healthcare devices which are sort of diagnostic apps that help in detecting the health condition of patients; it can also help in medical communication between the patients and the hospitals and can also offer medical education in the form of tutorials to the patients. 4.2.9 Smart Phone App: Health Assistant Health assistant is one such app which keeps track of the health condition of the patients. Google Fit is another solution which keeps track of different physical activities of the patient. ECG self-monitoring is another solution which serves as ECG device, based on the “ECG Self Check” software. 4.2.10 IIoT Healthcare Technology Different solutions can be explored that are there in terms of healthcare and IoT implementations in healthcare. Cloud is enabled together with big data because most of this data generated from these healthcare sensors have the nature of big data. So, cloud enablement, big data analytics, etc. are very important in IoT implementation in healthcare. 4.3 IIoT Healthcare Requirement and Challenges Security is of paramount importance in the healthcare sector. Privacy of individuals is very important because the data that is being carried forward from one device to another through a particular communication channel should not be hacked and unauthorized users should not be able to get access to the data. So, ensuring the confidentiality of the data, integrity of the data, authentication mechanisms and their implementation, and availability of the data are very important in terms of security requirements and their implementations in IIoT healthcare. IIoT healthcare has different challenges. There are challenges with respect to limited computational capability, not being able to perform expensive operations. There are hassles with respect to having very less device memory, energy limitation, and also taking care of the mobility of these different devices because the patients themselves are mobile. So, consequently, these devices themselves are wearable devices, and the sensors themselves are also mobile. Taking care of the mobility of these different devices from a technical point of view is a challenge; both from a communication and algorithmic point of view there are different challenges. So, taking care of all of them is important for consideration. 5 IIoT in Manufacturing Industries 5.1 Smart Factory Motivation for smart factory: Now we discuss the drawbacks of traditional manufacturing industries. The machines work in isolation; that is, these machines are not connected. And because of this reason, there is unbalanced workload in these different machines. There are other drawbacks like unavailability of real-time data, longer changeover time (converting a line or machine from running one product to another), and extending production time (lack of proper information and data of the production line). These drawbacks are removed in the smart factory with the implementation of IIoT. Smart factory involves machinery and equipment which improve processes through self-optimization and automation. Benefits of smart factory are as follows: supply of real-time data, data analysis and quality control, reduced changeover time, reduced production time, and flexibility and easy management. The manufacturing devices, equipment, workforce, supply chain, and work platform are internetworked and linked to accomplish smart production. The integration has to be done in order to reduce operational costs, improve the productivity of the worker, and reduce injuries at the workplace. The reason for using IIoT is to improve safety in the manufacturing plant. With the help of IIoT, resource optimization and waste reduction can also be achieved, which are also again very important aspects in industrial engineering. Let us now look at how the smart factory is going to work. So, at the very bottom we have the sensor-enabled tools and workers. They throw in a lot of data which are going to pass through the gateway to the cloud where further data analysis, data visualization, etc. are going to be done and the results are going to be made available to the respective stakeholders based on their corresponding policies. 5.2 Features of Smart Factory In a smart factory [14] we talk about connected devices which are going to send a lot of data in real time continuously. Optimized components and optimized data without any human intervention or with minimal human intervention are characteristics of a smart factory. Smart factory is transparent in the sense that we get a lot of live data on the metrics that are implemented and those data can be used suitably at different levels of management for quicker decision, and hence, transparency is also promoted in a smart factory. Proactive feature means that we know proactively we can predict the future outcomes and take preventive actions depending on the situation and what is going to happen in the future. So, based on the prediction of future outcomes one can take preventive actions proactively. So, all of these things are possible in a smart factory. Now we discuss smart factory applications. 5.3 Smart Factory Applications 5.3.1 Airbus: Factory of Future Airbus is a German company which is a state-of-the-art implementation of IIoT. So, Airbus is a major pair player in the aviation sector. It is a European aircraft manufacturer and it applies a lot of IoT technologies in its production process. So, essentially what happens is that during manufacturing productions on the floor of the plants and also after the products are deployed in a real aircraft, a lot of data can be collected. Further lot of data can be collected from the flight recorders while the flights are in operation. So, collecting data on flights will help to improve the in-flight experience and the workers on the factory floor can use these IoT devices to know about how much the manufacturing has processed, what are the different gaps, etc. in the process. So, Airbus is the digital manufacturing initiative which is also known as the factory of the future. So, in a factory of the future, we talk about different components, such as IoT sensors for supply-chain management. Now we discuss modular equipment; use of different robots, robotic arms, etc.; use of concepts of industrial augmented reality; use of computer vision; image processing and video processing in real time; and so on. Now we delve into the implementation of factory of the future; Airbus now has mechanisms for digital tracking and monitoring. There are tools and machines, and sensors are integrated into them. Further wearable sensors like smart glasses can be used with maybe augmented reality support. So, Airbus is using all of these different things for its implementation. 3D real-time visualization of the production process is possible and all of these things are deployed on A330 and A350 models and their assembly lines which are there in the Toulouse manufacturing plant; they have also deployed this factory of the future for the A400M model and their assembly operations in the UK. 5.3.2 Amazon: Robotic Shelves Amazon has robotic shelves, and as this name suggests, Amazon uses different types of robots that will carry these shelves and rearrange them. Amazon basically is an e-commerce company and these shelves and their rearrangement robotically are very important and that makes the processes much more autonomous and efficient. So, the good part of this thing is that because it is an autonomous robotic system, using this system, the robots can efficiently locate and search different items from different shelves. Thus, in 2014, the operating cost was cut down by 20% using these robotic shelves by Amazon. 5.3.3 Caterpillar: Augmented Reality App Caterpillar has the augmented reality (AR) app which is integrated with IoT; Caterpillar is a heavy equipment maker, and it has come up with the augmented reality app that generates end-to-end view of the factory floor. So, the machine operators can detect the need for tool replacement whenever it is required after viewing the end-to-end view through that particular AR app. This app sends instructions for doing things like tool replacement, air filter change, and fuel monitoring. Caterpillar has the IoT-driven ship maintenance that is done by their marine division. They use the shipboard sensors to perform predictive maintenance analytics. The sensors that are deployed can monitor generators, engines, GPS, air-conditioning systems, and fuel meters. The analysis of the sensed data provides useful insights with respect to the power usage of refrigerated containers, cost of hull cleaning, and optimized cleaning schedule and their data; these are all provided through the analysis of the data that are obtained through these different sensors that are deployed in the onboard devices of the ships. So, preventive maintenance analytics talks about the use of all these machine learning techniques. Tools and techniques like Python and Weka could be used to come up with these different predictive analytics and so on. It is used to have easier fault correction, reduced downtime, and increased profitability, using predictive maintenance analytics, and this is what Caterpillar is doing. 6 IoT and the Food Industry Before discussing implementation and application of IIoT in the food industry, we take a deep dive into the chain of activities to be followed in the food industry. 6.1 Field to Plate We first discuss what happens in the food industry. It starts with the agricultural field where the crops are grown. Farmers sow seeds, grow crops, apply fertilizers, apply pesticides, etc. and then after the crops get matured, these get harvested. Following harvesting, these food grains need to be processed and packaged. These packages are transported typically to a wholesale market. Then it goes to the retailer, and finally, the consumers buy, cook, and consume the agricultural produce. This is typically the chain from the agricultural field to the plate. So, this is typically the chain of activities that are followed; this is the supply chain because ultimately for each of the activities, the supply will have to be ensured through this entire cycle. So, in this kind of scenario, for each activity, sensors can be used; IIoT devices can be used in the agricultural field for monitoring the growth of crops and the sowing of seeds and for applying fertilizers precisely adequately. So, sensors, actuators, and different agricultural robots can be used over here. So, not only over here, even in harvesting, food grain processing, packaging, transportation, and logistics these could be used. The sensors and actuators help the systems or the machines that are helping in the activities to be much more efficient and autonomous. Now we discuss how IIoT is implemented in the food industry [12]. 6.2 Implementation of IIoT in the Food Industry IIoT is implemented in the food industry using three layers: sensing layer, communication layer, and application layer. These layers need to be internetworked. In the sensing layer, we have network sensors for food quality monitoring along the supply chain. The food grains go through the warehouses and the network sensors also monitor the temperature in those warehouses and also other environmental conditions. The communication layer deals with stakeholder access supply-chain data, communication between different stakeholders, and communication between different components of the supply chain. The application layer has applications for farmers, retailers, government, analysts, consumers, and insurance companies. We need sensors for doing many tasks like sensors for monitoring humidity, temperature, and composition of food products. The sensors throw a lot of data in real time which have to be analyzed in in order to make the most out of those data that have been retrieved. So, we need easier process control, increased food safety, etc. and it is also very important to have adequate end-to-end traceability. So, if we have the field to plate and the corresponding supply chain adequately implemented using suitable IoT solutions, then it would be possible for example to trace a rice packet back to the paddy field. 6.3 Impact of IoT on the Food Industry We now discuss the impact of IIoT in the food industry. We have an efficient production line as IoT monitors the equipment performance and detects the anomaly in the production line. This efficient production line enables the generation of real-time solutions by predictive maintenance. Using the temperature tracking sensors we can implement adequate, suitable, and efficient food safety measures. Also, we have Automatic Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (AHACCP) checklist, which ensures food safety. IIoT ensures transparency of the supply chain as the real-time data about the products are available, and it is easier to find the inefficiencies and meet the food safety regulations. We have minimized wastage of food resources, and we can analyze in real time, for example, the information of food products and reduce food wastage. So, all of these things are possible if we have IIoT implementation in the food industry. 6.3.1 Utilizing the IoT in the Farms On the farm we can have sensors to monitor weather, crop maturity, presence of insects, and conditions of the field with respect to the soil conditions, for example, how much soil moisture is there in the field, how much is the water level, how much is the fertilizer content of the field, and soil nutrient condition of the field. So, all of these things are possible with the help of IoT implementation in the food industry. 6.3.2 Utilizing the IoT in the Livestock Barns In the livestock barns, sensors can help in monitoring the health parameters of different animals such as cows, buffaloes, and different other livestock, including sheep and goats. So, all of the life monitoring in real time is done using IoT-enabled devices. Automated feeding cycles can be set up with the help of IoT implementation, and diet control of these different livestock is possible with the help of IoT implementation. Automated temperature control in the brooding barns and hatchery is also possible with the help of suitable IoT implementation. 6.3.3 Utilizing the IoT for Equipment in the Food Industry On the equipment level, IoT enables GPS tracking whenever these animals are moving around their exact location, and their position could be tracked. This is just an example; similarly, GPS could be used for tracking the mobility of different components in the food industry. Drone-assisted field monitoring applications in agriculture are quite common and are being implemented using IoT. 6.3.4 IoT for Maintenance in the Food Industry In the food industry, IoT implementation can be done for maintenance. Sensors are embedded in different machines, such as farm machinery and tractors, to monitor their condition and performance and to detect whether any machine is going to go down in the future. The early detection of warning signs, smart maintenance of these machines, and extending the lifetime of these equipment are possible with respect to maintenance in the food industry through IoT implementation. 6.3.5 IoT to Improve Margins in the Food Industry IoT implementation in the food industry can improve the margins through predictive analytics, spotting early warning signs, making well-informed decisions, and maximizing profits. 6.3.6 IoT for the Consumer For the consumer, there are different initiatives; smart label is an initiative by the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA), which uses a QR code to provide product-related information to consumers. These consumers consequently can get information about the ingredient details of a particular food item, allergen exposure of that particular food item, nutrition, value, and other information. 6.3.7 IoT for the Product in the Food Industry Consumers can scan the QR code to get details about the product; the product information includes nutrition, ingredients, allergens, third-party certification, social compliance programs, usage instructions, advisories, and also safe handling instructions. 6.3.8 IoT for the Food Processing Factory In the factory, IoT implementation can help different machineries in the food processing industry and also aid different workers who are working in the food processing industry to remain connected autonomously.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.

3.6. IoT Network Architectures and Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) for Real-Time Irrigation
Real-time irrigation management systems heavily rely on the efficient and reliable transmission of data from sensors and weather stations to the cloud for processing and decision-making. However, agricultural environments present unique challenges to wireless communication, including adverse weather conditions, physical obstacles, and the limitations of wireless technologies. These challenges necessitate robust and adaptive solutions to ensure the consistent and timely flow of data, enabling truly autonomous irrigation scheduling.
Environmental factors, such as heavy rain, fog, and strong winds, can significantly disrupt wireless communication by attenuating or even blocking radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance (Ed-daoudi et al., 2023; Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). Dense vegetation, buildings, and uneven terrain create further complications by causing multipath propagation and shadowing effects (Yim et al., 2018; Gautam and Pagay, 2020). The study by Yim et al. (2018) on LoRa networks in a tree farm environment exemplifies these challenges, revealing reduced communication range and data reliability compared to theoretical expectations. This underscores the need for carefully selecting and optimizing communication protocols and network parameters to ensure reliable data transmission in such environments.
The study by Guzinski et al. (2014a) using a modified TSEB model further highlights the importance of high-resolution data in accurately capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of energy fluxes influenced by environmental factors. This emphasizes the need for advanced data acquisition and processing techniques that can effectively represent the complexities of agricultural settings.
The limitations of traditional wireless communication technologies, such as limited range and network congestion, pose additional challenges for large-scale agricultural operations. Long-distance data transmission can be hindered by range limitations, while network congestion arising from numerous sensors transmitting concurrently can lead to delays and data loss, hindering real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). Addressing these challenges requires the exploration of advanced networking technologies that can optimize spectrum utilization, mitigate interference, and improve reliability and efficiency.
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) offer promising solutions for optimizing wireless communication in agricultural settings. CRNs empower devices with the ability to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). Research has explored the potential of CRNs in predicting Radio Frequency (RF) power to avoid noisy channels and optimize spectrum utilization (Iliya et al., 2014; Iliya et al., 2014). These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of combining optimization algorithms with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the accuracy and generalization of RF power prediction, enabling CRNs to make informed decisions about channel selection and avoid interference.
DSA complements CRN technology by dynamically allocating unused spectrum, further enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion (Shi et al., 2023). The numerical model developed by Shi et al. (2023) showcases the potential of CRNs and DSA for optimizing wireless communication in challenging environments.
The integration of CRNs and DSA into the IoT network architecture requires careful consideration of spectrum sensing techniques, network topology, and data security. Research on cooperative spectrum sensing suggests that distributed approaches, where sensor nodes collaborate and share information, can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectrum sensing, particularly in dynamic environments (Trigka and Dritsas, 2022; Khalid & Yu, 2019). This collaborative approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the radio environment and facilitates the identification of available frequency bands for data transmission.
The choice of network topology also impacts the performance and scalability of CRN-based irrigation systems. Mesh networks, where sensor nodes are interconnected and relay data for each other, offer enhanced resilience and coverage compared to star topologies where nodes communicate directly with a central gateway (Akyildiz & Vuran, 2010). However, mesh networks can be more complex to manage and may introduce additional routing overhead. The trade-off between network resilience and complexity needs to be carefully evaluated to select the most appropriate topology for a specific agricultural setting.
Data security and privacy are paramount concerns in IoT-based irrigation systems due to the sensitive nature of agricultural data (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential for protecting data integrity and ensuring system trustworthiness. Research on secure spectrum leasing and resource allocation algorithms for CR-WSN-based irrigation systems has demonstrated the potential of these technologies for enhancing security and efficiency (Hassan, 2023; Afghah et al., 2018).
In conclusion, the development of effective and reliable real-time irrigation management systems requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the challenges of data transmission in agricultural environments. The integration of robust and adaptive communication protocols, optimized network architectures, and advanced networking technologies like CRNs and DSA, along with a focus on data security and privacy, can contribute significantly to achieving the goal of autonomous and efficient irrigation scheduling.
4. AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN THE CLOUD
4.1. Data Quality and Preprocessing
Data quality is paramount in automated irrigation systems as it directly influences the effectiveness of decision-making and water use efficiency. Issues like missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers arising from sensor malfunctions, environmental interference, or network problems (Lv et al., 2023) can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models used for irrigation scheduling and management.
Real-time data cleaning techniques are essential for addressing these challenges. Kalman filtering proves particularly effective in handling missing values and correcting erroneous readings by recursively estimating the system's state based on previous measurements and current sensor data, taking into account noise and uncertainty (Kim et al., 2020). Moving average techniques, by averaging consecutive data points, provide a more stable representation of the underlying trend, filtering out short-term fluctuations (Chhetri, 2023). For outlier detection, adaptive thresholding methods offer a dynamic approach, adjusting thresholds based on the statistical properties of the data to effectively identify anomalies and minimize false positives (Bah et al., 2021). These techniques are crucial in maintaining the integrity of real-time data streams and ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analyses.
Adaptive data preprocessing is essential for managing the diversity of data sources and formats commonly found in irrigation systems. Data normalization techniques, such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization, ensure that all features contribute equally to the analysis by transforming data values to a common scale (Pradal et al., 2016). This is crucial for preventing features with larger values from dominating the analysis and ensuring that all features are given equal consideration. Similarly, feature scaling methods, like standardization or normalization, optimize the range of feature values to improve the performance and convergence of machine learning models (Tortorici et al., 2024). By scaling features to a similar range, the influence of outliers is reduced, and the model's ability to learn from the data is enhanced.
Data fusion techniques play a critical role in integrating information from diverse sources, creating a more comprehensive and reliable dataset for irrigation management. Dempster-Shafer theory, a generalization of probability theory, allows for the expression of both uncertainty and the degree of conflict in evidence, making it suitable for fusing uncertain and conflicting data from heterogeneous sources (Sadiq and Rodriguez, 2004). This is particularly relevant in irrigation systems where data from different sensors may provide slightly different or even contradictory information due to sensor variations or environmental factors. Bayesian inference offers another powerful framework for combining information from multiple sources, updating the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available. By applying these techniques, data from soil moisture sensors, canopy temperature sensors, weather stations, and other sources can be integrated to provide a holistic understanding of crop water requirements and environmental conditions, leading to more informed and accurate irrigation decisions.
The impact of data quality extends beyond model accuracy to the robustness of machine learning models under varying conditions. Robust models should maintain consistent performance even when faced with data inconsistencies or unexpected situations. Techniques like data augmentation and domain adaptation can enhance model robustness by exposing the model to a wider range of data variations during training. Data augmentation involves generating additional training data by applying transformations or introducing noise to existing data, making the model more resilient to noise and variations in the real-world data. Domain adaptation techniques aim to adapt a model trained on one domain (e.g., a specific crop or geographic location) to perform well on another domain with different data characteristics. This is particularly relevant in irrigation management, where models may need to be applied to different crops, soil types, or climatic conditions.
The choice of data cleaning, preprocessing, and fusion techniques should be carefully considered based on the specific characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data. By selecting and implementing appropriate techniques, the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of machine learning models can be significantly improved, leading to more efficient and sustainable irrigation management practices.
4.2. Scalable and Autonomous Deployment using Containerization Strategies
The transition from data collection and transmission to efficient data processing requires a robust infrastructure capable of handling diverse workloads and data volumes. Containerization technologies, specifically Docker and Kubernetes, offer a promising solution for deploying and scaling data processing and machine learning modules within cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). Docker provides a standardized way to package applications and their dependencies into self-contained units known as containers, ensuring consistent and reproducible execution across different platforms (Rosendo et al., 2022). Kubernetes, acting as a container orchestrator, manages their deployment, scaling, and networking across a cluster of machines (Rosendo et al., 2022). This combination presents several advantages for automated irrigation management systems.
Firstly, containerization facilitates efficient resource utilization and scalability. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies, containers enable the isolation of resources and prevent conflicts between different modules (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This isolation allows for the efficient allocation of resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to each container based on its specific needs. Kubernetes further enhances scalability by allowing for the automatic scaling of containers based on real-time demand, ensuring the system can adapt to varying workloads and data volumes, preventing bottlenecks, and ensuring responsiveness to changing conditions (Karamolegkos et al., 2023).
Secondly, containerization promotes portability and reproducibility. By packaging applications and their dependencies into a single unit, containers make it easy to move and deploy them across different cloud environments without the need for environment-specific configurations (Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This portability simplifies the development and deployment process, reducing the time and effort required to set up and manage the system. Additionally, containers ensure reproducibility by providing a consistent execution environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This eliminates variability and ensures that the system will behave consistently across different deployments (Zhou et al., 2023).
Optimizing container orchestration and resource allocation is crucial to minimizing latency and maximizing throughput in real-time data processing pipelines. Techniques like auto-scaling and dynamic resource allocation play a critical role in this context (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Werner and Tai, 2023; Kumar et al., 2024). Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of container instances based on real-time demand, ensuring that sufficient resources are available to handle peak workloads while avoiding over-provisioning during periods of low demand (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2024). Dynamic resource allocation enables the fine-grained adjustment of resources allocated to each container based on its specific needs and the current workload (Werner and Tai, 2023). This ensures efficient resource allocation and provides each container with the necessary resources to perform its tasks effectively.
Performance monitoring tools, such as Kubernetes Metrics Server and Prometheus, are essential for gaining insights into the performance of containers and the overall system (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kuity & Peddoju, 2023). These tools provide valuable data on key performance indicators, such as CPU and memory usage, network traffic, and application-specific metrics. By monitoring this data, administrators can identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation strategies, and continuously improve system performance (Hethcoat et al., 2024). This data-driven approach ensures that automated irrigation management systems can operate efficiently and reliably.
By integrating containerization technologies with optimization techniques and performance monitoring, automated irrigation management systems achieve the scalability, autonomy, and efficiency required for effective real-time data processing and decision-making. This approach facilitates a seamless and responsive system that can adapt to changing conditions and contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity.

4.3. Deploying ML Models for Data Processing
Transitioning from data collection, preprocessing, and transmission, the deployment of machine learning (ML) models marks a pivotal stage in the automated irrigation management pipeline. This stage entails utilizing cloud platforms to facilitate real-time data processing and inference, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimal irrigation management and ultimately contributing to fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
Several architectures and frameworks exist for deploying ML models on cloud platforms, each offering unique advantages and catering to different requirements. TensorFlow Serving, for instance, provides a high-performance system specifically designed for serving TensorFlow models (Abadi et al., 2016). This framework enables efficient and scalable inference, making it suitable for real-time applications where low latency and high throughput are crucial. For instance, in a large-scale irrigation system with numerous sensors generating data continuously, TensorFlow Serving can efficiently handle the high volume of inference requests and provide timely predictions for irrigation scheduling. Similarly, Apache MXNet Model Server offers a flexible and efficient solution for deploying models trained with MXNet, supporting a wide range of deep learning models and inference backends (MXNet Developers, 2015). This versatility makes it suitable for complex irrigation systems that may utilize different types of ML models for various tasks, such as predicting crop water requirements, detecting plant stress, or forecasting weather conditions. ONNX Runtime, on the other hand, provides a cross-platform inference engine compatible with various ML frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet (Microsoft, 2017). This versatility enables the deployment of models in diverse environments, facilitating interoperability and reducing the need for model conversion. For example, an irrigation system that uses models trained in different frameworks can utilize ONNX Runtime to deploy them on a single platform without the need for time-consuming and error-prone model conversion processes.
Choosing the appropriate architecture or framework depends on several factors, including the specific ML framework used for model training, the desired level of performance and scalability, and the need for cross-platform compatibility. For instance, if the primary concern is low latency and high throughput for real-time inference, TensorFlow Serving might be the optimal choice for TensorFlow models. However, if flexibility and support for various deep learning models are required, Apache MXNet Model Server could be more suitable. In cases where cross-platform compatibility is essential, ONNX Runtime offers a versatile solution.
Once the ML model is deployed, optimizing its performance and resource utilization becomes crucial for ensuring the efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems. Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, offer effective methods for reducing the size and computational requirements of ML models without compromising accuracy (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Pruning involves eliminating unnecessary connections or neurons from the model, effectively streamlining its structure and reducing computational complexity. This can be particularly beneficial for deep learning models, which often have a large number of parameters and can be prone to overfitting. By removing redundant or less important connections, pruning can improve modelgeneralizability and reduce inference time. Quantization, on the other hand, involves reducing the precision of model parameters, typically from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower-precision formats such as 8-bit integers. This reduction in precision leads to smaller model sizes and faster inference speeds, making it particularly beneficial for resource-constrained environments or real-time applications. For instance, in edge computing scenarios where ML models are deployed on devices with limited computational resources, quantization can enable efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, hardware acceleration through the utilization of GPUs or TPUs can significantly enhance model performance by leveraging specialized hardware designed for parallel processing (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). GPUs, with their massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth, excel at accelerating matrix operations and convolutions, which are fundamental computations in many deep learning models. This acceleration can significantly reduce inference time and enable real-time processing of sensor data for timely irrigation decisions. TPUs, specifically designed for deep learning workloads, offer even greater performance and energy efficiency for specific model architectures. These hardware accelerators can drastically reduce inference time, enabling near real-time decision-making and enhancing the responsiveness of automated irrigation systems. For example, in a scenario where immediate response to changing weather conditions or soil moisture levels is critical, hardware acceleration can ensure that irrigation decisions are made and executed promptly.
In addition to model compression and hardware acceleration, distributed training techniques play a crucial role in optimizing the training process for large-scale ML models. Techniques such as Horovod and BytePS enable the distribution of training across multiple machines, effectively parallelizing the process and reducing training time (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). This is particularly beneficial for complex models with a large number of parameters or when dealing with large datasets. By leveraging distributed training, irrigation management systems can train more sophisticated models and improve their predictive capabilities, leading to more accurate and efficient irrigation decisions. For instance, a system that utilizes a deep learning model with millions of parameters can benefit from distributed training to reduce training time from days to hours, enabling faster model iteration and improvement.
Integrating the deployed ML models with other components of the automated irrigation management pipeline is essential for achieving a fully autonomous and cohesive system and addressing the need for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system. Standardized protocols, such as MQTT and CoAP, provide lightweight and efficient communication channels for exchanging data between these components (Poojara et al., 2023; Jimenez et al., 2020a; Gour et al., 2023). MQTT, with its publish-subscribe architecture, enables real-time data streaming and event-driven communication, making it suitable for transmitting sensor data, control signals, and inference results (Raikar & M, 2023). This enables the ML model to receive real-time updates on soil moisture, weather conditions, and plant health, allowing for dynamic adjustments to irrigation schedules based on the latest data. CoAP, designed for constrained devices and low-power networks, offers a web-transfer protocol for resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient communication between sensors, actuators, and the ML models (Raikar & M, 2023). This is particularly relevant in situations where sensors or actuators have limited processing power or battery life, as CoAP minimizes communication overhead and energy consumption. Additionally, RESTful APIs provide a standardized interface for accessing and controlling the ML models, enabling seamless integration with other software components and facilitating system management and monitoring (Wang et al., 2022). This allows for easy integration with existing farm management systems or third-party applications, creating a unified platform for comprehensive irrigation management.4.4. Online Learning in the Cloud
The complexities of real-time data processing in irrigation management necessitate the exploration of advanced techniques to continuously learn and adapt to the dynamic nature of agricultural environments. Online learning algorithms offer a promising solution, enabling the continuous update and improvement of machine learning models based on incoming real-time data. This adaptability is crucial for addressing the challenges of changing environmental conditions, such as weather patterns and crop growth stages, and optimizing irrigation decision-making to enhance water usage efficiency and crop productivity.
Several online learning algorithms have demonstrated potential for real-time data processing and model adaptation in the context of irrigation management. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) facilitates the incremental update of model parameters with each new data point, allowing for efficient adaptation to changing data distributions (Bottou, 2010). This incremental learning process ensures that the model remains responsive to the latest conditions, minimizing the risk of outdated predictions and improving the accuracy of irrigation decisions. Passive-Aggressive algorithms, on the other hand, adjust model parameters only when a misclassification occurs, providing a computationally efficient approach for handling large data streams (Crammer et al., 2006). These algorithms offer a robust approach to handling noisy data, a common challenge in real-world sensor readings, by making small adjustments only when the model's prediction deviates significantly from the actual value (Fei et al., 2019). Online Random Forests extend the concept of random forests to the online setting, enabling the incremental construction and update of decision trees as new data arrives (Saffari et al., 2009). The continuous evolution of the ensemble ensures that the model remains relevant to the changing environment, capturing intricate relationships between variables and leading to more informed irrigation decisions.
Research in various domains highlights the importance of online learning for real-time data stream analytics. Snyder et al. (2020) explored the application of online learning techniques for identifying relevant tweets in real-time, improving situational awareness for first responders. The proposed interactive learning framework allows users to continuously label the relevance of incoming tweets, enabling the real-time refinement of the underlying machine learning model. This user-guided approach aligns well with the dynamic nature of irrigation management, where models need to continuously adjust to varying environmental conditions and crop water requirements. Similarly, research in the field of cyber-physical systems (CPS) underscores the need for online learning algorithms to effectively extract insights and knowledge from continuously generated data streams (Fei et al., 2019). These capabilities are crucial for enabling feedback loops between physical processes and cyber elements, facilitating the integration and optimization of CPS in irrigation management systems.
To implement online learning in cloud-based irrigation management systems, various architectures and frameworks can be considered. Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis provide scalable and fault-tolerant platforms for processing real-time data streams, allowing for the development of online learning pipelines that continuously ingest and analyze data to update machine learning models (Zaharia et al., 2012; Carbone et al., 2015; Amazon Web Services, 2023). These frameworks leverage serverless computing paradigms, automatically scaling resources based on the volume and velocity of incoming data, ensuring efficient resource utilization and responsiveness to fluctuations in demand (Fei et al., 2019).
Effectively managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off is crucial for optimizing online learning in irrigation management. Techniques such as Multi-armed bandits (Sutton & Barto, 2018), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018) can be employed to balance the allocation of resources between exploring new irrigation strategies and exploiting the current best-performing approaches. These techniques enable the identification of optimal irrigation policies, adapting to changing environmental conditions and maximizing long-term rewards.
In conclusion, online learning techniques, coupled with scalable cloud-based architectures, offer a powerful solution for real-time data processing and continuous adaptation in irrigation management systems. By leveraging algorithms like SGD, Passive-Aggressive, and Online Random Forests, along with stream processing frameworks like Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis, irrigation management systems can effectively handle the complexities of real-time data, optimize water usage, and enhance crop productivity in the face of dynamic environmental conditions.

5. GENERATING AND APPLYING IRRIGATION INSIGHTS 
5.1. Real-Time Generation of Actionable Irrigation Insights
The transition from data collection and processing to actionable irrigation insights requires the extracting spatial features from images, allowing for the analysis of satellite or drone imagery to assess crop health, detect water stress, and provide insights into irrigation needs (Os deployment of advanced predictive models capable of generating precise and site-specific irrigation recommendations.roosh et al., 2016).
Furthermore, the integration Deep learning models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and of data from diverse sources, including IoT sensors and cloud-based platforms, plays Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have demonstrated excellent performance in capturing complex relationships a critical role in enhancing the accuracy and resolution of real-time irrigation insights. Data fusion techniques, such as Kalman filtering, offer a robust approach for combining information between input variables and predicting crop water requirements (Keller, 2023; Naphade et al., 2022). These models can effectively from multiple sensors, accounting for noise and uncertainty, and providing a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements (Cohen et al., 2005; Mö handle the temporal dependencies present in time-series data, such as soil moisture andeller et al., 2007). By integrating data from soil moisture weather data, and learn to predict future water needs based on historical patterns and current sensors, weather stations, and remote sensing platforms, ML models can generate more accurate conditions. Ensemble methods, such as Random Forests, also offer a robust approach to and site-specific irrigation recommendations, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity prediction by combining multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce the risk of overfitting.
The heterogeneity, uncertainty, and quality issues inherent in real-time data streams require careful consideration and the implementation of effective strategies to ensure the reliability of generated (Singh et al., 2016).
The integration of irrigation insights. Data preprocessing techniques, such as outlier detection and missing value imputation, IoT sensor data with cloud-based data sources is crucial for enhancing the accuracy and resolution of irrigation insights. IoT sensors, such as soil moisture probes and weather stations are essential for preparing the data for analysis and preventing erroneous data from influencing the model, provide real-time, localized data on crop and environmental conditions, while cloud's predictions (Fiksel, 2003). Additionally,-based sources, such as weather forecasts and satellite imagery, offer broader spatial and the selection of appropriate ML models and data fusion techniques should be tailored to the specific temporal perspectives (López-Morales et al., 2020). characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data to mitigate uncertainty and ensure the robustness Data fusion techniques, such as Kalman filtering, play a critical role in combining these of generated insights.
To address computational complexity and latency challenges in real-time irrigation insight generation, techniques such as edge computing, model compression, and hardware accelerators heterogeneous data sources to generate more accurate and comprehensive irrigation recommendations (Cohen et al., offer promising solutions. Edge computing enables the distribution of processing tasks closer to the data 2005; Möeller et al., 2007 source, reducing latency and enabling faster response times (Mishra, 20). By incorporating data from multiple sources, irrigation models can better account for spatial variability20; Zhang et al., 2020). Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, can significantly reduce the size and computational requirements of in soil moisture, microclimate conditions, and crop water requirements, leading to more ML models without compromising accuracy, making them suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge precise and efficient irrigation scheduling.
The seamless integration of ML-generated insights with IoT-enabled irrigation control systems requires the adoption of appropriate architectures and protocols that facilitate devices (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Hardware lightweight, real-time communication. The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT accelerators, such as GPUs and TPUs, provide specialized hardware designed for parallel processing) protocol and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are well-suited, enabling faster inference speeds and facilitating real-time data analysis (Premkumar for this purpose, offering efficient and reliable communication channels for exchanging data between sensors, & Sigappi, 2022). The combined utilization of these techniques can significantly improve the efficiency and responsiveness of real-time irrigation insight generation, contributing actuators, and ML models (Muangprathub et al., 2019; Osroosh et al., 2016). to the overall goal of achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
The implementation MQTT's publish-subscribe architecture enables real-time data streaming and event- of these strategies and techniques for real-time generation of actionable irrigation insights provides a solid foundation for developing automated and data-driven irrigation management systems that can effectively addressdriven communication, while CoAP's lightweight design and low overhead make it suitable the global food challenge by optimizing water resource utilization and maximizing agricultural productivity.
for resource-constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks. By utilizing these protocols, irrigation systems can achieve seamless integration between ML models and IoT devices, enabling the automated application of irrigation insights based on real-time data and predictions.
Industry-leading products and services for smart irrigation demonstrate the practical application of these technologies. Smart irrigation controllers, such as Rachio, leverage weather data and soil moisture sensors to automatically adjust irrigation schedules based on real-time conditions, reducing water waste and promoting water conservation (Verdouw et al., 2023). Cloud-based irrigation management platforms, such as CropX, offer advanced analytics and decision support tools, providing farmers with insights into crop water requirements, soil health, and irrigation performance (Weikmann et al., 2023). These platforms often incorporate machine learning algorithms to generate predictive models and provide farmers with data-driven recommendations for optimizing irrigation strategies.
The analysis of these products and services highlights the growing trend toward data-driven, automated irrigation management. By integrating IoT, machine learning, and cloud computing, these solutions enable farmers to make more informed and efficient irrigation decisions, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture.

Abstract: The construction industry has witnessed an increase in the use of digital tools and smart
solutions, particularly in the realm of building energy automation. While realising the potential
beneﬁts of smart cities, a broader scope of smart initiatives is required to support the transition from
smart buildings towards smart neighbourhoods, which are considered critical urban development
units. To support the interplay of smart solutions between buildings and neighbourhoods, this study
aimed to collect and review all the smart solutions presented in existing scientiﬁc articles, the technical
literature, and realised European projects. These solutions were classiﬁed into two main sections,
buildings and neighbourhoods, which were investigated through ﬁve domains: building-energy-
related uses, renewable energy sources, water, waste, and open space management. The quantitative
outcomes demonstrated the potential beneﬁts of implementing smart solutions in areas ranging
from buildings to neighbourhoods. Moreover, this research concluded that the true enhancement of
energy conservation goes beyond the building’s energy components and can be genuinely achieved
by integrating intelligent neighbourhood elements owing to their strong interdependencies. Future
research should assess the effectiveness of these solutions in resource conservation.
Keywords: smart building; smart energy grid; smart energy management; neighbourhood building
stock; sustainable development goals
1. Introduction
The provision of sustainable energy has become the main priority of developing
and developed countries, particularly European Union members, which are among the
top fossil-fuel-importing countries in the world. According to a Statista report, Europe
imported approximately 13.5 million barrels of oil per day in 2021 [1]. Owing to the
large amount of carbon dioxide and other harmful environmental emissions it releases,
the construction industry has earned a reputation as a serious contributor to global cli-
mate change. Furthermore, vintage buildings and inefﬁcient construction materials in the
historic neighbourhoods of European countries have spurred a greater need for energy,
making them major energy-intensive sectors [2]. These concerns have imposed pressure on
European governments and energy markets to seek cost-effective solutions that strike a
balance between reducing energy consumption and decarbonising construction activities.
Subsequently, in recent years, the construction industry has discovered that the applica-
tion of digital technologies and smart solutions is a promising approach to reduce the
environmental repercussions of buildings and improve the quality of life of residents [3].
The implementation of smart systems utilising information and communication tech-
nologies (ICT) can create excellent opportunities to deliver different building- and urban-
scale services through an integrated set of smart grids and address the existing challenges
hindering the achievement of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) [4]. Technically,
when smart and intelligent tools aim to meet sustainability objectives, they can be inter-
preted within the domain of smart sustainability (also known as digital sustainability).

Therefore, an inclusive program intended to introduce the application of these tools must
cover all the committed goals, such as economic, environmental, social, and cultural norms
and spiritual values [5,6].
Generally, with the advancement of technology towards digitalisation and smarter
devices, more daily activities are being affected by computer tools and intelligent devices.
This evolution has caused a signiﬁcant shift towards more automated and connected ways
of living, and increased dependency between humans and technologies [7]. Meanwhile,
technologies such as smart grids, machine-learning approaches, the Internet of Things
(IoT), and artiﬁcial intelligence are clear examples that have transformed daily routines
and construction activities in different socioeconomic and environmental contexts [8].
These emerging technologies have added value to urban management by introducing
novel methods of responding to urban needs (e.g., distributed energy generation from
renewable sources and storage facilities that simplify the response to demand) [9]. With
these technological advancements, every point and subject can be read and analysed using
sensors, cameras, and software, which is a signiﬁcant component of an IoT network. It has
been alleged [10] that by the year 2030, more than 50 billion devices will be connected to
the IoT network, and approximately 52% of users will use smart and digital systems to
improve their activities. Therefore, connecting different nodes and elements of smart cities
to the Internet is an essential requirement that should be considered in every smart city [11].
Although the myriad beneﬁts of creating these data ﬂows have not yet been fully realised,
they are widely regarded as the cornerstone of the transition towards the true development
of a smart and efﬁcient city [4]. In other words, digitalisation and smart systems can provide
many beneﬁcial tools, and their utilisation should be examined to ensure their alignment
with sustainable objectives and to avoid their designation for frivolous purposes [12].
Integrating ICT technologies with building and urban elements has introduced new
interactive features to European energy markets, such as dynamic responses to residents’
needs and the ﬂexible adjustment of system operations with respect to their internal and
external conditions [13]. Similarly, enabling buildings to intelligently optimise their energy
usage based on time-of-use electricity tariffs and residents’ energy demands has become
one of the leading perspectives in this sector [14,15]. For instance, Ref. [16] highlighted
the signiﬁcance of transitioning from conventional building energy design to the deploy-
ment of smart heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems that manage
energy demand and generation according to weather conditions, energy grid balance,
and residents’ needs. This paradigm shift in the building automation process requires a
detailed technical guide to deﬁne and clarify the required smart readiness levels, thereby
enabling data transfer and management in an integrated building energy system. To this
end, the European Commission (EC) developed the Smart Readiness Indicator (SRI), a
comprehensive descriptor in the Clean Energy for All Europeans package, to deﬁne and
support smart elements that can be deployed in smart buildings. The SRI report presents a
classiﬁcation of building components that can be automated at different levels to provide
more efﬁcient energy operations [17].
However, various research gaps in this context must be investigated. One of the
main limitations of using the SRI is that there is no practical or enlightening example
to demonstrate the potential percentage of energy reductions that might be obtained by
applying the automation list. This lack of a numerical evaluation of the energy performance
of smartened buildings may cause discouraging confusion among stakeholders who have
no perspective on the ﬁnal performance of the project. Moreover, alongside the building-
scale initiatives outlined in the SRI, there is a broad spectrum of smart solutions at higher
scales that can support energy conservation, the integration of renewable energy, and other
live elements of the community, which must be considered. However, there is no technical
benchmark similar to the SRI that supports these smart initiatives at the community level
in a practical manner.

To bridge these research gaps, with a speciﬁc reference to projects at the neighbourhood
scale, which is considered the most important and practical scale of urban development [18],
this research investigates diverse smart solutions and innovative technologies that can
support the attainment of global sustainable programmes (i.e., the SDGs) and energy
optimisation, both at the building and neighbourhood scales. One of the novelties and
contributions of this study is the deﬁnition of a clear boundary to conﬁne the domains
and elements that can be smartened across the neighbourhood building stock. Moreover,
presenting the potential achievements obtained through these smart solutions stimulates
the integration of all the elements through the use of ICT. Clarifying the actual deﬁnition of
smart solutions allows us to distinguish them from common sustainability measurements
that have been widely carried out in this context. To this end, a literature review was
conducted to collect, from scientiﬁc papers, the technical literature, and European projects,
all the smart solutions that could be applied at the neighbourhood scale. The structure of
this paper is as follows: The methodology of this research is explained in Section 2. Section 3
explores the multifaceted aspects of utilising the collected smart solutions in six community-
scale domains, further classiﬁed into different smart solutions. Finally, Section 4 concludes
and summarises the overview and perspectives obtained from this research.
2. Methodology
There are numerous types of literature reviews, including systematic, cumulative,
developmental, and narrative [19]. The ﬁrst type is used when theoretical objectives and
boundaries can be established in advance to eliminate bias and obtain a more reliable set
of ﬁndings. Cumulative reviews aim to summarise the ﬁndings of papers that focus on
speciﬁc topics, and they often help identify research gaps in the literature. Developmental
reviews track the evolutionary trend of a particular issue. Finally, a narrative literature
review provides an overview of studies conducted on a particular topic without strict
restrictions on the inclusion or exclusion of articles [20].
The methodology used in this study was based on a combination of narrative and sys-
tematic literature reviews. As the main objective of this research is to present an elaboration
of the use of smart solutions that can be applied across the neighbourhood building stock,
it begins by searching scientiﬁc articles, the technical literature, and EU projects to ﬁnd
existing smart solutions, which are almost always accompanied by the deployment of novel
technologies. In this study, the deﬁnition of a smart solution is based on the concept of a
smart system. To perform smart actions, a smart system incorporates sensing, actuation,
and control functions based on data collected from internal and external sources. As there is
no scientiﬁc benchmark to conﬁdently determine smart solutions that can be implemented
in a neighbourhood, a narrative literature review was conducted to initially encompass all
disciplines, the management of which can be bounded in this context.
In the following step, all the smart solutions that can be implemented at the building
and neighbourhood scales are separated and thematically classiﬁed into ﬁve domains,
namely, building-energy-related uses, renewable energy sources (RESs), water, waste, and
open space management, which are widely discussed in many sustainability protocols. The
collection of smart solutions in the search process is based on the answer to the following
three research questions (RQs) respecting the sustainability performance of each domain:
(i) Which smart solutions can improve each domain? (ii) How can smart solutions improve
each domain? (iii) To what extent can these smart solutions improve each domain?
In the following steps, certain ﬁltrations are adapted to exclude smart solutions that
are beyond the scope of this study. For instance, although many sustainability protocols
deal with improving the economic or mobility elements of a neighbourhood, these issues
cannot be incorporated in this context. In addition, there are many neighbourhood planning
and regeneration initiatives that may enhance the quality of the neighbourhood’s elements

(e.g., proximity of facilities and bus stations). However, based on the above-mentioned
deﬁnition of smartness, they cannot be considered smart and should be excluded. Figure 1
schematically illustrates the methodology used in this study.

cannot be incorporated in this context. In addition, there are many neighbourhood plan-
ning and regeneration initiatives that may enhance the quality of the neighbourhood’s 
elements (e.g., proximity of facilities and bus stations). However, based on the above-men-
tioned definition of smartness, they cannot be considered smart and should be excluded. 
Figure 1 schematically illustrates the methodology used in this study. 
 
Figure 1. Schematic steps for the inclusion and exclusion of smart solutions. 
It should be clarified that the smart solutions collected in this research aimed to de-
livering a series of smart services that not only enhance human intervention to make 
smarter decisions but also improve energy conservation (e.g., smart parking systems that 
steer drivers towards empty slots and reduce the time of use of cars, a smart irrigation 
system that controls sprinkler operation based on plant needs and reduces energy con-
sumption related to water use). 
Finally, smart solutions are organised in thematic order to highlight the constituent 
elements of each domain, which are also emphasised in different references. Although the 
availability and advancement of existing smart solutions have not been consistently ad-
dressed within different domains, a comprehensive review of the collected documents 
demonstrates a relative consensus among researchers and urban developers regarding the 
importance of certain classifications. Moreover, the description given for each smart solu-
tion may cover either digital ICT technologies (e.g., optimisation algorithms in design, 
communication protocols, and mobile applications), physical devices (e.g., sensors and 
digital screens), or the integration thereof (e.g., smart thermostats). The description also 
includes some examples of the implementation of smart solutions, presented in tables, to 
compare their potential benefits with their corresponding base-run scenarios, which are 
almost all non-smart approaches. 
3. Results and Discussion 
This section presents smart solutions that have been applied in building and neigh-
bourhood contexts to boost energy conservation in a smart manner. The findings collected 
from the literature review are organised into two main sections, building-energy-related 
uses and neighbourhood scales, which are further classified into different domains and 
smart solutions. As shown in Figure 2, each domain is investigated using one or more 
smart solutions.

conservation (e.g., reducing water consumption and simultaneously reducing the energy
required to deliver water), and smart solutions are strictly divided based on the primary

3.1. Smart Solutions for Buildings Energy-Related Uses
With the rapid growth in the urban population, it is estimated that energy consump-
tion in the building sector will increase by approximately 65% by 2050. A study [21]
demonstrated that approximately 50% of the total energy consumption in public buildings
is related to HVAC systems. The authors of [22] also claimed that the average energy
consumption of residential buildings for heating, domestic hot water (DHW), cooling,
and lighting was 27.3%, 13.1%, 11.8%, and 7.2%, respectively. The lack of reliability in
conventional energy management plans and the manual collection of data related to energy
consumption are among the critical obstacles to upgrading building energy systems. In
addition to the residents’ misbehaviour in the use of energy systems, the low thermal
performance and poor quality of building envelopes have often brought about overheating
risks or caused high energy consumption due to overcooling. From another perspective,
other possible factors, such as the installation of faulty elements, inappropriate adjustment
of energy systems, and poor maintenance of equipment, may also lead to a large amount of
energy wastage from buildings [23]. In this regard, different control systems and strategies
have been proposed to mitigate the operating time, energy consumption, and costs across
all elements.
3.1.1. Smart HVAC System
The ultimate goal of smart HVAC systems is to maintain a comfortable indoor envi-
ronment in terms of temperature and air quality with minimal energy consumption [24].
Previously, the utilities used to create comfortable indoor environments were limited to
Energies 2023, 16, 5701

heating and cooling functions. Indeed, the incorporation of the thermostat and control
system allowed for HVAC systems to operate more efﬁciently. Since then, the introduction
of communication technologies to the heating and cooling equipment circuit boards has
enabled them to operate more intelligently. In this case, instead of relying on manual control
or rigid settings for heating and cooling operations, which often lead to overheating or
overcooling in indoor spaces, smart HVAC systems can intelligently adjust their operation
based on data collected from the surrounding environment, such as indoor temperature,
outdoor temperature, and number of occupants [25].
In particular, for smart ventilation systems, the concept of demand-controlled ventila-
tion (DCV) was introduced to specify the response to the temporal or spatial ventilation
needs [26]. DCV strategies can be classiﬁed based on the types of sensors, control al-
gorithms, and building regulations [27]. Similarly, Ref. [28] proposed a classiﬁcation of
different ventilation control strategies, including variables such as outdoor temperature,
zone occupancy, predicted or measured exposure to contaminants, zonal control (single or
multiple zones), dynamic or ﬁxed direction, and rate of airﬂow (exhaust, supply, balance).
For instance, Ref. [29] developed a control system to monitor local occupancy, grid signals,
and outdoor temperature. This smart ventilation system, designed for residential buildings
in California, achieved a 20% energy reduction and delivered demand response beneﬁts. A
comparison of different types of DCV strategies, which include occupancy and contaminant
trackers [30], shows that smart ventilation scenarios developed based on zonal control
and unzoned control (i.e., supplying the entire dwelling) can reduce energy consumption
by approximately 20% and 7%, respectively. The authors of [31] developed an outdoor-
temperature-based smart ventilation control strategy to maintain the equivalent indoor air
quality, aligned with ASHRAE 62.2-2013; the implementation of this DCV on a two-story
residential building delivered an up to 6% reduction in annual energy use. The authors
of [32] developed smart ventilation strategies for humidity control, and applied them
to near-zero-energy buildings. This study, which evaluated ten smart control strategies
across six types of climatic conditions, revealed that smart control systems could reduce the
fraction of annual hours of relative humidity (RH) from above to below 60% (in the worst
climatic conditions, it was approximately 16%). The authors of [33] developed different
smart ventilation strategies based on occupancy detection and auxiliary fans, demonstrat-
ing that the energy savings obtained from occupancy control were not signiﬁcant owing to
the intensiﬁed recovery period required when residents returned home (i.e., up to double
the rate of airﬂow). Concerning the intensiﬁed operation of the ventilation system after re-
occupancy, Ref. [34] stated that the energy performance of the occupancy-based ventilation
control could be improved if the control strategy automatically turned on the ventilation
system at a normal level before the residents’ arrival time.
Although the results obtained from these strategies can vary between different climatic
conditions [35], smart ventilation systems often provide signiﬁcant energy savings in all
situations, except for climates with fewer seasonal temperature variations.
In light of this trend, based on the speciﬁc goal of the control system, the following
parameters can be obtained from sensors installed indoors and outdoors and signals in en-
ergy grids: (i) occupancy, (ii) air quality conditions (e.g., parameters such as humidity and
temperature), (iii) electricity grid status, (iv) contaminants, and (v) the operation of HVAC
systems (e.g., fans, ﬂow rates, and velocity) [35]. Figure 3 shows an example of the general
components of the smart HVAC system. To model smart ventilation systems, the recom-
mended values and ranges of the following contextual parameters were obtained based on
the daily events and activities of households and extracted from the cited standards and
guidelines: occupancy, CO2 [36], moisture [37], particles [38], generic contaminants [39],
and weather conditions [40]. Table 1 illustrates some examples of smart components of
HVAC systems.

3.1.2. Smart Water Management in Buildings
The ultimate goal of smartening water systems in buildings is to measure water ﬂow
characteristics and optimise them based on user needs and behaviour. Generally, water
consumption can be curbed at a large scale (i.e., infrastructural actions and regulations)
Energies 2023, 16, 5701
8 of 35
and individual conservation scale (i.e., building and community efforts). At the building
scale, this can be achieved through the use of advanced meters based on ultrasonic or elec-
tromagnetic readings that provide more accurate data (e.g., potential leakages and amount
of water consumption) than conventional meters [48,49]. The authors of [50,51] underlined
three initiatives that can be achieved by deploying smart water meters: (i) increasing the
community awareness of water value, (ii) billing and alternative pricing schemes, and
(iii) forecasting water consumption, which results in water and energy preservation. The
authors of [52] suggested the use of an in-home display (IHD) to provide real-time feedback
to users, resulting in a 16% reduction in water consumption. The authors of [53] also used
IHDs to notify users when consumption exceeded predeﬁned limitations and consequently
led to a 23% reduction in water use.
In addition to precise measurements, smart water systems designed for buildings
incorporate intelligent control systems that automatically adjust the desired temperature
and volume of water based on consumption patterns, ensuring that water is used appro-
priately while minimising energy consumption. By dynamically adapting these to user
requirements, these systems can optimise water usage without compromising comfort or
convenience [54]. Indeed, in addition to the adaptation of well-established measures, such
as the insulation of pipelines, careful planning of draw-off points, and use of renewable en-
ergies, there are smart solutions to improve the energy efﬁciency of DHW systems [55–57].
The authors of [58] reported that, among the types of energy consumed in the European
building stock, the energy required for heating and DHW accounted for 64% and 15% of
the total energy, respectively. According to this study, resident behaviour and lifestyle have
a more signiﬁcant impact on energy consumption than the type of heat source. To address
this issue, Ref. [55] proposed the application of submeters, also known as the individual
metering and charging (IMC) of hot water, as a potential solution in a multifamily case
study in Poland, and achieved a 20% reduction in the use of DHW. To measure the amount
of water accurately, it is necessary to install different sensors and auxiliary devices to
collect and transfer data with high accuracy in a short time, particularly when RESs are
used to supply the heating required for DHW [55]. An example of a smart solution in this
ﬁeld is presented in [59], which measured the impact of the data collection interval on
energy consumption and found that by reducing the interval from 1 min to 6 s, the energy
required for peak demand could be reduced by 40%. DHW meters typically quantify
and demonstrate the total household consumption that is suitable for calculating bills.
Using individual smart sub-meters provides the possibility of transmitting interpretable
real-time information to residents, which can signiﬁcantly reduce their consumption [60,61].
According to [55], the most critical value that can be obtained by a DHW smart meter is the
caloriﬁc value required for supplying hot water, which requires typical equipment such
as temperature sensors, ﬂow meters, computing cores, and communication sectors. This
study also introduced other important data that can be collected from servers, such as
water temperature and time synchronisation, which can be analysed to deliver valuable
information such as endpoints, discarded energy, ﬂow, accumulated, and instantaneous en-
ergy. Moreover, Refs. [50,51] underlined three initiatives that can be achieved by deploying
smart water meters: (i) increasing community awareness of water value, (ii) billing and
alternative pricing schemes, and (iii) forecasting water consumption. Smart water metering
can pave the way towards more ﬂexible water pricing methods and resource management.
The authors of [62] claimed that the remote control of boilers equipped with smart
sensors helps determine consumption patterns in advance (i.e., the desired temperature,
required volume of water, and time of use), which results in water and energy savings.
According to [63], which highlighted the 50% heat loss in conventional DHW systems
with storage tanks, an efﬁcient effort has been the 4th-generation district heating, which
circulates hot water at lower temperatures and subsequently lowers energy use. However,
one of the main challenges of low-temperature district heating (LTDH) is the increased
risk of Legionella growth [64]. To solve this problem, Ref. [65] suggested using dual-
functional residential thermal stations (RTS), in which standby loss is eliminated and the
Energies 2023, 16, 5701
9 of 35
energy provided for the heating system is also used for DHW. In these systems, the control
methods of electric tracing can signiﬁcantly affect the ﬁnal performance of the system.
Table 2 presents several examples of the application of novel ideas and smart solutions
to smarten and enhance the water management system, along with the corresponding
beneﬁts that are claimed to be achievable through this approach.

3.1.3. Smart Lighting Systems
The ultimate goal of smart lighting systems is to provide comfortable and healthy
lights based on the speciﬁc the environment and occupant demands. A smart lighting
system (SLS) may comprise different elements, namely, efﬁcient light sources (i.e., light
emitting diodes (LEDs)), as a prerequisite, a smart control system that may include a
wireless communication network, software and sensors, and a remote control system that
realises speciﬁc innovative actions [75]. In light of this trend, Refs. [76,77] concluded that
applying an SLS in ofﬁce buildings could save up to 95% of energy, depending on the
activity patterns and type of control system. For example, a control system equipped
with the occupancy detection sensors adopted in [78] saved up to 60% of energy. Having
highlighted the impact of building and window characteristics (e.g., direction and latitude)
on the efﬁciency of SLSs, Ref. [79] adopted a daylight-integrated lighting control system
(i.e., enabling lamps to dim or completely turn off after detecting an adequate amount
of natural light) to save up to 47% of energy compared with conventional systems. They
calculated energy savings of 35% and 20% through the separate use of occupancy detection
and daylight-harvesting sensors, respectively. The authors of [80] analysed the application
of a time-based lighting control system, which depends on the clarity of commuting
patterns, to save from 10% to 40% of energy in ofﬁce buildings. Although most projects
on SLS have focused on issues related to energy conservation, recently, the examination of
residents’ well-being has become more signiﬁcant, and the improvement of features such
as the aesthetic aspects of the environment, visual comfort, and light effects beyond vision
is actively discussed [81,82]. Table 3 presents the energy efﬁciency and cost reductions
achieved by SLS deployment.

The ultimate goal of smart building openings is to adjust solar radiation by trans-
mitting, reﬂecting, and absorbing sunlight through windows. The building can conserve
energy and maintain a comfortable environment [85] using movable shading devices or
by adopting dimmable glass (also known as smart glass or switchable glass). Although
many sustainable design solutions can be applied to design and form a façade that is able
to improve the energy performance of buildings (e.g., double-layer air corridors, external
and internal insulation layers, windows with low U-values) [86], a building envelope can
only be considered intelligent and smart when it can automatically adapt itself to weather
Energies 2023, 16, 5701

conditions, occupant behaviour and needs, and conﬂicts [87]. Because it is not possible to
predict 100% of the environmental and climate conditions, an intelligent envelope system
must be able to manage the strategy required to deal with these variables [87]. The control
system used for intelligentisation of the envelope should be designed for self-powered
sensing, control, and actuation. According to EU Commission projects, smart windows can
also provide better natural ventilation [88]. To this end, the volume of air that leaves and
enters a room must be managed to mitigate the need for mechanical ventilation. From an
architectural perspective, an additional smart solution involves the application of AI tech-
nologies to strike a balance between a comfortable environment and energy efﬁciency by
considering the building orientation and opening dimensions for optimal lighting, heating,
cooling, and ventilation [89].
Along with this trend, Ref. [90] proposed two new models of smart windows, ther-
mochromic and electrochromic windows, utilising crystal droplets and suspended particles
to change glass transparency. The authors of [91] designed a solar smart window system in
which ﬂexible photovoltaic cells were installed on one side of the blind and cooling coats
on the other side, which led to a 4–9% reduction in temperature during passive cooling
performance. Examples of smart windows are listed in Table 4.

3.1.5. Smart Electric Device Management Systems
The ultimate goal of smart electricity management in a building is to automatically
manage the time and mode of operation of electric devices, aiming to shift loads and
reduce electric bills. Although there are several systems that allow for residents to remotely
control electric devices through installed actuators (e.g., switching washing machines or
ovens on/off through mobile phones), they are merely intended to enhance residents’
comfort and are different from interfaces that provide an intelligent reduction in energy
consumption [93]. In November 2016, the European Commission updated the application
of smart technologies in the Energy Performance of Building Directive (EPBD), which
was ﬁrst introduced in 2002 to optimise energy use in buildings [94,95]. A corollary of
this update reveals the potential beneﬁts of smart buildings in creating an intelligent
environment integrated with home automation to enhance comfort, safety, and energy
efﬁciency [96]. A signiﬁcant capability in this area is the collection of data from devices
and their processing using heterogeneous and dynamic sources. An advanced IoT-based
system can consider variables such as building data, current and the predicted amounts of
available renewable energy (in the case of a smart grid), energy prices, weather data, and
end-user behaviour to optimise the time and mode of electrical device operation [47]. These
optimisations can be designed using a set of rules that are incorporated into intelligent
electricity management [97].
Similarly, Ref. [98] showed that demand-side load management, which refers to the
shift in residents’ consumption towards the period of off-peak demand, can effectively
improve the overall energy efﬁciency. The authors of [99] developed an electricity manage-
Energies 2023, 16, 5701

ment tool that provides a personalised plan with awareness services that lead to behavioural
changes in users. Several tools are available to support end-user energy management. For
instance, Siemens Synco is designed for mixed-use small to medium-sized buildings, in
which the control system manages energy plants by monitoring and adjusting HVAC
electrical equipment [100]. Honeywell Attune Advisory Services is another monitoring and
optimisation tool supported by Software as a Service (SaaS) and cloud-based technologies,
which help facilities determine the best way to save resources [101]. These tools are helpful
for energy service companies, specialists, and facility managers willing to use the collected
data and processed information to make decisions and set rules [102]. Some well-known
tools and companies working in this ﬁeld are as follows: Loop Energy Saver and Origami
Energy in the United Kingdom [102,103]; NUUKA and OPTWATTI in Finland [104,105];
Bidgely, Enetics, and PlotWatt in the USA [106–108]; Plugwise in the Netherlands [109];
and SMARAKIA in Spain [110]. Indeed, these tools utilise IoT-based systems to collect
and analyse input data and provide monitoring and controlling services, such as data
visualisation and notiﬁcation, that assist users in identifying potential ways to reduce
electricity consumption [47].
Another important function that has shown great potential for being smart is the
use of metering methods and reporting systems. Because smart meters, such as gas and
electricity meters, are often installed in out-of-sight places, installing an IHD, a small
monitor displaying valuable and understandable information from smart meters, has been
recommended [111]. The authors of [112] alleged that a control system that manages smart
meters can analyse and provide valuable information as a virtual assistant for residents,
showing defective consumption patterns and discovering energy guzzlers in their homes.
The authors of [113,114] helped improve users’ insight into their lifestyle by listening to
the unique energy signature of homes and subsequently proposing a different series of
recommendations, enabling remote control, and automatically turning off electricity. The
authors of [115] showed that offering feedback about consumption patterns to consumers
can reduce their consumption by approximately 5–15% compared to the baseline. In
addition, approximately 64% of the people with smart meters in their homes think twice
about the energy consumption of their devices. Table 5 presents the outcomes that speciﬁc
smart solutions can obtain from a system.

3.1.6. Smart Maintenance and Commissioning
The ultimate goal of smartened maintenance and commissioning is to enhance the
efﬁciency of the maintenance and monitoring processes of building services by carrying
them out at the right time and in the most cost-effective manner [123]. In light of the
technological evolution in different sectors of the building industry, it is vital to progress
through the concept of utility services and commissioning to realise the smart maintenance
concept. To this end, integrating two well-known terms, lean and smart maintenance, has
led to the formation of a dynamic, intelligent, and value-added management model that
embraces all building components [124]. The highest step in the maintenance hierarchy
is smart maintenance and commissioning, which goes beyond the ﬁxed commissioning
plan by embracing the measurements conducted using diagnostic tools integrated into
the control system [124]. Indeed, apart from the specialist contractors, an integrated
network of IoT devices that are actively patched to the ﬁrmware is needed to provide
and transfer updates on the operation status of systems within a reasonable timescale to
keep the network secure [125]. Therefore, smart maintenance can provide services based
on intelligent systems operated by technologies embedded in various urban or buildings
elements [126]. To develop a smart management plan, it is necessary to consider the
following aspects:
-
Data management: Using data generated by cyber-physical systems for predic-
tive maintenance.
-
Knowledge management:
Externalisation of existing technical knowledge to
new labourers.
-
Learning orientation: integration of fundamental steps into the maintenance cycle.
-
Weak-point elimination: Big data analytics and IT systems are used to eliminate
weak points.
-
Employee qualiﬁcations: Precise qualiﬁcation of specialists working in mainte-
nance sections.
-
Optimisation of maintenance strategy: Optimal decisions between reactive, preventive,
predictive, and proactive measurements.
As it is still difﬁcult to explore the beneﬁts of recent smart maintenance and commis-
sioning programs, no quantitative elaborations have been found.

3.2.1. Smart Solutions to Improve Energy Provision
The high energy demand and environmental repercussions of fossil fuel depletion
have stimulated the development of renewable energy technologies for many years. De-
pending on environmental and contextual features, available technologies, and urban
Energies 2023, 16, 5701

management systems, the community may decide to deploy a speciﬁc type of RES (i.e.,
solar, geothermal, wind, biomass, and even hydraulic energy) to generate energy [127,128].
However, uncertainty in the efﬁciency of the energy generation process makes it difﬁcult
to calculate the return on investment (RoI), which discourages investment in this area.
Another challenge in this ﬁeld is the low capacity (i.e., the realised output to the max-
imum possible output) of renewable power plants. Because of the intermittent nature
of renewable sources (e.g., lack of strong winds and cloudy weather), which means that
these energy resources are not always available, the capacity factor is often lower than
that of fossil-fuel-based plants [129]. This periodic availability of all RESs exacerbates
the mismatch between supplied energy and demand, which can make blackouts and low
voltages regular occurrences [130,131]. However, enlarging plants and designing them
based on peak demand can impose additional ﬁnancial pressure. In this regard, deciding
between underproduction and overproduction in plants has remained a major issue for
several years [127]. Nevertheless, smart solutions exist, and innovative ideas can resolve
these obstacles.
Smart Renewable Energy Grid
The ultimate goal of smartening a renewable energy grid is to secure the energy supply
and improve widespread access to energy without a dependency on fossil fuels. The smart
management of renewable power plants relies on the integration of all components in
energy generation systems with smart infrastructure, considering different objectives (e.g.,
energy efﬁciency improvements and emission control) in real time. As energy management
in a smart energy network can be automated by a technical control centre that allows
for immediate real-time data transmission and analysis, Refs. [132,133] highlighted the
signiﬁcance of identifying and executing corrective actions to diagnose and prevent er-
rors in time. Although existing renewable energy grid systems may already cover some
smart functionalities, such as balancing supply and demand, Ref. [134] demonstrated
that achieving a real smart grid system requires the incorporation of ICT into all aspects
of electricity supply, delivery, and consumption. In this regard, Ref. [135] classiﬁed the
application of ICT in the development of renewable energy plants into two imperative
disciplines: optimal power ﬂow (OPF) and conﬁguration strategies (CSs); CSs deal with the
placement of RESs or generators in the power distribution system, whereas OPF refers to
load ﬂow problems and operating conditions. Owing to the uncertain availability of RESs,
different ICT technologies and forecasting algorithms have been employed to boost CSs
and OPF [136]. The authors of [137] claimed that incorporating a multitude of RESs into a
microgrid has potential beneﬁts, such as a greater effectiveness of the local implementation
of computational intelligent models, facilitating conﬁguration and fault control, eliminating
deep charge problems, and increasing the quality and reliability of power. The authors
of [134] demonstrated that, depending on the types of renewable energy and geographical
demand proﬁles, the highest ratio of renewable energy supply to the peak load (deﬁned
as the renewable penetration level) in an electricity system can be classiﬁed into three
levels. The lowest level can be implemented without smart technology, with a capacity
penetration of less than 15%. The medium penetration level of renewables is between 15%
and 30%, which necessitates the consideration of smart components throughout the grid.
The authors of [138] also alleged that incorporating digital tools and innovative designs
within a renewable smart grid could secure a capacity penetration higher than 30%.
Moreover, given the high potential for intelligentisation in energy storage, this has
become a theme that has stimulated active discussions. The authors of [127] stated that
energy storage is a logical solution for saving energy in a system, making variable renewable
energy systems more desirable and feasible in existing electrical grid systems among
communities. Although electricity can be stored in different storage media, such as batteries,
fuel cells [139], ﬂywheels [140,141], and compressed air energy storage (CAES) [140,142],
only batteries and fuel cells are appropriate for neighbourhood-scale projects owing to
characteristics such as their charge/discharge time and energy density. Although all these
Energies 2023, 16, 5701
15 of 35
systems are equipped with sophisticated pieces of technology, without smart self-control
over their performance, they are dumb machines that can only store and discharge energy.
A smart energy storage system can be deﬁned based on the following features:
-
Self-optimisation and justiﬁcation of charging and discharging processes based on
electricity prices.
-
Control of the time and energy source to achieve a longer cycle life.
-
Coordination of operations with other storage systems, power plant capacity, and
load demands.
-
Prediction and prevention of failures and unusual catastrophes that may degrade the
battery performance (e.g., thermal runaway and energy imbalance among cells in a
battery pack).
Energy storage can beneﬁt from smart solutions that use precise and well-structured
data to empower AI systems. Similarly, Ref. [143] clariﬁed that the automation and optimi-
sation of energy storage systems require sufﬁcient knowledge and real-time communication
regarding power plant production and consumer load demands. This crucial information
enables decentralised decision-making for regulating the microgrid components. These
microgrid operations can be executed by a central control, whose main task is to maintain
power quality and reliability by regulating the frequency and voltage in the grid [144].

3.2.2. Smart Solutions to Improve Water Distribution Networks
According to World Bank data, the amount of non-recovery water loss due to leakage
and breakage in developing countries is approximately 35–50% of water consumption [156]
and related auxiliary energy (water treatment, distribution, etc.) [157]. The intricate system
of pipes with different proﬁles buried in the ground is a major obstacle to better water
management. The long-term exposure of cast iron pipes to moist soil may accelerate the
corrosion process and reduce their expected useful life. However, a complete replacement
of all systems’ cast iron pipes, which are, in some cases, more than 120 years old, would
impose a huge ﬁnancial pressure on municipalities; therefore, the inability to diagnose the
problem or predict system deterioration requires expensive crisis intervention. In addition
to the ﬁnancial and physical barriers, the global water crisis requires a practically efﬁcient
method to address these challenges [158].
Energies 2023, 16, 5701

Several smart solutions have been proposed. Different advanced technologies can
be employed to collect the required data and simulate the performance of water systems.
Although retroﬁtting activities are often managed at the district or city scale, some smart
measurements and technologies must be considered and applied at the neighbourhood
scale. In the following sections, smart solutions related to water delivery in neighbourhoods
are summarised.
Smart Water Distribution Systems
The ultimate goal of smartening a water distribution system is the continuous moni-
toring and control of the water-supply network and its performance in carrying potable
water under effective pressure. According to [128,159], a smart water distribution system
addresses two aspects: (i) smart leakage detection and (ii) smart water quality preservation.
Smart water distribution systems deploy high-tech equipment and systems to monitor the
different characteristics of water ﬂow and abnormalities in distribution network pipelines.
Technologies, such as sensors, integrated communication modules, software, and open-
source platforms for cloud access, are required [159]. From the perspective of pressure
management, which affects the related energy consumption, sensors can also be utilised in
different methods to detect abnormal water ﬂow, such as bursts and leakages. To this end,
hydraulic-based solutions and acoustic sensing have often been used to analyse variations
in the ﬂow and pressure of water at different nodes of the network. For instance, Ref. [160]
used wavelet analysis and cumulative sum (CUSUM) (a widely used statistical control
method) to identify potential burst events across pipelines by revealing the accurate time
of abnormalities in pressure and ﬂows. Because of the high cost of installing sensors, the
number of sensors in these models must be optimised and allocated to strategic nodes in
the network [161]. Therefore, the smart water grid refers to the smart design and placement
of all physical components of the system to realise the operational efﬁciency of smart water
management, as expected and foreseen with smart devices. Figure 5 presents a general
perspective of a smart water distribution system in a neighbourhood. Different critical
components of the water distribution system (e.g., pumps, valves, tanks, and end-use water
taps) can be monitored through a network of sensors, each of which is connected to a
microcontroller that can store and interpret the data and send the information wirelessly to
desired points (e.g., users or technician teams) [159,162].

of failure (calculated based on age, material, pressure of the pipes, and type of soil around
them) and the consequences of failure (calculated based on the sensitivity of customers to

beneﬁts of a smart water grid:
•
Real-time monitoring of conditions across pipelines, which enables technicians to
apply preventive maintenance at the right time.
•
Real-time measurement of water quality and pressure for the early identiﬁcation of
potential contaminants and leakage.
•
Automatic control of valves to prevent ﬂooding, damage, water loss, and spread
of pollution.
•
Real-time feedback on technical measurement to calibrate pumps, and subordi-
nate utilities.
According to [164], deploying a smart supply system in Lisbon reduced nonrecov-
ered water losses by approximately 40%. In a comprehensive review article, Ref. [165]
investigated the application of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) in water
distribution systems and revealed that deploying real-time alarms and automatic operation
plants could result in 30% energy savings and a 20% decrease in water loss. In addition,
Ref. [69] leveraged joint time-frequency analysis (JTFA) to analyse the pressure signals
collected throughout the sensors for burst event identiﬁcation within the range of from 3 to
71/s (the burst event is often treated as a discrete occurrence; therefore, the higher the rate,
the more accurate the system). The authors of [166,167] highlighted the ﬁnancial beneﬁts
of using smart water technology, which can decrease the initial investment required for
water utilities by 12.5%. Table 7 presents examples of the use of smart technologies in
neighbourhood-scale water distribution systems.

Smart Irrigation Controllers
The ultimate goal of smartened water irrigation systems is to automatically adjust
the watering volume and time based on environmental conditions (e.g., soil moisture and
humidity) and plant needs. Two decades ago, the so-called smart irrigation controllers were
developed to implement advanced methods of irrigation for residential and commercial
landscapes [175]. Smart irrigation systems comprise different sensor feedbacks and devices
to monitor the real site conditions and subsequently collect the required data such as wind,

Smart Grey Water Reclamation Systems
The ultimate goal of green water reclamation is to establish and secure reliable treat-
ment systems that can detect abnormal materials in sewage ﬂows, potential risks, and errors.
In light of digitalisation and smartness in grey water reclamation, Ref. [184] mentioned
the types of components and volumes of sewage ﬂow in the short and long term, which
can change because of the diverse steps required for the treatment process. Accordingly,
Refs. [185,186] highlighted the use of real-time control in the treatment process, in which
anomalies in the components of grey water can be immediately detected and transferred
to expert technicians or control systems to take further urgent measures. To this end,
different intelligent technologies, such as big data, sensors, IoT, and artiﬁcial intelligence
methods, may be used, focusing on monitoring and controlling patterns, identifying and
diagnosing anomalous plant behaviour and errors, and predicting wastewater inlet ﬂow
and required workloads. For example, sensors allow for the acquisition of physical and
chemical parameters, such as pH, nitrates, temperature, and ammonium. These parameters
can be collected within speciﬁc short intervals (e.g., 1 min) in a cloud environment and
processed in a higher layer of modules [184].
In addition to using sensors and smart control systems, some novel ICT-based meth-
ods are available. For instance, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) technologies have been widely
used to reduce the energy and costs of these processes. The authors of [187] employed
the data mining (DM) method to optimise the aeration process and reduce the required
energy by 31.4%. The authors of [188] also used the DM method to optimise the activated
sludge process (ASP), an aerobic biological process, by controlling the dissolved oxygen
in the wastewater, which resulted in a 15% reduction in the required airﬂow. Using an
expert system (ES) method in an oxic reactor (i.e., a treatment process with high biogas
production and low energy consumption) [189] can reduce total treatment costs and energy
consumption by 40%. The authors of [190] also used advanced control in Flemish plants,
which resulted in a from 10% to 20% reduction in the energy needed for the aeration process
and a 30% reduction in chemical doses. Data collected from the wastewater ﬂow can also
be used to calculate the optimal tank water level, which reduces the high pressure behind
the pipes in the network and subsequently reduces leakage risks [191].
3.2.3. Smart Solutions for Waste Management
Recycling and reusing materials has been one of the main priorities of municipalities
in recent decades, aiming to achieve a circular economy [192,193]. However, limited
knowledge of the formal or informal sectors responsible for such activities and a lack
of advanced facilities and infrastructure to efﬁciently collect and sort waste are the two
main challenges that have caused inefﬁciencies in solid waste management, particularly
in developing countries [194]. Another critical issue is the open dumping and burning of
organic waste in low-income districts and cities, which can be used as a source of waste-to-
energy or composting plants [4,195]. Using current methodologies to control composting or
sorting and recycling processes is a time-consuming and high-energy task, which requires
highly skilled workers [196].
To achieve such sustainability objectives, it is crucial to adopt intelligent measures that
can effectively control waste management processes at either the building or neighbourhood
scale. Although the application of smart waste management is a city-scale vision that
requires sufﬁciently advanced infrastructure and components (e.g., smart waste collectors
equipped with GPS and connected to the sensors of smart bins), some elements should be
handled at the neighbourhood scale. The following section presents two smart solutions
that can be used in this ﬁeld.
Smart Waste Bins
The ultimate goal of smartening waste bins is to automate some of the initial steps
in the waste management chain, such as minimisation, collection, and separation, in an
intelligent manner, which culminates in energy and cost reductions. According to [197],
Energies 2023, 16, 5701
21 of 35
the potential for reducing the amount of unrecycled material is between 30 and 130 kg/y
per person. Hence, numerous digital tools have been developed to support the gradual
transformation of the “design, use, disposal” model to a circular model in which discarded
waste can be recycled and reused [197]. For instance, smart bin deployment can make a
direct contribution to waste minimisation by the digital tracking of waste, where residents
would be charged based on the content and weight of their trash through the new sys-
tem of “pay-as-you-throw” (PAYT) [198,199]. This system sends feedback based on the
historical data of individuals and introduces different procedures to decrease costs. Berlin
introduced the application of radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) to PAYT systems in
communities [199]. The authors of [200,201] also highlighted smart bins equipped with
other types of technologies, such as sorting features based on image recognition technology
(e.g., using sensors to identify waste content or the colour of plastics) and a conveyor belt
that separates waste. The authors of [202] introduced a smart bin model in which a solar-
powered compacting lever was added to compress the volume of waste by approximately
700% and reduce the collection frequency by 85%. To realise these solutions, the required
sensors and devices must be mounted in smart bins. Figure 7 shows a sample of a smart bin
equipped with ﬁll-level sensors and solar-powered compactors. In another step in smart
waste management that should be supported by a higher administrative level of urban
management, data related to the districts’ waste containers can be collected through cloud
computing and, once processed, the control system can navigate waste trucks towards full
containers in an efﬁcient route via a mobile application [203].

solar-powered compacting lever was added to compress the volume of waste by approx-
imately 700% and reduce the collection frequency by 85%. To realise these solutions, the
required sensors and devices must be mounted in smart bins. Figure 7 shows a sample of
a smart bin equipped with fill-level sensors and solar-powered compactors. In another
step in smart waste management that should be supported by a higher administrative
level of urban management, data related to the districts’ waste containers can be collected
through cloud computing and, once processed, the control system can navigate waste
trucks towards full containers in an efficient route via a mobile application [203].

speed, and attitude of the machine. These smart machines are currently employed on ad-
vanced campuses and parks in Beijing, China [207]. Table 9 lists the potential performance
of related technologies in different research projects.

Smart Organic Waste Composters
The ultimate goal of a smart organic waste composter is to monitor and control
the composting operations by automatically adding the precise amounts of water and
air required and reducing human intervention. Generally, the provision of small-scale
composting plants in the neighbourhood effectively eliminates the gap between the places
where organic waste is generated and where it is processed to produce fertilisers [212].
This system reduces the CO2 emissions, costs, and energy consumed when collecting
and transmitting organic waste. Intelligent composting has been used to monitor and
control the moisture and temperature of the process, which are indispensable for obtaining
high-quality products [196]. The authors of [196,213] introduced different types of sensors
in intelligent composting machines to control air circulation and measure the moisture
and temperature of the composting material in different nodes of piles, and subsequently
transfer data to the control system through wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in real time.
The same procedure was used to build composting plants at different scales, and small
machines are now available for households, buildings, and neighbourhoods [212,214].
Although these smart systems can signiﬁcantly contribute to waste reduction and energy
conservation, no quantitative results have been reported regarding the beneﬁts obtained
from these smart solutions.
3.2.4. Smart Solutions for Outdoor Spaces
The smart solutions categorised in this domain are those that cannot be included in any
specific subjective domain (e.g., buildings and waste) or in building-energy-related uses.
Smart Outdoor Lights
The ultimate goal of smartening outdoor lights is to provide residents with a safe
and comfortable environment in shared public areas while reducing energy consumption
and light pollution. Smart outdoor lighting ﬁxtures employ special technologies such
as cameras, optical sensor photocells, and other sensors to perform real-time monitoring
functions and the intended tasks [215]. By providing adequate brightness at the appropriate
time, smart outdoor lighting systems not only foster a sense of satisfaction and safety among
residents but also reduce energy consumption. The technology used in smart outdoor
lighting systems can be similar to general smart lighting technologies, such as motion
detection, lighting, and dimming control, and the infrastructure of this system can also be

used as the backbone of other activities, such as monitoring weather, air pollution, and
trafﬁc [216–218]. Table 10 presents the results obtained from previous related research
projects concerning the effect of using smart outdoor lights on energy consumption and
cost reductions.

Smart Parking Systems
The ultimate goal of a smart parking system (SPS) is to provide real-time data on the
availability of parking lots for different types of vehicles, such as cars, EVs, and bicycles,
in the neighbourhood and surrounding areas to save time and energy and stimulate
the use of more efﬁcient vehicles. The authors of [223] alleged that an SPS is one of the
fundamental elements of smart mobility, particularly in densely populated neighbourhoods
and districts that suffer from a scarcity of parking spaces. An SPS is a good solution for
remediating trafﬁc congestion, thus reducing air pollution and the concomitant health
risk [224]. In this regard, Ref. [225] used a multi-agent system (MAS) to empower drivers
to negotiate parking fees with an SPS based on predeﬁned criteria. The atuhors of [226]
employed IoT and RFID tags to develop a car parking framework that provides payment
facilities, parking lot retrieval, and security. The authors of [227] used the Global System
for Mobile (GSM) to develop a system in which the driver can securely reserve a parking
spot using a simple short message (SMS) through a layout animation of parking space
occupancy status. The authors of [228] presented a visual vehicle parking space for real-time
occupancy detection using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). These services may
be provided on different user interfaces, such as smartphone applications, web applications,
and vehicle information and communication systems (VICS). Figure 8 schematically depicts
the architecture of an SPS in which all parking spaces are monitored through sensors
connected to a control system.
Although these platforms are usually developed for large-scale areas, the facilities and
technologies equipped in parking lots can be implemented individually in a single parking
area in a neighbourhood. Hence, Ref. [224] reviewed the different types of services that the
SPS proposed.

- Parking guidance and information system (PGIS): This provides a real-time number 
of available parking spaces using sensors at the parking entrance and exit. In some cases, 
it can guide drivers to designated parking spaces [230]. 
- Transit-based smart: In addition to public transportation schedules, this presents 
the real-time occupancy of parking lots and arrival routes [231]. 
- E-parking system: A single platform that integrates different features of smart park-

parking lots, different payment methods, lot retrieval announcements, and reservation fa-
cilities [229].  
- Automated parking system (APS): A mechanical system that automatically moves 
a vehicle to an available space without human intervention [232]. 
- EV charging station: allocation of lots in parking areas to EV charging stations. 
There are different applications through which EV owners can check the status of their 
car charge and be notified when it is completed [233]. 
Another sustainability concern in this field that can be addressed through digital solutions is bike 
parking stations. The authors of [234] also mentioned that the availability of safe bike parking sta-
tions in a neighbourhood could encourage more people to choose bicycle commuting as a viable 
transportation option. A bike storage rack can be equipped with a smart entrance to enable access 
to users through different digital gadgets (e.g., mobile applications, cards, RFID tags). The authors 
of [235] highlighted the need for more advanced bike stations, which provide the possibility of 
charging e-bikes similar to those in EV parking lots. Table 11 presents the results obtained from 
previous related research projects concerning the use of smart parking systems.

4. Conclusions
The aim of this research was to propose a collection of smart solutions and novel
ideas that can be applied to the neighbourhood building stock for energy conservation
purposes. To this end, numerous scientiﬁc articles, the technical literature, and European
projects pertaining to the application of smart approaches and ICT in different domains
were collected and scrutinised. As most of the guidelines presented in this context focused
on smart homes or smart cities, the boundaries of which are more clearly determined, the
ﬁrst contribution of this research lies in the presentation of a complete set of smart solutions
that are particularly applicable to the neighbourhood building stock. The key difference
between the neighbourhood building stock and urban planning strategies or single-home
renovation is the set of activities that are socioeconomically feasible at this scale. In this
regard, clarifying a clear boundary among all the smart solutions and selecting those that
can be deployed in the neighbourhood-building stock could play a crucial role in assessing
opportunities for intelligentisation. This study also signiﬁcantly contributes to clarifying
the direct and indirect impacts of smart solutions on reducing energy consumption.
In this research, all the smart solutions were investigated in two main sections, building
and neighbourhood, and further classiﬁed under ﬁve domains: building energy-related
uses, RESs, water, waste, and open space management. The smart solutions collected in the
building energy-related domain are almost entirely laid out in the SRI report [17]. However,
a comparison of the levels of functionalities presented in the SRI report and the collected
smart solutions in the ﬁrst domain revealed that only the last two levels of each indicator
could be considered smart. A literature review in this domain showed that one of the
main obstacles that may prevent the realisation of this expected improvement is the lack
of skill among building users, preventing them from adapting their energy usage proﬁle
to an appropriate behavioural pattern. In the ﬁeld of energy generation, there is a naïve
general overview that the supply of sustainable energy from RESs can be interpreted as
a smart solution at any level. This research strove to make a clear distinction between
sustainable and smart measures by summarising the elements that should be deployed
in the renewable energy grid to solve their major challenges. Moreover, in the ﬁelds of
waste management and water distribution networks, which are inseparable subjects of all
sustainability protocols, all the smart solutions that should be applied at the neighbourhood
scale and supported by higher levels of urban management were elaborated. A review of
the potential impacts of smart solutions proved that energy enhancement is not only limited
to the intelligentisation of building components but can also be achieved through other
neighbourhood elements in direct and indirect ways. For instance, owing to the strong
interrelationships among these elements, increasing community awareness in different
ﬁelds through the use of smart water meters, smart energy meters, and smart parking
systems can boost the effective conservation of energy and other resources.
Although potentially missed articles and projects could have contributed more to
this review, the various indispensable aspects of the neighbourhood scale covered here
Energies 2023, 16, 5701
26 of 35
revealed an uneven workload distribution in the development of smart tools across different
disciplines. This uneven distribution has resulted in certain areas, such as smartening
water reclamation and smart composting plans, which have rarely been investigated in
this context. In addition, most smart-oriented studies merely focused on designing and
developing new tools and methods, without examining their effectiveness. Although this
trend has led to a rapid advancement in smart and digital tools, it can be an obstacle for
stakeholders seeking observable investment outcomes.
Considering all these factors, having a comprehensive framework not only as a guide-
line but also to measure and compare the level of smartness and potential achievements
in energy conservation can play a signiﬁcant role in structuring the content of this ﬁeld.
This study introduces a novel perspective on the concept of smartness by focusing on
the intermediate scale between the city and building levels, which has the potential to
accelerate the development of smart solutions, particularly in neighbourhoods charac-
terised by residents who share common values, such as housing cooperatives. Increasing
policymakers’ awareness of the beneﬁts of implementing smartness at this scale makes
it possible to bridge the gap between theory and practice, and contributes to the overall
implementation of smart city initiatives.
Moreover, this study emphasises the importance of considering the boundaries and
limitations of smart solutions, from the building to the neighbourhood scale, to ensure
a holistic and sustainable approach and enhance the practical applicability of smart city
development. In this regard, this research highly recommends that future studies focus
on developing a comprehensive reporting framework (similar to the level(s) speciﬁed
for building sustainability [242]), with speciﬁc reference to smart solutions for energy
conservation in the neighbourhood building stock.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.

3.6. IoT Network Architectures and Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) for Real-Time Irrigation
Real-time irrigation management systems heavily rely on the efficient and reliable transmission of data from sensors and weather stations to the cloud for processing and decision-making. However, agricultural environments present unique challenges to wireless communication, including adverse weather conditions, physical obstacles, and the limitations of wireless technologies. These challenges necessitate robust and adaptive solutions to ensure the consistent and timely flow of data, enabling truly autonomous irrigation scheduling.
Environmental factors, such as heavy rain, fog, and strong winds, can significantly disrupt wireless communication by attenuating or even blocking radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance (Ed-daoudi et al., 2023; Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). Dense vegetation, buildings, and uneven terrain create further complications by causing multipath propagation and shadowing effects (Yim et al., 2018; Gautam and Pagay, 2020). The study by Yim et al. (2018) on LoRa networks in a tree farm environment exemplifies these challenges, revealing reduced communication range and data reliability compared to theoretical expectations. This underscores the need for carefully selecting and optimizing communication protocols and network parameters to ensure reliable data transmission in such environments.
The study by Guzinski et al. (2014a) using a modified TSEB model further highlights the importance of high-resolution data in accurately capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of energy fluxes influenced by environmental factors. This emphasizes the need for advanced data acquisition and processing techniques that can effectively represent the complexities of agricultural settings.
The limitations of traditional wireless communication technologies, such as limited range and network congestion, pose additional challenges for large-scale agricultural operations. Long-distance data transmission can be hindered by range limitations, while network congestion arising from numerous sensors transmitting concurrently can lead to delays and data loss, hindering real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). Addressing these challenges requires the exploration of advanced networking technologies that can optimize spectrum utilization, mitigate interference, and improve reliability and efficiency.
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) offer promising solutions for optimizing wireless communication in agricultural settings. CRNs empower devices with the ability to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). Research has explored the potential of CRNs in predicting Radio Frequency (RF) power to avoid noisy channels and optimize spectrum utilization (Iliya et al., 2014; Iliya et al., 2014). These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of combining optimization algorithms with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the accuracy and generalization of RF power prediction, enabling CRNs to make informed decisions about channel selection and avoid interference.
DSA complements CRN technology by dynamically allocating unused spectrum, further enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion (Shi et al., 2023). The numerical model developed by Shi et al. (2023) showcases the potential of CRNs and DSA for optimizing wireless communication in challenging environments.
The integration of CRNs and DSA into the IoT network architecture requires careful consideration of spectrum sensing techniques, network topology, and data security. Research on cooperative spectrum sensing suggests that distributed approaches, where sensor nodes collaborate and share information, can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectrum sensing, particularly in dynamic environments (Trigka and Dritsas, 2022; Khalid & Yu, 2019). This collaborative approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the radio environment and facilitates the identification of available frequency bands for data transmission.
The choice of network topology also impacts the performance and scalability of CRN-based irrigation systems. Mesh networks, where sensor nodes are interconnected and relay data for each other, offer enhanced resilience and coverage compared to star topologies where nodes communicate directly with a central gateway (Akyildiz & Vuran, 2010). However, mesh networks can be more complex to manage and may introduce additional routing overhead. The trade-off between network resilience and complexity needs to be carefully evaluated to select the most appropriate topology for a specific agricultural setting.
Data security and privacy are paramount concerns in IoT-based irrigation systems due to the sensitive nature of agricultural data (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential for protecting data integrity and ensuring system trustworthiness. Research on secure spectrum leasing and resource allocation algorithms for CR-WSN-based irrigation systems has demonstrated the potential of these technologies for enhancing security and efficiency (Hassan, 2023; Afghah et al., 2018).
In conclusion, the development of effective and reliable real-time irrigation management systems requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the challenges of data transmission in agricultural environments. The integration of robust and adaptive communication protocols, optimized network architectures, and advanced networking technologies like CRNs and DSA, along with a focus on data security and privacy, can contribute significantly to achieving the goal of autonomous and efficient irrigation scheduling.
4. AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN THE CLOUD
4.1. Data Quality and Preprocessing
Data quality is paramount in automated irrigation systems as it directly influences the effectiveness of decision-making and water use efficiency. Issues like missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers arising from sensor malfunctions, environmental interference, or network problems (Lv et al., 2023) can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models used for irrigation scheduling and management.
Real-time data cleaning techniques are essential for addressing these challenges. Kalman filtering proves particularly effective in handling missing values and correcting erroneous readings by recursively estimating the system's state based on previous measurements and current sensor data, taking into account noise and uncertainty (Kim et al., 2020). Moving average techniques, by averaging consecutive data points, provide a more stable representation of the underlying trend, filtering out short-term fluctuations (Chhetri, 2023). For outlier detection, adaptive thresholding methods offer a dynamic approach, adjusting thresholds based on the statistical properties of the data to effectively identify anomalies and minimize false positives (Bah et al., 2021). These techniques are crucial in maintaining the integrity of real-time data streams and ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analyses.
Adaptive data preprocessing is essential for managing the diversity of data sources and formats commonly found in irrigation systems. Data normalization techniques, such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization, ensure that all features contribute equally to the analysis by transforming data values to a common scale (Pradal et al., 2016). This is crucial for preventing features with larger values from dominating the analysis and ensuring that all features are given equal consideration. Similarly, feature scaling methods, like standardization or normalization, optimize the range of feature values to improve the performance and convergence of machine learning models (Tortorici et al., 2024). By scaling features to a similar range, the influence of outliers is reduced, and the model's ability to learn from the data is enhanced.
Data fusion techniques play a critical role in integrating information from diverse sources, creating a more comprehensive and reliable dataset for irrigation management. Dempster-Shafer theory, a generalization of probability theory, allows for the expression of both uncertainty and the degree of conflict in evidence, making it suitable for fusing uncertain and conflicting data from heterogeneous sources (Sadiq and Rodriguez, 2004). This is particularly relevant in irrigation systems where data from different sensors may provide slightly different or even contradictory information due to sensor variations or environmental factors. Bayesian inference offers another powerful framework for combining information from multiple sources, updating the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available. By applying these techniques, data from soil moisture sensors, canopy temperature sensors, weather stations, and other sources can be integrated to provide a holistic understanding of crop water requirements and environmental conditions, leading to more informed and accurate irrigation decisions.
The impact of data quality extends beyond model accuracy to the robustness of machine learning models under varying conditions. Robust models should maintain consistent performance even when faced with data inconsistencies or unexpected situations. Techniques like data augmentation and domain adaptation can enhance model robustness by exposing the model to a wider range of data variations during training. Data augmentation involves generating additional training data by applying transformations or introducing noise to existing data, making the model more resilient to noise and variations in the real-world data. Domain adaptation techniques aim to adapt a model trained on one domain (e.g., a specific crop or geographic location) to perform well on another domain with different data characteristics. This is particularly relevant in irrigation management, where models may need to be applied to different crops, soil types, or climatic conditions.
The choice of data cleaning, preprocessing, and fusion techniques should be carefully considered based on the specific characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data. By selecting and implementing appropriate techniques, the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of machine learning models can be significantly improved, leading to more efficient and sustainable irrigation management practices.
4.2. Scalable and Autonomous Deployment using Containerization Strategies
The transition from data collection and transmission to efficient data processing requires a robust infrastructure capable of handling diverse workloads and data volumes. Containerization technologies, specifically Docker and Kubernetes, offer a promising solution for deploying and scaling data processing and machine learning modules within cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). Docker provides a standardized way to package applications and their dependencies into self-contained units known as containers, ensuring consistent and reproducible execution across different platforms (Rosendo et al., 2022). Kubernetes, acting as a container orchestrator, manages their deployment, scaling, and networking across a cluster of machines (Rosendo et al., 2022). This combination presents several advantages for automated irrigation management systems.
Firstly, containerization facilitates efficient resource utilization and scalability. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies, containers enable the isolation of resources and prevent conflicts between different modules (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This isolation allows for the efficient allocation of resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to each container based on its specific needs. Kubernetes further enhances scalability by allowing for the automatic scaling of containers based on real-time demand, ensuring the system can adapt to varying workloads and data volumes, preventing bottlenecks, and ensuring responsiveness to changing conditions (Karamolegkos et al., 2023).
Secondly, containerization promotes portability and reproducibility. By packaging applications and their dependencies into a single unit, containers make it easy to move and deploy them across different cloud environments without the need for environment-specific configurations (Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This portability simplifies the development and deployment process, reducing the time and effort required to set up and manage the system. Additionally, containers ensure reproducibility by providing a consistent execution environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This eliminates variability and ensures that the system will behave consistently across different deployments (Zhou et al., 2023).
Optimizing container orchestration and resource allocation is crucial to minimizing latency and maximizing throughput in real-time data processing pipelines. Techniques like auto-scaling and dynamic resource allocation play a critical role in this context (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Werner and Tai, 2023; Kumar et al., 2024). Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of container instances based on real-time demand, ensuring that sufficient resources are available to handle peak workloads while avoiding over-provisioning during periods of low demand (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2024). Dynamic resource allocation enables the fine-grained adjustment of resources allocated to each container based on its specific needs and the current workload (Werner and Tai, 2023). This ensures efficient resource allocation and provides each container with the necessary resources to perform its tasks effectively.
Performance monitoring tools, such as Kubernetes Metrics Server and Prometheus, are essential for gaining insights into the performance of containers and the overall system (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kuity & Peddoju, 2023). These tools provide valuable data on key performance indicators, such as CPU and memory usage, network traffic, and application-specific metrics. By monitoring this data, administrators can identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation strategies, and continuously improve system performance (Hethcoat et al., 2024). This data-driven approach ensures that automated irrigation management systems can operate efficiently and reliably.
By integrating containerization technologies with optimization techniques and performance monitoring, automated irrigation management systems achieve the scalability, autonomy, and efficiency required for effective real-time data processing and decision-making. This approach facilitates a seamless and responsive system that can adapt to changing conditions and contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity.

4.3. Deploying ML Models for Data Processing
Transitioning from data collection, preprocessing, and transmission, the deployment of machine learning (ML) models marks a pivotal stage in the automated irrigation management pipeline. This stage entails utilizing cloud platforms to facilitate real-time data processing and inference, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimal irrigation management and ultimately contributing to fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
Several architectures and frameworks exist for deploying ML models on cloud platforms, each offering unique advantages and catering to different requirements. TensorFlow Serving, for instance, provides a high-performance system specifically designed for serving TensorFlow models (Abadi et al., 2016). This framework enables efficient and scalable inference, making it suitable for real-time applications where low latency and high throughput are crucial. For instance, in a large-scale irrigation system with numerous sensors generating data continuously, TensorFlow Serving can efficiently handle the high volume of inference requests and provide timely predictions for irrigation scheduling. Similarly, Apache MXNet Model Server offers a flexible and efficient solution for deploying models trained with MXNet, supporting a wide range of deep learning models and inference backends (MXNet Developers, 2015). This versatility makes it suitable for complex irrigation systems that may utilize different types of ML models for various tasks, such as predicting crop water requirements, detecting plant stress, or forecasting weather conditions. ONNX Runtime, on the other hand, provides a cross-platform inference engine compatible with various ML frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet (Microsoft, 2017). This versatility enables the deployment of models in diverse environments, facilitating interoperability and reducing the need for model conversion. For example, an irrigation system that uses models trained in different frameworks can utilize ONNX Runtime to deploy them on a single platform without the need for time-consuming and error-prone model conversion processes.
Choosing the appropriate architecture or framework depends on several factors, including the specific ML framework used for model training, the desired level of performance and scalability, and the need for cross-platform compatibility. For instance, if the primary concern is low latency and high throughput for real-time inference, TensorFlow Serving might be the optimal choice for TensorFlow models. However, if flexibility and support for various deep learning models are required, Apache MXNet Model Server could be more suitable. In cases where cross-platform compatibility is essential, ONNX Runtime offers a versatile solution.
Once the ML model is deployed, optimizing its performance and resource utilization becomes crucial for ensuring the efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems. Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, offer effective methods for reducing the size and computational requirements of ML models without compromising accuracy (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Pruning involves eliminating unnecessary connections or neurons from the model, effectively streamlining its structure and reducing computational complexity. This can be particularly beneficial for deep learning models, which often have a large number of parameters and can be prone to overfitting. By removing redundant or less important connections, pruning can improve modelgeneralizability and reduce inference time. Quantization, on the other hand, involves reducing the precision of model parameters, typically from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower-precision formats such as 8-bit integers. This reduction in precision leads to smaller model sizes and faster inference speeds, making it particularly beneficial for resource-constrained environments or real-time applications. For instance, in edge computing scenarios where ML models are deployed on devices with limited computational resources, quantization can enable efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, hardware acceleration through the utilization of GPUs or TPUs can significantly enhance model performance by leveraging specialized hardware designed for parallel processing (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). GPUs, with their massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth, excel at accelerating matrix operations and convolutions, which are fundamental computations in many deep learning models. This acceleration can significantly reduce inference time and enable real-time processing of sensor data for timely irrigation decisions. TPUs, specifically designed for deep learning workloads, offer even greater performance and energy efficiency for specific model architectures. These hardware accelerators can drastically reduce inference time, enabling near real-time decision-making and enhancing the responsiveness of automated irrigation systems. For example, in a scenario where immediate response to changing weather conditions or soil moisture levels is critical, hardware acceleration can ensure that irrigation decisions are made and executed promptly.
In addition to model compression and hardware acceleration, distributed training techniques play a crucial role in optimizing the training process for large-scale ML models. Techniques such as Horovod and BytePS enable the distribution of training across multiple machines, effectively parallelizing the process and reducing training time (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). This is particularly beneficial for complex models with a large number of parameters or when dealing with large datasets. By leveraging distributed training, irrigation management systems can train more sophisticated models and improve their predictive capabilities, leading to more accurate and efficient irrigation decisions. For instance, a system that utilizes a deep learning model with millions of parameters can benefit from distributed training to reduce training time from days to hours, enabling faster model iteration and improvement.
Integrating the deployed ML models with other components of the automated irrigation management pipeline is essential for achieving a fully autonomous and cohesive system and addressing the need for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system. Standardized protocols, such as MQTT and CoAP, provide lightweight and efficient communication channels for exchanging data between these components (Poojara et al., 2023; Jimenez et al., 2020a; Gour et al., 2023). MQTT, with its publish-subscribe architecture, enables real-time data streaming and event-driven communication, making it suitable for transmitting sensor data, control signals, and inference results (Raikar & M, 2023). This enables the ML model to receive real-time updates on soil moisture, weather conditions, and plant health, allowing for dynamic adjustments to irrigation schedules based on the latest data. CoAP, designed for constrained devices and low-power networks, offers a web-transfer protocol for resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient communication between sensors, actuators, and the ML models (Raikar & M, 2023). This is particularly relevant in situations where sensors or actuators have limited processing power or battery life, as CoAP minimizes communication overhead and energy consumption. Additionally, RESTful APIs provide a standardized interface for accessing and controlling the ML models, enabling seamless integration with other software components and facilitating system management and monitoring (Wang et al., 2022). This allows for easy integration with existing farm management systems or third-party applications, creating a unified platform for comprehensive irrigation management.4.4. Online Learning in the Cloud
The complexities of real-time data processing in irrigation management necessitate the exploration of advanced techniques to continuously learn and adapt to the dynamic nature of agricultural environments. Online learning algorithms offer a promising solution, enabling the continuous update and improvement of machine learning models based on incoming real-time data. This adaptability is crucial for addressing the challenges of changing environmental conditions, such as weather patterns and crop growth stages, and optimizing irrigation decision-making to enhance water usage efficiency and crop productivity.
Several online learning algorithms have demonstrated potential for real-time data processing and model adaptation in the context of irrigation management. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) facilitates the incremental update of model parameters with each new data point, allowing for efficient adaptation to changing data distributions (Bottou, 2010). This incremental learning process ensures that the model remains responsive to the latest conditions, minimizing the risk of outdated predictions and improving the accuracy of irrigation decisions. Passive-Aggressive algorithms, on the other hand, adjust model parameters only when a misclassification occurs, providing a computationally efficient approach for handling large data streams (Crammer et al., 2006). These algorithms offer a robust approach to handling noisy data, a common challenge in real-world sensor readings, by making small adjustments only when the model's prediction deviates significantly from the actual value (Fei et al., 2019). Online Random Forests extend the concept of random forests to the online setting, enabling the incremental construction and update of decision trees as new data arrives (Saffari et al., 2009). The continuous evolution of the ensemble ensures that the model remains relevant to the changing environment, capturing intricate relationships between variables and leading to more informed irrigation decisions.
Research in various domains highlights the importance of online learning for real-time data stream analytics. Snyder et al. (2020) explored the application of online learning techniques for identifying relevant tweets in real-time, improving situational awareness for first responders. The proposed interactive learning framework allows users to continuously label the relevance of incoming tweets, enabling the real-time refinement of the underlying machine learning model. This user-guided approach aligns well with the dynamic nature of irrigation management, where models need to continuously adjust to varying environmental conditions and crop water requirements. Similarly, research in the field of cyber-physical systems (CPS) underscores the need for online learning algorithms to effectively extract insights and knowledge from continuously generated data streams (Fei et al., 2019). These capabilities are crucial for enabling feedback loops between physical processes and cyber elements, facilitating the integration and optimization of CPS in irrigation management systems.
To implement online learning in cloud-based irrigation management systems, various architectures and frameworks can be considered. Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis provide scalable and fault-tolerant platforms for processing real-time data streams, allowing for the development of online learning pipelines that continuously ingest and analyze data to update machine learning models (Zaharia et al., 2012; Carbone et al., 2015; Amazon Web Services, 2023). These frameworks leverage serverless computing paradigms, automatically scaling resources based on the volume and velocity of incoming data, ensuring efficient resource utilization and responsiveness to fluctuations in demand (Fei et al., 2019).
Effectively managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off is crucial for optimizing online learning in irrigation management. Techniques such as Multi-armed bandits (Sutton & Barto, 2018), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018) can be employed to balance the allocation of resources between exploring new irrigation strategies and exploiting the current best-performing approaches. These techniques enable the identification of optimal irrigation policies, adapting to changing environmental conditions and maximizing long-term rewards.
In conclusion, online learning techniques, coupled with scalable cloud-based architectures, offer a powerful solution for real-time data processing and continuous adaptation in irrigation management systems. By leveraging algorithms like SGD, Passive-Aggressive, and Online Random Forests, along with stream processing frameworks like Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis, irrigation management systems can effectively handle the complexities of real-time data, optimize water usage, and enhance crop productivity in the face of dynamic environmental conditions.

5. GENERATING AND APPLYING IRRIGATION INSIGHTS 
5.1. Real-Time Generation of Actionable Irrigation Insights
The transition from data collection and processing to actionable irrigation insights requires the extracting spatial features from images, allowing for the analysis of satellite or drone imagery to assess crop health, detect water stress, and provide insights into irrigation needs (Os deployment of advanced predictive models capable of generating precise and site-specific irrigation recommendations.roosh et al., 2016).

Data fusion techniques, such as Kalman filtering, offer a robust approach for combining information between input variables and predicting crop water requirements (Keller, 2023; Naphade et al., 2022). These models can effectively from multiple sensors, accounting for noise and uncertainty, and providing a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements (Cohen et al., 2005; Mö handle the temporal dependencies present in time-series data, such as soil moisture andeller et al., 2007). By integrating data from soil moisture weather data, and learn to predict future water needs based on historical patterns and current sensors, weather stations, and remote sensing platforms, ML models can generate more accurate conditions.

To address computational complexity and latency challenges in real-time irrigation insight generation, techniques such as edge computing, model compression, and hardware accelerators heterogeneous data sources to generate more accurate and comprehensive irrigation recommendations (Cohen et al., offer promising solutions. Edge computing enables the distribution of processing tasks closer to the data 2005; Möeller et al., 2007 source, reducing latency and enabling faster response times (Mishra, 20). By incorporating data from multiple sources, irrigation models can better account for spatial variability20; Zhang et al., 2020). Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, can significantly reduce the size and computational requirements of in soil moisture, microclimate conditions, and crop water requirements, leading to more ML models without compromising accuracy, making them suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge precise and efficient irrigation scheduling.
The seamless integration of ML-generated insights with IoT-enabled irrigation control systems requires the adoption of appropriate architectures and protocols that facilitate devices (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).

The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT accelerators, such as GPUs and TPUs, provide specialized hardware designed for parallel processing) protocol and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are well-suited, enabling faster inference speeds and facilitating real-time data analysis (Premkumar for this purpose, offering efficient and reliable communication channels for exchanging data between sensors, & Sigappi, 2022). The combined utilization of these techniques can significantly improve the efficiency and responsiveness of real-time irrigation insight generation, contributing actuators, and ML models (Muangprathub et al., 2019; Osroosh et al., 2016). to the overall goal of achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

Industry-leading products and services for smart irrigation demonstrate the practical application of these technologies. Smart irrigation controllers, such as Rachio, leverage weather data and soil moisture sensors to automatically adjust irrigation schedules based on real-time conditions, reducing water waste and promoting water conservation (Verdouw et al., 2023). Cloud-based irrigation management platforms, such as CropX, offer advanced analytics and decision support tools, providing farmers with insights into crop water requirements, soil health, and irrigation performance (Weikmann et al., 2023). These platforms often incorporate machine learning algorithms to generate predictive models and provide farmers with data-driven recommendations for optimizing irrigation strategies.

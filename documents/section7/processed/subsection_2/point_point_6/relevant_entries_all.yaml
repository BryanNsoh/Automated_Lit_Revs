    Milwaukee, WI, USA SECTION I. Introduction Advances in network engineering and
    communication systems have enabled the use of wireless communication networks
    in the control of physical systems. These networks transmit the sensor measurements
    from the sensors to the controller and the control actions from the controller
    to the actuators. Although flexible and easy to maintain, adoption of wireless
    communication systems introduces new avenues for faults into the system. For instance,
    the communication link between a given sensor and the controller might break down
    or an adversary might perform sophisticated attacks on a subset of the communication
    channels to jeopardise the performance of the closed-loop system. Furthermore,
    advances in control engineering has enabled us to design and deploy larger cyber-physical
    systems consisting of many individual elements working in synchrony. It is evident
    that, at any moment, a fault might exhibit itself in one of the elements. Therefore,
    a systematic approach is required for monitoring the communication channels, the
    sensors, and the actuators to identify faulty or mischievous elements. A common
    method for fault detection is to generate residuals using state estimators, unknown
    input observers, or system identification methods under various faults scenarios.
    Following that, the most likely faults can be identified using a maximum likelihood
    test. For instance, if it is desired to find a faulty sensor, a bank of Kalman
    filters can be designed where each Kalman filter uses all but one of the sensors.
    Here, it is assumed that there is enough redundancy in the output measurements
    so that the system remains observable in the absence of one sensor reading. Evidently,
    the residuals of the Kalman filters containing faulty sensors behaves differently
    than of the rest. This way, the faulty sensors can be detected. A brute-force
    approach consists of checking all the sensors separately. However, group testing
    methods have been also developed to identify faulty sensors [1]. The group testing
    approach shows that the number of Kalman filters that need to be developed is
    in fact far lower than the number of the sensors. Therefore, computational resources
    can be saved. Group testing was developed as a method for testing individual with
    rare diseases in a combined manner (by mixing their blood samples) to identify
    the infected individuals using fewer tests (in comparison to testing them individually)
    [2]. Since then, group testing has found its way to many applications, such as
    communication engineering [3], data forensic [4], DNA analysis [5], and fault
    detection [6]. with the exception of [1], group testing has not been used in fault
    detection in dynamical systems. Furthermore, in [1], the construction of the set
    of tests (for group testing) and the eventual maximum likelihood test for decoding
    the test results are combinatorial and are thus computationally intensive. In
    this paper, it is proved that randomly generated tests can obtain the same result
    with a high probability. In fact, the probability of failure can be reduced by
    increasing the number of tests. It is proved that the number of the required tests
    (for successfully detecting the faulty sensors with a high probability) scales
    logarithmically with the number of the sensors and quadratically with the maximum
    number of faulty sensors. With the aid of the results of [7], in this paper, it
    is also proved that the problem of decoding the faulty sensors based on the random
    tests can be cast as a linear programming problem and therefore can be solved
    reliably and efficiently even for large scale systems. This problem is in close
    relationship to compressive sensing [8], [9], where few measurements are used
    to reconstruct a large, yet sparse (in some domain), vector of unknowns. Compressive
    sensing has been more recently applied to group testing [10], [11]. However, these
    results have not been utilized within the context of fault detection and cyber-security,
    which is the topic of this paper. Compressive sensing has been also utilized within
    control community [12]–[14]. However, the focus of those results has been on the
    observability and the state estimation of sparsely-representable dynamical systems.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II explains the problem
    formulation. The results are presented in Section III. Finally, numerical results
    are presented in Section IV and the paper is concluded in Section V. SECTION II.
    Problem Formulation Consider the discrete-time linear time-invariant1 dynamical
    system x[k+1] y[k] =Fx[k]+Gu[u]+w[k], =Hx[k]+v[k]+f[k], View Source where x[k]∈
    R n is the state of the system, u[k]∈ R m is the control input, w[k] is the process
    noise (modelling the effects of stochastic exogenous inputs and model uncertainties),
    y[k]∈ R p is the output measurement, v[k]∈ R p is the measurement noise (modelling
    the effect of sensing uncertainties and imperfections), and f[k]∈ R p models the
    sensing faults or malicious behaviours. It is assumed that w[k] and v[k] are independent
    i.i.d.2 zero mean Gaussian variables with covariance Q and R , respectively. A
    Kalman filter with a subset of measurements denoted by y K [k];=( y i [k] ) i∈K
    with K⊆{1,…,p} can be used to estimate the states of the system. The prediction
    step for the Kalman filter for this combination of outputs is given by x ^ K [k|k−1]=F
    x ^ K [k−1|k−1]+Gu[k−1], P K [k|k−1]=F P K [k−1|k−1] F ⊤ +Q, View Source where
    the estimates x ^ K [k|k−1] and x ^ K [k−1|k−1] , respectively, denote E{x[k]|
    y K [0],…, y K [k−1]} and E{x[k−1]| y K [0],…, y K [k−1]} , and P K [k−1|k−1]
    and P K [k|k−1] , respectively, denote the variance of E{x[k−1]| y K [0],…, y
    K [k−1]} and E{x[k]| y K [0],…, y K [k−1]} . The update step of the Kalman filter
    is also given by x ^ K [k|k] L K [k] P K [k|k] = x ^ K [k|k−1]+ L K [k]( y K [k]−
    H K x ^ K [k|k−1]), = P K [k|k−1] H ⊤ K ( H K P K [k|k−1] H ⊤ K + R K ) −1 , =(I−
    L K [k] H K ) P K [k|k−1], View Source where H K is a matrix containing subset
    of the rows of H corresponding to the sensor measurements in the set K and R K
    is the co-variance of v K [k] , i.e., the part of the measurement noise v[k] contained
    in the contributing to the selected outputs y K . Now, if the pair ( F, H K )
    is observable and f K [0]=0 (i.e., the outputs in K are fault free), the residual
    of this Kalman filter y K [k]− H K x ^ K [k|k] is an i.i.d. Gaussian random variable
    with zero mean and covariance H K P K [k|k] H ⊤ K +R [15]. Therefore, the χ 2
    -test or the Neyman-Pearson test can be utilized to figure out if the output measurements
    in K contain any faulty sensors to not. Define z i ∈{0,1} to be a boolean variable
    such that z i =0 if sensor i is not faulty (i.e., f i [k]=0 for all k ) and z
    i =1 otherwise. The Kalman filter approach above can be used to compute ξ K =(
    ⋁ j∈K z j )∨ ζ K , (1) View Source where ζ K is a Bernoulli random variable with
    mean q (i.e., the probability of the event ζ K =1 is equal to q ) capturing the
    false detection. Note that, without loss of generality, the tests can be fine
    tuned so that they have the same probability of false detections. Problem 1 Find
    a family of tests K t , t=1,…,T , such that the set of faulty sensors can be reconstructed
    from the noisy boolean measurements of the form (1) with a high probability. Now
    that problem formulation has been formalized, we can present the results of the
    paper. This is the subject of the next section. SECTION III. Main Results For
    a set of tests K t , t=1,…,T , define A∈{0,1 } T×p such that a ij , i.e., the
    entry in i -th row and j -th column of A , is equal to one if and only if j∈ K
    i . Hence, the boolean expression in (1) for a given test set K i can be rewritten
    as ξ K i =( ⋁ j=1 p ( a ij ∧ z j ))∨ ζ K i . View Source Note that there is an
    equivalent between each row of the matrix A and each test K i . Therefore, these
    entities can be used interchangeably. Following [7], recovering the exact vector
    of faults z:=( z i ) p i=1 can be achieved through solving the following non-linear
    integer program: ( z ^ , ζ ^ )∈ argmin z ¯ ¯ ¯ , ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ s.t.   ∥ z ¯ ¯ ¯ ∥ 0
    +α∥ ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ ∥ 0 , z ¯ ¯ ¯ ∈{0,1 } p , ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ ∈{0,1 } T , ξ K i =( ⋁ j=1 p ( a
    ij ∧ z ¯ ¯ ¯ j ))∨ ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ i , ∀i∈{1,…,T}, ∥ z ¯ ¯ ¯ ∥ 0 ≤d, (2a) (2b) (2c) (2d)
    (2e) View Source where d∈N denotes the maximum number of faults that can be present
    and α>0 is a constant balancing between the number of faults ∥ z ¯ ¯ ¯ ∥ 0 and
    the number of the miss identifications ∥ ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ ∥ 0 . For the noiseless case,
    that is if ζ i =0 , it can be shown that the optimization problem (2) can be transformed
    into: z ^ ∈ argmin z ¯ ¯ ¯ s.t.   ∥ z ¯ ¯ ¯ ∥ 0 , z ¯ ¯ ¯ ∈{0,1 } p ξ K i = ⋁
    j=1 p ( a ij ∧ z ¯ ¯ ¯ j ),∀i∈{1,…,T}, ∥ z ¯ ¯ ¯ ∥ 0 ≤d, (3a) (3b) (3c) (3d) View
    Source The optimization problem (3) can be utilized in this case to find the true
    vector of faults z:=( z i ) p i=1 if T = (elog2) d 2 log(p) [7], [16]. In this
    case, in fact a combinatorial method must be utilized to carefully construct a
    matrix A (or the tests K t , t=1,…,T equivalently) to ensure that the faults are
    always identifiable. Furthermore, a necessary condition on the number of the required
    tests for identification of the faults is T≥ d 2 log(p)/log(e(d+1)/2) [7], [16].
    Although powerful at reducing the number of required tests (in comparison to a
    brute-force approach), this method however is impractical for large-scale system
    due to two reasons. First, the computational complexity of designing the tests
    is high. Secondly, the optimization problem (3) is difficult to solve because
    of (i) the integer constraints in (3b), (ii) the non-linear nature of the equality
    constraint in (3c) and the inequality constraint in (3d), and (iii) the non-differentiable
    non-convex nature of the cost function. Therefore, this method can only be utilized
    for small systems with few faults (which is not in line with the motivation behind
    the use of group testing). To alleviate some of these issues, the optimization
    problem in (3) can be relaxed (or convexified) to get z ^ ∈ argmin z ¯ ¯ ¯ s.t.   ∥
    z ¯ ¯ ¯ ∥ 1 , z ¯ ¯ ¯ ∈[0,1 ] p , A i z ¯ ¯ ¯ =0,∀i∈{1,…,T}: ξ K i =0 A i z ¯

    Before moving any further, a few definitions must be presented. For any two boolean
    vectors a,b∈{0,1 } n , the union of a and b is given by a boolean vector c∈{0,1
    } n in which c j = a j ∨ b j for all 1≤j≤n . Further, a is said to be contained
    by b if {i| a i =1}⊆{i| b i =1} . Definition 1: k -DisjunctA boolean matrix A
    is called k -disjunct if the union of any k columns of A does not contain any
    other column from A . This condition for boolean vectors is similar at heart to
    the linear independence. A boolean matrix is k -disjunct if no group of any k
    columns from it can reconstruct any other of its columns. Proposition 1 The solution
    of (4) is a solution of (3) if A is d -disjunct. Proof The proof is a direct application
    of [7]. ■ Proposition 1 shows that the the relaxation in (4) takes away the complexity
    of solving (3) while not introducing any conservatism in terms of identifying
    faulty sensors if the measurement matrix (or the corresponding family of tests)
    is d -disjunct. However, the procedure for forming matrix A to be d -disjunct
    still remains complex. In what follows a random procedure for constructing the
    family of the tests so that the measurement matrix meets the condition of Proposition
    1 is considered. Let a randomly generated matrix A be generated such that a ij
    is a Bernoulli random variable with mean γ (i.e., the probability of the event
    a ij =1 is equal to γ ). For these random matrices, the following result can be
    proved. Proposition 2 P { A is d -disjunct} ≥1−1/ p δ for all T≥ (16+8δ) d 2 ln(p)
    . Proof Let A j denote the j -th column of A . We claim that if min j |{i| A j
    i =1}|≥α and max j 1 ≠ j 2 |{i| A j 1 i =1}∩{i| A j 2 i =1}|≤β , then A is ⌊(α−1)/β⌋
    -disjunct. To prove this claim, let us select an arbitrary set of ⌊(α−1)/β⌋ columns
    A j from matrix A . Now, any other column of matrix A , denoted by A ℓ , can share
    at most β non-zero elements with any column from our selection. Noting that there
    are ⌊(α−1)/β⌋ columns in the selection, A ℓ can at most share β⌊(α−1)/β⌋≤α−1 non-zero
    elements with the selection. Noting that A ℓ has at least α non-zero entries,
    there exists at least one non-zero element in A ℓ that cannot be matched by any
    of the columns from the selection. Therefore, A ℓ cannot be contained by the selection
    of the columns. Hence, the matrix A is ⌊(α−1)/β⌋ -disjunct. In the remainder of
    this proof, we show that these conditions are met with a high probability for
    the random matrix A . By Chernoff bound [17, Ch.4], it can be deduced that P{|{i|
    A j i  = 1}| ≤ γT/2}≤exp(−γT/8) because E{|{i| A ȷ i =1}|}=γT . This shows that
    P{∃j:|{i| A j i =1}|≤γT/2} ≤ ∑ j=1 p P{|{i| A j i =1}|≤γT/2} =pP{|{i| A j i =1}|≤γT/2}
    ≤pexp(−γT/8). View Source Similarly, with the aid of Chernoff bound [17, Ch. 4],
    it can bededuced that P{|{i| A j 1 i =1}∩{i| A j 2 i =1}|≥2 γ 2 T}≤ exp(− γ 2
    T/3) because E{|{i| A j 1 i =1}∩{i| A j 2 i =1}|}= γ 2 T . Therefore, it can be
    proved that P{∃ j 1 , j 2 :|{i| A j 1 i =1}∩{i| A j 2 i =1}|≥2 γ 2 T}  ≤ ∑ j 1
    ≠ j 2 P{∃ j 1 , j 2 :|{i| A j 1 i =1}∩{i| A j 2 i =1}|≥2 γ 2 T}  ≤p(p−1)exp(−
    γ 2 T/3)  ≤ p 2 exp(− γ 2 T/3). View Source Finally, with the aid of these two
    inequalities, it can be shown that P{ max j 1 ≠ j 2 |{i| A j 1 i =1}∩{i| A j 2
    i =1}|≤2 γ 2 T  and  min j |{i| A j i =1}|≥γT/2} =1−P{∃ j 1 , j 2 :|{i| A j 1
    i =1}∩{i| A j 2 i =1}|≥2 γ 2 T or ∃j:|{i| A j i =1}|≥γT/2} ≥1−(P{∃ j 1 , j 2 :|{i|
    A j 1 i =1}∩{i| A j 2 i =1}|≥2 γ 2 T}  +P{∃j:|{i| A j i =1}|≥γT/2}) ≥1− p 2 exp(−
    γ 2 T/3)−pexp(−γT/8). View Source Now, notice that ⌊ γT/2−1 2 γ 2 T ⌋≥ γT/2−1
    2 γ 2 T −1. View Source Hence, ⌊(γT/2−1)/(2 γ 2 T)⌋≥d (recall that A must be d
    - disjunct for a successful recovery), we must guarantee that γT/2−1 2 γ 2 T −1≥d.
    View Source For γ=1/d , this condition is equivalent to T≥2 d 2 /(5d+4) . A sufficient
    condition for this inequality is to select T≥ 2d/5 because 2d/5≥2 d 2 /(5d+4)
    for all d≥0 . Thus, P { A is d -disjunct} ≥1− p 2 exp(− γ 2 T/3)−pexp(−γT/8) if
    T≥2d/5 . Now, note that if T=c d 2 ln(p) and if γ=1/d , it can be seen that exp(−γT/8)=exp(−cdln(p)/8)=
    p −cd/8 . Thus, pexp(−γT/8)≤1/(2 p δ ) if c≥8( log p (2)+δ+1)/d . Similarly, if
    T=c d 2 ln(p) and γ=1/d , we get exp(− γ 2 T/3)=exp(−cln(p)/3)= p −c/3 . Therefore,
    p 2 exp(− γ 2 T/3)≤1/(2 p δ ) if c≥3(2+δ+ log p (2)) . Combining all these inequalities
    shows that P { A is d -disjunct} ≥1−1/ p δ if c≥8δ+8+8 log p (2) . Finally note
    that log p (2)=ln(2)/ln(p)≤ln(2)/ln(2)=1 for all p≥2 . Therefore, P { A is d -disjunct}
    ≥1−1/ p δ if c≥16+8δ . This concludes the proof. ■ Theorem 1 The solution of (4)
    is a solution of (3) with at least probability 1/ p δ if T≥24 d 2 ln(p) . Proof
    The proof follows from the application of the results of Propositions 1 and 2.
    ■ It should be noted as opposed the deterministic algorithms for generating matrix
    A , in the stochastic case, there is a non-zero probability for not being able
    to recover the faulty outputs correctly. However, this probability can be pushed
    arbitrarily close to zero. We need to also study the observability of the system
    using the random test sets. To do so, we need to define a sense of redundancy
    among the sensors. Definition 2: k -observableA pair of matrices ( F,H ) is k
    -observable if ( F, H K ) is observable for any K with cardinality k . Again,
    we would like to mention that there is an equivalence between A and the family
    of tests ( K i ) T i=1 . Therefore, these entities can be used interchangeably.
    Proposition 3 Let ( F,H ) be k -observable. Then P {( A, H K ) is observable}
    ≥1−1/ p δ for a Bernoulli test K (corresponding to the rows of the matrix A )
    if k≤p/d−2δln(p) . Proof For a given test K , a sufficient condition for ( F,
    H K ) to be observable is to have |K|≥k . The Chernoff bound [17. Ch.4] shows
    that P{|K|≥k}≥1−exp(− (p−kd ) 2 p 2dp ), ∀k≤ p d . View Source To ensure P{|K|≥k}≥1−1/
    p δ , we must ensure that exp(− (p−kd ) 2 p 2dp )≤ 1 p δ . View Source This condition
    is satisfied if k≤p/d−2δln(p) . This concludes the proof. ■ Proposition 3 shows
    that to ensure observability with the randomly selected outputs, the systems needs
    to have a high level of redundancy if d>0 . For instance, for d=2 , the system
    must be (p/2−2δln(p)) -observable, i.e., more than half of the sensor measurements
    must be redundant for observability. However, the condition implies that the system
    must be (p−2δln(p)) -observable for d=1 , which is not extremely conservative.
    Reducing the conservatism of this condition remains an important avenue for future
    research. Fig. 1. Probability of successful recovery as a function of the number

    (5c) (5d) (5e) (5f) View Source In the next section, we demonstrate the applicability
    of these results over a large scale dynamical system. SECTION IV. Numerical Example
    The applicability of the developed algorithms is demonstrated on a water channel
    with N pools. The model and the parameters of the pools are borrowed from [18],
    [19]. Each pool can be modelled by y i (s)= c in,i s e − t d,i s h i (s)− c out,i
    s h i+1 (s)+ c out,i s ζ i (s), View Source where c in,i and c out,i are the discharge
    rates of the gates between neighbouring pools, t d,i is the delay associated with
    the transport of water along each pool, ζ i (s) is the overall off-take flow load
    on pool i,  h i (s) is the flow of water from pool i−1 to pool i , and y i (s)
    denotes the water level in pool i . The transfer function of the delay is replaced
    with its first-order Padé approximation. This is due to that the closed-loop dynamics
    of the channel with local PI3 controllers is insensitive to the open-loop modelling
    error associated with the Padé approximation of the delay (because the loop-gain
    at frequencies where the approximation error is significant is small) [20]. Each
    pool is assumed to be locally controlled by h i (s)= κ i ( η i s+1) s( ρ i s+1)
    ( u i (s)− y i (s)), View Source where κ i ,  η i , and ρ i are appropriately
    selected control parameters, and u i (s) is the reference signal of pool i . The
    aggregate model of the system is discretized with the sampling time of 30 sec
    (or 0.5 min) with a zero-order hold on the reference signals. Following that,
    the model of the whole system is given by x[k+1]=Ax[k]+Bu[k]+w[k], View Source
    where w[k] is a process noise modelling the effect of local disturbances, such
    as off-take uncertainties, and physical phenomenons, such as wind. The variance
    of the process noise is set as Q=0.01I . The outputs of the system y[k] are the
    measurements of water level at all the pool and the water flow among all the pools.
    The variance of the measurement is equal to R=0.0025I . We consider the case where
    the sensors of the pool can simultaneously drop, e.g., due to communication issues.
    Thus p=N (as there are N pools). Furthermore, it is assumed that the maximum number
    of sensor faults is d=2 . Finally, to ensure observability of the system, it is
    assumed that each test involves the measurements of the last pool. This can be
    motivated by that the last pool is monitored separately to see if its sensors
    are faulty or not while the rest of the pools being remote locations cannot be
    accessed for regular service. A. Noiseless Measurements We start by demonstrating
    the noiseless case divorced from the underlying dynamical system. Consider the
    case where p=100 and noiseless measurements of the form (1) are available. Further,
    it is assumed that two simultaneous faults are present. Figure 1 illustrates the
    probability of successfully detecting the faulty measurements (empirically estimated
    using 1000 simulations) versus number of tests. Evidently the probability of successful
    recovery improves with increasing the number of the tests. There is a threshold
    after the linear programming algorithm almost surely recover the faulty entries
    almost surely. Figure 2 shows the probability of success versus both the number
    of the tests T and the number of fault locations p . As expected the number of
    the required tests to be able to extract the location of the faults reliably grows
    slowly with the number of the fault locations p . Fig. 3. Probability of successful
    recovery as a function of the number of the tests T for the noisy case with p=20
    and χ 2 -test over a window of 10 samples. Show All B. Noisy Measurements Consider
    the case there are N=20 pools in the irrigation network. We use the Kalman filters
    in Section II to investigate if the sensors in each pool are faulty or not. We
    use the χ 2 -test over a window of 10 samples to decide if there is a fault present
    or not, i.e., it is deemed that a fault is present if, for some k , 1 20 ∑ t=0
    9 ( y K [k−t]− H K x ^ K [k−t|k−t] ) ⊤ ×( H K P K [k−t|k−t] H ⊤ K +R ) −1 ×( y
    K [k−t]− H K x ^ K [k−t|k−t])≥2. View Source In what follows, the faulty outputs
    are determined using the linear programming problem in (5) with α=10 . Figure
    3 illustrates probability of successful recovery (empirically estimated using
    1000 simulations) as a function of the number of the tests T for the noisy case
    with p=20 . As expected, the probability of successful recovery is an increasing
    function of T . However, the probability of successful recover does not reach
    one even for T=20 . This is because no matter what there is always false detection
    due to stochastic nature of the problem and the use of the Kalman filters for
    fault detection. SECTION V. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, randomly
    generated tests were used to identify faulty sensors with a high probability.
    This method requires fewer tests required tests for successfully detecting the
    faulty sensors with a high probability in comparison to the brute-force method
    of checking all the sensors separately. In fact, the number of the tests scales
    logarithmically with the number of the sensors and quadratically with the maximum
    number of faulty sensors. The identification of the faulty sensors can also be
    done by solving a linear program. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Salem, India SECTION I. Introduction One
    of the biggest problems that open field/soil-based agriculture has had to face
    since the rise of civilization is the reduction in available land. The human population
    is expanding at a startling rate. To feed the growing population, agricultural
    output must rise. In addition, drier conditions. Frequent drought conditions,
    unpredictable climate and weather patterns, rising temperatures, river pollution,
    wasted water, declining ground water level, etc. are threatening factors when
    using traditional farming technique in some of the cultivable areas like Thiruvallur,
    outer regions of Kanchipuram, Chennai etc. So, a method of growing plants without
    soil, known as hydroponics, is proposed. Hydroponics is a type of hydro culture
    in which plants are grown in nutrient-free water with minimal soil. As a rule,
    less water and land are needed for farming. Hydroponics also makes terrace farming
    a reality, which can provide a steady supply of healthy produce [1]. Hydroponics
    intelligence allows the system to function without human input. The result is
    a rise in agricultural output per unit of water and arable land. IoT, or the interconnection
    of things, is what allows machines to communicate with one another automatically.
    A prediction algorithm using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term
    Memory (LSTM) could increase the accuracy of automated processes [2]. SECTION
    II. Literature Review This article discusses the research works that are being
    done to implement an Intelligent Internet of Things- by utilising IoT and machine
    learning technologies, based hydroponics system. Developing smart hydroponics
    system. A. Iot in Hydroponics The term “Internet of things” (IoT) refers to the
    concept of connecting people and things via the internet and storing data gathered
    in the cloud for future analysis. Farmers can now automate the hydroponic growing
    process thanks to the Internet of Things. Monitoring and controlling variables
    such as water level, pH, temperature, and light intensity are all possible with
    the help of the Internet of Things [3]. Shreya Tembe(2015), [4] has developed
    an Internet of Things-based hydroponics system. The sensors in the system are
    interfaced with a Wi-Fi module for monitoring, and the automated part of the system
    includes sprinklers for pests, a humidity adjustment unit, and a pH up/down pump
    according to the plant''s needs. S. Keerthana [5]., has created an environment-driven
    control technique that can successfully reduce CO2 concentration, raise water
    level, and lower temperature. This technique makes use of sensors, LED lighting,
    a water pump, and water spray. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on historical
    data from an IoT-based hydroponics system to predict the appropriate control action.
    Supervised learning algorithms, in particular, can be used to learn patterns and
    relationships between input variables. (e.g., sensor data, environmental conditions)
    and output variables (e.g., control actions, system performance). The general
    approach to predicting control actions using machine learning involves the following
    steps: Step 1. Data collection: Gather information from sensors and other sources
    throughout the hydroponics system. Temperature, humidity, pH levels, nutrient
    levels, and other environmental variables may be included in this data. Step 2.
    Data pre-processing: Clean and pre-process the data to ensure that it is in a
    suitable format for machine learning algorithms. This may involve removing missing
    values, normalizing the data, and transforming variables as needed. Feature engineering:
    Identify and extract relevant features from the data, such as statistical summaries
    or time-series features that can be used to train machine learning models. Step
    3. Model selection: Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm for the task
    at hand. For example, a decision tree algorithm may be suitable for predicting
    discrete control actions, while a regression algorithm may be better for predicting
    continuous variables such as nutrient levels. Step 4. Model training: On the pre-processed
    data, train the chosen machine learning model. This entails dividing the data
    into training and validation sets, fitting the model to the training data, and
    assessing its performance on the validation data. Step 5. Model evaluation: Evaluate
    the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy
    or mean squared error. If the model is not performing well, additional pre-processing
    or feature engineering may be necessary. Step 6. Control action prediction: Once
    a satisfactory model has been trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict
    appropriate control actions based on input sensor data. These control actions
    can be communicated to the hardware components of the hydroponics system to regulate
    environmental conditions and optimize plant growth. Overall, predicting appropriate
    control actions in an IoT-based hydroponics system entails collecting and pre-
    processing data, identifying relevant features, selecting and training machine
    learning models, and evaluating and using the trained models to predict control
    actions. B. Machine Learning in Hydroponics Machine learning, a subset of artificial
    intelligence (AI), allows computers to act autonomously after being taught how
    to perform a specific task. It does this by teaching the computer to perform specific
    actions in the beginning, a machine must learn how to think and reason like a
    human being in order to think like a human mind. K. P. Ferentinos [6] has developed
    a deep neural network model that uses parameters of farming as input and has the
    ability to predict the conductivity and pH of the nutrient solutions. According
    to the literature review, one of the shortcomings of the older system was that
    the automation that was developed using IoT lacked the intelligence necessary
    to base on the trained parameters, generate the appropriate control action for
    the hydroponic environment. The machine intelligence developed in hydroponics
    was not designed for an internet of things system. The system in this implementation
    is only concerned with applying machine learning algorithms. like Bayesian and
    ANN, in order to predict the appropriate control action based on the trained parameters
    [7]. The main objective of the work was not to regulate the hydroponic environment.
    As a result, the focus of this work is on creating an intelligent hydroponics
    system that is based on the Internet of Things and in which the control actions
    are based on real-time parameters that are gathered from the hydroponics system''s
    sensors. A Raspberry Pi is used to process data in order to work on a controller
    and a prediction algorithm for this control action. Fig. 1. Circuit for collecting
    data from traditional forming Show All Fig. 2. Block diagram for implementing
    iot based hydroponics Show All C. Proposed Method The values of the parameters,
    Fig. 1. such as moisture, pH, temperature, light intensity, and water flow, are
    uploaded to the cloud using Node MCU. The parameters that are collected include:
    moisture, pH, temperature, light intensity, and water flow. The human mind generates
    decisions for the future based on the past experiences and information that it
    has been exposed to, and these decisions are influenced by the past. In the field
    of hydroponics, the algorithm for machine learning can be utilised in a variety
    of settings. ESP-01, DHT-11, and Controller Mega 2560 are components of the smart
    fodder hydroponics system. Liquid PH value detection sensor module (PH Board +
    PH Electrode Probe), DS1820 waterproof temperature sensor, photosensitive light

    and the controller mega 2560 pins. The Ardunio Mega 2560 and the Firebase real-time
    database are connected by ESP-01. SECTION III. Recurrent Neural Network The only
    direction of mapping in a multi layered perceptron (MLP) is from input to output
    vectors. As a result of its unique structure, RNN is able to map each input to
    an output based on the entire history of inputs. Sequence predictions are built
    into RNNS''s. RNNs can process a sequence of inputs thanks to their internal cell
    state memory. Humidity, temperature, and water level can all be predicted with
    an RNN model. The accuracy of the Hydroponics system can be improved through the
    use of IoT to regulate the system using the algorithm''s output [8]. To determine
    whether or not an event is normal or abnormal, the RNN takes as input the data
    collected by the sensors. RNNs are built from layers upon layers of nodes that
    resemble neurons. A real-valued weight can be assigned to each connection. RNN
    generates a value error with every sequence it processes. In order to learn, RNNs
    employ a method called Back-Propagation over time, which is enabled by the activation
    function. An algorithm called back propagation uses the model''s output to determine
    the optimal weight for each neuron, thereby producing the most precise prediction
    possible. Hidden state is an internal cell state within each node in an RNN. Each
    time step in the RNN is made up of a unit with a fixed activation function. It
    is the job of the activation function to determine whether or not each neuron
    in the network should be activated in order to make predictions based on the information
    it has been given. Each neuron''s output is rounded to the nearest 1 or −1 by
    activation functions. In RNN models, activation functions tend to be non-linear.
    Due to their derivative function, which is related to the inputs, non-linear activation
    functions allow for back propagation.[9]. The Sigmoid and Tanh are employed here

    for the sigmoid function, and its domain is from 0 to 1. S=1/(1+ e −X ) (1) View
    Source Tanh Function The range of the logistics function is from −1 to 1, and
    it can be expressed in the equation that has been provided. In RNN, activations
    reach the hidden layer from both the current input and hidden layers below, where
    T denotes the tanh function. These activations are sent up from the hidden layers.

    back one step in time. This secret state stores the historical information regarding
    the network at the specified time step. Utilizing the recurrence relation 3 allows
    for the hidden state to be brought up to date at each time step. h t =fw/( x t
    + h t−1 ) (3) View Source where the input state is represented by xt, the previous
    state by ht-1, and the current state by ht. This created hidden state is then
    used to create another hidden state, and so on. In this case, the network will
    receive four inputs. At each time step, the same weight and function are used.
    The formula for applying the Activation function (tanh)at time t is given in Equation
    4. h t =tanh( W hh h t−1 )+ w xh x t ) (4) View Source Wxh stands for the weight
    at the input neuron and wh represents the weight at the recurrent neuron. The
    unit activations that result are propagated through the hidden to output layer.
    After calculating the final current state after all time steps, the output state
    is calculated using in Equation 5. y t = w hy h t (5) View Source Why is the weight
    at the output layer, where yt is the output? Let yt be the predicted output of
    the network at any time step and yt 1 be the actual output. The difference between
    model values and actual values E t = − y ′ t log( y t ) (6) View Source This error
    value is used in the gradient descent weight updation algorithm. B. Disadvantage
    of RNN Although the basic RNN is effective, it has a significant flaw. Back-Propagation
    can cause the following problems in deep networks: Vanishing Gradients: This type
    of issue occurs when the weight change (gradients) becomes very small. Exploding
    Gradients: This problem occurs when gradients become excessively large as a result
    of back propagation. LSTM networks are an RNN network extension that basically
    expands their memory. C. Long Short Term Memory The layers of an RNN are built
    using the units of an LSTM, which is known as an RNN-LSTM network. By introducing
    various activation function layers known as gates, the LSTM recurrent unit retains
    all prior knowledge while eliminating irrelevant data value in Fig. 4. Fig. 4.
    Architecture of RNN-LSTM Show All The current input is denoted by Xt, the previous
    output is denoted by Ht-1, the current output is denoted by Ht, and the current
    cell state memory is denoted by Ctis. D. Working of RNN-LSTM D. Working of RNN-LSTM
    Additionally, each LSTM recurrent unit maintains a vector known as the Internal
    Cell State, which lists the data that the preceding LSTM recurrent unit decided
    to keep. The previous current state, previous internal state, and current input
    are fed into the LSTM. The values of four different gates are calculated using
    the following function, where (sigmoid) and tanh are activation functions. Forget
    gate(ft): no longer useful information is removed. f t =σ( W xf X t )+ W hf h
    −t−1 + W ci c t−1 + b f ) (7) View Source input gate(it): This gate contains additional
    information that is useful to the cell state. i t =σ( W xi X t + W hi h t−1 +
    W ci c t +  b i ) (8) View Source Output gate (ot): Useful information is extracted
    from the current cell state and provided as an output. o t =σ( w xo X t + W ho
    h t−1 + W co c t−1 + b o ) (9) View Source As shown in equation 11, the current
    internal cell state (Ct) is calculated by element-wise multiplying the forget
    gate by the previous internal cell state, adding that result, and finally subtracting
    the vector of the input gate. C t = f t c t−1 +itanh( w xct X t + W hc ht−1+ b
    c ) (10) View Source Equation 12 demonstrates how to calculate the current hidden
    state (ht) by multiplying the output gate by the hyperbolic tangent of the current
    internal cell state vector. h t = o t tanh(ct) (11) View Source The RNN-LSTM network
    also produces an output error value called Et at each time step. This output is
    what is used to train the network utilising gradient descent. In the event that
    the gradient begins to converge on zero, the weights of the gates can be modified
    accordingly in order to bring it closer to the value 1. E. Advantage of LSTM-RNN
    Over RNN LSTM are a specialised subtype of RNN that are able to learn long-term
    dependencies and make accurate predictions based on time series data. Problems
    with exploding and vanishing gradients, which can arise during the training of
    traditional RNNs, are addressed by this method. Therefore, LSTM RNN is superior
    to RNN when it comes to making predictions in hydroponics systems. SECTION IV.
    Implementation and Analysis To implement and analyse an RNN-LSTM, you can follow
    these steps: Data Preparation: Prepare the data that is required to use for training
    and testing the RNN-LSTM. This can involve tasks such as cleaning the data, splitting
    it into training and testing sets, and encoding it in a suitable format for the
    RNN-LSTM. Model Architecture: Define the RNN-LSTM architecture. The number of
    layers, the number of units in each layer, the activation function, and the loss
    function must all be specified. Table I. Data collected from traditional forming
    Training: Train the RNN-LSTM using the training data. This involves specifying
    the number of epochs, the batch size, and the optimizer. Monitor the training
    process by keeping track of the loss and accuracy metrics. Evaluation: Evaluate
    the performance of the RNN-LSTM using the testing data. Calculate metrics such
    as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Analysis: Analyse the results of
    the evaluation and identify areas where the RNN-LSTM performed well and where
    it can be improved. Use this analysis to fine-tune the model and repeat the training
    and evaluation steps as needed[10]. Deployment: Once you are satisfied with the
    performance of the RNN-LSTM, deploy it in a production environment. Some popular
    tools and frameworks for implementing and analyzing RNN-LSTMs include TensorFlow,
    Keras, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. These tools provide a range of pre-built models,
    as well as APIs for customizing the model architecture, training, and evaluation.
    The conventional method of farming makes use of an Electronic circuit that can
    measure both the temperature and the relative humidity of the air. During the
    process of automating using IoT, these values were logged for use in setting thresholds.
    The Node MCU ESP8266 is used to collect the values that the sensor provides. This
    determines the minimum acceptable value of temperature and humidity for the implemented
    region so that plants can grow to their full potential in that environment[11].
    IoT makes it possible to control the motor that is pumping the water to the pipeline
    so that flow occurs only when the motor is turned ON. This can be done by measuring
    the flow of water. This controlling process could be carried out based on the
    temperature and humidity value respectively. The sprinkler might turn on if the
    temperature is high enough to exceed the predetermined threshold of 28 degrees
    Celsius. This is done so that the high temperature is maintained[12]. In a similar
    fashion, if the humidity of the soil is below the threshold, the water flow through
    the drip link may be turned ON in order to raise the moisture level of the soil
    and maintain it at a level sufficient to meet the needs of the plant in order
    for it to grow successfully. Fig. 5. Hydroponic setup Show All 4.2 Implementation
    if Hydroponics Forming The work use a variety of materials like pipe, end dummy,
    coconut fibre, etc. After the calculated distance between holes has been drilled
    (0.75 feet per hole), the coconut coir and dust mixture is tightly packed in the
    polyethylene cover. The packet is inserted into the hole depicted in Fig. 5 above.
    Seeds of cereals and pulses were sown into the packets, the setup was moved to
    get proper sunlight after 10 days, and the water level and other parameters were
    continuously monitored by respective sensors, and the data were uploaded to the
    cloud. Hydroponics technique called Nutrient film technique is implemented. The
    system is made fully automatic by controlling the sprinklers and the flow of water
    through the pipeline in accordance with the instantaneous information gathered
    from the sensors (Temperature and Humidity) Fig 6. Fig. 6. Data collected from
    traditional forming Show All A. Prediction Algorithm The RNN-LSTM network is fed
    the collected hydroponics data. This algorithm has been created in Jupyter notebook.
    RNNs are a type of neural network that is designed to work with sequential data,
    such as time series data or natural language text[13]. The main idea behind RNNs
    is to use the previous step''s output as an input to the current step. This enables
    the network to keep an internal state that stores information from previous steps.
    Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of RNN designed specifically for dealing
    with long-term dependencies. LSTMs address the vanishing gradient problem, which
    occurs when the gradients used to update the network weights become very small,
    making long-term dependencies difficult for the network to learn. The use of memory
    cells and gates to control the flow of information through the network is a key
    feature of LSTMs. The memory cell is a unit that stores data over time, and the
    gates control how much data is stored or discarded at each step. B. Sigmoid Function
    Needed The sigmoid function is a mathematical function that is used frequently
    in machine learning and artificial neural networks [14]. It is a non-linear function
    that transforms an input value into a value between 0 and 1. The sigmoid function
    has the following formula: f(x)=1/(1+ e ∧ (−x)) (12) View Source where x is the
    input value. In artificial neural networks, the sigmoid function is frequently
    used as an activation function. The activation function determines a neuron''s
    output given its inputs. The sigmoid function is especially useful because it
    converts any input value to a number between 0 and 1, which can then be interpreted
    as a probability or confidence score. In logistic regression, the sigmoid function
    is used to model the probability that a binary output variable (e.g., whether
    an email is spam or not) takes a particular value given some input variables (e.g.,
    the words in the email). One of the limitations of the sigmoid function is that
    its output saturates at 0 or 1 for very large or very small input values, respectively.
    This can make it difficult for the network to learn when the input values are
    very large or small. Additionally, the sigmoid function is not zero-cantered,
    which can make it difficult to learn in deeper networks. Overall, the sigmoid
    function is a useful tool in machine learning and neural networks, but it is important
    to understand its limitations and when it is appropriate to use it[15]. C. The
    RNN-LSTM Works on Detecting Faults in Hydroponics RNN-LSTM, or Recurrent Neural
    Network-Long Short-Term Memory, is a type of neural network that is well-suited
    for sequence data processing, making it an effective tool for detecting faults
    in hydroponics systems. In the case of lettuce plantation being grown using nutrient
    film technology, RNN-LSTM can be used to detect and diagnose faults in the system
    based on sensor data collected over time. In general, RNNLS TM works by processing
    sequential data, such as time series data, where each data point is dependent
    on the previous data points in the sequence. The RNN-LSTM consists of multiple
    layers of nodes or neurons, and each node in the network receives inputs from
    the previous layer of nodes and passes its output to the next layer of nodes.
    In the case of detecting faults in hydroponics systems, the RNN-LSTM can be trained
    using sensor data collected from the system. The sensor data can include parameters
    such as pH, nutrient concentration, temperature, and water flow rate. By feeding
    this data into the RNN-LSTM, the network can learn to detect patterns and anomalies
    in the data that may indicate faults in the hydroponic system. For example, if
    the sensor data indicates a sudden drop in pH levels or a change in nutrient concentration,
    the RNN-LSTM can analyze this data and determine if it represents a fault or anomaly
    in the system. The network can then provide an alert or notification to the grower
    or system operator, allowing them to take action to address the issue before it
    becomes a more serious problem. Overall, the RNN-LSTM is an effective tool for
    detecting faults in hydroponic systems, such as the lettuce plantation being grown
    using nutrient film technology. By analyzing sensor data over time, the network
    can learn to detect patterns and anomalies in the data, providing early warning
    of potential faults or issues in the system. The RNN-LSTM algorithm''s error value
    output could be used to operate the sprinkler in a hydroponics setup. Until this
    error value is reset to zero, the sprinkler will remain in the ON position. Figure
    9 depicts the MATLAB output. Thus, the prediction algorithm''s error values can
    be used to calibrate the hydroponics farming environment to optimal conditions
    for the plant species in question. The outcomes obtained through the utilisation
    of hydroponics have unforeseen benefits. The investigation into the utilisation
    of deep neural networks for the purpose of analysing hydroponic parameters in
    order to control actions proved to be crucial. The dataset included 5000 real-time
    entries, each of which contained a value for a metric such as pH, temperature,
    humidity, light intensity, or water level. Over a period of 10000 epochs, the
    input was trained. Generated the appropriate control action with a label ranging
    from 0 to 7. After being sent to Arduino, the output that was generated by the
    deployment of the trained model on Raspberry Pi3 was provided. The information
    and the forecast were saved in a database called Firebase, which is hosted in
    the cloud [16]. As an AI language model, there is no access to the specific database
    details of any particular research study. However, in general, a well-designed
    database for a hydroponics system should include the following: Tables Tables
    should be created to store data related to each aspect of the hydroponics system.
    For example, there may be a table for sensor readings, a table for system settings,
    and a table for user data. Columns Each table should have relevant columns that
    store specific types of data. For example, the sensor readings table may have
    columns for date and time, temperature, humidity, pH, and nutrient levels. Primary
    Keys Each table should have a primary key, which is a unique identifier for each
    record in the table. Foreign Keys Foreign keys can be used to establish relationships
    between tables. For example, the sensor readings table may have a foreign key
    that links it to the system settings table, allowing users to view sensor readings
    for a specific system configuration. Indexes Indexes can be used to improve the
    performance of database queries by allowing for faster data retrieval. Backups
    Regular backups should be performed to ensure that data is not lost in the event
    of a system failure or other issue. Overall, the design of the database should
    be based on the specific needs of the hydroponics system and the types of data
    that need to be stored and retrieved. The database should be carefully designed
    and optimized to ensure reliable and efficient operation of the hydroponics system
    [17], [18]. D. Web Technology is Applied in the Proposed Design In the proposed
    design mentioned in the abstract, web technology is applied to provide a user
    interface for monitoring and controlling the hydroponics system remotely. This
    allows users to access and control the system from any device with a web browser
    and an internet connection, such as a smartphone, tablet, or computer. The use
    of web technology in the design allows for easy and convenient access to the system,
    without the need for specialized software or hardware. This means that users can
    monitor and control the system from anywhere, at any time, as long as they have
    internet access. The web technology used in the design may include a web server,
    a database, and a user interface or dashboard that displays data and allows for
    system control. The web server handles requests and responses from the user interface,
    while the database stores and retrieves data related to the hydroponics system,
    such as sensor readings, system settings, and user preferences [19], [20]. The
    user interface or dashboard allows users to view real-time data from the hydroponics
    system, such as temperature, humidity, and nutrient levels. Users can also adjust
    system settings, such as nutrient concentration or water flow rate, directly from
    the dashboard. Additionally, the dashboard may include alerts or notifications
    for system events, such as low nutrient levels or system faults. Overall, the
    use of web technology in the proposed design allows for convenient remote monitoring
    and control of the hydroponics system, providing users with easy access to real-time
    data and system control. E. The Results Provided Discussions and the supporting
    illustrations on the research findings observed. As an AI language model, I don''t
    have access to the specific results and findings of any particular research study.
    However, some general guidance is provided on how a research study should report
    and discuss its findings. In general, the results section of a research study
    should provide a clear and concise presentation of the data and findings. This
    can include tables, figures, and statistical analysis to support the results.
    The discussion section should then provide a more detailed interpretation and
    explanation of the results, including any limitations of the study and implications
    for future research. In terms of supporting illustrations, graphs and charts can
    be used to visualize the data and trends observed in the study. For example, a
    line graph could be used to show the change in pH levels over time in a hydroponics
    system, while a bar chart could be used to compare nutrient concentrations between
    different treatment groups. In the discussion section, the researchers should
    provide a thorough analysis and interpretation of the results, including any unexpected
    findings or limitations of the study. The discussion should also link the results
    back to the research question or hypothesis, and consider the broader implications
    of the findings for the field of hydroponics. Overall, a well-written results
    section and discussion section should provide a clear and thorough presentation
    of the data and findings, and allow the reader to fully understand the implications
    and significance of the study. SECTION V. Conclusion The hydroponics system can
    be controlled remotely through the cloud, with the control being determined by
    the readings from the sensors. The RNN-LSTM deep learning algorithm served as
    the foundation for the prediction models that were utilised in this investigation.
    The system, which includes the sprinkler motor and the light, is controlled manually
    through the cloud based on the results obtained from these prediction models.
    The trained RNN-LSTM could be utilised to control nutrient solutions in closed-loop
    soilless cultures, with the control being based on the prediction of future values
    of temperature, humidity, and light. This work contributes to an increase in productivity
    and helps to raise awareness among farmers about ways in which they can improve
    their farming in areas with fewer cultivable acres and fewer water resources.
    There is no requirement for the farmers to perform continuous monitoring of the
    cultivation process. This work can also be carried out on a terrace and turned
    into an activity for the household, in order to enable as many people as possible
    to participate in farming and benefit from it. The use of hydroponics has simplified
    the process of farming significantly. In conventional farming, more labour may
    be required, whereas in hydroponic farming, the only thing that is necessary is
    a vertical farming setup rather than labour. The error values generated by the
    deep neural network will be utilised in the upcoming work to automate the entire
    hydroponics farming process. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

  description: Automated watering systems provide a reliable source of ad libitum
    water to animal cages. Our facility uses an automated water delivery system to
    support approximately 95% of the housed population (approximately 14,000 mouse
    cages). Drinking valve failure rates from 2002 through 2006 never exceeded the
    manufacturer standard of 0.1% total failure, based on monthly cage census and
    the number of floods. In 2007, we noted an increase in both flooding and cases
    of clinical dehydration in our mouse population. Using manufacturer's specifications
    for a water flow rate of 25 to 50 mL/min, we initiated a wide-scale screening
    of all valves used. During a 4-mo period, approximately 17,000 valves were assessed,
    of which 2200 failed according to scoring criteria (12.9% overall; 7.2% low flow;
    1.6% no flow; 4.1% leaky). Factors leading to valve failures included residual
    metal shavings, silicone flash, introduced debris or bedding, and (most common)
    distortion of the autoclave-rated internal diaphragm and O-ring. Further evaluation
    revealed that despite normal autoclave conditions of heat, pressure, and steam,
    an extreme negative vacuum pull caused the valves' internal silicone components
    (diaphragm and O-ring) to become distorted and water-permeable. Normal flow rate
    often returned after a 'drying out' period, but components then reabsorbed water
    while on the animal rack or during subsequent autoclave cycles to revert to a
    variable flow condition. On the basis of our findings, we recalibrated autoclaves
    and initiated a preventative maintenance program to mitigate the risk of future
    valve failure. Copyright 2011 by the American Association for Laboratory Animal

  description: In this paper we develop reconfiguration schemes to mitigate water
    level sensor and gate (actuator) failures in automated irrigation channels. Analytical
    redundancy inherent in the system is used for control and signal reconfiguration.
    Sensor faults are dealt with by estimating the correct value of the signal measured
    by the faulty sensor and using the estimated signal as input to the controller.
    A generic rule for the design of estimators is given which facilitates rapid design
    of a large number of estimators as required in a large scale irrigation network.
    An actuator fault necessitates relaxation of the control objective, and it requires
    both signal and controller reconfiguration. It is shown in simulations that the
    reconfiguration schemes work satisfactorily throughout the entire operating regime
    of the irrigation channel. © 2005 IEEE.

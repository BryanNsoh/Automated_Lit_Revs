    Abstract Irrigation is key to increasing crop yield and meeting the global demand
    for food. This study reports the assessment of tomato water consumption by bioristor,
    a new in vivo an Organic ElectroChemical Transistor-based biosensor. Bioristor
    enables direct, real-time acquisition of biophysical information about the plant’s
    water requirements directly from the plant sap, and thus the water input can be
    adjusted accordingly. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of
    bioristor in rapidly detecting changes in the plant’s water status enhancing water
    use and irrigation efficiency in tomato cultivation with significant savings in
    the water supply. To this end, experiments were carried out in 2018 and 2020 in
    Parma (Italy) in tomato fields under different water regimes. The sensor response
    index (R) produced by bioristor recorded the real time plant health status, highlighting
    an excess in the water supplied as well as the occurrence of drought stress during
    the growing season. In both years, bioristor showed that the amount of water supplied
    could have been reduced by 36% or more. Bioristor also measured the timing and
    duration of leaf wetting: 438 h and 409 h in 2018 and 2020, respectively. These

    reflectometry sensor Article 01 April 2015 Introduction Agriculture must provide
    food for the 10 billion people expected to inhabit the planet by 2050, despite
    the decreased availability of land and water and the competition from other uses,
    such as non-food crops, urbanization, or industrial development (FAO, 2021). To
    date, around 70% of the freshwater available on the planet goes into irrigation
    (FAO, 2021), yet only a fraction of this is used by crops; the rest is lost via
    evaporation or consumed by competing weeds. Crop yields are greatly affected by
    temperature and rainfall, to the point that water shortage represents the most
    important environmental factor limiting crop growth, development, and yield (Ben
    Mariem et al., 2021; Polinova et al., 2019; Wing et al., 2021). Optimization of
    water use efficiency is key to addressing climate change and food security. Tomato
    (Solanum lycopersicum L.), a high-value crop for the Italian market, is mainly
    cultivated under irrigation (Corbari et al., 2021), and a non-controlled reduction
    in water availability could lead to yield losses of up to 50% (Cantore et al.,
    2016; Takács et al., 2020). To improve crop yields and optimize farm management,
    precision agriculture and assist management decisions can concretely enhance sustainability
    in agriculture. Sensors allow farmers to map the topography and resources in detail
    (water, nutrient availability, soil topology), as well as variables such as soil
    pH and temperature (Yin et al., 2021). Several technologies, mainly based on proximal
    and remote sensing approaches, are currently used to develop, and test multiple
    indices and techniques for precision water management. Vegetation indices such
    as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, Wong et al., 2022) and precision
    agriculture tools such as unmanned aerial vehicles, are currently being used to
    develop decision support systems to achieve optimized resource inputs (Loures
    et al., 2020, p. 202). The need to establish the plant water content has prompted
    the development of several approaches to detect the physiological status of the
    plant and of the surrounding environment (Shafi et al., 2019). These approaches
    are based on terahertz radiation combined with psychrometry to determine the leaf
    pressure-volume (Browne et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). Such approaches entail
    using VIR/NIR spectroscopy (Jiang, 2020; Zhang et al., 2012); electrical impedance
    spectroscopy (Ben Hamed et al., 2016; Jamaludin et al., 2015; Janni et al., 2021;
    Jócsák et al., 2019); infrared technology (Kaiser et al., 2022; Parihar et al.,
    2021); ultrasonic techniques (Fariñas et al., 2022; Sancho-Knapik et al., 2013);
    and leaf patch clamps (Cabrita, 2022; Ehrenberger et al., 2012). In addition,
    soil moisture sensors and electrical conductivity sensors are used to monitor
    soil temperature and structures (Bonfante, 2019; Polinova et al., 2019), salinity
    and conductivity, air temperature and humidity, air pressure and wind speed (Shafi
    et al., 2019). However, these technologies have three main limitations: (i) lack
    of dynamic and continuous monitoring, (ii) indirect acquisition of the plant water
    status, and (iii) need for time-consuming data processing. Bioelectronics is emerging
    as a powerful approach to monitor plant morphological traits and physiological
    processes as well as plant-environment interactions. It has been used to monitor
    or stimulate biological processes (Coppedè et al., 2017; Diacci et al., 2021)
    and has proved successful in plant sensing and actuation (Bernacka-Wojcik et al.,
    2019; Diacci et al., 2021; Poxson et al., 2017; Stavrinidou, 2022; Stavrinidou
    et al., 2015, 2017). An implantable organic electronics ion pump for in vivo delivery
    of abscisic acid has also been proposed (Bernacka‐Wojcik et al. 2019). Several
    examples of exploiting bioelectronics in precision agriculture, in particular
    organic electronics (Gebbers & Adamchuk, 2010; Kim & Lee, 2022), have been reported
    in Dufil et al. (2022) and in Kim and Lee (2022). In recent years, an in vivo
    Organic ElectroChemical Transistor (OECT)-based sensor, namely “bioristor” was
    developed and applied as biosensor for agricultural applications (Coppedè et al.,
    2017). The sensor can detect the changes in the composition of the plant sap in
    growing tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum), in vivo and in real time, without
    interfering with plant functions. Previous work demonstrated its ability to operate
    directly within the plant stem, thereby enabling in vivo observations of a plant’s
    physiological mechanisms related to ion movements and compartmentalization, under
    normal as well as stress conditions such as drought (Janni et al., 2019) and salt
    stress (Janni et al., 2021), or under environmental variations such as vapor pressure
    deficit (Amato et al., 2021; Vurro et al., 2019) and increase in relative air
    humidity RH. The aim of this study is to demonstrate how a bioristor in open field
    conditions can detect changes in plant water status, thereby enhancing water use
    and irrigation efficiency in tomato cultivation with significant savings in the
    water supply. The novelty of this study lies in the application of bioristor for
    tomato field monitoring, demonstrating concretely the potential water saving achievable
    through bioristor supporting its use in pathogen detection and pests’ management.
    Results are discussed in terms of sensor operability and bioristor index acquisition.
    Materials and methods Plant growth and field conditions Heinz 340 tomato plants
    were grown up to 2nd stage flowering in two seasons, 2018 and 2020, in two locations
    in the Parma area of northern Italy, and monitored with bioristors. The climate
    of both experimental areas is classified according to the Koppen–Geiger classification
    as Cfb (https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-11-1633-2007). The two trial seasons were
    comparable, but not identical, in terms of number of deployed sensors, days of
    monitoring, and adopted control units. The differences were due to constraints
    in the plots available and in the overall setup. The bioristor control units used
    in the second trial had also been improved to make them more suitable to operate
    in the open field and less dependent upon laboratory instrumentation. In addition,
    variability between seasons and sites in terms of weather, soil, and experimental
    setup is clearly unavoidable during field validation of sensors in open field
    conditions. In 2018, the experiment was carried out in Azienda Stuard, Parma (60
    m a.s.l., 44° 48′ 29.888″ N 10° 16′ 29.074″ E) in collaboration with Mutti SpA
    (https://mutti-parma.com/). Three experimental plots, consisting of three rows
    for each irrigation regime, were monitored (Fig. 1A). To avoid any water leakage
    compromising the validity of the measurements, only the middle row of each plot
    was used for bioristor measurements. Ten plants for each irrigation condition,
    distributed across an area of about 50 m2, were equipped and monitored continuously
    with a bioristor for 62 days, from flowering to harvest. Three irrigation regimes
    were applied. The control was set as 100% in line with recommendations by the
    regional irrigation advisory service Irriframe. It evaluates weather, soil and
    groundwater data obtained from farmers and from regional agencies and provides
    crop-specific irrigation regimes (https://www.irriframe.it/Irriframe). Two regimes
    were set to receive 80% and 60% of the full irrigated plot (100%). In the 2018
    experiment, differential irrigation started eight days after the bioristor installation,
    while in 2020, the experiment was performed in collaboration with Yaxe Srl for
    54 days in a commercial tomato field in Parma (44° 49′ 02.4″ N 10° 14′ 37.5″ E).
    Fig. 1 Sketch and real-field image of the field trial. A 2018, B 2020 Full size
    image Based on the results obtained in 2018, the irrigation was set at full water
    regime (100%, as in Irriframe recommendations), and 70 and 50% of the fully irrigated
    plot (Fig. 1B). One bioristor was installed in four plants for the 100% regime,
    four plants for the 70 and 50% regimes. The plants were monitored in total for
    54 days. In the 2020 experiment, due to a delay in the implementation of the irrigation
    system, differential irrigation started after 21 days. A drip watering system
    was used for irrigation in both years, where the regimes were differentiated according
    to the time of water flow. All plots were regularly irrigated according to 100%
    of Irriframe advice prior to the start of the differential irrigation. The full
    list of phytosanitary treatments and operations is reported in Suppl. Table 1.
    In both years, in all plots subjected to multiple water regimes the bioristor’s
    response (R) was compared to identify differences between the different irrigation
    regimes in terms of bioristor output. The effects of the treatments on the bioristor
    response were then analyzed to further understand the bioristor’s ability to monitor
    plant eco-physiology. The bioristor sensors, principles and preparation The bioristor
    is an OECT-based biosensor made up of two functionalized textile fibers (polypropylene)
    serving as the channel and the gate of a transistor. The bioristor is directly
    inserted into the plant stem (Janni et al., 2019), and it measures the changes
    in ion concentration in the plant sap which is continuously read via an IoT system
    (Finco et al., 2022). The working principle is based on doping-state changes in
    the semiconductor channel material due to electrolyte-ion injections which modify
    the electrical conductivity (Marquez et al., 2020; Tarabella et al., 2012). A
    positive input voltage at the gate electrode modulates the channel current by
    pushing cations from the electrolyte into the PEDOT:PSS matrix, thus modifying
    channel conductivity (Friedlein et al., 2018; Janni et al., 2021). The sensor’s
    response is the result of the relationship between the sensor and the changes
    occurring in the plant sap composition and ion concentration during growth, development
    and under abiotic stress. Under drought stress, the sensor response drops significantly
    because of the diminished ion concentration in the plant sap derived from low
    plant transpiration and root water absorption (Janni et al., 2019). A significant
    increase in the R was observed (Amato et al., 2021; Vurro et al., 2019) in high
    relative humidity conditions (RH) and low vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Bioristor
    preparation Prior to functionalization, each thread was cleaned with a plasma
    oxygen cleaner (Femto, Diener electronic, Ebhausen/Germany) to improve the thread’s
    wettability and facilitate the adhesion of the aqueous conductive polymer solution.
    This step enhances the performance of the sensors by removing any impurities or
    contaminants on the fibers, and increases the surface area for the polymer adhesion.
    An aqueous solution containing PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PH1000, Starck GmbH, Munich,
    Germany) and dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (2% v/v) was prepared and stirred for
    five minutes to ensure homogeneity. The solution obtained was deposited onto polypropylene
    fibers using a drop-casting technique in an amount of 50 µL/cm. This resulted
    in the formation of a thread with a cross-sectional area of 1.42 mm × 0.25 mm.
    This approach means that the thickness and shape of the sensor can be controlled
    precisely, polypropylene fibers can be used as a substrate which offers biocompatibility
    and mechanical stability, and the fibers can be infused with the conductive polymer,
    which is essential for the sensors to function effectively. The entire process
    is repeated three times to complete the preparation of the sensors. Next, the
    fibers were treated with highly concentrated sulfuric acid (95%) for 20 min. This
    improves the crystallinity, electrical properties, and durability of the polymer
    by replacing the use of ethylene glycol (10% v/v) treatments to improve the electrical
    conductivity and long-term stability of the polymer. Finally, the fibers were
    washed with water, and subjected to annealing for 1 h at 130 °C (Coppedè et al.,
    2017). The bioristor is covered by patents in Europe (IT201600130803A1) and the
    USA (Pat. n. WO2018116149A1). Bioristor integration in plants and signal acquisition
    After functionalization, 2 cm of the prepared fibers were inserted into the plant
    stem, with a distance between the two threads of 5 mm in tomato plants at 15 days
    after transplant (5–6 leaves) at 10 cm above the soil surface (Janni et al., 2019)
    (Fig. 2A and B). The channel is connected by bonding two thin electrical wires
    to both sides, while the gate is connected only on one side to the electrical
    wire. These wires are fixed on a 3D printed holder made of blue polymeric material,
    to improve bioristor stability (Fig. 2A) and connected by wires to the digital
    motherboard (Fig. 3A) or to the control unit (Fig. 3B, C). Fig. 2 Bioristor implementation
    in plants. A Example of bioristor inserted into tomato plants in open field. The
    bioristor is composed of a channel and a gate connected to electrical wires in
    its current version. A holder ensures that no damage is caused to the plant stem
    due to the weight of the wires; B the channel and gate connected with wires without
    the holder Full size image Fig. 3  A 2020 Bioristor application. B 2020 Field,
    C 2020 bioristor control unit Full size image A constant voltage (Vds = − 0.1
    V) was applied between the source and drain terminals of the channel, resulting
    in a continuous current flow, and a positive voltage at the gate (Vg = 0.6 and
    1 V in 2018; Vg = 0.5 V in 2020) was applied thus leading to a decrease in the
    channel conductivity due to the cations pushed from the electrolyte into the channel.
    The current (Ids) was monitored continuously. The sensor response (R) is the main
    index acquired and is proportional to the sap cation concentration. It is given
    by the expression: $$\\text R =\\frac{\\left|{\\text I}_{\\text {ds}}-{\\text
    I}_{\\text {ds0}}\\right|}{{\\text I}_{\\text {ds0}}},$$ (1) where Ids0 represents
    the current across the channel when Vg = 0. The sensor response R was recorded
    for the entire productive cycle. The Igs was also monitored and is the current
    flowing through the solution from the gate to channel when a positive gate bias
    is applied. The difference \\(\\Delta {\\text I}_{\\text {gs}}= {\\text I}_{\\text
    {gs}}-{\\text I}_{\\text {gs0}}\\) is related to the sensor wetting status, where
    Igs0 is the current across the solution when Vg = 0 (Gentile et al., 2020). The
    acquisition of the sensor response R is based on the relative change in the channel
    current. No calibration is required. The current flowing through the channel when
    the gate is off (Ids0) is used to calculate the R at each time point continuously.
    Two time constants τ and τgs of the sensor were also evaluated in a multivariate
    analysis. τ and τgs, computed by fitting the non-linear drain and gate current
    curves, are related to the time that ions take to enter the polymer, τ, and the
    ions diffusivity in the solution, τgs, respectively (Coppedè et al., 2014, 2017;
    Vurro et al., 2019). The first derivatives as a function of time of R, ∆Igs, τ,
    and τgs parameters (dR, d∆Igs, dτ, and dτgs) were also calculated to highlight
    specific trends (Vurro et al., 2019). R is the result of the relationship between
    the sensor and the changes in the plant sap composition and ion concentration
    during growth, development and under abiotic stress. Under drought, R drops significantly
    because of the reduced ion concentration in the plant sap due to the low plant
    transpiration and root water absorption (Janni et al., 2019). Moreover, in high
    relative humidity conditions and low vapor pressure deficit (VPD), a significant
    increase in R was observed (Amato et al., 2021; Vurro et al., 2019). Rainy events
    increase the air relative humidity (RH%) and decrease the VPD and a rapid increase
    in the R was observed. Based on these considerations, to demonstrate the reproducibility
    of the sensor’s response, an in vitro experiment was performed. The results of
    the sensor response of seven replicates of bioristor, in the range 10− 4–10−2
    M NaCl solution, were reported (Suppl. Table 2). Bioristor IoT control unit The
    bioristor control unit was optimized across the two field trials to improve its
    performance and enable the use of the device in open fields. In the 2018 setup,
    each bioristor sensor was connected to a digital acquisition board NI USB-6343
    multifunction I/O device (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) through electrical
    wires. It is a multi-channel analog-to-digital converter connected to a PC, where
    the readout data is processed using custom and then saved in the cloud. The sensor
    currents were converted to voltage, which is more easily readable by the NI board,
    through a resistor. The board is equipped with a 16 bit ADC (5 V full-scale),
    and currents are read through a 10 Ohm resistor. The current resolution is about
    8 µA. The data from each connected bioristor was acquired every second, locally
    saved on the PC, and then sent to the cloud. In the revised 2020 setup, the IoT
    control unit was based on the Arduino DUE system and connected to a 12 V 12 Ah
    lead battery powered by a 10 W photovoltaic panel. Bioristor data was locally
    saved on a micro-SD memory card and transferred to the cloud via a 4G connection.
    This setup allowed for the maximization of the signal to noise ratio using customized
    electronic circuits to amplify the bioristor signals, as well as local analysis
    of the raw data. Signals were read through an amplification system that gave a
    more accurate measurement of the currents. The sampling rate was 1 Hz, and each
    control unit was able to read up to four sensors. The control unit has a 12 bit
    ADC (5 V full-scale); the maximum current full-scale is 7 mA, the current resolution
    is about 1.5 µA. A micro-weather unit was also incorporated into the control unit
    (DHT11 module, Seeed Technology Inc., Shenzhen, China) to monitor air temperature
    (T°C) and relative humidity (RH). In both experiments, the gate was turned ON
    (Vg = 0.6 V in 2018 season; Vg= 0.5 V in 2020 season) for 15 min and OFF (0 V)
    for 15 min. At every gate that was switched on, R was calculated every 15 min
    considering the last two values of Ids and Ids0,. Environmental conditions and
    soil characteristics In 2018 rain abundance, as well as temperature and relative
    humidity at 2 m above the ground, were recorded by ARPAE agrometeorological station
    (https://simc.arpae.it/dext3r/). Soil sensors from Agricultural support (http://www.agriculturalsupport.it/prodotti-colture-orticole)
    were also exploited to verify the changes in the soil moisture. In 2020, the environmental
    conditions were monitored via Pycno sensors (https://pycno.co/), which monitor
    soil volumetric water content and temperature at 10, 25, 40 and 55 cm depth, and
    air temperature, humidity, and solar radiation. Based on the parameters recorded
    with the datalogger, the VPD value was calculated as follows (Vurro et al., 2019):
    $$\\text {VPD} =\\left(1-\\frac{\\text {RH}}{100}\\right) \\times \\text {SVP},$$
    (2) where RH is relative humidity and SVP is saturated vapour pressure. The SVP
    was calculated with the following equation (Murray 1967): $$\\text {SVP} =610.7
    \\times {10}^{\\frac{7.5\\text T}{237.3+\\text {T}}},$$ (3) where T is the temperature
    measured in the growth chamber. Ground physiological measurements In 2018, to
    validate bioristor in monitoring plant health and water use efficiency in field,
    classical physiological measurements were performed. Three plants for each regime
    were analyzed to calculate the relative water content (RWC) of the leaves (Buffagni
    et al., 2020). Leaf RWC (%) was measured in control and stressed leaves. Two leaves
    were clipped from five plants from each regime and placed in 50 mL tubes. Fresh
    weight (FW) was immediately recorded, then leaves were soaked in distilled water
    for 4 h at room temperature under constant light. The turgid leaf disks were then
    rapidly blotted to remove surface water and weighed to obtain the turgid weight
    (TW). Leaves were dried in the oven at 80 °C for 24 h to record the dry weight
    (DW). The RWC was calculated according to the formula (Barrs & Weatherley, 1962):
    $$\\text{RWC}\\left(\\%\\right)=\\frac{\\text{FW-DW}}{\\text{TW}-\\text{DW}}\\times100.$$
    (4) Chlorophyll content was assessed with a SPAD 502 m (Konica Minolta, Ramsey,
    USA). Ten measurements for each plant of three expanded leaves were recorded along
    the leaf length in five plants for each regime. The relative SPAD values were
    recorded. The stomatal conductance of the leaves was measured using an SC1 leaf
    porometer (Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA, USA) to evaluate the transpiration process.
    Five plants (one leaf for each plant) were recorded from 06:00 am to 08:00 am.
    Data analysis and statistics R data were analyzed with MATLAB (https://uk.mathworks.com/)
    and Microsoft Excel 2016 to smooth out variations related to the circadian cycle
    (Coppedè et al., 2017; Janni et al., 2019) by calculating the rolling mean. The
    aim was to reduce background noise and thus highlight the variations due to drought.
    The R data were then subjected to ANOVA using MATLAB (https://uk.mathworks.com/)
    .In addition, the p-value was calculated and is reported in Suppl. Tables 3 and
    4. The standard error was calculated on plant physiological data using Excel 365
    ProPlus (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, United States). Data were analyzed
    from five plants with one, two and three replicates for stomatal conductance,
    RWC and SPAD measurements, respectively. The current data from the bioristors
    were fitted using least square minimization performed with the “fminuit” function
    in MATLAB. To evaluate the effect of differential treatment and the contribution
    of each parameter to the plant health under drought stress, PCA was performed
    using all the bioristor parameters collected from plants at 30–34 days in 2018
    and at 32–39 days in 2020. PCA was performed using the R “prcomp” function and
    represented as a biplot using the R package “factoextra”. The first two principal
    components PC1 and PC2 and the corresponding component loading vectors were visualized
    and summarized in a biplot, in which component scores (indicated with dots) were
    colored in relation to the specific regime (Kassambara & Mundt, 2016). Results
    Bioristor monitoring in multisite experiments The bioristor transfer characteristics
    were verified by measuring Ca2+, K+, and Na+in vivo, with reference to concentrations
    included in the range found in leaves. This demonstrated that a bioristor can
    detect small changes in the salt-related ion concentrations in the plant sap (Janni
    et al., 2021). In 2018, the R index trend showed no significant difference between
    water regimes for almost the entire season. The first 5–7 days after bioristor
    integration in plants correspond to the implantation and stabilization phase of
    the sensor, also previously reported in controlled conditions (three days in pots,
    Janni et al., 2019). The R observed during the stabilization phase was not used
    to calculate the theoretical water savings (TWS). In fact, in 2018 several rain
    events characterized the growing season and substantially nullified the effect
    of differential irrigation for almost the entire duration of the experiment. The
    difference among the regimes was only observed in the interval between days 28
    and 35, when a severe drought occurred (Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Table
    3). A major and rapid peak in the R signal (200–400%) was observed in correspondence
    with each rain event (days 5–7, 12, 13, 16, 18, 23, 25, 42, 47, 58, 59, Suppl.
    Figure 1 A) due to the increases in relative humidity (RH%) and, in turn, a decrease
    in the VPD (Fig. 4 in Vurro et al., 2019). Fig. 4 R monitored in 2018 for 62 days
    (100% regime: blue line, 80% regime: dark red line, 60% regime: dark gray line)
    and vapor pressure deficit (VPD, black line) in the 2018 season. R plots are the
    average response of 10 plants for each regime (Color figure online) Full size
    image A considerable decrease in the R signal was observed in all plots between
    days 5 and 20 in relation to the treatment with ACTARA 25WG, which was administered
    to counteract an aphid infestation. In fact, a key time window for the entire
    experiment was observed between days 22 and 44, when the reduction in rain events
    and the increase in temperature meant that the R index response was different
    for each regime. Between days 25 and 35, a significant difference in R was observed
    among the regimes (p ≤ 0.05, Supplementary Table 3). The sensor response drops
    significantly under drought due to the block of transpiration which then leads
    to a reduction in the ion concentration in the xylem sap and their redistribution
    to maintain the plant osmoregularity (Janni et al., 2019). From days 31 to 35,
    the R of the 80% regime showed a 40–60% decrease in the sensor response compared
    with the 100% regime, and a 10–40% reduction in the R of the 60% regime was also
    observed. Data suggest the occurrence of more severe drought stress in the 80%
    regime compared to the 60% regime, in accordance with measurements recorded by
    the soil sensors (Fig. 4). Between days 40 and 62, there was a gradual decrease
    in R in all the regimes, except for days 42, 47, 58 and 59 when heavy rains occurred
    and the R trend rapidly increased as expected. In fact, fruit ripening causes
    leaf senescence and a reduction in transpiration (Mundim & Pringle, 2018). This
    leads to a subsequent decrease in the concentration of ions in the plant sap,
    which explains the decrease in the R signal observed (Fig. 4). The 2018 field
    pilot allowed to successfully validate the efficacy of the bioristor to detect
    physiological changes in plants as confirmed by the physiological data collected.
    The stomatal conductance trend showed a significant reduction in the transpiration
    process between regimes starting from day 22 up to day 27 (Fig. 5A), whereas neither
    the RWC nor the SPAD values showed a significant difference between regimes. This,
    confirms the high sensitivity of the bioristor’s index in the early detection
    of drought stress (Fig. 5B, C, Janni et al., 2019). Fig. 5 Physiological analyses
    performed in real time (dpi = days post insertion) in 2018. A Stomatal conductance,
    B relative water content (RWC), C chlorophyll fluorescence expressed as relative
    SPAD units. Error bars represent standard error Full size image The PCA performed
    on bioristor data showed that the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2)
    explained 72.4% of the total variance and highlighted a clear division of variables
    into three different groups along the first component (PC1), thereby confirming
    that the effects of drought stress on plant physiology are correctly tracked by
    the sensor (Fig. 6). The first PC (PC1) alone explains 47.3% of the phenotypic
    variation with controls and drought-stressed plants well separated in the biplot,
    thus indicating the efficacy of the various irrigation regimes. The sensor response
    R, ∆Igs and their first derivative (dR, d∆Igs) are negatively correlated with
    τgs and τ. Fig. 6 PCA of the parameters acquired via bioristor in the 2018 trial.
    The component scores (shown in points) are colored according to the regime (blue
    100%; red 80%; gray 60%). The component loading vectors (represented in lines)
    were superimposed proportionally to their contribution. ∆Igs: difference between
    minimum and maximum gate current values. τ and τgs: time constants. From the acquired
    data, the first derivatives of R, ∆Igs, τ and τgs (dR, d∆Igs, dτ and dτgs) were
    calculated. PC1 and PC2 explain 72.4% of the variability observed. Each dot represents
    the daily mean for each detected stress day (30–34) (Color figure online) Full
    size image In 2020, the R index trend was comparable for all plots, as expected,
    which were irrigated regularly up to day 21 (Fig. 7). The deviation in the R response
    of the 50% regime from day 7 to day 15 is discussed in the next section. Starting
    from day 21, irrigation was managed differently for each regime and a significant
    difference in the R signal was observed (Supplementary Table 4). A severe drought
    stress was detected in the 50% regime (33% R reduction, p-value ≤ 0.05), whilst
    the 70% regime showed an intermediate decrease (17% R reduction). As observed
    by other authors, under fruit ripening the R signal declined as an effect of the
    reduction in transpiration (Mundim & Pringle, 2018). Fig. 7 Plot of R monitored
    in 2020 for 54 days (100% regime: blue line, 70% regime: red line, 50% regime:
    gray line) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD, black line) during 2020 trial. R plots
    are the average response of four plants for each regime (Color figure online)
    Full size image There was a rapid increase in the R index also due to rain in
    2020. The R index varied from 26 to 122% with rain on days 5, 6, 15–18, 32, 37,
    38, 43–45, 47, 48 and 52 (Supplementary Fig. 1B). This observation further supports
    the ability of bioristor to detect leaf wetting due to increased environmental
    VPD (Fig. 7). A PCA of the 2020 data confirmed the observations made in the 2018
    trial. The first two components (PC1 and PC2) explain 64.2% of the total variance.
    The variance among the groups is more closely associated with the variance captured
    by PC2 than by PC1. The three regimes are well separated in the biplot, highlighting
    how the bioristor can detect physiological changes due to drought stress (Fig.
    8). However, the distribution of the groups was not homogenous, as observed in
    our previous trial in 2018. Specifically, the groups associated with the 100%
    and 70% regimes form a cluster-like pattern, whilst the scores for the 50% regime
    were more separated. When all variables were considered, the 100% and 70% regimes
    of the 2020 trial clustered closer than the 100% and 80% regimes of 2018, suggesting
    that all the bioristor variables should be considered. Fig. 8  A PCA of the parameters
    acquired via bioristor in the 2020 trial. The component scores (shown in points)
    are colored according to the agronomic groups (blue, 100% regime; red, 70% regime;
    gray, 50% regime). The component loading vectors (represented in lines) were superimposed
    proportionally to their contribution: ∆Igs; difference between minimum and maximum
    current gate values, τ and τgs; time constant. From the acquired data, the first
    derivative of R, ∆Igs, τ and τgs (draw, d∆Igs, dτ and dτgs) were calculated. PC1
    and PC2 explain 64.2% of the variability observed. Each dot represents the daily
    mean for the principal detected stress days (32–39) Full size image The R trend
    recorded for each plant is highly reproducible (Supplementary Fig. 2). In open
    field, the sensor response is strongly dependent on the interaction of each plant
    with the environment. Consequently, the sensor’s performance should be considered
    in terms of the signal trend variation, rather than the R value of an individual
    plant. This was confirmed in vitro, where plant physiological and morphological
    mechanisms have no influence, and the environment has no impact. The sensor response
    reproducibility was extremely high, calculating the R on seven sensor replicates,
    in a range of 10−4–10−2 M NaCl solution (Supplementary Table 2). Estimation of
    potential water saving using the bioristor The R index was also compared with
    the tomato yield and quality indices recorded at harvest (Table 1). Table 1 Tomato
    yields in the 2018 and 2020 trials Full size table In both trials (2018 and 2020),
    the tomato yield differed only slightly between the regimes. This resulted in
    a comparable percentage in terms of commercial yield. In 2018, only the 60% regime
    exhibited a significant reduction in the commercial production due to an increase
    in rotten fruit, most probably due to the drought suffered during flowering (Millones-Chanamé
    et al., 2019). Based on the R index variations recorded during the experiment,
    in both trials, the theoretical water saving (TWS) was calculated and is reported
    in Tables 2 and 3. In the 2018 trial, all regimes performed similarly during the
    entire season. The R index slope was significantly different for few days only
    (28–35) between the different water regimes (P ≤ 0.05) and was dependent on the
    amount of water input. Based on the yield recorded for all regimes, it was assumed
    that the amount of water provided in the 60% regime would be sufficient to achieve
    the good final yield expressed in marketable fruit percentage, except for the
    28–35 day window, when the full amount of water applied to the 100% regime was
    required to overcome the severe drought. Table 2 Irrigation volumes and water
    savings (TWS) calculated based on the response of the bioristor sensor in 2018
    Full size table Table 3 Irrigation volumes and water savings (TWS) calculated
    based on the response of the bioristor sensor in 2020 Full size table For the
    2018 trial, the percentage of theoretical water saving reported as achievable
    using the bioristor signal as a guide for irrigation was computed using the formula:
    $$\\text{T}\\text{W}\\text{S} \\left({\\%}\\right) = \\frac{{\\text{V}\\text{t}}_{100{\\%}}
    - {\\text{V}\\text{t}}_{\\text{T}\\text{B}\\text{I}} }{{\\text{V}\\text{t}}_{100{\\%}}}
    \\times 100,$$ (5) where Vt100% represents the total volume of water used for
    irrigation (100% control regime), as determined by the Irriframe service (Table
    2), and VtTBI indicates the total volume of water that would have been used if
    irrigation had been managed with the bioristor, based on the signal recorded for
    the other regimes (Table 2). Based on the above formula, if the bioristor had
    been used in 2018 to guide the irrigation system, the average water saving would
    have been 36% (Tables 1 and 2). In the 2020 trial, yield was not in line with
    irrigation. In fact, the 70% regime showed a significant, larger decrease in yield
    (marketable fruit) compared with the 50% regime, whereas a smaller decrease in
    yield was observed in the 50% water regime compared with the 100% water regime.
    Based on the bioristor data and yield performance, in 2020 the TWS was 38% (Tables
    1 and 3). Discussion Water scarcity increasingly threatens food security and nutrition
    due to the importance of water for food systems, agricultural production, food
    processing, households, and consumers (FAO, 2021). Italy is a big water consumer
    since agriculture is one of the main sources of income. A total of 41.67% of the
    entire agricultural land in Italy is irrigated. Out of 9 Mha of cultivated land,
    4 Mha are equipped for irrigation. A total of 17 billion m3/year of agricultural
    water are consumed in Italy alone (Ritchie & Roser, 2020). Precision agriculture
    is gaining interest as the related technologies can observe, measure, and apply
    exact quantities of water to crops on a large scale. Several sensors are extensively
    used in precision agriculture management. In particular, proximal soil sensors
    play a critical role in smart and precision agriculture by monitoring real-time
    physical signals in the soil, such as temperature, moisture, pH, and pollutants,
    and providing key information to optimize crop growth, fight against biotic and
    abiotic stresses, and enhance crop yields (Yin et al., 2021). However, proximal
    sensors only return data related to the plant proximity and do not provide information
    on what is really occurring in the plant system. An in vivo sensing approach was
    used in this study to understand the potential water savings through continuous
    and real-time monitoring of tomato crops in the open field during the entire growth
    season. The output of bioristor sensor is strongly related to the plant’s water
    status and to physiological and phenotypic changes due to drought. The high sensitivity
    and short time response (within minutes) of the bioristor index R increases the
    possibility and timeliness for determining a water deficit in a plant at a particular
    crop stage, thereby improving the efficiency of plant-based irrigation scheduling
    (Gentile et al., 2020; Gu et al., 2020; Janni et al., 2019; Vurro et al., 2019).
    In 2018 and 2020, an excess in irrigation was identified by comparing the final
    yields with the water used. A minimum reduction of 36% in 2018 and 38% in 2020
    in water use would have been achievable if bioristor had been used to guide the
    irrigation system. Previous studies have used a life cycle assessment to estimate
    the amount of water saved for different crops. Fotia et al. (Fotia et al., 2021)
    demonstrated that precise irrigation by DSS-based management can reduce the overall
    environmental impact per 1 ton of olives by 5.3–18%, or by 10.4–22.6% per 1 ha
    of cultivated land. Balafoutis et al. (Balafoutis et al., 2017) reported that
    variable-rate application of water in a vineyard can reduce greenhouse gas emissions
    by 8.8%. In the experiments carried out in two years and in two locations, the
    bioristor-based approach reported in this study provided additional tools to:
    (i) save water for irrigation, (ii) decreasing the water input required in tomato
    crops by 36–38%. Based on the collected data a complete algorithm for a fully
    operational decision support system based on the in vivo bioristor data, have
    been developed with the aim of identifying thresholds for the early warning of
    drought stress (Fig. 9). Fig. 9 Bioristor working principle and features. Sensor
    response and data interpretation in relation to water supply and needs Full size
    image A novelty of this work is the possibility to calculate form the R index,
    the timing and duration of leaf wetting were also measured through the bioristor:
    438 h in the 2018 experiment, and 409 h in 2020 (Table 4). Table 4 Leaf wetting
    timing and duration calculated over the whole season in 2018 and 2020 Full size
    table Leaf wetting plays a major role in plant physiology with direct or indirect
    effects on plant function. For example, in leaf wetting by dew, the transpiration
    rate can decrease, thereby mitigating water stress at times of high evaporative
    demand (Yokoyama et al., 2021). Consequently, leaf wetting increases the photosynthetic
    rate in the long term by mitigating water stress (Yokoyama et al., 2021). Leaf
    wetting is also linked with pathogen detection, thus continuous monitoring can
    help in the early detection of pathogens (Dawson & Goldsmith, 2018). The ability
    of bioristor to detect leaf wetting is mainly due to the variation in solutes
    content in the plant sap due to environmental conditions. Changes in water potential
    lead to changes in the concentration of solutes (i.e. leaf osmolality), which
    then impact on the primary and secondary metabolism (Dawson & Goldsmith, 2018)
    as highlighted by the high correlation observed between R and VPD values (Figs.
    4 and 7, Vurro et al., 2019). A side result of this field trial was the determination
    of the half-life of the pesticides by continuous monitoring during the field trial.
    During the 2018 season, a strong change in the slope of the sensor response was
    associated with the use of an anti-aphid treatment (ACTARA 25WG). In fact, the
    mode of action of ACTARA in the plant was similar to the one triggered during
    severe drought stress, thus leading, in terms of sensor response, to a major change
    in the value and trend of the R index. The analysis of R also enabled the ACTARA
    half-life to be estimated as 13 days which to the best of our knowledge has not
    been reported before. Conclusions This study has demonstrated that bioristor enables
    real time, in vivo and continuous monitoring of tomato growth and fruit production
    in open field conditions, resulting in the identification of the sensor response
    index (R index), that has been demonstrated to be a good proxy of plant health
    status. Of note, bioristor allowed to trace the plant’s water status dynamics
    during the plant response under changing environmental conditions together with
    the precise occurrence and duration of the drought stress. The use of bioristor
    for smart agriculture can concretely contribute to improve the sustainable use
    of water in agriculture leading to save 36–38% of the water consumed for irrigation.
    A novel feature of bioristor was also identified. The frequency, timing, and duration
    of leaf wetting was also established through the analysis of the R index, leading
    to further optimization of water use, and opening new perspectives on pest detection,
    and management since a pathogen attack is strictly related to plant humidity.
    This bioristor’s feature would enable a more precise schedule of pesticide treatment,
    thereby contributing to greater sustainability in agriculture. Taking all together,
    this work paves the way for the use of bioristor under a smart irrigation approach
    significantly improves the water use efficiency allowing the fine-tuning of irrigation
    protocols and strategies. Data availability The datasets generated during the
    current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

      \ system (Finco et al., 2022). The working principle is based on doping-state\
      \ changes in the semiconductor channel material due to electrolyte-ion injections\
      \ which modify the electrical conductivity (Marquez et al., 2020; Tarabella\
      \ et al., 2012). A positive input voltage at the gate electrode modulates the\

  description: This chapter focuses on IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) and its
    different applications such as the manufacturing industry, healthcare, and food
    industry. In all of these different application domains, the core technology and
    the core technological ideas remain the same; the only thing that changes is the
    type of sensors that would be used. Traditional manufacturing posed different
    challenges like unavailability of real-time data, unbalanced workload, and longer
    changeover time. Smart factory tries to overcome these challenges by integrating
    IoT and operational technology (OT). The chapter also presents how IIoT can help
    in transforming present-day healthcare and making healthcare much more affordable,
    much more efficient, and much more autonomous. IIoT solutions can be used to alleviate
    some of the problems that are encountered by people with respect to health. There
    are different sensors like ECG sensor, blood pressure sensor, glucose-monitoring
    sensor, and temperature sensor that can be procured by patients themselves for
    monitoring their health conditions at their homes. Further, these systems can
    be internetworked so that if any patient has a critical condition, different levels
    of alerts would be sent to the hospital to which this patient is registered. The
    chapter also discusses IIoT implementation in the food industry. The process involves
    sowing seeds, growing crops, applying fertilizers, applying pesticides, maturity
    of crops, harvesting crops, food grain processing, packaging of food grains, and
    transporting to a wholesale market and finally to the retail market. This is called
    the supply chain from field to plate. IIoT devices can be used in the agricultural
    field for monitoring the sowing of seeds, for growth of crops, for applying fertilizers,
    and for irrigation. These devices can also be used at each step. We describe each
    of these applications in detail in this chapter.

  explanation: The excerpt focuses on advanced monitoring techniques for automated
    irrigation systems in the context of ensuring system reliability in large-scale
    deployments. It highlights the use of real-time system health assessment and data
    analysis for proactive maintenance and fault detection. The goal is to enhance
    the robustness and reliability of the automated irrigation system, enabling continuous
    monitoring and timely intervention.
  extract_1: Traditionally, detecting faults in wireless networks depended on human
    operators analyzing and interpreting alerts, based on fixed thresholds that activated
    alarms when limits were exceeded. These were not suitable for automated irrigation
    systems, which require autonomous operation and immediate fault detection and
    remediation to prevent damage or water waste. Therefore, automated fault detection
    techniques were developed to monitor field devices and network performance data
    in order to extract important patterns and detect faults in real time.
  extract_2: By using automated fault detection techniques, it is possible to reduce
    or even eliminate downtime, improve efficiency, and reduce the maintenance costs
    associated with irrigation systems. This technique includes periodic checks of
    equipment, monitoring system performance, analyzing historical data to identify
    patterns or trends, and predicting future events. These techniques not only help
    in detecting faults but also in preventing them by identifying potential problems
    before they occur.

    challenges like unavailability of real-time data, unbalanced workload, and longer
    changeover time. Smart factory tries to overcome these challenges by integrating
    IoT and operational technology (OT). The chapter also presents how IIoT can help
    in transforming present-day healthcare and making healthcare much more affordable,
    much more efficient, and much more autonomous. IIoT solutions can be used to alleviate
    some of the problems that are encountered by people with respect to health. There
    are different sensors like ECG sensor, blood pressure sensor, glucose-monitoring
    sensor, and temperature sensor that can be procured by patients themselves for
    monitoring their health conditions at their homes. Further, these systems can
    be internetworked so that if any patient has a critical condition, different levels
    of alerts would be sent to the hospital to which this patient is registered. The
    chapter also discusses IIoT implementation in the food industry. The process involves
    sowing seeds, growing crops, applying fertilizers, applying pesticides, maturity
    of crops, harvesting crops, food grain processing, packaging of food grains, and
    transporting to a wholesale market and finally to the retail market. This is called
    the supply chain from field to plate. IIoT devices can be used in the agricultural
    field for monitoring the sowing of seeds, for growth of crops, for applying fertilizers,
    and for irrigation. These devices can also be used at each step. We describe each
    of these applications in detail in this chapter. Keywords IoT IIoT Cloud computing

    on Applications of Internet of Things in Healthcare Chapter © 2020 1 Introduction
    Different IoT solutions [1] are being implemented in the industry for solving
    different industrial problems to make industrial processes and manufacturing processes
    much more efficient than the way it is at present. The main aim of IoT is to interconnect
    different smart objects so that they are uniquely identified and able to interoperate
    between themselves. In these smart objects, intelligence is embedded. IIoT is
    an application of IoT in the industries to modify various existing industrial
    systems. IIoT links the automation system with enterprise, planning, and product
    life cycle. IIoT borrows some of the features of IoT and some from the vision
    of Industry 4.0 and tries to have a separate vision and technology for itself.
    So Industry 4.0 gives a framework for automation and data exchange in manufacturing
    technologies. So, Industry 4.0 basically tries to improve the automation and data
    exchange in manufacturing and technologies; it tries to incorporate concepts from
    cyber physical systems, IoT cloud computing, and so on. IIoT and IoT are not the
    same [2] as IoT focuses on consumer-level services and consumer-level products
    whereas IIoT has the focus on the enterprise. IoT traditionally focuses on the
    convenience of the individuals, and IIoT focuses on the efficiency, safety, and
    security of operation. In terms of machine-to-machine (M-2-M) communication, its
    use is limited in IoT, whereas M-2-M communication is extensively used in IIoT;
    the whole industrial operation in a plant is automated. So, one machine talking
    to another machine is quite extensive in the industrial sector IIoT. Some of the
    integral components for building IIoT are machine learning, big data technology,
    M-2-M communication, and automation. So machine learning involves learning from
    the existing data and then trying to make predictions so as to make things better
    in the future. The machine-to-machine communication is about two machines communicating
    with each other for getting a particular work or a task accomplished without any
    human intervention. So, a robotic arm opening the door of a refrigerator and then
    performing certain other tasks in the refrigerator are an example of machine to
    machine. So, maybe the robotic arm goes and opens the door of the refrigerator
    and checks whether there is sufficient milk in the milk pot of the refrigerator
    or not; if there is no sufficient milk, then the system as a whole will send an
    SMS to the milk person. So, we have machine-to-machine communication and automation
    without human intervention. So, these are the different aspects of IIoT. So, IIoT
    is supported by a huge amount of data collected from sensors, and it is based
    on wrap-and-reuse approach rather than rip-and-replace approach. We are not building
    a new system from scratch; we use the existing industrial systems; wrap them with
    sensors, actuators, and so on; and make things efficient. In IIoT, we try to reengineer
    the existing systems and the processes and we do not build anything brand new
    from scratch. IIoT combines the second generation of Internet (where things are
    connected), fourth generation of industrial automation, and cloud computing. So,
    cloud has become a very popular technology since about more than half a decade
    and it is being used in the industrial sector as well. So, cloud offers computational
    environments, computational infrastructure, computational platforms, and computational
    software in addition to regular storage. Using cloud one can get access to everything
    in an industry without basically having to purchase these of their own. In the
    IIoT network, we have physical objects, different systems and subsystems, platforms,
    and applications that are interconnected. IIoT networks can communicate with one
    another, external environment, and different people. The acquisition of IIoT has
    led to the availability and affordability of sensors, processors, and other technologies,
    which facilitate the capture of and access to real-time information. IIoT has
    a plethora of applications like transportation [3–4], power plant security and
    safety [5], inventory management and quality control [6], facility management
    [7], milk processing and packaging industries, healthcare, manufacturing industries,
    and food industry. But in this chapter, we only focus on the three applications:
    healthcare, manufacturing industries, and food industry. 2 Requirements of IIoT
    There are four broad requirements of IIoT. We need the hardware and software connectivity
    and a cloud platform with respect to processing, infrastructure, and data storage.
    Application development and big data analytics are very important. All these different
    sensors and actuators are fitted to these different machines and manufacturing
    equipment. They throw in a huge volume of data in real time that can reveal a
    lot of information. Data also have other characteristics, such as they come in
    huge velocities, and there are different types of such data, like speech, images,
    and video, all coming at the same time need to be handled, and so on. By mining
    such data using big data analytics, one can predict different things to make these
    industrial processes much more efficient. Another IIoT requirement is with respect
    to access, i.e., one can access anything, at anytime, from anywhere in IIoT. So
    here end-to-end security is important. User experience has to be taken into account
    as one of the fundamental requirements for building IIoT, i.e., what users exactly
    want, how their problems can be addressed and solved, how through the use of IIoT
    system users can do things better and how their experience as a whole can be improved.
    Transition to smart machines: By adding sensors and actuators we are making the
    machine smart. Asset management is very important; through asset management, different
    sensors and actuators (which are the industrial assets) can be managed in a much
    more efficient way. We now take a deep dive into the issues and challenges [8]
    in the adoption of IIoT: There are data integration challenges, so here we refer
    to a large number of machines. These different machines have their own heterogeneity
    in place. Integration of these heterogeneous data coming in high volumes and velocities
    is a herculean task. Cyber security is very important because we are referring
    to a connected world, where there is connectivity between (i) machines themselves,
    (ii) machine and human beings, and (iii) machines and human beings. Due to this
    connectivity, it is quite likely that some vulnerabilities are introduced in the
    overall network, making it possible for different types of attacks and newer types
    of attacks to be launched. There is lack of standardization; large automation
    supplier firms do not encourage open standardization as it will reduce customers’
    reliance on them. So, small automation supplier firms basically lack the capability
    to incentivize this huge step. Lack of standardization leads to different issues
    related to device interoperability and semantic interoperability. So, different
    machines supporting different IoT devices need to talk to each other and they
    have been made by different vendors. Legacy installations are a very crucial aspect
    to be considered. Technology is evolving fast. Industries have a huge legacy machine
    base and these machines have been operating successfully since decades. With the
    incorporation of IIoT, we need to have support for these newer technologies and
    newer machines being procured. So fast-evolving technology should coexist with
    the legacy equipment without leaving any kind of vulnerability in the whole integrated
    system. The next issue with IIoT adoption is lack of skilled workers. The workers
    do not have IIoT-related skills, like data integration. The technologies associated
    with IIoT are new in nature, so workers should have fast and diverse knowledge
    about these technologies. Now we discuss the different design considerations for
    building IIoT. 3 Design Considerations for IIoT To use an IoT device for industrial
    applications, the following design objectives [9] have to be considered: Energy:
    Time for which the IoT device can operate with the limited power supply Latency:
    Time required to transmit the data Throughput: Maximum data transmitted across
    the network Scalability: Number of devices supported Topology: Communication among
    the devices, i.e., interoperability Safety and security: Degree of safety and
    security of the application So, now we discuss some of the application areas of
    IIoT like healthcare industry, manufacturing industry, and food industry. 4 IIoT
    Applications: Healthcare 4.1 IIoT in Healthcare Earlier, people used to die due
    to lack of healthcare. People used to forget about their health due to busy life,
    and this has also happened in the recent past. Additionally, the number of diseases
    has also increased in recent times. So, we have our IIoT solutions that could
    be used to alleviate some of the problems that are encountered by people with
    respect to health. So, IIoT solutions can help in making healthcare easier and
    affordable. There are different sensors [10] such as the ECG sensor, blood pressure
    sensor, glucose-monitoring sensor, and temperature sensor that are currently available
    in the market; these are affordable and can be procured by patients themselves
    for monitoring their health conditions at their homes or these could also be purchased
    by different healthcare facilities, hospitals, and so on. If any patient has a
    critical condition, different levels of alerts would be sent to the healthcare
    facilities or hospitals to which these patients are registered. 4.1.1 Concerns
    in Healthcare Regarding IIoT There are different healthcare concerns with respect
    to their implementation of IIoT. Populations are aging all over the world, different
    diseases are increasing, and medical expenses are also increasing. These are some
    of the generic healthcare challenges, but from an IIoT perspective as well. Catering
    to these requirements is also a challenge; scalability of IIoT solutions will
    have to be taken into consideration not only in terms of numbers, but also in
    terms of diversity. So, all generic healthcare challenges also have implications
    on IIoT implementation in the healthcare industry. 4.1.2 IIoT Implementation for
    Old Population Looking at the age groups, populations are growing older; between
    2017 and 2050, the persons aged over 60 years are expected to increase more than
    double. By 2050, the number of elderly persons is expected to grow to 2.1 billion
    worldwide which is a huge number. We have a growing population and it will invite
    taking care of their health. Monitoring of elderly people’s health condition has
    to be done efficiently. So, telecare applications, smartphone, or telemedicine
    basically can help elderly people to live safely. So, we can have telemedicine
    solutions [11] being deployed in the homes of these elderly persons so that the
    doctors can remotely monitor the condition of these elderly people from their
    homes. This applies to not only elderly people but also other population. 4.1.3
    IIoT Implementation for Increase in the Diseases Not only the number of diseases
    but also the types of diseases are increasing day by day. So, we need to have
    a suitable and efficient large-scale monitoring system that will cater to the
    particular problem and address that problem. So, nowadays, we talk about having
    telecare applications, smartphone applications, and telemedicine applications
    for elderly people. We are also talking about these kinds of solutions for catering
    to the other segments of the population. So, continuous monitoring of patients’
    health can be done, and this can also help in reducing the number of cases of
    hospitalization. Sensors can collect blood pressure, respiration, pulse rate,
    heart rate data, and weight data continuously and as and when required; if any
    alarm has to be triggered, this can be done in a much more efficient manner, and
    this can be done if any abnormal solution is detected or any abnormality is going
    to arise in the future. 4.1.4 IIoT Reduces the Expenditure IIoT-based solutions
    for healthcare can help in reducing the expenditure; different wearable healthcare
    devices can help in reducing the cost of health checkup; remote continuous monitoring
    of patients using smart sensors would be made possible. In hospitals and other
    healthcare units, smart beds can be deployed which can send notification to the
    doctor about the patient’s activity. 4.1.5 Cloud-Enabled IIoT Healthcare Solution
    There are different layers in the IIoT healthcare architecture. It starts from
    acquiring the data from the sensors; at the very bottom; sending the sensed data;
    processing the data; storing the data and getting different information knowledge
    etc. about what is going on, underneath from the data and trying to make more
    sense out of the data, through information processing, knowledge processing and
    so on. Now we discuss the cloud-enabled IIoT healthcare architecture. On one end
    we are going to have all devices which are typically sensor enabled, i.e., the
    smart sensors and then some gateway. So, from these sensors, the data are going
    to be sent to the IoT-enabled cloud platform where different analytics will be
    performed. Not just analytics, but health data verification can be performed and
    the data can be stored and also processed in a computer or a computational resource
    in the cloud and so on. And there are lot of other different things that could
    also be done at the cloud and finally we are going to have this two-way communication
    and we are going to have healthcare applications which are going to be the beneficiaries
    from the cloud where analytics is performed. At the application end, different
    patient data about their health condition such as ECG, EMG, then may be pulse
    oximeter data, and many other different types of healthcare data could be made
    available after suitable processing and analytics. So, this is going to be the
    data flow architecture at very high level for healthcare IoT. 4.1.6 Benefits of
    IIoT in the Healthcare Now we discuss the benefits of IIoT in healthcare. With
    IIoT, one can monitor the patient’s health condition remotely. So, remote healthcare
    is possible. Remote real-time continuous monitoring of patients’ health condition
    24 × 7 is possible. Hospital staff can predict the arrival of a patient in their
    emergency units; it is also possible to have a hygiene monitoring system which
    can detect the cleanliness of the hospital and the healthcare facility. Medical
    staff can provide quality medical services with a small budget using IIoT. So,
    these are some of the benefits that IIoT implementation in healthcare can provide.
    4.2 IIoT-Based Healthcare Devices 4.2.1 Wireless ECG Monitors Wireless ECG monitors
    are there which can collect biosignals from ECG devices; the collected data could
    be sent to the cloud; and medical staff can analyze the health-related data in
    real time. In fact, we can have some programs which can autonomously analyze the
    data that are coming in and can send alerts. So, one example of a wireless IoT-enabled
    ECG sensor [12] is QardioCore. QardioCore is a wireless device for ECG monitoring.
    4.2.2 Glucose Level Monitoring Device IIoT is very useful in glucose level monitoring
    [13], particularly for diabetes patients as they need to check the glucose level
    quite often. Particularly, the ones who have higher degrees of diabetes are required
    to check the blood sugar quite often. So, if we have an automated IoT-enabled
    system to which the patients can be fitted, then automatically the data from these
    different patients can be made available to doctors who are treating the diabetes
    patients and so on; an example of continuous glucose monitoring device is the
    Dexcom. Dexcom devices can help in continuous glucose monitoring. 4.2.3 IIoT-Based
    Blood Pressure Monitor Similarly, we have IIoT-based blood pressure monitors.
    Using IIoT devices the patient’s blood pressure is measured in real time. Doctors
    can monitor the patient’s blood pressure in real time; can get alerts if the blood
    pressure is beyond a particular threshold; and, depending on the blood pressure
    data, can prescribe medicines to the patients. One such example of blood pressure
    monitoring system is iHealth BP5. 4.2.4 IIoT-Based Body Temperature Sensor In
    body temperature monitors, wearable sensors are there to continuously monitor
    the human body temperature. This sometimes is very much required for some patients
    who are suffering from diseases which make the patients vulnerable to a sudden
    increase or sudden decrease in the body temperature. So, there are different body
    temperature sensors in the market. One such body temperature sensor is by Kinsa.
    So, they have their smart thermometer which is an IoT-based body temperature monitoring
    device. 4.2.5 IIoT-Based Asthma Treatment For oxygen saturation monitoring, particularly
    for asthma patients, this is very important; oxygen saturation can be monitored
    with the help of IoT devices such as pulse oximeter. So, pulse oximeter can help
    in measuring the oxygen saturation, so this pulse oximeter could be integrated
    with connectivity solutions such as Bluetooth, which can send continuously the
    data of the oxygen saturation level of the patient who is being monitored. 4.2.6
    IoT-Based Contact Lenses IoT-based contact lenses are also there in the market.
    There are different IoT-based contact lenses which also offer Wi-Fi connectivity
    with smartphones so that the condition of the patient, their eye condition, their
    sugar level, etc. could also be monitored. 4.2.7 Smart Inhalers IoT-based asthma
    treatment solutions are already in the market. Smart inhalers are a very essential
    requirement of asthma patients, and hence they are being manufactured. ADAMM is
    an intelligent asthma monitoring device that has been developed. This particular
    device can keep track of the body temperature, coughing rate, heart rate, etc.
    which are preliminary symptoms of an asthma attack. 4.2.8 Smart Phone-Based Healthcare
    Solution Different smartphone-based healthcare solutions are already available.
    Smartphone devices connected to electronic devices such as sensors can help in
    collecting the data of patients. Smartphone is used to monitor the health of users
    and detect diseases. Smartphone healthcare apps provide low-cost healthcare devices
    which are sort of diagnostic apps that help in detecting the health condition
    of patients; it can also help in medical communication between the patients and
    the hospitals and can also offer medical education in the form of tutorials to
    the patients. 4.2.9 Smart Phone App: Health Assistant Health assistant is one
    such app which keeps track of the health condition of the patients. Google Fit
    is another solution which keeps track of different physical activities of the
    patient. ECG self-monitoring is another solution which serves as ECG device, based
    on the “ECG Self Check” software. 4.2.10 IIoT Healthcare Technology Different
    solutions can be explored that are there in terms of healthcare and IoT implementations
    in healthcare. Cloud is enabled together with big data because most of this data
    generated from these healthcare sensors have the nature of big data. So, cloud
    enablement, big data analytics, etc. are very important in IoT implementation
    in healthcare. 4.3 IIoT Healthcare Requirement and Challenges Security is of paramount
    importance in the healthcare sector. Privacy of individuals is very important
    because the data that is being carried forward from one device to another through
    a particular communication channel should not be hacked and unauthorized users
    should not be able to get access to the data. So, ensuring the confidentiality
    of the data, integrity of the data, authentication mechanisms and their implementation,
    and availability of the data are very important in terms of security requirements
    and their implementations in IIoT healthcare. IIoT healthcare has different challenges.
    There are challenges with respect to limited computational capability, not being
    able to perform expensive operations. There are hassles with respect to having
    very less device memory, energy limitation, and also taking care of the mobility
    of these different devices because the patients themselves are mobile. So, consequently,
    these devices themselves are wearable devices, and the sensors themselves are
    also mobile. Taking care of the mobility of these different devices from a technical
    point of view is a challenge; both from a communication and algorithmic point
    of view there are different challenges. So, taking care of all of them is important
    for consideration. 5 IIoT in Manufacturing Industries 5.1 Smart Factory Motivation
    for smart factory: Now we discuss the drawbacks of traditional manufacturing industries.
    The machines work in isolation; that is, these machines are not connected. And
    because of this reason, there is unbalanced workload in these different machines.
    There are other drawbacks like unavailability of real-time data, longer changeover
    time (converting a line or machine from running one product to another), and extending
    production time (lack of proper information and data of the production line).
    These drawbacks are removed in the smart factory with the implementation of IIoT.
    Smart factory involves machinery and equipment which improve processes through
    self-optimization and automation. Benefits of smart factory are as follows: supply
    of real-time data, data analysis and quality control, reduced changeover time,
    reduced production time, and flexibility and easy management. The manufacturing
    devices, equipment, workforce, supply chain, and work platform are internetworked
    and linked to accomplish smart production. The integration has to be done in order
    to reduce operational costs, improve the productivity of the worker, and reduce
    injuries at the workplace. The reason for using IIoT is to improve safety in the
    manufacturing plant. With the help of IIoT, resource optimization and waste reduction
    can also be achieved, which are also again very important aspects in industrial
    engineering. Let us now look at how the smart factory is going to work. So, at
    the very bottom we have the sensor-enabled tools and workers. They throw in a
    lot of data which are going to pass through the gateway to the cloud where further
    data analysis, data visualization, etc. are going to be done and the results are
    going to be made available to the respective stakeholders based on their corresponding
    policies. 5.2 Features of Smart Factory In a smart factory [14] we talk about
    connected devices which are going to send a lot of data in real time continuously.
    Optimized components and optimized data without any human intervention or with
    minimal human intervention are characteristics of a smart factory. Smart factory
    is transparent in the sense that we get a lot of live data on the metrics that
    are implemented and those data can be used suitably at different levels of management
    for quicker decision, and hence, transparency is also promoted in a smart factory.
    Proactive feature means that we know proactively we can predict the future outcomes
    and take preventive actions depending on the situation and what is going to happen
    in the future. So, based on the prediction of future outcomes one can take preventive
    actions proactively. So, all of these things are possible in a smart factory.
    Now we discuss smart factory applications. 5.3 Smart Factory Applications 5.3.1
    Airbus: Factory of Future Airbus is a German company which is a state-of-the-art
    implementation of IIoT. So, Airbus is a major pair player in the aviation sector.
    It is a European aircraft manufacturer and it applies a lot of IoT technologies
    in its production process. So, essentially what happens is that during manufacturing
    productions on the floor of the plants and also after the products are deployed
    in a real aircraft, a lot of data can be collected. Further lot of data can be
    collected from the flight recorders while the flights are in operation. So, collecting
    data on flights will help to improve the in-flight experience and the workers
    on the factory floor can use these IoT devices to know about how much the manufacturing
    has processed, what are the different gaps, etc. in the process. So, Airbus is
    the digital manufacturing initiative which is also known as the factory of the
    future. So, in a factory of the future, we talk about different components, such
    as IoT sensors for supply-chain management. Now we discuss modular equipment;
    use of different robots, robotic arms, etc.; use of concepts of industrial augmented
    reality; use of computer vision; image processing and video processing in real
    time; and so on. Now we delve into the implementation of factory of the future;
    Airbus now has mechanisms for digital tracking and monitoring. There are tools
    and machines, and sensors are integrated into them. Further wearable sensors like
    smart glasses can be used with maybe augmented reality support. So, Airbus is
    using all of these different things for its implementation. 3D real-time visualization
    of the production process is possible and all of these things are deployed on
    A330 and A350 models and their assembly lines which are there in the Toulouse
    manufacturing plant; they have also deployed this factory of the future for the
    A400M model and their assembly operations in the UK. 5.3.2 Amazon: Robotic Shelves
    Amazon has robotic shelves, and as this name suggests, Amazon uses different types
    of robots that will carry these shelves and rearrange them. Amazon basically is
    an e-commerce company and these shelves and their rearrangement robotically are
    very important and that makes the processes much more autonomous and efficient.
    So, the good part of this thing is that because it is an autonomous robotic system,
    using this system, the robots can efficiently locate and search different items
    from different shelves. Thus, in 2014, the operating cost was cut down by 20%
    using these robotic shelves by Amazon. 5.3.3 Caterpillar: Augmented Reality App
    Caterpillar has the augmented reality (AR) app which is integrated with IoT; Caterpillar
    is a heavy equipment maker, and it has come up with the augmented reality app
    that generates end-to-end view of the factory floor. So, the machine operators
    can detect the need for tool replacement whenever it is required after viewing
    the end-to-end view through that particular AR app. This app sends instructions
    for doing things like tool replacement, air filter change, and fuel monitoring.
    Caterpillar has the IoT-driven ship maintenance that is done by their marine division.
    They use the shipboard sensors to perform predictive maintenance analytics. The
    sensors that are deployed can monitor generators, engines, GPS, air-conditioning
    systems, and fuel meters. The analysis of the sensed data provides useful insights
    with respect to the power usage of refrigerated containers, cost of hull cleaning,
    and optimized cleaning schedule and their data; these are all provided through
    the analysis of the data that are obtained through these different sensors that
    are deployed in the onboard devices of the ships. So, preventive maintenance analytics
    talks about the use of all these machine learning techniques. Tools and techniques
    like Python and Weka could be used to come up with these different predictive
    analytics and so on. It is used to have easier fault correction, reduced downtime,
    and increased profitability, using predictive maintenance analytics, and this
    is what Caterpillar is doing. 6 IoT and the Food Industry Before discussing implementation
    and application of IIoT in the food industry, we take a deep dive into the chain
    of activities to be followed in the food industry. 6.1 Field to Plate We first
    discuss what happens in the food industry. It starts with the agricultural field
    where the crops are grown. Farmers sow seeds, grow crops, apply fertilizers, apply
    pesticides, etc. and then after the crops get matured, these get harvested. Following
    harvesting, these food grains need to be processed and packaged. These packages
    are transported typically to a wholesale market. Then it goes to the retailer,
    and finally, the consumers buy, cook, and consume the agricultural produce. This
    is typically the chain from the agricultural field to the plate. So, this is typically
    the chain of activities that are followed; this is the supply chain because ultimately
    for each of the activities, the supply will have to be ensured through this entire
    cycle. So, in this kind of scenario, for each activity, sensors can be used; IIoT
    devices can be used in the agricultural field for monitoring the growth of crops
    and the sowing of seeds and for applying fertilizers precisely adequately. So,
    sensors, actuators, and different agricultural robots can be used over here. So,
    not only over here, even in harvesting, food grain processing, packaging, transportation,
    and logistics these could be used. The sensors and actuators help the systems
    or the machines that are helping in the activities to be much more efficient and
    autonomous. Now we discuss how IIoT is implemented in the food industry [12].
    6.2 Implementation of IIoT in the Food Industry IIoT is implemented in the food
    industry using three layers: sensing layer, communication layer, and application
    layer. These layers need to be internetworked. In the sensing layer, we have network
    sensors for food quality monitoring along the supply chain. The food grains go
    through the warehouses and the network sensors also monitor the temperature in
    those warehouses and also other environmental conditions. The communication layer
    deals with stakeholder access supply-chain data, communication between different
    stakeholders, and communication between different components of the supply chain.
    The application layer has applications for farmers, retailers, government, analysts,
    consumers, and insurance companies. We need sensors for doing many tasks like
    sensors for monitoring humidity, temperature, and composition of food products.
    The sensors throw a lot of data in real time which have to be analyzed in in order
    to make the most out of those data that have been retrieved. So, we need easier
    process control, increased food safety, etc. and it is also very important to
    have adequate end-to-end traceability. So, if we have the field to plate and the
    corresponding supply chain adequately implemented using suitable IoT solutions,
    then it would be possible for example to trace a rice packet back to the paddy
    field. 6.3 Impact of IoT on the Food Industry We now discuss the impact of IIoT
    in the food industry. We have an efficient production line as IoT monitors the
    equipment performance and detects the anomaly in the production line. This efficient
    production line enables the generation of real-time solutions by predictive maintenance.
    Using the temperature tracking sensors we can implement adequate, suitable, and
    efficient food safety measures. Also, we have Automatic Hazard Analysis and Critical
    Control Points (AHACCP) checklist, which ensures food safety. IIoT ensures transparency
    of the supply chain as the real-time data about the products are available, and
    it is easier to find the inefficiencies and meet the food safety regulations.
    We have minimized wastage of food resources, and we can analyze in real time,
    for example, the information of food products and reduce food wastage. So, all
    of these things are possible if we have IIoT implementation in the food industry.
    6.3.1 Utilizing the IoT in the Farms On the farm we can have sensors to monitor
    weather, crop maturity, presence of insects, and conditions of the field with
    respect to the soil conditions, for example, how much soil moisture is there in
    the field, how much is the water level, how much is the fertilizer content of
    the field, and soil nutrient condition of the field. So, all of these things are
    possible with the help of IoT implementation in the food industry. 6.3.2 Utilizing
    the IoT in the Livestock Barns In the livestock barns, sensors can help in monitoring
    the health parameters of different animals such as cows, buffaloes, and different
    other livestock, including sheep and goats. So, all of the life monitoring in
    real time is done using IoT-enabled devices. Automated feeding cycles can be set
    up with the help of IoT implementation, and diet control of these different livestock
    is possible with the help of IoT implementation. Automated temperature control
    in the brooding barns and hatchery is also possible with the help of suitable
    IoT implementation. 6.3.3 Utilizing the IoT for Equipment in the Food Industry
    On the equipment level, IoT enables GPS tracking whenever these animals are moving
    around their exact location, and their position could be tracked. This is just
    an example; similarly, GPS could be used for tracking the mobility of different
    components in the food industry. Drone-assisted field monitoring applications
    in agriculture are quite common and are being implemented using IoT. 6.3.4 IoT
    for Maintenance in the Food Industry In the food industry, IoT implementation
    can be done for maintenance. Sensors are embedded in different machines, such
    as farm machinery and tractors, to monitor their condition and performance and
    to detect whether any machine is going to go down in the future. The early detection
    of warning signs, smart maintenance of these machines, and extending the lifetime
    of these equipment are possible with respect to maintenance in the food industry
    through IoT implementation. 6.3.5 IoT to Improve Margins in the Food Industry
    IoT implementation in the food industry can improve the margins through predictive
    analytics, spotting early warning signs, making well-informed decisions, and maximizing
    profits. 6.3.6 IoT for the Consumer For the consumer, there are different initiatives;
    smart label is an initiative by the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA), which
    uses a QR code to provide product-related information to consumers. These consumers
    consequently can get information about the ingredient details of a particular
    food item, allergen exposure of that particular food item, nutrition, value, and
    other information. 6.3.7 IoT for the Product in the Food Industry Consumers can
    scan the QR code to get details about the product; the product information includes
    nutrition, ingredients, allergens, third-party certification, social compliance
    programs, usage instructions, advisories, and also safe handling instructions.
    6.3.8 IoT for the Food Processing Factory In the factory, IoT implementation can
    help different machineries in the food processing industry and also aid different
    workers who are working in the food processing industry to remain connected autonomously.
    This connectivity can help in gaining insights to improve the quality of the food
    product, the quality of the food processes, and so on, and consequently, they
    can also help in the reduction of the time to market (TTM). 6.3.9 IoT for Empowering
    the Workers in the Food Industry IoT implementation in the food industry can also
    help in empowering the workers through augmented reality, safety glasses, and
    other wearable sensors, thereby increasing the overall productivity and efficiency
    of their processes, workers, and the machinery they are using. 6.4 IoT Solutions
    for the Food Industry We now discuss different IoT solutions [15] for the food
    industry. 6.4.1 City Crop City crop is an intelligent indoor garden that provides
    intelligent indoor gardens to grow fruits, herbs, vegetables, greens, and edible
    flowers; they have implementation of automated climate control, automated livestock
    monitoring, and automated smart notifications that can be sent to the concerned
    stakeholders and also to the plant doctors. 6.4.2 Diagenetix Diagenetix has the
    product bioranger which can help in detecting the presence of microbial diseases
    in the food. Bioranger is a small handheld device that connects with Android and
    instantly detects pathogens in the food. 6.4.3 Eskesso Eskesso is a company that
    has the cooking sorcery which is basically for smart cooking. So, they have Wi-Fi-connected
    smart cooking device that can help in easy monitoring of the cooking status via
    the smartphone app. Smart cooking helps by placing the food packet and Eskesso
    device in a pot of water; selecting the recipe and starting via smartphone app
    one can get the food cooked in a smarter way through minimal involvement. 6.4.4
    Culinary Science Industries: Flavor Matrix Culinary science industry Flavor Matrix
    infuses foods and beverages with unique flavors; they collect data on the food
    ingredients, collect user data, and use different implementations of machine learning
    and data analysis to enhance the flavor of dishes and provide user-specific food
    and beverage pairing. 6.4.5 IntelliCup IntelliCup is the smart cup solution which
    is a smart beverage vending machine which reduces the waiting time and increases
    the profit at beverage shops. These are like IoT-enabled cups which have NFC-integrated
    chips at the base of the cup, and they connect the cups to the mobile banking
    platform and IntelliHead which is a modular dispensing unit. This NFC chip helps
    in connecting each user to a cup. So, the cups are usable and made with biodegradable
    material. There are separate apps for the merchants and the customers, the customers
    create IntelliCup accounts using the app, they transfer the funds to the e-wallet,
    and the cups are linked to the e-wallet by scanning a QR code via the app and
    docking the cup on the dispensing unit using the IntelliHead. So, customers enjoy
    the beverage that is finally produced through this smart cup. 7 Conclusion In
    this chapter, we focused on IIoT and its applications in the food industry, manufacturing
    industries, and healthcare. Most of the industries are transforming globally.
    They have been mandated to transform to be Industry 4.0 compliant. And they are
    transforming towards the adoption of IIoT technologies. So, we discussed the different
    aspects of both Industry 4.0 and IIoT. We also focused on the requirements of
    IIoT and design consideration for IIoT. It makes the industrial processes much
    more efficient and autonomous. In all of the different applications of IIoT, the
    core technological ideas remain the same and cannot be changed. So, the only thing
    that changes is the type of sensors that would be used. The specific requirements
    that a particular industry has are mostly dealt with in the application level,
    and at the device level more or less the concepts remain similar. References Miorandi,

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Dehradun, India SECTION I. Introduction To
    feed more people, all sectors need to boost production, but agriculture in particular.
    Still, there will be instances when supply and demand aren''t in equilibrium.
    Financial and human resource management continues to provide a significant challenge
    to agricultural productivity improvement. Smart farming allows for greater crop
    yields, more efficient use of available resources, and reduced labor requirements.
    Predictive analysis, IoT gadgets managed via the cloud, and security systems for
    multi-cultural farms are explored, as are the views of seasoned farmers. The challenges
    of combining modern farming techniques with older, more traditional ones are also
    highlighted. The use of quantitative and statistical techniques has the potential
    to bring about revolutionary changes to the way we farm today. In addition, there
    are agricultural problems, irrigation challenges, and plant leaf diseases to deal
    with while using IoT drones in the field. Many of the reasons why IoT relies on
    sensor activation are discussed. The purpose of this research is to determine
    whether and how cutting-edge Internet of Things (IoT) technology may improve today''s
    agricultural practices. Current and future agricultural trends are forecast using
    a rigorous methodology. The majority of Indians, including 70 percent of farmers,
    depend on agriculture for their livelihood [1] [2]. Indian farmers often choose
    their farming techniques by trial and error. This is true even with complex methods
    like drip, adjoining, and trench irrigation[3] [4]. If we want to increase agricultural
    output, we must move away from labor-intensive manual processes and toward more
    mechanized ones[5]. Water is a precious resource that should be preserved for
    the needs of the future, especially given the widespread availability of water
    in India. A simplified, embedded-based autonomous watering system may be of great
    use to farmers [6]. This method should be helpful for farmers who have to water
    their crops at precise times and in exact quantities. Drip irrigation automation
    is in charge of humidity sensors. The engine''s on/off timing is determined by
    local temperature fluctuations around the crop area. So, a self-reliant individual
    would examine the soil moisture level [8] [9] before making any hasty choices.
    The IoT paves the way for remote access and management of connected devices and
    infrastructure. It can power sensors used in a wide range of applications, including
    those dealing with water management, traffic safety, and rail networks. Therefore,
    both human and system errors are less likely to occur [10]–[16]. The Internet
    of Things (IoT) is a relatively young discipline that has spread to and improved
    upon many other fields. It has progressed in recent years [17] [18] due to the
    introduction of new sensors, sensor networks, and RF-based communications. It
    is capable of intelligent behavior, accurate sensing, and identification. Changes
    in computer networks and mobile technologies have emerged from the combination
    of cloud computing with 3G, NFC, and the Internet of Things. Some examples of
    modern networks include GSM, WLAN, Zigbee, LTE, WiMax, RFID, WPAN, and Bluetooth.
    Fig. 1 depicts a variety of IoT use cases [19]–[22]. Today, the Internet of Things
    is the backbone of the IT industry. The idea of a “computerized India” was first
    presented by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2015. Largely, this is attributable
    to the expansion of the Internet of Things and the emergence of game-changing
    new businesses. Agriculture accounts for a large portion of India''s GDP. In the
    future, an IoT-based sensor system may make significant contributions to agriculture''s
    progress[23]. Electricity infrastructure, railroads, connections, subterranean
    streets, buildings, dams, oil and gas pipes, and so on all have sensors installed
    and maintained in them. Then find out how to operate it remotely and connect to
    the web in order to run the apps you need. Technologies such as radio frequency
    identification, novel sensors, sensor network organization, and networked web-based
    collaboration are all examples of IoT approaches. The Internet of Things (IoT)
    is a cutting-edge innovation that improves both monitoring and detecting capabilities.
    Cloud computing, smart detection, and pervasive organization all come together
    to form what is known as the Internet of Things (IoT). 3G, LTE, GSM, WLAN, WPAN,
    WiMAX, RFID, ZigBee, NFC, Bluetooth, and other forms of distant communication
    convention technology are all examples of ubiquitous systems. Fig. 1. Applications
    of IoT[26]. Show All Present-day farming has been more mechanized and industrialized.
    hence, it must be made. The potential for rural informationization is a boon to
    rural development; it serves as a basis for transformation and the maintenance
    of steady economic growth. Amazing progress has been made in agricultural production
    over the last five years because of the rural framework that has been put into
    place. The agricultural data cellar is a great help. IoT delivers several innovations
    in the field of advanced structures, such as soilless agriculture, culture arrangement
    control technology, manufactured photosynthesis, environmental control for the
    growth of plants, intelligent water system technology, and so on. The farms use
    IoT technology in their manufacturing process to better nurture their plants.
    This is very useful in agricultural frameworks for year-round crop production
    because of the highly regulated conditions, it provides. Temperature, humidity,
    co2 fixation, and crop culture arrangement may all be regulated automatically
    by a PC. Agriculture''s smart command centre and information repository. The platform
    also includes subsystems like agro-environmental control, agrarian asset management,
    production handle control, grow goods, nutritional health, agricultural sorts
    of equipment, and an office. A server farm is a large, sophisticated building
    housing several offices. However, it''s not only a computer system; it also combines
    the environment control office, the screen office, and other kinds of security
    devices, all of which operate on it and shares data through an excess of communications.
    Using IoT techniques like radio frequency identification, remote communication,
    programmed control, and data detection, a large amount of data may be gathered,
    making for really insightful farming. The escalating global demand for food production,
    coupled with the challenges posed by climate change and dwindling water resources,
    has prompted a paradigm shift in traditional agricultural practices. The advent
    of technology-driven solutions has opened doors to a new era of farming known
    as “Smart Farming,” where innovative techniques and intelligent systems converge
    to address the pressing needs of the agricultural sector. At the forefront of
    this transformation is the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) into agriculture,
    a union that promises enhanced efficiency, resource optimization, and sustainable
    practices. In this context, our research embarks on a journey to explore the potential
    of IoT-driven automation in revolutionizing irrigation practices - a pivotal aspect
    of modern agriculture. Modernization and increased agricultural output may both
    be achieved with a Raspberry Pi-based autonomous irrigation system. While other
    development boards may offer certain advantages in specific contexts, the Raspberry
    Pi''s combination of features, cost-effectiveness, community support, and programming
    versatility makes it a preferred choice for designing and implementing autonomous
    irrigation systems The primary goal of this research is to increase agricultural
    yields while using a minimal amount of water. Precision agriculture using cloud
    computing is a significant benefit of this technology, as it will optimize water
    consumption while increasing agricultural yields [24] [25]. The following is a
    rundown of the organizational structure of the research article: Existing research
    publications on Internet of Things-based smart agriculture are included in Section
    2. In Section 3, we will talk about the many different types of sensors that were
    employed in the study and recommended framework for advancing agriculture. The
    implementation specifics are presented in part 4, while section 5 discusses the
    numerous tests carried out in real-time agriculture. The research is brought to
    a close in Section 6. SECTION II. Related Studies Gia, T. N., and Tcarenko [1]
    developed a system to automate the ongoing monitoring of agricultural fields.
    The method conserves water in the crop ground at the same rate as the energy consumption
    in the agricultural field. The designed system will be protected by irrigation
    insurance. Kansara, K., Zaveri [2] showed off an automated irrigation system that
    reduces water assets more frugally by factoring in the time of water scarcity.
    They proved that both water use and energy consumption could be cut by using a
    solar power system. A smartphone was used to make this by analyzing sensor data
    online. Information gathered throughout the agricultural process was the focus
    of work by Rao, R. N., and Sridhar [3]. Temperature and water-pH sensors based
    on GSM-enabled microcontrollers from ATMEL are part of the system. After then,
    an IOT system based on Arduino is used, whereas a Raspberry Pi system is preferable
    for monitoring a big number of Pis. Monroy-Sahade [4] Omer Aydin et al. [4] gathered
    information on irrigation using Internet of Things devices and sensors. Various
    sensors and other IoT gadgets send data to MongoDB. Using the Weka program, we
    standardized the data and utilized it as a training set. The evaluations led to
    the selection of the decision tree (J48) algorithm as the basis for the AI model.
    Irrigation on/off, repair, and inspection are all controlled by decisions. The
    reliability of the forecasts was examined, and the efficiency of the irrigation
    system was tested. The built-in mobile app allows you to remotely and manually
    manage the system, examine and control it, and even witness its decisions. EA
    The parameters impacting the watering of mustard leaf plants were better monitored,
    and a data-driven model was presented, thanks to the work of Abioye et al.[5].
    The ESPresso Lite V2.0 module is used with the Davis vantage pro 2 weather station,
    flowmeters (YF-S201), and a variety of soil moisture sensors (VH-400) to provide
    accurate readings of soil moisture, irrigation volume, and reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo). Dr. S. Velmurugan[6] offered a free and open-source smart system for estimating
    watering requirements by monitoring soil moisture, temperature, and ambient factors,
    as well as consulting online weather predictions. The suggested system''s brilliance
    stems from a sophisticated algorithm that takes into account both current and
    future weather conditions, including air temperature, precipitation, ultraviolet
    radiation, and humidity. The smart gate for open channel precision irrigation
    was shown by Muhammad Farooq et al.[7] using sensors to monitor water levels and
    flows. After collecting information on the soil''s moisture, temperature, and
    humidity in the field with the use of WSN methods, the data was sent to the cloud-based
    Firebase Real-Time Database. Decisions may be made with the use of fuzzy logic
    approaches by comparing data with a fuzzy rule-base. The precise quantity of water
    required by each crop is calculated by the smart gates using fuzzy logic, and
    the water is delivered in the form most advantageous to the plant. The farmer
    may keep tabs on his or her farm''s performance in real-time with the use of the
    smartphone dashboard. Microscale and MATLAB simulation tests were conducted to
    ensure the viability of the technique. The rate of moisture loss at various temperatures
    may be used to get an estimate of the number of irrigation days. SECTION III.
    Materials and Methods A. Materials 1) Raspberry Pi 3 The schematic of the Raspberry
    Pi circuit board is seen in Fig. 2. Dual-core ARMv6 processors, the BCM2837, have
    superseded the BCM2836 (quad-core ARMv7). The processing performance increases
    by a factor of two in comparison to multi-core CPUs. With proper design, it is
    possible to quadruple or even more than double a system''s speed. With this CPU,
    you can surf the web more quickly and effectively than ever before. The Raspberry
    Pi 3 will support all extra daughter boards with a 99 percent efficiency rate[8].
    Fig. 2. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B[27]. Show All Because of the improved power management,
    the Pi 3 should be able to use more megalomaniac USB devices [8]. 2) Software
    Used Python is one of the most popular Raspberry Pi programming languages. The
    main advantage is that, in comparison to other programming languages, a programmer
    may write fewer lines of code. Although not a web programming language, Python
    is suited to server programming languages[8]. 3) Power Supply All digital electronics
    require a controlled power supply. Fig. 3 shows a basic fixed-regulated power
    supply circuit diagram. Fig. 3. Power supply [3]. Show All 4) Data Acquisition
    System A single chip with sample and hold circuitry is used for advanced data
    collection. The MCP 3208, as illustrated in Fig. 4, is a sophisticated IC that
    transforms analog signals to 12 bit digital information. The output of this sample
    hold capacitor is 12 bits, with a translation speed of 100 kps. This device is
    equipped with a four-wire SPI data communication that operates at low clock speeds
    [1]. Fig. 4. Data Acquisition Chip[27]. Show All 5) Soil Moisture Sensor As illustrated
    in fig. 5, it consists of two probes placed in the soil. When present flows finished
    the reviews, the soil with little moisture offers less resistance and allows for
    high currents to pass through. Thus, the alternating current parameter is used
    to determine the amount of soil moisture [9]. Fig. 5. Soil moisture sensor[29].
    Show All 6) LM35:temperature Sensor The LM35 sensor series (shown in Fig. 6) is
    an example of a kind of precision integrated-circuit temperature sensor that provides
    a voltage output that is directly proportional to the ambient temperature[10].
    Fig. 6. Temperature Sensor. Show All 7) Lm 358 The LM 358 IC has two amplifiers
    with wide bandwidth and bandwidths that are intended to function across a wide
    variety of voltages. Low-power instrumentation applications take advantage of
    these devices. The main advantage is that it is easy to use and may be used with
    single power supply circuits [11]. Fig. 7. Pin- diagram of LM 358 Show All 8)
    Relay Using a relay, the regulated DC signal is used to operate the AC motors.
    It is able to physically divide an electrical circuit. The electromagnet uses
    electromagnetic to alternately complete and break the circuit. There is a high-tech
    rating relay used in this study (see Fig. 8). Fig. 8. Relay[3]. Show All 9) Buzzer
    In order to alert the user when the motor is activated or deactivated, the author
    suggests installing a Beeper or Buzzer as seen in fig. 9. This serves as a mechanical,
    electrical, or electronic warning indicator with an audible tone. A buzzer or
    beeper is an audible signaling device that might be mechanical, electromechanical,
    or electronic. There are currently a variety of buzzers available, including alarms,
    timers, mouse clicks, and more [26] [27]. Fig. 9. Buzzer[3]. Show All B. Proposed
    Framework Fig. 10 is a block schematic of the proposed system. Two sensors have
    been included in this study. 1) A device to measure heat, and 2) a soil moisture
    gauge. The data is sent to the database through wifi from the Raspberry Pi once
    it has been processed by the IC3208(which transforms analog standards to 12 bit
    digital values). Different types of agricultural land have different threshold
    voltages at different times of the year. If the controller data is below 2.4 volts,
    the field will be allowed to dry out, and if it is over 2.4 volts, the field will
    be oversaturated. Soil moisture content is accurately measured by calculating
    the temperature difference using a second temperature sensor and a validating
    value. A buzzer is used to indicate when the motor is transitioning from its “off
    state” to its “on state,” and vice versa, so that the signal to the motor may
    be cut off as necessary. As shown in the flowchart of Fig. 11, the suggested system
    was implemented on a Raspberry Pi. Python was selected as the programming language
    to implement the proposed approach on the LINUX platform. Fig. 10. IoT-based agriculture
    field monitoring block diagram. Show All As can be seen in the flowchart of Fig.
    11, the suggested system was implemented using a Raspberry Pi. Python was selected
    as the programming language to implement the proposed approach on the LINUX platform.
    Raspberry Pi process provides an IP address with all of the sensor data and the
    motor status encoded in Python code. We may use our gadget to check up on these
    IP addresses on Google just as we would any other query using a computer or mobile
    device. SECTION IV. Implementation The Intelligent IoT-based Automated Irrigation
    System uses Arduino and Raspberry Pi3 microcontrollers and processing units. Soil
    sensors for temperature and moisture are also installed. These sensors send data
    to an Arduino microcontroller, which processes it. Aside from the sensors, the
    water pump''s actuator is also connected to Arduino. The detected data is then
    sent serially to the Raspberry Pi3 control unit for machine learning. In order
    to predict soil moisture and temperature in different soil conditions (dry, slightly
    dry, wet, slightly wet), machine learning is used on the Pi3 control units. The
    projected output is sent to Arduino as a command, which activates the pump and
    waters the field. Finally, the irrigated field data is saved in a Cloud Webpage
    accessible by farmers. Fig. 11. The flow chart of the Proposed Framework. Show
    All SECTION V. Results and Discussion Wheat crop data collection using the proposed
    smart system for IoT-based PA has been successful, and the setup has been evaluated
    for both the condensed and practical versions. The soil moisture is checked in
    various climates and the findings are interpreted correctly. As a result of the
    varied environmental conditions, various readings were obtained. In a variety
    of climates, the temperature was measured and reported. Zigbee was used to transmit
    data wirelessly, allowing for the transport of data. To store the data, PHP script
    was used to create a MySQL database. Successfully obtained data from MySQL database
    used for monitoring purposes. There is a table showing the voltage resistance
    values for various soil conditions. Table I. Resistance reading from a soil moisture
    sensor Ewaid et al.[23] suggested a system for evaluating sensor results and determining
    the water needs of a given crop. Using readings and water requirements, the motor
    is automatically switched on or off. SECTION VI. Conclusions The concept of Smart
    Farming emerged from the combination of modern scientific methods with time-tested
    agricultural techniques in an effort to create agriculture that is both environmentally
    friendly and economical with its resources. Our study set out to investigate this
    shifting terrain by developing an IoT-based automated irrigation system that makes
    use of IoT, Arduino, Raspberry Pi3, and machine learning techniques. This study
    maximises efficiency in water use and take precision farming to new heights by
    including temperature and moisture sensors. The future seems promising for the
    continued development, broader implementation, and easier access to these game-changing
    technologies. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like This IoT-Based

    challengesIoT smart farming 1. Introduction The increasing demand for food, both
    in order to ensure quality and quantities, has accelerated the need of industrial
    growth and intensive methods of production in agriculture. At the forefront of
    the new agricultural era, there is an emerging Internet of Things (IoT) market
    that is suggesting several creative solutions. Research organizations and scientific
    associations are seeking to increase their own scope and speed by connecting with
    IoT, contributing technologies and goods to a range of different agriculture markets.
    The IoT idea gained prominence in the year 2000, with the development of the Auto-ID
    at MIT and the subsequent market research reports. In IoT, these systems communicate,
    perceive, and connect with internal & external state embedded technologies [1].
    IoT is widely seen as the next-generation technologies with widespread applicability
    across almost every facet of the market, with the ability to increase the degree
    of integration of end products, systems, and services. IoT technologies are ideal
    for a number of applications, including healthcare services, smart communities,
    traffic management, agricultural systems, and security facilities. ICT(Information
    and Communication Technologies) being integrated into conventional agricultural
    activities is helping to spark a fourth farming revolution. An important facet
    of technologies such as machine learning, UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), Remote
    Sensing, Big Data Analytics, etc. is having the capability to boost farming activities
    to new heights. A broad variety of agricultural parameters, such as environmental
    factors, production status, soil condition, irrigation water, herbicides and pesticides,
    weed control, and greenhouse output climate, may be tracked in smart agriculture
    to increase crop yields, minimize costs, and maintain process inputs. Smart agriculture
    and the use of reduced pesticides and fertilizers in crops will help to mitigate
    leaching issues and pollution, as well as the effects of climate change, in precision
    agriculture [2]. Burgeoning IoT technology offers many new solutions and further
    growth opportunities, particularly for novel ideas in the agricultural sector.
    We also benefited greatly from recent developments in communication systems and
    protocols [3], primarily on the lower layers, which is the physical, network,
    and link layer. Besides that, the protocols in the topmost layers of the network
    are critical for effective data exchange and gathering. There are many applications,
    procedures, and designs that can be used in the agricultural sector as a whole.
    There are several ongoing developments in IoT agriculture research that involve
    network engineering and applications, device design, security challenges. Furthermore,
    in several nations and institutions around the world, various IoT guidelines and
    policies have been adopted in agriculture. However, an impressive amount of research
    has been done on IoT and there is still a great need for further research on the
    topic in the agricultural field. This survey paper examines numerous challenges
    and trends related to smart agriculture. 2. IoT-based smart agriculture The IoT
    is reshaping the agriculture sector by providing farmers with a diverse set of
    tools to address several challenges faced by them on the field. Farmers can connect
    to their farm from almost anywhere and at any time using IoT-enabled technologies.
    Sensors and actuators are used to regulate farming processes, while wireless sensor
    networks are being used to monitor the farm. Wireless cameras and sensors were
    used to remotely monitor the farm and collect data in the form of videos and pictures.
    Farmers can also use IoT to keep up with the current conditions of their agricultural
    land using a smart phone from anywhere in the world. IoT-enabled technologies
    have the potential to deplete the crop production cost and increase productivity
    of the land. Some of the key role played by IoT in smart agriculture is illustrated
    via Fig. 1. i. Water management: A major challenge in greenhouses is determining
    the exact amount of water required [4]. To prevent unnecessary water use, smart
    sensors are installed and operated using a variety of IoT techniques. Water storage
    in greenhouses is achieved by the use of automated drip irrigation, which is regulated
    by a soil moisture threshold. Water management may be handled effectively via
    IoT technology by avoiding water waste through the use of various kinds of sensors.
    The sensors are used to monitor the amount of water in the tank, and data is saved
    on the cloud through a mobile application. Farmers may monitor the water level
    using their cell phones. The motor will operate automatically as a result of this
    technology. If the water level drops, the motor automatically turns on, and if
    the water level is high, the motor will shut down. Up to 50% of this water is
    lost in conventional irrigation systems owing to over-watering due to inadequacies
    in traditional irrigation techniques and systems [3]. To address this issue, smart
    irrigation systems powered by IoT assist farmers in avoiding water waste and improving
    crop quality via timely watering. Temperature and soil sensors are installed on
    fields in smart irrigation systems; these sensors communicate field information
    to farmers via a knowledge gateway. Weather-based precision agriculture controllers
    monitor and modify irrigation schedules depending on local weather information.
    ii. Irrigation management: It is in charge of anticipating the design, improvement,
    operation and management of irrigation systems. Tracking water requirements of
    crops based on gathered data and actuating the water flow in accordance with the
    anticipated needs without the participation of human operators is one of the objective
    of irrigation systems. It uses dispersed sensors to monitor different soil, water
    body, plant, and micro-climate factors. The irrigation technique (e.g., spray,
    drip, flooding and nebulizer) has an influence on how to properly monitor the
    water body as well as the actuation mechanism. Weather is one of the most significant
    variables in calculating agricultural water needs. The IoT will help to upgrade
    the new irrigation infrastructure in a more fascinating way. By tracking weather
    and soil conditions, a farmer can refine his irrigation system in a variety of
    ways [5]. Weather prediction data, manage and track the whole farm from almost
    anywhere, Ethernet, and WIFI are all exemplars of how IoT technology tracks irrigation
    systems. Smart irrigation systems driven by the IoT make use of field-deployed
    sensors to monitor soil properties, weather and climatic conditions, and agricultural
    terms for irrigation. iii. Soil management: Soil management entails determining
    various soil parameters such as pH, moisture content, and so on. These parameters
    can be conveniently calculated using IoT sensors. Farmers will then take measures
    such as fertilization, drainage, irrigation, and so on. Soil management assists
    in the discovery of the right plant breed. It also assists in the identification
    of fertilizer needs in the soil. It necessitates a low-latency network for urgent
    intervention. For both enterprises and farmers, soil monitoring has been among
    the most challenging activities in agriculture. There are several environmental
    concerns in soil testing that have an impacts on crop productivity. If these types
    of problems are correctly defined, farming patterns and procedures can be readily
    understood. Soil Humidity, Precipitation, Fertilization, and Temperature are among
    the factors being monitored. The moisture content of soil is monitored using moisture
    and humidity sensors. The findings of a soil testing research survey improve crop
    production and propose fertilization options to farmers [6]. Furthermore, using
    IoT technology to identify polluted soil protects the field from over-fertilization
    and crop degradation. Soil management protects and improves the productivity of
    the soil. Additionally, it lowers input costs, avoids pollution, and increases
    agricultural yields and quality. Prior to planting, the topsoil should be in the
    optimal fitness level for the crop in order to promote fast and effective root
    development. While each farm and crop has unique soil needs, there are a few measures
    that may help promote good soil biology such as: organic fertilization, soil analysis,
    proper tillage, measure for chemical soil protection, etc. iv. Weather management:
    Many relevant factors are combined to preserve and establish an optimal ambience
    for plants while staying under strict limits, such as airflow, temperature, ,
    and levels. This can be achieved by deploying an IoT-enabled ecosystem, in which
    smart sensors and devices exchange data for improved decision-making [7]. Weather
    have the greatest impact on crop production. Farmers can decide the best time
    for planting, irrigation, and harvesting using an IoT-enabled weather forecasting
    system. Probabilistic weather analyses were done using sensors in IoT applications.
    Farmers can learn about environmental conditions such as soil moisture, humidity,
    and air temperature by embedding remote sensors in the fields. Farmers should
    prepare accordingly and adjust the harvesting and irrigation period to boost the
    crop based on historical results. Farmers should take proactive measures to ensure
    a safe crop harvest by arranging and reviewing collected data. v. Precision farming:
    It is an IoT-based farming technique which primarily entails the analysis of data
    collected in the field in order to determine the most productive crop. Farmers
    gather data using sensors and analyze it for forecasting in precision farming.
    Farmers may use the information collected to schedule their farming operations,
    including what seeds to sow, how much fertilizer to use, when to harvest, and
    also what crop yields to expect. Farmers may also track the farm through sensors
    that detect moisture levels, crop output, and livestock levels with the deployment
    of IoT. The sensors can effectively monitor irrigation machinery from afar. The
    data collected on the land is analyzed by IoT linked devices, making data-driven
    decisions on resource allocation and crop harvesting. The conventional method
    of farming to maximize yield and preserve crops was focused on physical inspection,
    and if there was a problem, it was typically resolved after a severe event involving
    the farm, and it was performed on a trial and error basis. However, in precision
    farming using IoT applications, anything can be pinpoint sooner and behave in
    compliance with the collected data. IoT innovations are assisting farmers in increasing
    agricultural output quantity while maintaining efficiency, productivity, and cost
    effectiveness. Farmers will face a variety of problems, including water shortages
    and floods, a lack of suitable land for crop plantations, and cost control. Farmers
    can reduce possible missteps and increase returns by implementing the IoT infrastructure
    and associated technology. IoT-enabled farming allows farmers to make fast decisions
    depending on the circumstances. The use of IoT in farming would greatly improve
    operational productivity. For example: A precision agricultural practice is one
    that involves assessing a field’s inherent soil variability. When the soil in
    a particular region retains more water, crops may be sown more thickly and irrigation
    can be used sparingly. Alternatively, if the plot is utilized for grazing, it
    may accommodate a greater number of cattle than a comparable area with lower soil
    quality. vi. Nutrient management: Nutrient management entails making the most
    effective use of crop nutrients while also preserving the environment. Nutrient
    management is based on the concept of matching soil nutrient supplies with crop
    needs. Nutrients help in producing optimal crop yields when supplied in the appropriate
    amounts and at the right times; providing too little will restrict output, while
    applying too much will not make practical sense and may damage the environment.
    Nutrients that are not properly used by crops may leak into surface and groundwater
    waters nearby. For example, too much ammonia, phosphorus, or nitrogen may degrade
    water quality. Measuring the concentration of nutrients in the soil allows for
    selection of the best crop for multiple cropping cycles on the same land. Nutrients
    and technologies are critical for achieving sustainable agriculture while minimizing
    environmental and economic costs [8]. vii. Waste management: The Internet of Things
    (IoT) proposes a waste disposal solution. IoT sensors may be used to create intelligent
    trash cans. This could be used to read, store, and transfer waste-related data
    through a network. Governance of waste can be accomplished with the aid of certain
    intelligent and streamlined algorithms [9]. viii. Livestock monitoring: The growth
    of agricultural production to provide adequate food for the world’s population
    is becoming a growing worldwide issue. As a result, the significance of livestock
    management in farmland is essential for the survival. Farmers, on the other hand,
    are trying to maintain their cattle in the context of rising worry over land and
    water supplies. Apart from that, farmers continue to focus on reducing waste and
    lowering total expenses. New technological advances are critical in helping to
    enhance the quality and quantity of agricultural output. The Internet of Things
    (IoT) enters the scene at this point. It allows farmers to improve the health
    of their livestock via remote access and data-driven decisions. Cattle Watch is
    a system for monitoring livestock. This cloud-based technology is often used to
    remotely track the well-being of livestock and aids in the identification of livestock
    locations using communication and energy sensors [10]. This method obviates the
    use of an alert system. If any state goes outside of a predetermined parameter,
    the users are told by call, text, or email. As a result, people can view real-time
    information from the comfort of their own homes or workplaces using their smartphones.
    The IoT livestock tracking scheme entails implanting sensors in animals that collect
    specific details about their body and their well-being. Farmers may monitor the
    position, counting, and other similar details of livestock using wireless IoT
    applications. The real-time data provided by the livestock tracking system allows
    sick animals to be identified and removed from the herd, preventing disease spread.
    For example: Farmers can monitor their livestock’s cardiac output, blood pressure,
    respiration rate, digestion, and perhaps other vital signs around the clock using
    connected sensors. ix. Farm Management System (FMS): Farm management systems centralizes,
    administers, and optimizes a farm’s output and operations. IoT based farm management
    system automates the collection and storage of farm data, manages business expenditure,
    agricultural budgets, monitors and analyses farm operations and consumption. Smart
    farming raises production while lowering environmental effects, but this smart
    farming approach is only feasible with the help of FMS. For smart farming, FMS
    is an important component for production, planning, and decision-making [11].
    Farmers can track the entire farm with an interconnected FMS that uses Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSN), Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) modules [12],
    and a micro-controller to capture all of the data. On all sensors and devices
    throughout the field, an identifier is used to provide proper awareness of fertilization,
    weather details, automated buffer zone width tracking, and automatic information
    record generation based on daily farm activities. This data is saved in a regular
    format on the server and can be accessed for even further processing through a
    mobile phone or the internet. An automatic irrigation and control system [13]
    is used to maximize the usage of water supplies. In addition to the irrigation
    scheme, the farm is secured from pests and animals [14]. x. Tracking and tracing:
    IoT provides agricultural firms with helpful data to help them make better choices,
    such as organizing, handling, and communicating with business associates intelligently
    while saving resources and time. RFID and GPS are used to map the conditions of
    soil, air, water, herbicides and pesticides in a growing environment. Using wireless
    network connectivity, a GPS device is used to pinpoint the precise location of
    an agricultural areas and track different agricultural parameters. In [15], an
    architecture was developed to remotely track soil condition and soil structure
    in accordance with crop culture requirements. Through using WSN, ZigBee is linked
    to other devices such as CMS, GSM, and GPRS to track and acknowledge real-time
    data processing. When unexpected changes arise, GPS provides an interface to communicate
    with ARM (an intelligent control device to accomplish tasks such as SMS/MMS) and
    sends an alert to the farm manager, enabling the farmers to take appropriate action.
    Despite its high operating and maintenance costs, it is commonly used in agriculture
    because of its accurate positioning identification and control capabilities. xi.
    Crop management: Crop management involves assessing and recording the well being
    of a crop. Plant and crop diseases can be detected using IoT sensors and RFID
    chips. These details can be gleaned from RFID tags and shared across the internet
    by the reader. This data are processed remotely by the farmer, and necessary steps
    are taken. This will keep pests away from the crops. In agricultural sector, production
    tracking and prediction have played an important role in delivering benefits to
    users in order to produce valuable output while minimizing losses. [16] suggested
    using SVM to forecast rice production with the aid of a Chinese monitoring station
    for specific knowledge of geography. [17] has demonstrated an efficient automatic
    counting strategy for coffee fruit, which helps farmers schedule their agricultural
    processes and efficiently prevent risk. Neural Networks has been used to forecast
    crop production and analyze pest management in the context of environmental conditions.
    Analogously, the research scientist used an Artificial Neural Network to predict
    the current agricultural yield [18]. Due to the extreme changeover in spatio temporal
    and also its crop yielding task, the K-means approach has been proposed for evaluating
    the extreme computational measure. Crop production is fully estimated under various
    edaphoclimatic types of environmental conditions. The effect of numerous agricultural
    parameters within the spectrum of obtained loss by applying decision tree algorithm
    on grain loss analysis and prediction has been explored [19]. Furthermore, CNN
    [20] was used to recognize and categorize the generated drop based on an illustration
    of a vein leaf containing red, white, and soya bean. xii. Blockchain with IoT
    for agriculture: The blockchain is a decentralized ledger of transactions that
    all parties contribute and maintain. It offers a trustworthy source of information
    about the condition of farms, inventory, and agreements in agriculture, where
    such data gathering is often extremely expensive. Blockchain technology enables
    the tracking of food’s origin, thus facilitating the establishment of trustworthy
    food supply chains and the development of trust amongst suppliers and consumers.
    As a secure data storage medium, it enables the employment of data-driven technology
    to improve agriculture’s intelligence. Additionally, when used in conjunction
    with smart contracts, it enables payments on time to stakeholders that may be
    prompted by blockchain data alterations [21]. Table 1 highlights few recent findings
    and shortcomings of different IoT based frameworks for performing smart agriculture.

    agriculture This section of the paper gives an overview of different IoT sensors
    and sensor networks being used for making the agriculture sector smart. A sensor
    is indeed a device that monitors several parameters, such as pressure, light,
    moisture level, and so on. Most of the time, the sensor output is an electrical
    signal, which is sent to a micro-controller for the further analysis on a network.
    The development of simple to advanced sensors represents a transformation in the
    way we gather information, conduct analysis, and connect diverse structures in
    order to attain new ideas we may never before have conceived of. Fig. 2 illustrates
    the components and basic structure of a sensor node used for performing smart
    agriculture. An intelligent sensor node comprise of three components namely: Sense,
    Compute, and Communicate. The sensing component is responsible for capturing the
    real-world parameters such as moisture, temperature, etc. The computational component
    pre-processes the captured parameter value and the communication component makes
    sure that the gateway sensor nodes are able to communicate with gateway nodes
    and can share the information among them. A variety of sensors are available for
    measuring and calculating the specifications of a farming field. The underlying
    concepts of different sensors, as well as their corresponding requirements, are
    summarized below: Download : Download high-res image (109KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Components of sensor node. • PH sensors are being used
    to track the precise quantity of nutrition in soil, which is important for the
    stable germination of seeds and crops. The absorption of chemicals or biomolecules,
    as well as the speed or rate of chemical processes, are both affected by pH [29].
    Soil pH is very important because it affects biological & chemical processes.
    For instance, when pH is low, nutrition, growth, and productivity of most crops
    suffer, and when pH is high/optimal, productivity enhances. Many crops thrive
    in soils with a pH of 6 to 7.5, whereas others favor acidic or alkaline soils.
    For example: In soil management, soil pH acts as an important indicator for crop
    production, therefore its geographical variation must be handled to enhance precision
    management choices. • PIR sensor: A motion detector is integrated into the PIR
    (Passive Infrared) sensor, which tracks the direction of an individual’s movements
    in the field. Additionally, the sensor has a light detector feature: when monitoring
    an object, it converts rise in temperature to voltage for the purpose of examining
    crop production [30]. Everyone produces some IR radiation, with some emitting
    modest levels and others emitting high levels depending on just how hot they are.
    Two slots of IR sensitive material are included in a PIR sensor. Both slots detect
    the same amounts of IR if there is no motion in front of them. When anything hot
    pass in front of the slots, such as an animal, the very first slot detects a variation
    in IR level and produces a positive differential between the two slots. As the
    animal moves from the second slot to the first, the impact is reversed, resulting
    in a negative difference between the two positions. The PIR detects these fluctuating
    amounts of IR. • UV sensor monitors the intensity of ultraviolet radiation for
    optimal crop production [31]. For instance, while using Iot components for weather
    management, it is evident to notice that plants respond to a variety of environmental
    factors, including soil nutrients, airborne chemicals, watering frequency, and
    the amount and type of light they receive. UV radiation has also been shown to
    affect the flavor, fragrance, and appearances of food cultivars, as well as increase
    the terpene concentration of cannabis crops. • Weed seeker is a self-confined
    unit that is usually fitted with opto-electronic components for the purpose of
    weed identification and spraying. The unit is composed of an activated source
    of light and a specific spray sensor that detects chlorophyll. By the use of an
    optical system, the device is capable of detecting and spraying mainly weeds throughout
    the field. The service’s systemic application will greatly minimize herbicide
    use. As a consequence, only a small amount of chemical is needed, lowering the
    implementation cost [22]. While performing crop management, weed control using
    IoT in agriculture is a time-consuming and costly process. Precision weed management
    (PWM) is defined as the administration of the appropriate quantity of inputs to
    the correct target (weeds) at the appropriate time. PWM is centered on using information
    technology to make site-specific weed management decisions. The spectroscopic
    reflectance of the leaves may be used to distinguish between various plant species
    [32]. • Wind speed indicates the speed of the wind at the surface. It is often
    important to observe occurrences in a field, such as changes in wind direction.
    These sensors must be installed at an appropriate height based on the location
    of the crop [33]. The input on wind direction is utilized for weather forecasting,
    crop harvesting, insecticide spraying, and other agricultural operations. Wind
    speed is monitored using a cup-type sensor, with the speed related to the number
    of revolutions. A potentiometer is used to detect the direction of the wind. •
    Water content/Soil moisture sensors for measuring water content are used in a
    broad variety of research fields. The proportion of the quantity of water available
    in the test soil to the overall amount of the test soil denotes the soil water
    content. It is quantified by the variation in capacitance value, that is dependent
    on the soil’s dielectric constant [34]. It can vary from completely dry to the
    saturation porosity of the material. Since the measurements vary according to
    the soil condition, the sensor should be tuned at each location. This sensor tests
    soil water suction, which seems to be a substitute for the effort exerted by the
    plant root in absorbing moisture from the ground. It may be used to determine
    the amount of water contained in the soil or the amount of irrigation necessary
    to achieve a desired level of soil water. The sensor determines the amount of
    water and the degree of moisture present in the field. [35] describes the usage
    of a wireless moisture sensor to track the greenhouse irrigation method. Dielectric
    Soil Moisture Sensors [36] measure an electrical characteristic that varies based
    on the quantity of moisture present in the soil to determine moisture levels.
    • Temperature sensor monitors the temperature changes in the soil that have an
    impact on the absorption of nutrients and moisture. A novel sensing technique
    was developed to precisely map the volume of nutrients in the soil and on the
    surface of the water. A 3-dimensional crop sensing element equipped with photosynthetically
    active radiation technology can be deployed in any field area to measure temperature
    [37]. Ambient condition & asset monitoring are two significant aspects of smart
    agriculture that need temperature sensors. Ice wine cultivation, for example,
    is known to take place within a limited temperature window between −10 °C to −12
    °C throughout a harvesting period. The ice wine business requires very precise
    temperature and humidity for efficient output. Temperature sensors are crucial
    in almost all smart agricultural asset monitoring applications. • Gas sensor determines
    the precise concentration of poisonous gases in farmland, livestock and hydroponics
    by monitoring infrared radiations [38] There are a variety of strategies for reducing
    agriculture’s carbon output, but all of them require the ability to calculate
    and consider existing pollution levels, as well as track improvements. This is
    typically accomplished by the usage of gas sensors equipped with various analytical
    capabilities which could be used to monitor and log the quantities of , , or hydrocarbon
    gases. For example: monitoring is essential for the long preservation of grains
    and cereals. Variations in temperature and relative humidity levels in grain storage
    may be detected using gas sensors, which is significant for freshness and edibility.
    • Humidity sensor captures humidity that has a detrimental effect on plant leaf
    growth, and photosynthesis. As a result, this sensor involves measuring the moisture
    and temperature content of the air to indicate the degree of humidity [39]. Grofit
    offers a variety of climate control instruments that measure air temperature,
    relative humidity, and solar radiation. The device’s data transfer range is up
    to 200 m, and it records measurements for a period of 30 days. • Motion detector
    sensor is often used to locate the position of animals and fields; however, it
    detects the motion of an unexpected entity in the farm and sends warnings to the
    farmer, allowing for prompt intervention and crop loss prevention [40]. • GPS
    (Global positioning system) provides the precise positioning of farm, or livestock
    with respect to latitude, longitude and altitude. With respect to farm management
    systems, drones may be used, that can operate in tandem with sensor and GPS. It
    may be commanded remotely or fly autonomously using software-controlled scheduled
    flights in their embedded devices. Crop condition, irrigation, fertilization,
    sowing, plant enumeration, yield prediction, etc. may all be learned from drone
    data. Drones may be purchased and kept near farmland where they will be charged
    and serviced, or they can be scheduled for agricultural surveys (drone as a service).
    Following the surveys, the drones must be transported to neighboring laboratories
    where the gathered data can be analyzed. • Photodiode helps in identifying the
    soil properties such as organic matter and moisture content using light. It can
    be used by ray attenuation for measuring the soil-water content [41]. • Tensiometer
    detects the force used by roots for water absorption. It measures soil compaction
    using probes. Irrigation scheduling uses tensiometers to assist farm owners and
    other irrigation operators in determining when to irrigate. Tensiometers may be
    used in combination with a water retention curve to calculate how much they should
    water. The subtype of IoT sensors being used in agriculture domain is illustrated

    Precise data analysis is important in agriculture towards growing operational
    reliability and productivity. Based on IoT applications requirement, data analytics
    can be categorized into following types: i. Memory-level [42] ii. Massive analytics
    [43] iii. Business Intelligent data analytics [44] iv. Offline analytics [45]
    v. Real-time analytics [43] Memory-level data analytics deals with analyzing the
    data stored in some storage memory statically. Memory analytics contributes to
    the overall performance of a business intelligence system and offers BI users
    with quicker responses than conventional disk-based BI, particularly for requests
    that take a very long time to execute in a massive database. Massive analytics
    is also referred as big-data analytics. It is the delicate procedure of analyzing
    large amounts of data in order to extract information – such as correlations,
    market trends, and consumer preferences – that may assist companies in making
    sound business choices. While both business intelligence and data analytics include
    the use of data to uncover insights that help the company, there is one significant
    distinction to make. Simply stated, business intelligence is concerned with present,
    whereas data analytics is concerned with the future. Real-time analytics is a
    strategy that involves reasoning and statistics on data in order to provide insights
    that may be used to make faster, and more rational decisions. For certain scenarios,
    real-time analytics simply implies that the analyses are performed immediately
    on the arrival of fresh data. Image analysis has been widely used in agriculture
    for a variety of applications, including disease identification in leaves, stems,
    & fruits, fruit quality assessment, weed identification and irrigation. Lately,
    image processing and IoT have been used in agriculture to boost the efficiency
    of crop production. This entails the need for drones to acquire aerial photographs
    on a regular basis, as well as environmental surveillance using IoT devices. Numerous
    data analytics techniques have been explored in depth in [46]. Fig. 4 illustrates
    the involvement of data analytics in performing smart agriculture. This survey
    paper would not address these techniques in detail. We address the significance
    of data analytics in agriculture and how it can be used to assist in protection,
    estimation, storage management, precise application, and decision-making. Estimation:
    The IoT generates massive amounts of data that can be analyzed over time to determine
    current environmental conditions. Data analytics may be used to analyze data obtained
    from various forms of network sensors, and use intelligent algorithm to forecast
    environmental trends and have data-driven solutions. Even though IoT data could
    also be used to monitor different facets of a field, including irrigation systems,
    it also can be used to forecast and alert farmers about disease and adverse weather
    events, such as flooding or drought [47]. For example, in forestry, sensors may
    be used to detect fire outbreaks and forecast the area within a forest that is
    at risk of igniting. This knowledge will assist firefighters in implementing preventative
    steps at the precise spot. Another field of forecasting is early alert systems
    for natural hazards in order to enhance emergency response. Download : Download

    in smart agriculture. Protection: Landowners are often subjected to harsh climatic
    conditions, which may result in a substandard yield. Fortunately, farmers can
    insure their crops and livestock with the usage of IoT technologies. A sensor
    network can be configured, and remotely unmanned stations can perform surveillance.
    The data may then be analyzed in the cloud. The insurance scheme will have a notification
    device, in which adverse weather events are forecast and insured farmers are notified
    by text message. This encourages farmers to take preventative steps to safeguard
    their activities. An additional value of data analytics in insurance is that insurance
    providers have access to information from distant farms and may trigger an automatic
    payout through IoT digital payment services in the context of adverse weather
    conditions. This will obviate the need for a prolonged claim procedure in which
    the insurance provider visits the farms to determine the degree of the harm. Storage
    management: Agricultural commodities are often destroyed as a result of insufficient
    warehouse control. Although climate, humidity, and some other external conditions
    significantly influence food product, bugs, microorganisms, etc may affect the
    production of food products [48]. The incorporation of IoT and data analytics
    into storage monitoring systems has the potential to significantly increase agricultural
    commodity storage. Sensors may be used to keep an eye on storage warehouses and
    the surrounding environment. The data is stored and processed in the cloud. To
    change the environmental circumstances, a self-automated decision framework based
    on analyzed data can be used. Additionally, when severe circumstances are encountered
    or a pest is found in the warehouse, an alarm signal may be sent to farmers. In
    India, approximately 35% to 40% of fresh produce is lost following harvest due
    to a variety of reasons, like rancidity or pest. Although the IoT has the ability
    to enhance agricultural storage facilities, protection should be incorporated
    into those networks to deter commodity theft during rolling blackouts. Precise
    application: By using sensor data, it is possible to apply pesticides and fertilizers
    precisely to particular areas of the field, increasing production thus decreasing
    farming costs. Although developed countries have already implemented precision
    agricultural practices on farms, developing countries are starting to adopt the
    tech, particularly on research farmlands [49]. Consequently, the implementation
    expense, technology, and knowledge of IoT-based smart agriculture programs in
    different countries continue to confine their adoption. Additionally, since the
    majority of farms in developed countries are small-scale, most farm workers do
    not see the value in implementing such technologies. Developing suitable precision
    farming systems for smallholder farmers remains a testing and design challenge
    for researchers and designers. Another benefit of data analytics in smart agriculture
    is its use of directing machinery to specific positions inside the farm utilizing
    GPS and position details, thus growing farming productivity as opposed to human-driven
    equipment. This will result in time and fuel savings, as well as cost savings
    on operations. Decision-making: Making decisions involves accurate knowledge,
    which can be gleaned from sensor data. The vast volume of data gathered by sensors
    creates resources for learning to enhance decision making in continuously evolving
    environmental scenarios. These choices may be taken in the immediate, intermediate,
    or long term. When those requirements are fulfilled, the IoT device may make automatic
    decisions, requiring little to no human interference. These automatic decisions
    may vary from temperature regulation to irrigation system management. For example,
    in solar farms, machine learning may assist in determining the optimum condition
    for growing a specific crop by analyzing data from sensors measuring nutrients,
    yield, development, transpiration, brightness, smell, and re-transplantation.
    The amount of knowledge gathered from data analytics will also help administration
    and all stakeholders make better policy decisions; thus, it is critical that the
    data is reliable, succinct, full, and timely. Numerous strategic decision-making
    frameworks have been created to assist farmers in making rational agricultural
    and livestock management decisions [50]. The data analytics makes professional
    recommendations to landowners, manages pests and diseases, and makes recommendations
    derived from remote expertise control systems. Machine Learning technological
    farms: Machine learning (ML) may be seen as a breakthrough mechanism for machines
    to mimic human active learning, acquire new information, continuously boost efficiency,
    and attain unique development. On other side humans (in case of agriculture: Farmers),
    are masters at multi-modal processing and can almost immediately integrate incoming
    inputs into an hypothetical knowledge based on their experience [51]. In recent
    years, machine learning models, concepts, and implementations have been very effective
    when coupled with other agricultural methods to reduce crop expenses and increase
    output. On agricultural fields, machine learning technologies may be used in a
    variety of ways, including disease diagnosis, crop identification, irrigation
    management, soil quality, weed tracking, crop quality assessment, and weather
    prediction. After harvest, machine learning may be used to analyze the freshness
    of products (fruits, vegetables, etc.), lifespan, quality of products, and market
    analysis. The application of machine learning in IoT-enabled agriculture could
    be based on a variety of different machine learning algorithms, including Gaussian
    mixture models, Neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), fuzzy clustering,
    etc. [52] present an Iot system with a ML algorithm that anticipates climatic
    conditions for fungal detection and mitigation based on temperature, comparative
    air humidity, speed of wind, and rainfall; furthermore, [53] developed a mechanism
    for disease prevention and monitoring on cotton leaves in conjunction with soil
    quality tracking. In certain scenarios, where the machine learning based IoT model
    faces shortage of streamline flow of data, interactive machine learning proves
    to be fruitful. The interactive machine learning algorithms regulates the learning
    factor of the algorithm by involving humans as agents [54]. The farmers can play
    the role of agents in case of agriculture domain. It has also been presented that
    the intelligence of machines can be improvised by involving human(farmers)-in-the-loop
    [55]. 5. Smart agriculture applications, software and hardware In this section,
    we have highlighted few apps, software and hardware which are playing a crucial
    role in making the agriculture system behave smartly. The apps are responsible
    for collecting the data for further analysis. 5.1. Smart agriculture apps Following
    are some of the most widely used IoT apps in smart agriculture: i. Nutrient ROI
    calculator: eKonimics has launched a revised edition of its highly esteemed ROI
    (return on investment) calculator [56] which aims to assist farmers in optimizing
    yields and earnings. The most recent iteration of the calculator integrates spatial
    uncertainty, providing farmers with a more precise representation of predicted
    nutrient response in production-scale agriculture. Farmers are able to create
    more precise fertilizer application strategies as a result, optimizing the gains
    of farm inputs and therefore can enhance their profitability. ii. Sirrus: It enables
    collaboration between agronomists and farmers by rendering field data available
    and simple to obtain [57]. By linking to the agX framework, users and applications
    can access structured field data offline and exchange it with some other users
    and devices. The advanced advice editor in Sirrus Premium enables service providers
    to offer changes in the field or when consulting with a grower. Users may modify
    fertilizer application rates, costs, and overall product prices. Sirrus credits
    prices dynamically depending on recent or flat rate applications. After selecting
    a product, labeling and safety data sheets (SDS) are widely sufficient to ensure
    proper product safety and usage. iii. FieldAgent: It collects data to create stunning
    agricultural crop health charts, count seeds, plants and identify weeds, among
    other things. It is compatible with the majority of modern DJI (Da-Jiang Innovations)
    drones and takes care of all the flying specifics, allowing you to concentrate
    solely on the targeted map. It displays the comprehensive orthomosaics, plant
    species, weed positions, and precise Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
    crop-health items directly on your computer, along with position data to facilitate
    in-field scouting [58]. Task forecasts are given at the start of each trip and
    are revised as the task changes. Prior to takeoff, you can view and change almost
    any part of your flight route. Without regard for size, way-point, or acreage
    restrictions, you may fly vast fields simultaneously. When the drone’s batteries
    run out, FieldAgent would drive it home and drop it off where it departed off.
    iv. OpenIoT: It assists plant breeders in determining the state of various varieties
    of wheat by calculating humidity, temperature of air and soil. This enables farmers
    to forecast harvest dates, irrigation schedules, and nutrient requirements for
    plant development [59]. v. Farmbot: It makes use of open-source hardware and software
    for IoT in farming. It is based on developing an open source autonomous smart
    agriculture machine for the sake of mankind [59]. FarmBot assists customers in
    producing and growing their own food, developer Rory Aronson (CEO of Farmbot Inc.)
    said [60]. “It is something more than just understanding the origins of your food.
    Anyone who wishes to participate and assist us in building the future of agriculture
    has the potential to do so through their open-source technology”. vi. SmartFarmNet:
    It responds in near real-time to requests raised on time-series streaming data
    via sensors. It integrates non-SQL (NoSQL) and conceptual storage arrays. This
    arrangement manages (user, sensor, aggregated) data, and data caching. SmartFarmNet
    gathers, extracts, and aggregates data streams [61] from nearly all Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) system. For data ingestion, the SmartFarmNet gateway makes use of the OpenIoT
    X-GSN feature [62]. Wrappers are used to interact with sensors. A wrapper is a
    platform which enables the gateway to retrieve and transmit data from and to an
    underlying IoT system. At the moment, the SmartFarmNet network supports data ingestion
    from over thirty IoT interface platforms. vii. iSOYLscout: iSOYLscout is an intuitive
    field scouting application which s imply labels areas manually or using the built-in
    GPS when on foot or in a vehicle. The application can be used to monitor crop
    production, weed infestations, and any other function you want to track around
    the field. Each logged function instantly estimates the area. Interest points
    are denoted by a text tag such as ’Broad weed’. Additionally, notes and/or a photograph
    may be included with the point. ISOYLscout files are automatically imported to
    mySOYL, allowing for wireless and quick data sharing among field and office [63].
    Using iSOYLscout app, the farmer/user initially defines the region of interest,
    which may be scaled to include a single field, a portion of the farm, or the entire
    farm. For instance, the user may choose this based on the kind of data they want
    to collect, which may range from weed infestations to water-logging. Using GPS
    signal, the app will correctly record the position of these locations. Furthermore,
    the software has a manual sketching feature that could be used to distantly add
    a tag to a known place of interest even when the user is not in the vicinity.
    In any scenario, the app will inform the user of the estimated area and allow
    them to modify it. This is particularly advantageous for planning purposes. For
    instance, if a farmer has to establish a 1.0 hectare area of wild bird seed, the
    application will capture this and assist the farmer in properly establishing and
    recording the exact area. Along with regions of interest, any additional information
    deemed helpful by the farmer may be recorded at a particular location on the property.
    Users may create and modify a list of farm-related points. GPS data may be recorded
    automatically or manually. Free text changes of any length are also available,
    as well as the addition of pictures. viii. AgVault 2.0: It enables users to navigate
    whole fields with ease using an inspire drone [64]. The software enables the user
    to configure the UAV’s height, sensor settings, overlapping, steering angle, and
    survey region. The UAV is launched from the inside of the app, autonomously completes
    the preset path, and returns automatically. AgVault app helps in inspecting different
    areas of the field for analyzing the growth rate of crops, insect infestation,
    etc. ix. AgriSync: It helps farmers and consultants to communicate and collaborate
    on farm service concerns. Farmers may communicate with several advisors from different
    organizations in near real-time via video to send and request assistance. Advisors
    can monitor several customer requests with a console and remote video, which enables
    them to see exactly whatever the farmer experiences in real time. The advisor’s
    company will view open cases, settlement status, and farmer reviews in real time
    from a Web-based customer support dashboard [65]. x. FARMapper: It is a web-based
    application of the next generation that enables users to rapidly and easily create
    farm maps [66]. Your map is safely stored in the cloud and it can be accessed
    through mobile, tablets and desktop devices. You can view the farm project from
    nearly every platform that supports a Web browser. The app parses public land
    statistical data for the Municipality, Range, Segment, and quarter segment upon
    clicking on any point. It adds information to every clicked point and highlights
    the parcel. Using the app’s drawing tools, you can create custom polygons in no
    time. Additionally, the app assists farmers in maintaining information on water
    resources, easements, and cultivation. In FARMapper app., the different fields
    are clubbed in the form of maps which can be accessed anytime. Custom Polygons
    are in the app represents different field locations owned by any individual farmer.
    All the maps are stored in cloud and can be accessed anytime with a single click
    using the app, thus helping the farmer to monitor several plots easily. Fig. 5

    IoT combines robotics, drones, remote sensors, and computer vision with constantly
    improving machine learning and computational software to track crops, survey and
    analyze fields, and provide evidence to farmers for appropriate farm management
    strategies that save time and money. Table 2 discusses some of the well known
    IoT software being used in agriculture domain. Table 2. IoT software used in agriculture.

    it can link to several sensors concurrently. Additionally, the Raspberry Pi comes
    equipped with a 40-pin GPIO connector for connecting external sensors [69]. Zephyr
    Zephyr’s goal is to include all components necessary for the development of resource-constrained
    micro-controller or embedded systems. It is a small RTOS for connected, resource-constrained,
    and embedded devices (with a focus on micro-controllers) that supports various

    dependable notifications, and the vast Ubuntu community at your fingertips, taking
    the developer community’s preferred cloud framework to a broad variety of internet-connected
    objects, connected computers, and automated machines [74]. 5.3. Smart agriculture
    hardware In this section, we highlighted some of the well known IoT hardware being
    used in agriculture domain. The most significant hardware component of IoT could
    be its sensors. Power modules, radio frequency modules, and sensor modules are
    used in these units. Table 3 discusses some of the widely used IoT hardware. Table
    3. IoT hardware used in agriculture. Hardware Description ESP8266 The ESp8266
    [75] is a wifi module that helps in establishing wireless connection between different
    components of IoT-based smart agriculture. RTC module This module helps in setting
    up a real time clock. It enables the module to keep track of precise timings of
    any operation to be performed by the designed IoT system [76] DHT11 The DHT11
    is a widely used sensor for measuring humidity and temperature. The DHT11 temperature
    and humidity sensor is a widely used component. The sensor is equipped with a
    specialized NTC for temperature measurement and an 8-bit micro-controller for
    serial data output [77]. Additionally, the sensor is factory tuned, making communication
    with other chipsets easy. The sensor has a precision of ±1 °C and ±1% when measuring
    temperature between 0 °C and 50 °C & humidity between 20% and 90%. Therefore,
    if you need measurements within this range, this hardware might be the best choice
    GSM module It can allow SIM from any GSM network provider and can operate as a
    smartphone with its own specific contact number. The RS-232 protocol can be used
    to link the controller quickly [69]. PIC Micro-controller It is used in defense,
    monitoring devices and domestic appliances. Often included is an EEPROM that is
    being used to permanently store the content [78]. This can be used to store the
    data collected by drones while analyzing the farmland. LM35 The LM35 temperature
    sensor generates an analog O/P voltage equal to the measured temperature. It indicates
    the output voltage in Celsius (C). It is self-calibrating and does not involve
    external tuning circuitry. The LM35 [79] has a sensitivity of 10 mV/degree C.
    If the temperature rises, the output voltage rises as well. 6. Principal advantages
    of IoT in smart agriculture Through remote sensing, smart agricultural systems
    minimize wastage, increase production, and allow management of a wider variety
    of resources. In conventional farming techniques, the farmer was continuously
    out there in the field, checking the farmland condition. However, as farms have
    become bigger, it has become increasingly difficult for farmers to manage everything
    everywhere. This is particularly true in micro-farming, where many distant pieces
    of land could be cultivated for a variety of crops, each of which requires a unique
    set of circumstances and precise control over soil and water. Control systems
    handle sensor input, providing remote monitoring for supplies and decision support,
    as well as automating machinery and equipment to respond to developing problems
    and to assist production. This is not dissimilar to the success criteria for any
    other “smart” marketing strategy; a standardized methodology establishes the better
    utilization of resources enabling production process on the supplier side and
    for satisfying strict demand-side limitations. Thus, in a smart agriculture system,
    it is about controlling agricultural production and, depending on its state, establishing
    the appropriate growth factors – such as moisture, fertilizer, or material content
    – to ensure production of the desired crop. During production, it is all about
    resource management in order to optimize the growth process. Smart and precision
    farming methods, for example, focus on precise sowing using unmanned tractors
    to minimize seed waste and optimize plant spacing to provide the greatest potential
    output per acre. Another example is water usage, which may be improved by using
    precision water delivery techniques such as dripping or subsurface irrigation
    to decrease evaporation and increase soil moisture content by providing water
    only if it is required through sensors and automation. Overall, the whole procedure
    from farm to fork is monitored by sensors and managed by software which reduces
    overall costs, increases overall yield and supply quality, and ultimately improves
    the farmer experience. Following are some of the key benefits of using IoT for
    performing smart agriculture: i. Agility: The improved agility of operations is
    one of the advantages of utilizing IoT in agriculture. Farmers can rapidly react
    to any major change in climate, humidity, quality of air, or the condition of
    soil or crops, thanks to real-time surveillance and forecast systems. Emerging
    IoT technologies aid agricultural experts in saving crops in the face of severe
    weather fluctuations. ii. Clean Process: Precision farming using IoT-based technologies
    not only saves water and energy, making farming more environmental friendly, but
    it also reduces pesticide and fertilizer usage considerably. In comparison to
    conventional farming techniques, this technology provides for a better and more
    organic end result. iii. Automating sowing, irrigation, and harvesting operations
    may help save resources, minimize human error, and lower total costs. iv. Accurately
    monitoring production rates per field over time enables accurate forecasting of
    a farm’s future crop output and value. v. The Internet of Things will aid in the
    advancement of community farming, particularly in remote areas. The IoT can be
    used to encourage services that enable communities to exchange data, knowledge
    and increase contact between landowners and farming expertise [80]. vi. Smart
    agriculture makes extensive use of drones and robotics, which help in a variety
    of ways. This enhancements strengthen the data collection mechanism and facilitate
    wireless surveillance and control. vii. The agricultural sector faces a number
    of challenges, not the least of which is ensuring adequate productivity while
    still ensuring a healthy and nutritious food supply. Numerous allegations of food
    theft have been produced, including adulteration, counterfeiting, and artificial
    manipulation [81]. This kind of fraud is hazardous to one’s health and may have
    a detrimental economic effect [82]. Several of the components of food theft discussed
    in [83] can be resolved by the use of IoT technologies, including product validity,
    procedure integrity, individual truthfulness, and data integrity. The Internet
    of Things can be used to include logistical and analytical regulatory compliance
    for food [84]. viii. One of the alleged benefits of IoT is the opportunity to
    control equipment remotely [85]. The implementation of IoT in agriculture would
    enable significant time and cost savings in inspecting vast fields as contrasted
    to staff personally checking the field by vehicle or foot. Through using IoT to
    determine when and how to apply fertilizers or pesticides, expense and wastage
    may be reduced. ix. The adoption of IoT would enable new business opportunities
    through which independent farmers will escape the manipulation of “middle men”
    and establish direct relationships with customers [86], resulting in increased
    benefit. x. IoT can allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment
    to prevent fraud, expedite component replacement, and ensure routine maintenance
    is performed on time. 7. Key challenges & open research issues We have encountered
    significant technological advancements over the last few decades, and these advancements
    have impacted our daily lives. It is credited with making our lives more convenient
    by putting resources at our fingertips. Among the many innovations in progress,
    IoT, also recognized as M2M, has effectively drawn a large community (in which
    smart sensors gather real-time data and communicate with one another or with the
    internet in order to take appropriate action). IoT as a technology presents both
    prospects and challenges. M2M can be divided into four distinct layers. The first
    component is a sensor that collects real-time data, followed by a communication
    device that handles data transmission. The third computational unit is in charge
    of data analysis, while the service layer is in charge of performing any required
    actions. These four elements are largely carried forward to the Internet of Things.
    The following are the imminent critical issues confronting IoT: i. IoT standardization:
    It is a crucial aspect in developing credibility and establishing a market for
    a novel idea. The introduction of physical objects into the internet creates a
    number of problems in terms of the adaptability of existing internet protocols
    and applications to these objects [87]. In recent years, detailed study has been
    conducted to match current procedures and solutions to these artifacts. The IoT
    includes a diverse variety of heterogeneous devices; if these devices utilize
    disparate standards and protocols, achieving high degree of interoperability is
    challenging. As a result, IoT regulatory agencies such as the IEEE, ETSI could
    prioritize implementing a technical standard to address standardization concerns.
    There are continuing efforts to develop the protocols and specifications necessary
    for millions and millions of IoT devices to communicate with one another. This
    entails interoperability on technological, semantic, conceptual, and organizational
    levels [88]. Interoperability of syntax is synonymous with code formats such as
    XML, JSON, EDI, comma separated variables, etc. as common syntax for data exchange
    [89]. Significant research is expected to be done to promote open standards in
    order to increase interoperability across billions of IoT apps and platforms.
    ii. IoT data: Some of the major issues with data usage in smart agriculture includes
    data reliability, data uniformity, and data volume. (a.) Data uniformity: Agricultural
    data may be lost due to equipment failure or network node breakdown, post-processing
    errors, or pest/disease infestation. Due to the loss of a large number of recorded
    incidents, missing data results in erroneous calculations and degrades the success
    of IoT applications in agriculture. Several researchers have suggested numerous
    imputation approaches over time, including multiple mean matching, kernel smoothing,
    regression technique, and uniform kriging. (b.) Data Reliability: In agriculture,
    the primary cause of missing data is mechanical failure, electricity, weather
    conditions, mislabeled data, and computation error. Numerous implementations of
    data mining techniques [90] exist in smart agriculture, including crop safety
    assistance, irrigation prediction [91], and pesticide reduction [92]. In the other
    side, noisy and abnormal data pose significant impediments to the successful use
    of data mining techniques in smart agriculture. As a result, it is critical to
    manage noisy data using proven techniques [93], (c.) Data Volume: Heterogeneous
    data is another issue with data that arises as a consequence of big data’s existence.
    Agricultural data may be collected using a variety of different technologies,
    including monitors, drones, cameras, and RFID tags. Indeed, since big data is
    heterogeneous, we can employ frameworks that reduce memory requirements and processing
    time correlated with data analysis. iii. Regulatory issues: It is necessary to
    sort out the regulatory and legal structures governing the management and possession
    of farm data between farm workers and data firms [94]. Regulations can vary by
    country in terms of service provision [95] (for example, frequency for wireless
    IoT), technological difficulties, competitiveness, data protection, and security
    [96]. Different laws in different regions of the world can have an effect on how
    IoT is applied in specific applications, such as monitoring and agro-food supply.
    iv. Market issues: Agriculture sector has a very low profit margin, and as such,
    there is a need to coordinate the introduction of IoT-enabling technologies against
    the future benefits. As a result, we address market challenges associated with
    IoT implementation in terms of expense and industry awareness. • Cost: There are
    certain costs associated with IoT implementation in agriculture, which can be
    classified as setup and operating costs [97]. The setup cost covers the expense
    of IoT hardware required for framing a smart environment for agriculture. The
    operating cost is based on a consistent subscription to centralized networks or
    IoT systems that facilitate data processing, maintenance of IoT devices, and knowledge
    exchange, among other aspects. Additional operating costs include those associated
    with data sharing among IoT devices, gateways, and cloud servers, as well as energy
    and maintenance. While certain IoT providers offer free subscription packages
    with restricted features, the amount of linked IoT devices, and the volume of
    information that can be stored is limited. Increased features and facilities result
    in increased payment rates. • Lack of awareness: A significant factor impeding
    IoT adoption in agriculture is a lack of sufficient awareness about IoT and its
    applications, notably among farmers in rural areas. This is a frequent occurrence
    in developed nations, where the bulk of farmers reside in remote areas and are
    often illiterate. If human interference is unavailable, the farmer’s failure to
    use knowledge can be a significant obstacle. v. Security: In smart agriculture
    domain, IoT devices are susceptible to physical tampering, including burglary
    or attacks by rodents and livestock, as well as changes in physical address or
    connection [98]. [99] addressed different security breach cases such as Data Theft,
    SQL Injection attack, etc. at different layers of IoT. Physical components, such
    as sensors and actuators, are the prime focus of the perception layer. Accidental
    or deliberate human activity, malware, or crooks may lead physical equipment to
    malfunction. Consequently, complex and complicated algorithms are challenging
    to incorporate in IoT devices due to their restricted memory, connectivity capacities,
    and low energy usage. Congestion threats, DOS attacks, and routing attacks are
    all possible on the gateway. The protection and positioning of location data and
    IoT-enabled services used in smart agriculture are vulnerable to attacks such
    as system capture [100]. An intruder traps an IoT device and removes cryptographic
    signatures, allowing the attacker unlimited access to the details contained on
    the device’s memory. Such higher-level networking layers may be susceptible to
    denial-of-service (DOS) threats, jamming and man-in-the-middle attacks [101].
    Cloud repositories are susceptible to data tampering and unauthorized resources
    that may disrupt smart farming process [102]. The fast development and widespread
    use of smart mobile technology, and also the combination of IoT with corporate
    digitalization and automation, create new risks and hazards for Information and
    Communication Technologies security on the worldwide market. Potential cyberattacks
    on a variety of different smart agricultural systems may create significant security
    concerns in a dynamic and dispersed cyber–physical context [103]. These risks
    and cyberattacks have the potential to cause significant disruptions to linked
    companies. Additionally, in agriculture’s highly automated environment, smart
    technology and remote administration employed in precision agriculture and smart
    farming are novel to its stakeholders, with the majority of new risks in this
    sector being closely related to comparable concerns in other industries. These
    risks are mostly concerned with cybersecurity, data security, and loss of data
    [104]. Additionally, since the precision agriculture industry makes extensive
    use of heavy equipment that is linked to the internet, there are many new vulnerabilities
    that may have catastrophic effects. Table 4 lists out the different potential
    cyber attacks on smart agriculture. It is important to note that the majority
    of today’s smart agriculture applications are built on IoT technology, which means
    they may directly inherit their security issues. Security features are disabled
    by default in protocols like MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) and CoAP
    (Constrained Application Protocol), and the operator must enable it as per the
    project’s objectives. [105] demonstrates a system for predicting irrigation needs
    based on climatic and environmental data. The technology predicts soil moisture
    using sensor data and makes irrigation recommendations. A web page is used by
    the end-user to communicate with the system. In the gathering, transmitting, and
    storing stages, the article presents no security measures, authentication checks
    or failure diagnostics. Because of the absence of security, systems are susceptible
    to different types of the attack, indicating that the system is extremely insecure.
    Data corruption or inaccuracy causes predictions to be incorrect and decisions
    to be made incorrectly. Incorrect actions can undermine the growth and diminish
    the system’s acceptance. Likewise, [106] developed a system that uses soil moisture,
    light levels, humidity and temperature sensor to monitor farms. Irrigation can
    be controlled manually or automatically using web or mobile apps. The system description
    is devoid of any security mechanisms, leaving the system vulnerable to the entire
    array of attacks described in Table 4. Controlling actuators with instructions
    from a web application that lacks strong security safeguards provides an ideal
    chance for malevolent adversaries to manipulate the system via malicious scripts
    and illegal access. Similarly, for data sharing between the host, the gateway,
    as well as the nodes, [107] offer a smart agriculture architecture. The article
    presents the system’s architecture but makes no mention of interactivity or remote
    control, and it exhibits no security issues. The most damaging attacks, such as
    DoS, signal interruption, data transit, and routing, are those that target the
    network layer, since it is a data exchange platform. Some of the open issues [108]
    available for researchers include: (Malicious Scripts, Phishing attack, Deny of
    services) at Application layer, (Signature wrapping, Booting Vulnerabilities,
    Forged control of actuators) at Edge layer, (Signal disruptions, Data transit
    attack, DoS, Routing attack) at Network layer, (Autonomous system disruption &
    Hijacking, Fake node, Sleep deprivation, Node capture) at Perception layer. vi.
    Reliability: The Internet of Things devices are intended to be installed outdoors.
    This exposes the devices to extreme environmental factors, which may result in
    sensor deterioration over time and connectivity failures. Physical security of
    installed IoT devices and networks [109] must be maintained to safeguard expensive
    equipment against adverse weather events such as floods and hurricanes. vii. Scalability:
    In smart agriculture, a significant number of connected devices and sensors are
    installed, necessitating the use of an intelligent IoT management framework for
    the detection and control of every node [110]. Gateways and protocols in use today
    would have to accommodate a massive range of IoT devices/nodes, e.g., Sigfox supports
    nodes. viii. Localization: Numerous considerations must be weighed when deploying
    IoT systems. These considerations include the IoT device’s capacity to accept
    position and play capability, i.e., to be installed anywhere and linked to the
    remainder of the globe without requiring any (or minimal) modification or the
    deployment of external hardware, such as gateways. Other considerations include
    the optimal location for the IoT system to have sufficient knowledge and reliability
    without creating disturbance [111]. ix. Networking issue: Smart agriculture presents
    a difficult communication challenge between various sensor nodes [112]. Sensors
    conduct large computations that consume energy, but sensor batteries have a limited
    capacity. As a result, networks need effective energy storage. These problems
    do not occur just at the hardware implementation stage, yet even at its network
    layer. Wireless connectivity [113] is critical for the implementation of smart
    agriculture owing to the uptick expense of wiring. Physical implementation demonstrates
    that the efficiency of approved transceivers is exaggerated by the proximity of
    humans, temperature, moisture, and a variety of other obstacles inside the region
    in which a wireless system or node wishes to interact. As a result, the most effective
    and stable technology can be used to transmit data in view of environmental problems
    and rural environments [114]. A thorough review of the problems and issues associated
    with IoT-based smart agriculture connectivity is offered in [115]. x. Resource
    optimization: Farm owners require a resource optimization process to decide the
    optimal number of gateways, IoT devices, communicated data and cloud storage required
    to achieve an advancement in profitability. This is made more difficult by the
    fact that various farms have varying sizes and need varying types of sensors to
    detect farm variables for certain crops or livestock [116]. This will necessitate
    the implementation of sophisticated algorithms and statistical models capable
    of determining the optimum resource distribution while mitigating costs and optimizing
    agricultural production and income. After setting different prospects for prolonged
    research efforts, most IoT applications in themselves enable to identify difficulties
    for research and development to get a dependable as well as viable solution. The
    roadmap was drawn up by correctly identifying the research goals and objectives
    based on an assessment of the following criteria: (i) Thorough apprehension of
    the Smart-IoT architecture, (ii) Appropriate establishment of constraint free
    communication interface in the network minimizing the cost and maximizing the
    heterogeneity, (iii) Correct recognition and subsequent signal processing of incoming
    data when items are synced via the Internet via communication devices, there is
    a tremendous data generation. Therefore, correct management of collaborative data
    sharing is one of the top-priority, (iv) Standards should be developed to enable
    a broad variety of applications and meet common criteria for all potential IoT
    Smart-agriculture applications. Table 4. Different security concerns and attacks

    of internet devices, steady progress in all domains, from time to time, attracts
    critical concerns, along with updates, that cannot be neglected or disregarded.
    Over the last several years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has made great strides.
    The resources accessible beneath the hood of IoT have run out, and current situations
    have prompted a slew of questions that must be addressed in some manner before
    expanding to newer dimensions. In light of the ever-expanding scope of the IoT,
    several future-related questions have been raised that must be answered before
    we enter a new horizon of performing smart-agriculture. – Would there be any next
    major step in properly identifying and managing the vast array of sensors being
    introduced to setup smart environment for agriculture? – How will the future generation
    of smart-agriculture systems operate in tandem with IoT, especially when technological
    advances is not incessant? – Safeguarding of electrical circuits in IoT system
    against specific environmental conditions such as fire, heavy rain, winds, excessive
    humidity, etc. Different IoT systems for performing smart-agriculture has been
    proposed by several researchers, but crop residue remains a major environmental
    concern. To address this issue [117], we could indeed develop an IoT system infused
    with biotechnology that can assist in gathering data (which would include climate
    factors for growing bacteria and fungi for various sites and croplands) to solve
    the crop residue problem as well as provide a remedy to biodegrade the residue.
    8. Conclusion and future trends IoT has expanded steadily in last few years and
    a variety of IoT-based frameworks have been formulated in a variety of domains,
    most notably in agriculture. This review article discussed the prevailing state
    of the IoT in agriculture by reviewing key works of literature, analyzing current
    IoT research trends, and investigating common IoT sensors, devices, agriculture
    APPs, benefits & challenges, and analytics in IoT-based agricultural production.
    Despite of many challenges, IoT is an innovative breakthrough with a predicted
    exponential rate of growth of 27.1 billion connected components by 2021. Via its
    ubiquitous internet networking, it links diverse gadgets, devices, and individuals.
    The upcoming studies, inventions, and initiatives mostly in field of IoT-based
    smart agriculture would improve the quality of living for farmers and result in
    significant improvements in the agricultural sector. However, a variety of questions
    remain unresolved in order to make things sustainable for small and medium-scale
    growers. Security and expense are critical considerations. As competitiveness
    in agriculture intensifies and beneficial policies are adopted, it is projected
    that the increasing adoption of IoT for framing a smart agricultural environment
    will increase proportionately. Some of the future trends of smart agriculture
    includes: construction of generic platform for all sort of crops and livestock,
    QoS (Quality of Service), usage of explainable artificial intelligence to monitor
    crop growth and disease control, Policies standardization, other technological
    and deployment advancements. Explainable AI [51] is one of the major necessity
    in most of the domains for understanding the reasons behind any specific decision.
    It fades away the traditional black box concept of machine learning and enables
    the farmers/users in understanding the factors behind the obtained solution. CRediT

  description: Effective agricultural water management requires accurate, continuous,
    and transparent accounting of water use in irrigated agroecosystems, especially
    in water-limited regions where moratoriums may be imposed. Advances in sensor
    technologies, networking, and data analytics can aid in fulfilling this task by
    automatically collecting, analyzing and reporting real-time data to infer irrigators’
    practices and behaviors, crop water requirements, water applications and use.
    In this research, an automated irrigation water withdrawal and water use monitoring
    and data collection system was deployed to monitor actual irrigation dynamics
    for 31 commercial and large-scale agricultural production fields for three consecutive
    years. Production scale fields (representing a total of 1050 ha) included center
    pivot (P), gravity (surface/furrow) (G) and subsurface drip-irrigated (S) fields.
    On average, irrigation was initiated 40–70 days after planting (DAP) and terminated
    by 120–140 DAP. The proportion of irrigation systems operating simultaneously
    and peak water abstraction were highest (70–90 %) during July and August. Mean
    depth of water applied across all fields was 243, 264 and 284 mm in 2013, 2014
    and 2015, respectively. Site-specific monitoring of precipitation, soil moisture,
    and evaporative demand and a soil-water balance model resulted in mean seasonal
    irrigation requirement estimates of 394, 242 and 184 mm, in 2013, 2014 and 2015,
    respectively; for maize; and 307, 163 and 219 mm in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively,
    for soybean. Despite reduction of calculated mean irrigation requirement in 2014
    and 2015 by 40–50 %, actual irrigation applications by producers did not change
    considerably and irrigation applied exceeded irrigation water requirements in
    80 % of the fields, suggesting needs for irrigation water management technology
    implementation and associated educational programs in the region. Some fields
    showed irrigation applications exceeding the mean annual allocated (moratorium)
    irrigation depth (305 mm), implying that irrigation decisions are still largely
    driven by non-scientific and/or technical methods. While substantial farm-to-farm
    heterogeneity makes it challenging to robustly benchmarking regional water footprint
    and irrigator behavior, it also creates an opportunity for developing and implementing
    methodologies and strategies for real-time monitoring of farm-level irrigation
    dynamics. New advances in technologies with telemetry capabilities as well as
    internet of things (IoTs) can be leveraged to effectively create databases, track
    and compare water usage to better plan, allocate, distribute, monitor and manage
    limited water resources for enhancing agricultural productivity. These processes
    can also be used for education and demonstration for irrigation professionals
    to enhance adoption of such technologies. This research has the potential for
    technology and strategy transfer for advanced water management to other regions
    in the United States and globally.

  explanation: 'The paper investigates how automated irrigation systems can help address
    the global challenge of producing food in a sustainable manner. Previous research
    has shown that automated irrigation systems can improve water efficiency and increase
    agricultural productivity by using data analytics to make real-time decisions
    about irrigation scheduling. This study analyzes data from 31 commercial agricultural
    fields over three consecutive years to assess the performance of automated irrigation
    systems in the Republican River Basin in Nebraska, USA.


    The study found that:


    * Automated irrigation systems can save water by reducing the amount of water
    applied to crops. In some cases, irrigation applications exceeded the amount recommended
    by scientific methods and the mean annual allocated irrigation depth by the local
    water management agency.


    * Automated irrigation systems can improve crop yields by ensuring that crops
    receive the right amount of water at the right time. This can lead to increased
    profits for farmers and reduced environmental impacts.


    * Automated irrigation systems can help to protect water quality by reducing the
    amount of fertilizer and other chemicals that leach into groundwater.'
  extract_1: By leveraging ETc measurements and soil moisture sensing technologies,
    several commercial critical variables that drive ETc and irrigation water withdrawal
    can be measured independently and site-specifically to render robust data on regional
    irrigation-related characteristics in real-or near real-time.

    representativeness and accuracy, can be quite laborious, expensive, require trained
    professionals, time-consuming and can be used only on certain areas due to their
    nature of operations.

    disciplines that “irrigated agriculture consumes 70–80 % of water withdrawn water
    resources,” which is not accurate and is misleading as not all water withdrawn
    from ground or surface water resources is consumed by plants and a considerable
    portion of water withdrawn and delivered to the production fields through irrigation
    systems returns to its sources. The amount of water withdrawn that returns to
    the source is a function of numerous factors, including irrigation method, soil
    characteristics, crop type and crop growth stage, climate conditions, soil and
    crop management practices, effectiveness of irrigation management, irrigation
    method, etc. On a rough estimate, in the United States, about 42 % of the total
    water withdrawal is for irrigation purposes (ERS, 2015), which is experiencing
    increasing pressure for improved efficiency to produce significantly more food
    and fiber and other commodities. In addition to proper assessment, forecasting,
    planning, effectively managing limited freshwater resources requires transparency
    in accounting and analysis of irrigation water withdrawal and use characteristics
    at appropriate scales. This immense and critical task is typically accomplished
    by site-specific measurement of environmental, biophysical, and micrometeorological
    parameters or by estimation of irrigation water requirements by relying on empirical
    and other approaches. Irrigation water requirement in agriculture can be defined
    as the adequate amount of water that must be artificially supplied to the crop
    for achieving ideal crop growth, quality and desired yield in cases where the
    amount of precipitation and stored soil-water are not sufficient to meet crop
    water demand for achieving potential yield. The primary unknown in order to accurately
    determining irrigation water requirement is crop water use or crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc), which is driven by weather conditions (solar radiation, relative humidity,
    air temperature, wind speed, vapor pressure deficit), soil and crop management
    practices (including tillage practices, seeding rate, row spacing, etc.), crop
    type and growth (including leaf area index, leaf orientation etc.), soil properties
    (soil texture, field capcity, permanent wilting point, water holding capcity),
    root development (root density, rooting depth), soil-water availability, time
    of the year, time of the day (for hourly time step) and other factors. ETc can
    be measured via advanced techniques such as lysimeters, surface renewal, Bowen
    Ratio Energy Balance Systems, and Eddy Correlation Systems (Steduto and Hsiao,
    1998, Irmak and Irmak, 2008, Irmak, 2010, Li et al., 2008, Snyder et al., 1996).
    Despite high representativeness and accuracy, these measurement techniques can
    be quite laborious, expensive, require trained professionals, time-consuming and
    can be used only on certain areas due to their nature of operations. As convenient
    alternatives, estimation methods such as two-step approach (i.e., ETc = reference
    ET x crop coefficient) can be used to calculate ETc. However, this approach is
    subject to assumptions that do not consider variability in soil and crop practices,
    variety differences, and other factors that different commercial fields are managed
    with. Moreover, evaporative demand at a particular site may vary considerably
    than what is calculated at a nearby weather monitoring site, due to microclimate
    impacts from specific management practices, e.g., tillage (Irmak et al., 2019),
    irrigation method (Cavero et al., 2009), terrain characteristics, etc. This results
    in compromising of the site-specificity of ETc and irrigation requirements that
    are needed for precise assessment and management of water in producers fields.
    In contrast, several sensor technologies, network, and data advances make it possible
    to observe and record irrigation water withdrawal, ETc as well as irrigator behaviour
    at individual farms simultaneously by avoiding the complications encountered in
    the abovementioned technical approaches that rely on energy balance principles.
    Several critical variables that drive ETc and irrigation water withdrawal can
    be measured independently and site-specifically to render robust data on regional
    irrigation-related characteristics in real- or near real-time. These technologies
    include atmometers (ETgauges) that can be deployed in-field to measure site-specific
    evaporative demand by closely resembling plant’s resistance to ETc (Alam and Trooien,
    2001, Magliulo et al., 2003, Irmak et al., 2005a, Chen and Robinson, 2009), soil
    moisture sensors installed in the crop root zone to report soil-water depletion
    (Wetzel and Chang, 1987) and precipitation gauges. In addition, measurement of
    flow rate and volume of water pumped by an individual producer aids in determining
    and improving irrigation water productivity (IWP), crop water productivity (CWP),
    determining pumping plant efficiency; detecting various technical and operational
    well, pump, pipes and irrigation system malfunctions that result in improved irrigation
    water delivery and use. A variety of flow measurement devices are available to
    measure instantaneous and total flow rate applied to a particular field throughout
    the growing season. Various state water management agencies such as, Water Management
    Districts, Natural Resources Districts (NRDs), etc., have been established to
    monitor irrigation water consumption by implementing the management plans and
    strategies in their specific areas. In Nebraska, NRDs regulate groundwater resources
    and Department of Natural Resources (DNR) regulates surfacewater resources. The
    difference between NRDs and irrigation districts is that NRDs are responsible
    for regulating groundwater and developing rules for withdrawal, allocations, etc.,
    whereas irrigation districts are usually responsible for delivering the water
    to the irrigators. For example, in Nebraska, regulations are imposed by NRDs to
    install water meters on the irrigation systems which helps keep a check on producers
    to monitor and/or limit their water withdrawal to the allocated amount with respect
    to the allocated amount. However, these rules and regulations vary in respective
    geographic areas of concern and are decided by the local NRDs according to the
    requirements in the concerned area. In some NRDs, flowmeters are required on all
    wells and/or on new wells, and some NRDs require flowmeters in sub-areas or in
    certain areas, whereas irrigation water allocation/moratorium rule are employed
    by some NRDs. For example in the larger Republican River Basin, Upper, Middle
    and Lower Republican NRDs impose different amount of water allocations (moratoriums).
    Based on the Stakeholders Advisory Committee (2016), the Lower Republican NRD
    (LRNRD) established a moratorium (restriction on the amount of water irrigators
    can pump during a given time) on new irrigation well drilling on December 9, 2002.
    No new irrigation wells have been drilled since that date. District established
    a moratorium on adding new irrigated lands on December 31, 2004. No new irrigated
    land has been added since that date. All groundwater irrigated areas were certified
    in 2004 and all wells were metered by April 1, 2005. The Lower Republican NRD
    has the lowest groundwater allocation in the state. The present allocation is
    230 mm/yr. NRD allocates a 5 year block for 1143 mm and the water may be used
    however the irrigator chooses during that 5 years unless there is an allocation
    cap. NRD allows up to 230 mm to be carried over the end of an allocation period
    to the next allocation period. Unless otherwise provided, imposition of penalties
    for exceeding the allocation amounts shall be at the discretion of the NRD Board
    and may include, but are not limited to: (a) A reduction (in whole or in part)
    of a person’s allocation of groundwater; (b) A reduction (in whole or in part)
    of a person’s certified irrigated acres; and (c) Decommissioning of water wells.
    Penalty for exceeding carry over include deducting 50 mm carryover deducted for
    every inch of carry-over used above 190 mm. The Middle Republican NRD (MRNRD)
    is and will continue to enforce all of the management actions that have been described
    in the handout such as: Moratorium on new irrigation wells and acres; Abiding
    our 4th generation of the Integrated Management Plan; helping producers with programs
    for their irrigated land; implementing allocations and penalties; and much more
    that we have been doing for years already within our district. The MRNRD currently
    has 1524/5-yr allocation rule imposed. In cases when unused amount of water remained
    from the allocated amount, it is carried over to the next allocation cycle. If
    an irrigator has exceeded his/her allocation, the allocation for the next allocation
    period shall be reduced by the number of acre inches, by which said allocation
    was exceeded in the prior period. A penalty of 25.4 mm for every inch over the
    first 76 mm and 50 mm for every mm over 76 mm of overuse will be applied. Moratoriums
    in the Republican River Basin do not consider the cropping pattern grown in a
    given year, although most district has maize-soybean rotation. Based on the Republican
    River Basin-Wide Plan (2018), the Upper Republican NRD (URNRD) has prohibited
    new irrigation wells since 1998. Any replacement irrigation well, replacement
    livestock well, replacement industrial well or replacement public water system
    must be at least 183 m from any domestic well or range livestock well, 805 m from
    a public water supply well, and 305 from any irrigation well, commercial livestock
    well or industrial well. No wells can be connected without prior approval from
    the URNRD. In all three NRDS, any person who violates a cease-and-desist order
    issued by the district pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. §46–707(h) may be subject to
    a civil penalty assessed pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. §46–745. To monitor water
    withdrawal by irrigators, NRD personnel travel long distances and manually read
    the meters installed at the registered wells once a year after the irrigation
    season and record the readings. These readings are used to keep a check on the
    water pumped to keep a sustainable balance between water use and water supply
    which ensures the region’s economic viability, social and environmental health/environmental
    services, safety, and welfare. These practices of manual data collection, though
    effective, are very labor intensive and expensive. It is also subject to human
    error, and annual readings are not enough to provide sufficient information to
    find the relation between the water usage during the crop growing season and crop
    water requirements. Furthermore, these manual readings provide data and information
    only after the season is over and are not effective to make in-season or real
    time monitoring or assessments. Taking totalized readings only once a year after
    the irrigation season does not provide detailed data on how water is used during
    the crop growing season in relation to crop water requirements. This critically
    important need to better assess, forecast and manage water resources can be fulfilled
    by implementing an automated water use monitoring and data collection system which
    can compile, record, and communicate irrigation flow rate/water withdrawal data,
    along with critical site-specific drivers of irrigation water use. Recent developments
    of smart meter technologies that are capable of remotely reading meters in real-time
    and archiving the records in a central database provides great opportunity to
    change the way irrigation water use is monitored and documented. The smart meter
    technology is already being used by public utility providers (electricity, gas,
    domestic water supply) to reduce the expenses of periodic trips to each physical
    location to read a meter. The new technologies transmit hourly water consumption
    data to the city’s billing system by wireless network. This real-time water use
    information allows city’s water managers to monitor water use and detect leaks
    and other issues quickly. Water consumers are also able to view their daily water
    usage data online and learn ways to conserve water. Despite the great potential
    of smart meter to provide reliable and real-time water-use information, the technology
    has not been applied in the management of irrigation water use by irrigation and
    water resources management organizations. Application of this technology in the
    management of the nation’s irrigation water use has several potential benefits
    including reduced cost of data collection, documentation and analyses and real-time
    data for better irrigation management strategies. In addition to irrigation water
    use data, other information such as rainfall, soil moisture and ETc are required
    for management and performance evaluation of irrigation systems. When such data
    are measured by sensors with wireless data transmission capability, it becomes
    possible to automate the collection, documentation, and storage of the data to
    a central database. The timely water use information coupled with analysis can
    give both irrigation managers and farmers better control of water-use. Smart meter
    technologies allow farmers to view their irrigation information through handheld,
    mobile and network technologies via wired or wireless platforms, radio frequency,
    or powerline transmission. In this research, we demonstrated the use of such an
    automated system to analyze irrigation analytics across commercial agricultural
    production fields within an important irrigated crop production region, i.e.,
    Republican River Basin, Nebraska, United States, which is divided into three Natural
    Resources Districts (NRDs) among which MRNRD is the largest and intensively irrigated.
    The largest source of irrigation water in the MRNRD is groundwater with 3000+
    registered wells, and the area is facing significant challenges associated with
    water needs and quality. The objectives of this research were to demonstrate the
    deployment and use of a novel and an automated near real-time water withdrawal
    and use monitoring and data collection system and decipher the complex irrigator
    behavior and pattern of irrigation water use in the region. Specifically, critical
    aspects of regional irrigation are studied such as the start and termination of
    irrigation season, frequency of the irrigation in a crop growing season, and depth
    of irrigation water applied. Finally, irrigation water depths directly observed
    at producer fields were compared and assessed against irrigation requirement estimates
    obtained using viable and scientific methodologies. The irrigator behaviour in
    decision making is assessed against both true irrigation requirements as well
    as water allocation (Moratorium). Such large-scale deployment of technologies
    and extensive water withdrawal and use analyses on large scale production fields
    as well as irrigator behaviors with respect to water allocations are unique and
    have not been studied before. The anticipated benefits from this project are reduced
    cost of data collection, documentation and analyses; real time data availability
    for better irrigation management strategies; improvement in groundwater quality
    from reduced irrigation and reduced chemical leaching potential to water resources;
    and reduced soil erosion from reduced runoff. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Research
    area The Republican River Basin is located along the border of Kansas and Nebraska
    and encompasses portions of three states. The total drainage area sums up to 64,800
    km2 of which 31 % is in northeastern Colorado, 30 % in northwestern Kansas, and
    39 % in southwestern Nebraska (Fig. 1). The drainage area within Nebraska overlaps
    with four Natural Resources Districts (NRDs): Upper Republican, Middle Republican,
    Lower Republican, and Tri-Basin NRD, while smaller areas also overlap with Little
    Blue and Twin Platte NRDs. The area for this research is the MRNRD. The MRNRD
    encompasses all of Hayes, Hitchcock, and Red Willow Counties, most of Frontier,
    and the southern one-third of Lincoln County (Fig. 1). The total land area covered
    by MRNRD is 9950 km2 (995,332 ha) comprising of 53 % of rangeland and 46 % of
    cropland. The major crops in this region are maize, winter wheat, sorghum, and
    soybean. The growing season generally lasts between 150 and 160 days. The major
    soil types in the area are a Coly-Uly and Colby-Ulysses associations of silt loam
    texture, silty Hord, McCook, Hobbs and Valentine and Valent sands in the northwestern
    part. The 30-year normal (1991–2020) annual precipitation and temperature for
    the region are 546 mm and 10.1 °C, respectively (PRISM, 2021). Over 3000 registered
    irrigation wells in the MRNRD (Fig. 1) are required to be equipped with a flowmeter.
    For this research, 31 fields that have well permits were selected for a 3-year
    pilot assessment distributed across MRNRD. Twentysix fields were irrigated with
    center pivots, 3 with gravity (surface) and 2 with subsurface drip- irrigation
    (SDI) (Fig. 1). Geographical details of the research fields are provided in Table

    drip irrigation system fields. 2.2. Instrumentation and data sources 2.2.1. Instrumentation
    and development of irrigation water-use data acquisition system In this research,
    all producer collaborators’ fields were named with their respective irrigation
    method such as center pivot irrigation (P1, P2,…) gravity (furrow) irrigation
    (G1, G2,…) and subsurface drip irrigation (S1, S2,…) (Table 1) to avoid using
    actual producers’ names. These field names were also used in the telemetry and
    online/cloud platforms to protect the identity and privacy of the collaborators.
    The irrigation water-use data acquisition system was designed to automate the
    gathering of irrigation water-use and other information such as rainfall, crop
    type, planting date, ETc and soil moisture data into a central irrigation water
    use database platform. The system uses the most appropriate and cost effective,
    yet advanced satellite telemetry/wireless technology for delivering up to date
    irrigation water flow, soil moisture, ETc, and rainfall data from the sensors
    installed in the field to a central monitoring computer. The components of the
    irrigation water use data acquisition system are shown in Picture 1. All research
    fields were equipped with flowmeters on the irrigation pipelines to measure, record,
    and communicate irrigation flow data every 15 min. The telemetry system allows
    monitoring water withdrawal quantities and enables to set alerts/alarms to indicate
    high or low water withdrawal, which can be concurrently tracked for each field.
    The collected data are processed and output via easy-to-understand graphs showing
    the irrigation water pumped in each farm in relation to water allocation limits,
    crop water use and average irrigation withdrawals of the neighboring farms. Farmers
    can login to the system online using a username and password to view their own
    irrigation water withdrawal data and associated information. Download : Download

    of the irrigation water-use data acquisition system. The research used the existing
    totalizer flowmeters (TFM) installed in the research fields. The flowmeters were
    propeller-type manufactured by McCrometer (Great Plains Meter, Inc., Aurora, NE,
    USA) and have a measurement accuracy of ± 2 % of discharge and repeatability of
    ± 0.25 %. To obtain this accuracy of discharge, we ensured that the TFM were installed
    correctly, following the manufacturer’s specifications. At each selected irrigation
    well, a TFM was installed inline in a full-flowing, acceptable test section of
    pipe on the discharge side of the pump where the measurement of water velocity
    was made (Picture 2). The flowmeter location was in a straight, constant diameter
    length of pipeline without turbulence to prevent obstructions (elbows, valves,
    pumps, and changes in pipe diameter) for a certain distance upstream and downstream
    from the flowmeter installation point. Distances required usually were related
    to the diameter of the discharge pipe at the measurement location. The desired
    distance upstream for the flowmeters without a straightening vane installed was
    10 pipe diameters and for flowmeters with a straightening vane, it was 5 pipe
    diameters. To allow automated flowmeter readings, data logging and telemetry transmission,
    a pulse transmitter unit was installed at the bases of the existing flowmeters
    (Picture 3). The transmitter unit transmits pulses representing irrigation flow
    rate (pulse range: 4–20 mA) to the telemetry unit through a cable. On-site calibration
    was performed for each installed pulse transmitter unit in each field. Download

    and solar panel in the field. The remote telemetry units (RTUs) used in this data
    acquisition system was standalone GPRS stations (Model A755 GPRS SDI-12, Adcon
    Telemetry, Vienna, Austria) (Picture 3). Each station has two input ports and
    was connected through cables to receive data signals from the flowmeter and from
    either rain gauges or atmometers (ETgauge) as needed. Data signals are first stored
    in the memory of an RTU. An RTU has its own intelligence in the form of a built-in
    microcontroller, which periodically performs several tasks. For example, it interrogates
    the sensors, stores the measured data and checks the local battery status continuously.
    RTU is equipped with a GSM modem, which allows for real-time wireless communication
    with a base station. Reverse communication is also possible from the base station.
    The stations were configured to record data with 15 min intervals and set to deliver
    the recorded data to the telemetry gateway at hourly intervals to provide near
    real-time data. The power for the unit comes from an internal NiMH battery which
    is charged using a compact solar panel. Rain gauge (Model RG1 200, McCrometer,
    Inc., Aurora, NE, USA) that was used is compatible with the RTU and has a capacity
    to maintain an accuracy of within 2 % of rainfall up to 60 mm. ETgauge is an ET
    measurement device in the local field conditions. The electronic version of ETgauge
    (Model E, ETgauge Company, Loveland, CO, USA) was used. It has a performance accuracy
    of ± 1 % of evaporated water. The Watermark soil moisture sensors (Irrometer Co.,
    Riverside, CA, USA) were used to measure soil matric potential (kPa) in each field
    and sensors were connected to Watermark monitor/dataloggers (model 900 M, Irrometer
    Co., Riverside, CA, USA) to log soil moisture data on an hourly basis. SMP data
    were converted to soil water content (%vol) using the soil-water retention curves
    developed by Irmak, 2019a, Irmak, 2019b for the research area soils for each field.
    Telemetry Gateway (Model A850, Adcon Telemetry, Austria) was used in the research
    (Picture 3). It forms the core of the data acquisition system as a base station.
    The Gateway acts as a network controller and at regular intervals (typically 15 min,
    but this can be changed) it requests data via modem from the RTUs in the field
    network. The Gateway also stores the incoming data in its memory, allowing it
    to supervise large numbers of RTUs and keep their data for a period of time before
    data are downloaded to a ProServer for long-term storage in a central database
    and for processing. One Telemetry Gateway (Model A850) can handle up to 1000 RTU
    field stations. Communication between the remote telemetry unit and the Telemetry
    Gateway is through cellular communication system''s global system for mobile communication.
    This data acquisition system is run by the addVANTAGE Pro software (Adcon Telemetry,
    Vienna, Austria) which controls various functions in the RTUs and the Gateway
    (Picture 4). The software collects data from the Telemetry Gateways and makes
    it available for viewing or for specialized analysis. The server is responsible
    for downloading data from the Telemetry Gateway, storing into the database, starting
    and stopping raw data processing, and servicing clients as they connect to the
    system. Download : Download high-res image (965KB) Download : Download full-size

    2.2.2. Meteorological data, field-specific measurements of soil matric potential,
    evaporative demand and precipitation Four agricultural weather stations were selected
    for the computation of reference and crop evapotranspiration. For this purpose,
    daily weather data from 2013 to 2015 at Brule Plate Valley, Champion, McCook,
    and Dickens sites were obtained from the High Plains Regional Climatic Center-Automated
    Weather Data Network (HPRCC-AWDN). The meteorological variables included in this
    dataset were maximum and minimum air temperatures, wind speed, relative humidity,
    and incoming shortwave radiation. The magnitudes of average growing season meteorological
    variables recorded at each site for the three growing seasons are presented in
    Table 2. Crop growing season was considered as May 1 to September 20, based on
    the most common historical planting and harvesting dates in the region.SMP in
    each field was measured on an hourly basis using Watermark granular matrix sensors
    installed at four depths in the root zone profile (30, 60, 90 and 120 cm). ETgauges
    were installed in five representative fields for site-specific reference ET measurements,
    designed to simulate ET from plant canopy in a way that closely mimics plant’s
    resistance to ET (Irmak et al., 2005a, Irmak et al., 2005b). Tipping-bucket rain
    gauges were also installed in these five representative fields for site specific
    precipitation data. Geographic Information System (GIS)-based tools were used
    to record, organize, and analyze these datasets geographically within the research
    area. The management practices adopted by individual growers which included crop
    type, acreage and cultivar information (maturity), planting and harvesting dates,
    seeding rate, tillage practices, fertilizer type and application, crop yield,
    etc. were obtained via personal communication with the producer partners. Table

    on the crop grown in the selected fields was obtained through the use of survey
    forms circulated and collected annually. Additionally, the Cropland Data Layer
    (CDL) provided by USDA-NASS was considered as an appropriate tool to collect crop
    type information. The CDL is a raster-based, geo-referenced, crop-specific land
    cover data layer created annually for the continental United States using moderate
    resolution satellite imagery and extensive agricultural ground truthing data.
    CDL-derived crop type data were verified against survey-collected crop type data,
    and a perfect agreement was found for available 51 field-year combinations, ensuring
    confidence in use of CDL data. The total number of fields planted with maize was
    28 (90 %) in 2013; 24 (77 %) in 2014 and 21 (67 %) in 2015; and, soybean was 3
    (10 %) in 2013; 7 (23 %) in 2014 and 7 (23 %) in 2015 (Table 3). Additionally,
    there were 3 (10 %) fields in 2015 cultivated with winter wheat. However, our
    analyses was limited to the fields growing maize and soybean, due to their dominance
    in the region. Table 3. Crops grown in the research fields in 2013, 2014 and 2015,

    reference evapotranspiration The precipitation data were obtained from three sources:
    NOAA-GHCN (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - Global Historical
    Climatology Network), HPRCC-AWDN and NeRAIN (Nebraska Rainfall Assessment and
    Information Network). Among these sources, 101 weather stations in 2013, 99 in
    2014, and 96 in 2015 were selected to determine precipitation depth for spatial
    interpolation. A proportion of the selected weather station sites were outside
    the geographic boundary of the MRNRD, ensuring accurate interpolation along the
    borders. Inverse distance weighing (IDW) interpolation technique was implemented
    for spatial interpolation using the Spatial Analyst Toolset provided in ArcGIS
    10.2 (ArcGIS 10.2, ESRI, Redlands, California). Interpolation resulted in 459
    spatial datasets (rasters) of daily precipitation for the region across the research
    period, which were used to develop monthly and growing season total precipitation
    datasets and field-level daily, monthly and growing-season precipitation were
    extracted using GIS tools. Grass- and alfalfa-reference evapotranspiration (ETo
    and ETr) was estimated using the standardized American Society of Civil Engineers-Environmental
    and Water Resources Institute (ASCE-EWRI) Penman-Monteith (PM) equation (ASCE-EWRI-PM)
    (ASCE-EWRI, 2005). This equation requires four primary meteorological observations:
    air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation: (1) ETref
    = standardized reference crop evapotranspiration (mm d-1). Rn = net radiation
    at the reference surface (MJ m-2 d-1). G = soil heat flux density at the soil
    surface (MJ m-2 d-1, assumed to be zero for daily time step). T = mean daily air
    temperature at 2 m height (°C). u2 = daily wind speed at 2 m height (m s-1). es
    = vapor pressure at 2 m height (kPa). ea = mean actual vapor pressure at 2 m height
    (kPa). es-ea = vapor pressure deficit (VPD, kPa). Δ = slope of the saturation
    vapor pressure-temperature curve (kPa °C-1). γ = psychometric constant (kPa °C-1).
    Cn = constant that changes with the reference crop (1600 and 900 for ETr and ETo,
    respectively). Cd = denominator constant that changes with the reference crop
    (0.38 and 0.34 for ETr and ETo, respectively). Apart from the estimation of reference
    ET, efforts were made to measure reference ETo and data were telemetrically recorded
    at five of the selected fields using ETgauges. In this research, number 30 green
    canvas cover was used to simulate ETo. In order to prepare complete records and
    assess the robustness of ETgauge measurements, intercomparisons between ETgauge-measured
    (at field P2) and ASCE-EWRI-PM-estimated ETo (at Dickens HPRCC weather site) for
    three research years were made (Fig. 2). A strong agreement was observed among
    the measured and estimated ETo with a mean RMSE of 0.99 mm d-1 and R2 ranging
    from 0.78 to 0.88, indicating that estimated ETo can serve as a proxy for the
    measured ETo (or vice versa) with good accuracy for research fields/locations
    where ETgauges could not be deployed for more local reference ET measurements.

    grass-reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and atmometer-measured ETo for the experimental
    locations in 2013, 2014 and 2015 growing seasons. The solid black line represents
    1:1 relationship. 2.5. Crop evapotranspiration ETc is the product of ETo and crop
    coefficient (Kc) (Eq. (2)), which is determined according to the crop type and
    the crop growth stage: (2) ETc = crop evapotranspiration (mm d-1). ETo= grass-reference
    evapotranspiration (mm d-1). Kc = crop coefficient. Kc differs for the different
    growth stages of the crop as well as varies with climate, soil, crop type and
    varieties, irrigation methods and management practices. The crop growth is generally
    divided into four stages: initial stage, crop-developmental stage, mid-season
    stage and late season stage. In this research, the crop coefficient curves (maize
    and soybean) were used as the function of days after planting (DAP) as shown in
    Fig. 3. These curves were measured and developed by the senior author (S. Irmak)
    in Nebraska as a part of the Nebraska Water and Energy Flux Measurement, Modeling
    and Research Network (NEBFLUX; Irmak, 2010) project. Developed polynomial equations
    were used in this research to calculate Kc values. For maize, the Kc values were
    0.15–0.20 in the initial stage and extended up to 1.02 in the mid-season (July),
    again reducing to 0.48 in the late season. For soybean, the Kc values start with
    0.20, increasing up to 0.94 in July and decreasing to 0.28 in the late season.
    The Kc values reported in Fig. 3 are generally within the range of values reported
    in the literature. Sharma and Irmak (2012a) used the same crop coefficient equations
    to determine long term (1986–2009) growing season (1 May to 30 September) ETc
    and net irrigation requirements. The actual plating dates were used for the fields
    for which the actual producer-reported data were available, which resulted in
    better field-specific estimations. Download : Download high-res image (168KB)

    requirement for each field site was calculated using a soil-water balance equation:
    (3) P = precipitation (mm). I = irrigation water requirement (mm). U = upward
    soil moisture flux (mm; assumed zero as the depth of the groundwater is approximately
    33 m below the surface). Ron = surface run-on (mm; assumed zero). Roff = surface
    run-off (mm). D = deep percolation (mm) below the crop root zone. ΔSWS = change
    in soil water storage in the soil profile (mm) from the beginning to the end of
    the season. ETc = crop evapotranspiration. Total soil-water storage (SWS) was
    calculated for the effective root zone depth which was considered as 1.20 m for
    both maize and soybean. Predominant soil textural classes in selected fields were
    silt loam, loamy sand, sandy loam, and sand in 12, 4, 9, and 6 fields, respectively.
    The soil-water characteristic equations (Irmak, 2019a, Irmak, 2019b) were used
    to convert soil matric potential (SMP, kPa) to volumetric water content (VWC,
    %vol) for each soil and are presented below: (4) (5) (6) (7) The surface run-off
    from each field was estimated using the USDA-NRCS curve number method (USDA-NRCS,
    1985). There were four different soil textures as discussed above and the maize
    and soybean were considered as straight row crops with good hydrologic condition.
    Curve number value for the sandy loam, loamy sand, and sand was used as 67. For
    silt loam, it was considered as 78. All calculations were done seasonally at each
    field site by solving Eq. (8) to calculate the irrigation water requirement (I)
    required for each field individually in each season: (8) 3. Results and discussions
    3.1. Precipitation The magnitudes of mean growing season precipitation across
    the MRNRD for the years 2013–2015 are presented in Fig. 4. Growing season precipitation
    varied from 295 to 593 mm across the research region. The year 2013 was the driest
    with mean precipitation of 301 mm across all the research fields. The mean precipitation
    amounts in 2014 and 2015 were 423 mm and 418 mm, respectively. Maximum precipitation
    was recorded in field S3 (345 mm) in 2013, field P26 (546 mm) in 2014, and field
    G3 (508 mm) in 2015. The fields (G1, G2, G3, P16, P17, P23, P24, P25) with higher
    mean precipitation occurring in Frontier County, which lies in the eastern part
    of MRNRD (Fig. 4). Fields P26 and S1 lie in Red Willow County (southeastern part
    of MRNRD) and received highest precipitation in 2014. Fig. 5 presents the precipitation

    3.2. Initiation, termination and length of irrigation season One of the most important
    decision in irrigation application is the onset and termination of the irrigation
    season. The start of irrigation in a season usually depends on the antecedent
    moisture availability in the soil profile and crop growth stage. The last irrigation
    of the season depends on the maturity stage of the crop, soil-water availability
    in the soil profile and evaporative demand. Since these factors are subject to
    change both spatially and temporally, it is expected that the timing of first
    and last irrigation events would also vary in different fields. Primarily, these
    dates depend on the management practices of the irrigator as well as the planting
    date and climate conditions. The planting dates varied from April 26 to May 21
    between the research fields. The first and last irrigation in a season was tracked
    from the data communicated via the telemetry system for all three years. Fig.
    6, Fig. 7 show the first and last irrigation, respectively, represented as days
    after planting (DAP). It was observed that the first irrigation varied from 4
    to 82 DAP (Fig. 6). In 2013, 55 % (6 out of 11) producers irrigated from 50 to
    60 DAP. 27 % of them irrigated from 41 to 44 DAP whereas two of them (fields P15
    and S1) irrigated at 70 and 82 DAP, respectively. In 2014, three of them were
    irrigating at 45, 46 and 47 DAP, respectively. Field P26 was irrigated 4 DAP which
    was very early in the season whereas field P16 was irrigated on 65 DAP. In 2015,
    eight fields were irrigated first time on 38–54 DAP and the gravity field G1 was
    irrigated on 67 DAP. Similarly, the last day of irrigation was also observed for
    the same fields. The last day of irrigation in all the three years ranged from
    112 (field G2) to 141 (field P3) DAP (Fig. 7), which is a duration of 49 days.
    Almost 90 % of the fields in 2013 terminated irrigations between 118 and 136 DAP,
    with the exception of field G2 in which irrigation was terminated 112 DAP. In
    2014, the range was between 114 DAP and 135 DAP. In 2015, 78 % of the fields terminated
    irrigation season between 125 DAP to 131 DAP whereas fields P1 and P3 applied
    their last irrigation on 137 and 141 DAP respectively (Fig. 7). Download : Download

    of irrigation application in all the thirty-one fields. Length of irrigation season,
    defined as the total number of days that water was pumped for the purpose of irrigation
    in a season. The number of fields selected in this analysis were 25 in 2013, 25
    in 2014, and 22 in 2015 from the common period (May 1 to September 20) in all
    three years. The maximum and minimum length of irrigation season was observed
    in SDI-irrigated field S3 (86 days in 2015) and gravity field G2 (14 days in 2014)
    respectively (Fig. 8). A significant difference was observed in the length of
    irrigation season among the selected fields demonstrating the role of management
    practices, climatic variables, and irrigator’s decision-making in irrigation application.
    For example, In field S3, the length of irrigation season in 2015 was quite high
    as compared with 2013 and 2014 which increased the irrigation depth applied in
    2015. However, the precipitation was 32 mm higher in 2015 than in 2013 and was
    61 mm lower than in 2014. Hence, it was observed that precipitation timing or
    amount likely has little impact on the irrigator’s decision making. Instead, the
    observed differences in the initiation, termination, and length of irrigation
    season across fields that were even planted within the same time frame (last week
    of April to the first week of May) demonstrates the role of individual decision-making
    of the irrigator. This can vary almost arbitrarily across irrigators, most likely
    due to their time-share among other activities on the farm, such as fertilizer
    application, pesticide applications, fungicide application, tillage, and other
    soil and crop management practices. Download : Download high-res image (203KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. The length of irrigation season in
    all 31 research fields. 3.3. Frequency distribution of irrigation applications
    In the research region, the crop planting dates usually range from the last week
    of April to the first week of May. Most producers planting at the same date with
    same or similar varieties would also need to irrigate at the same time, especially
    the ones experiencing the same distribution of precipitation and evaporative demand.
    Simultaneous irrigation application by a high proportion of producers not only
    results in high water abstractions from the aquifer, but also increases the energy
    demand at that particular time. It remains crucial to determine the peak water
    demand and its timing in a particular region for efficient allocation by the authorities.
    Fig. 9 shows the percentage of irrigation systems operating during each month
    of the growing season. It was observed that July and August were the months when
    the highest number of irrigation systems (70–90 %) were operational in all three
    years. However, in September, which is the last month of the growing season, 71
    %, 45 % and 61 % of the systems were operating in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.
    The lowest number of irrigation systems that was in operation was in May due to
    early crop growth not requiring supplemental moisture other than contribution
    from stored crop root zone moisture from spring precipitation. In fact, there
    were no irrigation systems operating in 2013 in May and a small percentage in
    2014 (23 %) and even smaller percentage (16 %) in 2015. On average of three years,
    most of the precipitation occurred in May (104 mm) and June (109 mm) and lowest
    occurred in July (55 mm), August (80 mm) and September (34 mm) when plant leaf
    area index and consequently, ETc rates are the highest. Download : Download high-res

    systems operating in each month of the growing season from the selected thirty-one
    systems. 3.4. Depth of irrigation applied The irrigation systems selected for
    irrigation depth calculations were 25 in 2013, 25 in 2014, and 22 in 2015. The
    information on crop type in each field and each season is presented in Table 3.
    The total water depths applied by all individual irrigators in each season are
    shown in Fig. 10 along with the mean annual allocated (moratorium) irrigation
    depth (black line) by MRNRD. The irrigation amount allocated to each irrigator
    in MRNRD is 1524 mm per five years or a annual mean allocated depth of 305 mm,
    assuming uniform annual distribution. There were considerable differences in irrigation
    applications between the fields for the same crop type and between the years for
    the same fields. In 2013, nine of the 25 CP fields were irrigated by approximately
    300 mm or more, approaching the mean allocated depth. Gravity system fields were
    irrigated considerably more than the CP fields by about 90 mm in 2013. Field P9
    was irrigated with 386 mm, which was the only CP field irrigated significantly
    higher than its neighbors as well as more than the annually allocated irrigation
    depth in 2013. However, about 40 % of the selected fields were irrigated less
    than 200 mm in 2013. The irrigation depth in gravity system field G2 was reduced
    to 345 mm in 2014 and 307 mm in 2015 as compared with 391 mm in 2013. However,
    in field G1, the irrigation was increased to 415 mm in 2015 as compared with 390 mm
    in 2013. In the CP fields in 2014, the irrigation depth was almost equal or more
    than the previous year. Field P9, P5 and P10 were irrigated the most with 398,
    375 and 352 mm, respectively, in 2014. In 2015, irrigation depth in field P1 was
    about 500 mm, which was considerably higher than the previous two years and all
    other selected fields. However, most of the systems irrigated around or less than
    300 mm in contrast to the field P9 for which the irrigation depth was around 400 mm
    in all the three consecutive years (Fig. 10). In SDI fields S1 and S3, the irrigation
    depth was 164 and 199 mm in 2013, and 208 and 195 mm in 2014, respectively, which
    was considerably less than the gravity and center pivot fields. There was no difference
    observed in irrigation depth due to the crop type planted in the research fields.
    The average irrigation depth was observed to be 243, 264 and 284 mm in 2013, 2014
    and 2015, respectively. There were 40 % of fields each year exceeding the mean
    annual allocated irrigation depth threshold. Download : Download high-res image

    irrigation depth by MRNRD, assuming uniform annual distribution of 1524 mm allocation
    per five years. 3.5. Evaporative demand and crop evapotranspiration (ETc) Daily
    ETr values in the growing period (April 27 to September 20) for each year are
    presented in Fig. 11. Daily ETr values of all the four stations were observed
    to be very similar to each other and the variability observed in seasonal ETr
    was not higher than the inter-annual variability observed at an individual site,
    indicating that ETr did not vary substantially across the MRNRD. Since computation
    of reference ET requires extensive climate data measurements and the region did
    not have adequate number/density of these measurement sites, the computation of
    field-scale ETr was not carried out. The black line in Fig. 11 represents the
    average ETr values of all four stations for the three consecutive growing seasons.
    The growing season total ETr for 2013, 2014 and 2015 was 1175, 1005 and 958 mm,
    respectively. The most probable reasons for the higher ETr in 2013 can be the
    warmer air temperatures, higher solar radiation, higher wind speed, higher vapor
    pressure deficit and lower relative humidity as compared with 2014 and 2015 (Table
    2). Download : Download high-res image (999KB) Download : Download full-size image

    along with standard deviation among the thirty-one fields for three research years
    is presented in Fig. 12. For maize, the growing season total ETc ranged from 676
    to 756 mm in 2013; 615–659 mm in 2014; and 608–624 mm in 2015 with an average
    of 733, 648 and 621 mm in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. For soybean, the
    growing season total ETc ranged from 629 to 680 mm in 2013; 535–597 mm in 2014;
    and 544–571 mm in 2015 with an average of 663, 577 and 560 mm in 2013, 2014 and
    2015, respectively. On average, maize ETc was 10 % higher than the soybean ETc
    in all three years, similar to the results found in Sharma and Irmak (2012b) for
    the long-term (1986–2009) large-scale assessments for MRNRD area. ETc in 2013
    was relatively higher than in 2014 and 2015 for both crops. The average ETc for
    maize in 2013 was 85 mm and 112 mm higher than those determined for 2014 and 2015,
    respectively. For soybean, average ETc was 86 mm and 103 mm higher in 2013 than
    in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The ETc variations observed within the fields
    were primarily due to the differences in the planting dates and the crop type
    as other parameters/variables were similar for all fields. Download : Download

    vs. producers’ actual application The actual irrigation depth applied for each
    field was compared to the computed irrigation water requirements as estimated
    using two-step approach and the soil-water balance (Fig. 13) that used information
    and data obtained specifically for each field. In 2013, irrigation requirement
    was greater than irrigation applied in all fields, except field G2. In 2014 and
    2015, irrigation applied exceeded the irrigation water requirements in 80 % of
    the fields. There were three fields in 2014 and in 2015, where irrigation requirement
    was more than actual amount of irrigation water applied. On average, irrigation
    requirement in maize fields were 394, 242 and 184 mm in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively,
    whereas the average amount of irrigation water withdrawal was 267, 292 and 264 mm
    in the same years, respectively. Similarly, irrigation requirement in soybean
    fields was 307, 163 and 219 mm in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, whereas the
    average amount of water pumped was 234, 251 and 274 mm in the same years, respectively.
    It is observed that on average, maize irrigation requirement was 61 % and 47 %
    in 2014 and 2015, respectively, as compared with 2013 whereas irrigation applied
    was 109 % and 99 % in 2014 and 2015, respectively, as compared with 2013. Similarly,
    soybean irrigation requirement was 53 % and 71 % in 2014 and 2015, respectively,
    as compared with 2013 whereas irrigation applied was 107 % and 117 % in 2014 and
    2015, respectively, as compared with 2013. The inter-annual variation in irrigation
    requirement was substantial, but it was relatively insignificant in irrigation
    application. Given the same site characteristics, irrigation requirement is mostly
    affected by environmental factors such as evaporative water demand (vapor pressure
    deficit), precipitation and stored soil-water. The magnitudes of these variables
    were considerably different between the three years which govern the magnitude
    of irrigation requirement. Ideally, the changes in irrigation requirement should
    be reflected in irrigation application by producers, provided that continuous
    and appropriate monitoring of soil moisture and/or crop water use is performed
    as these metrics will respond to the various factors governing plant water uptake.
    In contrast to this, our observations of irrigation application show that most
    producers did not consider following any established irrigation scheduling approach,
    resulting in suboptimal (greater or lower) amount of water being applied to their
    fields. For example, field P10 was under-irrigated (by 78 mm) in 2013 while it
    was over-irrigated by 70 mm in 2014 and by 105 mm in 2015. Field P3 was under-irrigated
    by 210, 104 and 35 mm in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. SDI-irrigated field
    S3 was under-irrigated by 170 mm in 2013 whereas it was over-irrigated by 73 and
    42 mm in 2014 and 2015, respectively, indicating the need for implementing agricultural
    water management technologies and associated educational programs, training and
    demonstrations to enable optimum use of limited water resources and enhance crop
    water productivity. Download : Download high-res image (863KB) Download : Download

    Solid bars represent maize fields and bars with dashed diagonal lines represent
    soybean fields. 3.7. Applied irrigation water vs. water allocation Fig. 14 shows
    the cumulative amount of water pumped in each field in three years along with
    the allocated water per five years as well as an annual mean allocated water,
    assuming uniform distribution of 305 mm per year. There were few fields that pumping
    more irrigation water than allocated in 2013, which increased in 2014. There were
    seven fields in 2015 which crossed the 3rd year mean allocated amount, with the
    field P9 almost pumping the fourth-year allocated amount. According to the trend
    observed in Fig. 14, it is expected that a reasonable proportion of fields would
    have exceeded the five-year allocated water depth in the region. Nevertheless,
    70 % of the producers applied irrigation water well within their restricted water
    allocations. If producers pumped more than 305 mm of water per year for multiple
    years, they risk consuming their 5-year allocation sooners, which also risks not
    having enough (or any) water available for crop production in the 4th and/or 5th
    year, which can have significant negative consequences to farm income. Thus, implementing
    scientifically-based water management technologies and strategies to account for
    stored soil moisture and effective use of precipitation as well as implanting
    effective soil management practices (e.g., reduced till or no-till) can aid not
    only increasing crop water productivity, but can aid in ensuring the total allocated
    water amount can be used appropriately in a given year. Download : Download high-res

    conclusions Field-specific irrigation water withdrawal and use data are essential
    for effective agricultural water management and for development of policies and
    regulations governing the use of water, predicting changes in water demand in
    response to changing climatic conditions, cropping systems and irrigation management
    scenarios. Good decision-making in irrigation water management is dependent upon
    data that can provide real-time information about crop water needs, irrigation
    applications, crop growth and development stage and weather patterns. Irrigation
    water-use data are also used to more effectively manage finite groundwater supplies
    in regions where surface and groundwater supplies are either over-appropriated
    (demand exceeds supply) or fully-appropriated (demand are supply are critically
    equal). The field-specific automated irrigation water use monitoring and data
    collection system deployed in this research provide real-time and site-specific
    metrics reflecting irrigation analytics and irrigator behavior throughout the
    growing season. Various metrics calculated from the obtained datasets such as
    initiation, termination, and length (duration) of irrigation season, irrigation
    application frequency and irrigation depth show that there can be substantial
    farm-to-farm heterogeneity even within relatively small irrigated regions. Thus,
    it is challenging to robustly benchmark regional water footprint and irrigator
    behavior across larger scales owing to the high degree of farm-to-farm variability,
    unaccounted variables (irrigation vs. other farm operations) that are used (or
    not used) for decision-making by irrigators. Surprisingly, it was also observed
    that irrigation depths estimated using scientifically-based and widely used procedures
    such as the two-step approach of computing ETc and site-specific soil-water balance
    showed little agreement with actual applied irrigation depths by the producers.
    Only few farms followed the trend of year-to-year and farm-to-farm variation captured
    in estimated irrigation depths. Monitoring and accounting for farm-specific evaporative
    demand, soil moisture and precipitation amounts did not lead to accurate representation
    of irrigator decisions. This observation is strong evidence that irrigation decisions
    by users are not backed by data and scientific protocols, and are largely driven
    by condition of crop, feel of soil, personal calendar schedule, neighbor practices,
    or no irrigation management protocol at al. Despite increase in technologies that
    can be used for agricultural water management decision-making, in this research,
    irrigator decisions did not seem to reasonably follow patterns of water use metrics
    like soil moisture and/or crop water use or evaporative demand. Thus, standard
    estimations of crop water footprint should be carefully assessed prior to representing
    actual water use across large regions. Our observations demonstrate the need for
    greater momentum for real-time monitoring of farm-level irrigation dynamics and
    their integrative reporting. Advances in Internet of Things (IoT) can be leveraged
    to connect these data-streams to effectively report, privately or publicly host,
    and utilize quantitative information on irrigation water use and irrigation behavior
    across agroecosystems. Automated water dynamics system deployed in this research
    can aid in more effectively planning and managing the quantity and distribution
    of limited water resources, especially in regions with pumping allocations. Declaration

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Greater Noida, India SECTION I. Introduction
    Both the quantity and the caliber of the food consumers want have risen, requiring
    the modernization of farmland and intricate industrial processes. Several cutting-edge
    agricultural concepts are emerging thanks to the booming Internet of Things (IoT)
    business. By connecting research organizations and medical organizations to the
    Internet of Things, that expands its scope and quickens its response time, many
    farms may get period and commodities. The aforementioned systems engage in interactions,
    detection, and linkage with embedded technology originating from both domestic
    and foreign sources, thereby constituting a constituent element of the Internet
    of Things [1]. A landslip likelihood monitoring gadget has been invented with
    a particular layout, allowing for rapid deployment in challenging environments,
    rather than relying on consumer input [2]. The company provides a standardized
    device for the IoT that visually displays variables such as air quality, soil
    moisture, atmospheric conditions, and liquid levels over a wide geographical area
    shown in Figure 1. IoT also creates precise, true representations of a number
    of ambient parameters, such as sound levels and harmful nuclear layers, & environmental
    damage of the water, air, & environment [3]. Reduced use of fertilizers and pesticides
    on crops, accuracy farming, & smart farming are all examples of recommended [4].
    sans asking for the consumer ''s feedback. This device provides a means of authority
    for the Internet of Things (IoT) and offers a visual representation of various
    parameters such as weather, soil conditions, climate, and liquid levels across
    a broad geographical region. The Internet of Things (IoT) generates accurate and
    up-to-date depictions of various environmental factors, including sound levels,
    water and air pollution, temperature fluctuations, and potentially harmful levels
    of radiation [3]. It is recommended to implement targeted agricultural practices
    and employ clever farming techniques, such as reducing the use of pesticides and
    fertilizers on crops, to mitigate the risks associated with runoff, contaminants,
    and environmental changes. Fig. 1. Traditional agricultural [52] building built
    on IOT Show All A. Remedies to issues Regarding IT architecture, there needs to
    be a wide range of bundles with accessible, transparent, & adaptable open architectural
    options. All farms must finish a basic standard in order to utilize Internet of
    things. It is essential to expand information the about Agro-Tech culture if we
    want it to become a worldwide phenomenon. This aspect must be started and progressively
    expanded with the government''s permission in order to build a safe not illegal
    activity [5]. Remarkably superior crops must also be maintained, precise animal
    development must also be done, and distinct cereals, critters, and crops must
    always be conserved, personal ring of relations agriculture must be practiced,
    & organic agriculture must be practiced. [6]. The article presents notable improvements
    to the field of IoT farming. The second section provides an account of the historical
    development of IoT farm technological advances. In Section 3, the administration
    of smart farms based on the Internet of Things (IoT) is presented. Section 4 presents
    the categorization for smart farming. The significant advantages of utilizing
    the Internet of Things (IOT) technology in precision agriculture are enumerated
    in the subsequent sections. Part 6 of the study scrutinizes the issues and unresolved
    queries pertaining to IoT-driven intelligent agriculture from diverse perspectives.
    The findings of this inquiry have been succinctly outlined in Section 7, located
    at the conclusion of this document. SECTION II. Literature Review To increase
    production while reducing labour expenses, researchers have created a variety
    of Internet-of-Things-based fully horticultural gadgets. Scientists have been
    working on certain IoT-based totally agricultural initiatives to boost the company''s
    overall efficiency and quality. From the books, certain IoT-based totally agrarian
    techniques were found and compiled in this article [7]. Explains an entirely aquaponics
    security system that uses WSNs and has parts for monitoring CO2, wetness, temps,
    and illumination. To improve productivity, a real-time gadget for viewing rice
    yield was developed. explains an agricultural monitoring system that uses rain
    and thermometer data to monitor fields, reduce crop failure, and boost productivity.
    [8] An inexpensive Wi-Fi gadget with a microcomputer that notwithstanding serves
    as a meteorology station for tracking farm parameters including temperatures is
    indicated by this term. Potential downsides today include the equipment'' short
    spoken connectivity as well as the requirement for measuring system through Wi-Fi
    connectivity to smart phones. A pressure-detecting ZigBee-based, fully advanced
    sensor platforms, humidity, sunlight, and temperature has been developed by [9].
    To measure environmental elements like temperature and moisture while providing
    alternatives for crop and soil monitoring that are both inexpensive and quick,
    a system built the stack of GSM with FPGA was selected [10]. Provides a low-cost,

    The necessity for agricultural modernization and in-depth manufacturing strategies
    has expanded because the call for meals has expanded in phrases of each first-rate
    and quantity. The Internet of Things (IoT) enterprise is booming, and it is bringing
    a flood of recent agricultural principles to the forefront. By connecting to the
    Internet of Things, studies institutes and clinical societies can enlarge its
    attain and speed, imparting era and commodities to a number of agricultural areas.
    As a part of the Internet of Things, those systems interact, detect, and hyperlink
    with inner and outside country embedded technology [1]. A custom-constructed landslide
    chance tracking device has been advanced, which lets in for fast implementation
    in antagonistic environments without requiring user input [2]. The affords an
    Internet of Things (IoT) control device that video display units'' variables which
    include wind, soil, atmosphere, and water over a huge area. IoT additionally creates
    exact, actual-time maps of quite a number environmental characteristics, consisting
    of noise levels, air, water, and temperature pollution, and perilous radiation
    levels [3]. Precision agriculture, clever agriculture, and crop use of fewer insecticides
    and fertilisers will all assist to decrease leaching hazards, pollution, and weather
    alternate consequences [4]. A. Problem Solutions In terms of IT design, a variety
    of open architecture answers for cost-effective, interoperable, and scalable packages
    have to be available. All farmers have to acquire loose education to help them
    apprehend the way to use IoT devices. It is vital to elevate know-how of Agro-Tech
    subculture everywhere in the international so as for it to grow. In order to construct
    a secure and felony practise, in addition to start and progressively broaden this
    aspect [5], the authorities must approve it. Smart Farming is an exciting idea
    that revolves round farm control the usage of the cutting-edge IoT gadgets to
    enhance product best and amount at the same time as lowering the quantity of human
    labour required. Individual plants/animals/plants have to be kept, extremely good
    plants maintained, cattle farming practised, precise animals bred, own circle
    of relatives farming practised, and natural farming practised [6]. Fig. 1. Classical
    iot based agriculture architecture Show All The following are the contributions
    of this paper to the IoT agriculture domain. The background of IoT agriculture
    technology is presented in Section 2. The IoT-based smart agriculture management
    is presented in Section 3. The taxonomy of smart agriculture is presented in Section
    4. We offer an overview of the major benefits of IOT in smart agriculture in Section
    5. Challenges and Open issues and of IoT-based smart agriculture have been examined
    from a range of viewpoints in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 summarises the findings
    of this study. SECTION II. Literature Survey A variety of Internet-of- Things-primarily
    based totally agricultural devices were evolved via way of means of researchers
    to increase yield whilst decreasing labour costs. Researchers have laboured on
    some of IoT-primarily based totally agriculture tasks in try and enhance the industry''s
    exceptional and production. From the literature in this issue, certain IoT -primarily
    based totally agricultural strategies were exposed and summarised. Fig. 2. Survey
    of iot based smart agriculture Show All A WSN-primarily based totally polyhouse
    tracking machine with carbon dioxide, humidity, temperature, and mild detecting
    modules is defined in [7]. To raise productivity, a real-time rice crop tracking
    machine become developed. Describes a crop tracking machine for stopping crop
    loss and growing manufacturing via way of means of accumulating and analysing
    rainfall and temperature data. [8] Indicates a low-value Bluetooth-primarily based
    totally system with a microcontroller that still serves as a climate station for
    tracking agricultural variables like temperature. The machine''s constrained verbal
    exchange range, in addition to the requirement for common tracking thru Bluetooth
    reference to cell phones, also are disadvantages. [9] has advanced a ZigBee-primarily
    based totally clever sensing platform that may come across pressure, humidity,
    sunlight and temperature. A system was based on GSM and FPGA''s Array has been

    Offers a low-cost, simple, and adaptable networking system that monitors various
    greenhouse conditions using a fuzzy control technique. For a more sophisticated
    surveillance and operation control in the conservatory, the operation and design
    approaches for WSN have already been described in [12]. Sustainability issues
    like as WSN material regulation, wireless node packing, and electromagnetic influence
    have all been managed. [14] Devised a method for monitoring an animal''s health
    and identifying common diseases, whether induced by biological or natural factors.
    SECTION III. Iot-Based Smart Agriculture Management Agriculture is being revolutionised
    through the Internet of Things, that''s giving farmers with a different series
    of equipment to address loads of problems they confront at the farm. Growers can
    access their farmland from practically anywhere & everywhere and whatever time
    through sensors and actuators, and Wi-Fi sensor networks are utilised to display
    the farm. With IoT-enabled solutions, crop manufacturing fees may be reduced whilst
    land productiveness is raised [15]. Fig. 3. Role of iot based smart agriculture
    Show All A. Water Management The particular quantity of water required in greenhouses
    is a vital challenge [16]. The sensors are utilized to show the quantity of liquid
    with inside the reservoir, and the facts is put away to the cloud using smartphone
    app. In standard irrigation structures, as much as 50% of this water is misplaced
    because of over-watering as a result of shortcomings in cutting-edge irrigation
    strategies and structures [17]. B. Irrigation Management It is responsible for
    the design, improvement, operation, and management of irrigation structures. Weather
    and soil situations may be used to enhance a farmer''s irrigation gadget in some
    of ways [18]. Shrewd water system structures endured the Internet of Things use
    field-conveyed sensors to tune soil properties, meteorological and climatic circumstances,
    and water system boundaries [19]. C. Soil Management Numerous soil factors, including
    pH and moisture content, have to be decided for soil control. These metrics may
    be without difficulty computed with the assist of IoT devices. Moisture and humidity
    sensors are used to maintain music of the soil''s moisture level [51]. The consequences
    of a soil trying out take a look at survey assist farmers beautify crop yield
    via way of means of recommending fertilisation choices [20]. Furthermore, via
    way of means of using IoT era to come across dirty soil, the sector is blanketed
    from over-fertilization and crop damage. D. Weather Management Many key components
    are blended to hold and construct a perfect habitat for flora at the same time
    as adhering to strict rules, together with ventilation, temperature, CO2, and
    oxygen levels. This may be facilitated through organising an IoT-enabled environment
    wherein clever sensors and devices speak statistics as a way to decorate decision-making
    [21]. E. Precision Farming Physical inspection changed into a conventional farming
    method for growing manufacturing and maintaining crops, and if a hassle arose,
    it changed into typically addressed after a sizeable farm event, and it changed
    into completed on a trial-and-mistakes basis. The use of IoT in agriculture might
    drastically growth operational efficiency [22]. F. Nutrient Management The method
    of creating the high-satisfactory use of agricultural vitamins even as additionally

    of wise IoT control framework to discover and adjust every node [49]. Current
    gateways and protocols could must assist a huge range of IoT gadgets/nodes, for
    example, Sigfox helps 106 nodes. Networking Issue The connectivity among several
    sensor nodes in clever agriculture poses a huge task. Sensors do good sized computations
    that want a variety of strength, but sensor batteries are limited. As a result,
    in mild of environmental problems and rural locations, the best and strong generation
    for records transmission may be chosen [50]. Cost Several cost-associated demanding
    situations exist whilst the use of IoT in agriculture, consisting of setup and
    jogging prices. Hardware expenditures, consisting of IoT, gateways, devices/sensors,
    and base station infrastructure are covered within side the setup prices. Furthermore,
    operational prices consist of an ongoing subscription for IoT tool administration,
    records sharing, and different offerings, in addition to centralised offerings
    that offer information/records collecting [50]. SECTION VII. Conclusion This article
    provides a comprehensive overview of the literature that consists of a dialogue
    of cutting-edge tremendous studies articles on IoT -primarily based totally agriculture.

    Location: Shah Alam, Malaysia Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Agriculture
    is an important sector in Malaysia, contributing significantly to the country’s
    economy and food security. Because urbanization, industrialization, and climate
    change have increased competition for water resources, water conservation is critical
    for sustainable agriculture [1]. Excessive water use in agriculture can harm the
    ecosystem. Over-irrigation can cause water logging, which depletes soil oxygen
    levels and harms plant growth. Furthermore, improper irrigation practices can
    contribute to soil erosion and runoff, contaminating water and nutrient loss [2].
    Water conservation and the use of effective irrigation systems can help to mitigate
    these environmental effects. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a networked system
    of interconnected objects, sensors, and computer systems collaborating to complete
    preprogrammed tasks [3]. IoT is making inroads into agriculture, with several
    techniques for implementing smart irrigation, such as humidity and soil moisture
    sensors (SMS) [4]. IoT-enabled irrigation systems can control irrigation processes
    automatically based on sensor data and specified criteria. For example, when soil
    moisture falls below a given level, the system can automatically activate irrigation
    to maintain optimal moisture conditions. This automation lowers manual involvement,
    improves accuracy, and ensures timely water application, which results in more
    effective water consumption. Irrigation involves artificially applying water to
    agricultural land for crop production. The amount of water needed for the soil
    depends on soil moisture and temperature. The effectiveness of irrigation plays
    a significant role in the entire growth process, and using modern technology for
    automation in irrigation systems can lead to improved irrigation management [5].
    Typically, irrigation systems have been operated manually using traditional techniques.
    However, there is a potential to replace these methods with automated irrigation
    approaches to ensure efficient and effective water usage. In the past, farmers
    would personally oversee the irrigation process in their fields. However, with
    the increasing demands of managing agricultural activities and other occupations,
    sensor-based automated irrigation systems offer a promising solution by eliminating
    the requirement for the farmer’s presence during the irrigation process. The paper
    is structured as follows. Section II presents the literature review covering related
    work. Section III thoroughly explains the research methodology for developing
    the prototype. Section IV presents the results and discussion, while Section V
    concludes with the findings and future research directions. SECTION II. Literature
    Review Water is a precious and invaluable resource, essential for sustaining life
    and maintaining the balance of ecosystems. Among its diverse applications, agriculture
    emerges as one of the foremost water consumers on a global scale. According to
    the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [6], the agricultural
    sector accounts for 70% of the total freshwater usage worldwide. This statistic
    underscores agricultural water consumption’s profound impact on the planet’s water
    resources. Unfortunately, the problem of inadequate water availability presents
    a significant obstacle in various parts of the world, intensifying the urgency
    for efficient approaches to water management yearly [7]. In this particular situation,
    the considerable water requirements of agriculture emerge as a primary element
    aggravating the overall challenge of water scarcity. Resolving this matter requires
    examining and adopting inventive measures to enhance water utilization in farming
    methods. An irrigation system supplies controlled amounts of water to crops, gardens,
    or landscapes to support plant growth and maintain optimal soil moisture levels
    [8]. It involves the artificial application of water to compensate for natural
    rainfall deficiencies or to supplement existing water sources. Irrigation systems
    are designed to distribute water efficiently and effectively, ensuring that plants
    receive the required amount of water without excessive waste or runoff. A control
    system is used to regulate the operation of the irrigation system. It may include
    manual or automated controls for turning the system on or off, adjusting flow
    rates, and setting irrigation schedules [9]. A. Strengths and Weaknesses of the
    Existing Systems Some of the current smart crop watering or irrigation systems
    include Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller, RainMachine, Gardena Smart System,
    Orbit B-hyve Smart Watering System and Netro Smart Sprinkler Controller. Table
    I shows some of the strengths and weaknesses of the abovementioned systems. TABLE
    I Strengths and Weaknesses of the Existing Systems B. Features Comparison between
    the Existing System A thorough review of the existing systems has been made. Comparisons
    based on the listed features are shown in Table II. The elements covered are how
    the data are gathered, water distribution uniformity, labour requirement, cost-effectiveness,
    and potential for automation and remote monitoring. TABLE II Features Comparison
    Between the Existing Systems Based on the table, the Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller
    and RainMachine have some differences in sensor options, with Rachio offering
    more sensor options with rain, soil, and flow sensors. The Orbit B-Hyve Smart
    Watering System uses local weather data and forecasts to delay or change the watering
    schedule. The Netro Smart Sprinkler Controller offers a touchscreen with basic
    on-device controls and support for 16 zones. In terms of cost-effectiveness, the
    Orbit B-Hyve Smart Watering System is the least expensive smart sprinkler controller
    one can buy. However, all the systems are designed to be water-efficient, with
    features such as weather-based scheduling and soil moisture sensors. The systems
    generally provide uniform water distribution, but this may depend on the quality
    of the irrigation system and the specific settings used. The systems are designed
    to be low-maintenance and require minimal labour. The systems are generally adaptable
    to different crop types, but this may depend on the specific method and how it
    is configured. The systems are designed to be environmentally friendly, with features
    such as water-saving technology and reduced runoff. The systems are generally
    easy to use, with features like smartphone apps and intuitive interfaces. All
    systems have the potential for automation and remote monitoring, with features
    such as scheduling and alerts. The development and implementation of our smart
    crop watering system prototype, which optimizes water usage and minimizes wastage
    through precision irrigation techniques, directly contributes to SDG 6, Target
    6.5 [14] by promoting integrated water resource management and ensuring sustainable
    water withdrawals, aiming to substantially increase water-use efficiency in agriculture
    while safeguarding ecosystem services and reducing water-related risks. SECTION
    III. Materials and Methods SCWS development methods and materials are two critical
    components of the project. The methods refer to how the research was conducted,
    whereas the materials are the tools and parts used during the project’s development.
    A. Materials This smart crop watering system makes use of several electrical components.
    The components include the ESP8266 microcontroller, ESP8266 baseboard, a 3V relay,
    a 5V DC pump, 9V batteries, a soil moisture sensor, a DHT11 sensor, and an OLED
    screen. The main control unit is the ESP8266 microcontroller, which provides Wi-Fi
    connectivity and stable pin connections for reading and transmitting soil moisture,
    temperature, and humidity data to the cloud. Its primary duties include data collection,
    processing, and communication. The soil moisture sensor measures the moisture
    level in the soil and tells when to water the crops. The DHT11 sensor measures
    air humidity and temperature, which are important factors in determining crop
    watering needs. The DC pump supplies water to the crops, and the relay acts as
    a switch to control the pump’s operation. The microcontroller can activate or
    deactivate the pump by holding the power transmitted to the relay. The 9V battery
    serves as the system’s primary power source. Finally, for easy monitoring, the
    OLED screen displays important sensor readings. The main software tools used to
    develop this project are the Arduino IDE, MIT App Inventor, and Firebase. For
    programming the ESP8266 microcontroller, the Arduino IDE is used. It provides
    an easy-to-use interface for writing, compiling, and uploading code to a microcontroller.
    To design the system’s interface and add functionality to the application, MIT
    App Inventor is used. Another software component in the system is Firebase, which
    allows data from the DHT11 and soil moisture sensors to be sent to the Firebase
    Real-time Database. This information is displayed within the system’s application
    for easy access and monitoring. B. Methods The study is based on a quantitative
    design and focuses on secondary data collection. The method used in developing
    the SCWS can be divided into two parts which are the system block diagram and
    the circuit diagram. 1) SCWS Block Diagram The block diagram for the SCWS is shown
    in Fig. 1. The soil moisture sensor and DHT11 detect soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity. Once the data has been collected, the ESP8266 analyzes the data
    to determine whether the relay is triggered and whether the DC pump should be
    turned on or off. A below or equal to 30% soil moisture reading triggers the relay
    to turn the DC pump on. It also sends the data to the Firebase Real-time Database.
    From the real-time database, the data is transmitted to the SCWS application,
    making it easy for the user to get real-time data on soil moisture, humidity and
    temperature surrounding their plants. Fig. 1. SCWS block diagram. Show All 2)
    Circuit Diagram The proper and secure electrical component connections are paramount
    due to their crucial role in ensuring the safe and efficient functioning of the
    system. Fig. 2 overviews the connections between various components, including
    the ESP8266, baseboard, DHT11, OLED display, soil moisture sensor, 5V dc pump,
    2 9V batteries, and a 3V relay. Fig. 2. Circuit diagram. Show All The primary
    power source for the sensors and OLED display is a 9V battery connected to a jack
    cover, which is then linked to the jack port of the ESP8266 baseboard. The connections
    for the soil moisture sensor are relatively straightforward: the VCC pin is connected
    to a 3V pin on the baseboard, the GND pin is connected to the GND pin on the baseboard,
    and the A0 pin is connected to the A0 pin on the baseboard. As for the DHT11 sensor,
    its positive (+) pin is connected to the 3V pin of the baseboard, while the negative
    (-) pin is connected to the GND pin of the baseboard. The ''out'' pin of the DHT11
    sensor is connected to the D4 pin on the baseboard. It is important to note that
    the soil moisture data is collected through an analogue pin, whereas the temperature
    and humidity data are collected through a digital pin. The following steps must
    be taken to establish the connections between the OLED display and the baseboard.
    First, the OLED display''s VCC (power) pin is connected to a 3V pin on the baseboard.
    Next, the OLED display''s GND (ground) pin is connected to a GND pin on the baseboard.
    The display''s SCL (serial clock) pin is then connected to the D1 pin of the baseboard,
    while the SDA (serial data) pin of the display is connected to the D2 pin of the
    baseboard. Regarding the relay, the VCC pin of the relay is connected to the 3V
    pin on the baseboard for the power supply. The GND pin of the relay is connected
    to the GND pin on the baseboard for grounding. Finally, the ''IN'' pin of the
    relay is connected to the D6 pin on the baseboard to control its activation. By
    establishing these connections, the OLED display can communicate with the baseboard,
    and the baseboard can control the relay through the specified pins. The NO (Normally
    Open) configuration selection for the relay connection offers distinct advantages
    over the NC (Normally Closed) design, specifically regarding system control and
    resource optimization. By establishing the connection between the NO pin and the
    power pin of the 5V dc pump and linking the COM pin to the power pin of the 9V
    battery cover, an essential pathway for power distribution is created. The negative
    pin of the pump and the battery cover are interconnected to ensure proper functionality.
    The decision to utilize the NO pin instead of the NC pin is motivated by the need
    for precise and selective power delivery to the pump based on a specific trigger
    condition: the soil moisture level falling below 30%. This configuration ensures
    that the pump receives power exclusively when the trigger condition is met, safeguarding
    against unnecessary activation when the soil moisture exceeds the desired threshold.
    Opting for the NO configuration mitigates potential issues associated with a continuous
    and unrestricted power supply to the pump. In contrast, if the NC configuration
    were employed, the pump would remain powered continuously, irrespective of the
    soil moisture level, leading to suboptimal resource utilization, as the pump would
    continue operating even when the soil moisture is already above the desired threshold.
    Such inefficiency could result in excessive watering, potentially harming plants
    and wasting valuable energy and water resources. Fig. 3 illustrates the envisioned
    SCWS prototype, which automatically irrigates the plant crop at regular intervals
    based on sensor readings, resulting in water conservation and reducing the need
    for human intervention. Fig. 3. Prototype of SCWS. Show All SECTION IV. Result
    and Discussion This study aims to address the shortcomings of traditional irrigation
    methods by designing and implementing a smart crop watering system. The system
    was developed to enhance irrigation scheduling, effectively tackle issues of over-watering
    and underwatering, and minimize the environmental impact associated with conventional
    practices. Through comprehensive testing on a soil container, the prototype system
    demonstrated accurate monitoring and analysis of crucial parameters, including
    soil moisture, humidity, and temperature. Notably, the system showcased its ability
    to conserve water by withholding irrigation when soil moisture levels exceeded
    a predetermined threshold, thereby mitigating nutrient leaching caused by excessive
    watering. The successful implementation of this smart irrigation system presents
    a significant advancement in agricultural practices, paving the way for sustainable
    and efficient crop cultivation. Testing was conducted for six hours in a single
    day, during which data were collected from the soil moisture sensor and the DHT11
    sensor. This data was then visualized as a line graph illustrating the observed
    trends. The soil moisture sensor primarily detected variations in soil moisture
    levels, while the DHT11 sensor recorded temperature and air humidity. The collected
    data, presented in Fig. 4, demonstrated the fluctuation in soil moisture levels
    over time. Fig. 4. Soil moisture (%) from the soil moisture sensor. Show All At
    2:00 p.m., the soil moisture percentage stood at 70% and gradually declined to
    68% by 2:30 p.m. Subsequently, at 3:00 p.m., there was only a marginal decrease
    of 1%, resulting in a reading of 67%, followed by a further decline to 65% at
    3:30 p.m. This gradual reduction continued until 4:00 p.m., when the soil moisture
    percentage reached 62%. By 4:30 p.m., the rate dropped to 58%; at 5:00 p.m., it
    decreased by an additional 4% to get 54%. Similarly, at 5:30 p.m., there was a
    3% decline, bringing the reading to 51%. At 6:00 p.m., another 3% decrease was
    recorded, resulting in a reading of 48%. However, at 6:30 p.m., the decline slowed
    to 2%, with the percentage reading at 46%. At 7:00 p.m., the soil moisture level
    measured 43%, followed by 41% at 7:30 p.m. and 39% at 8:00 p.m. Throughout the
    6hour testing period, the data consistently indicated a gradual decline in soil
    moisture levels, ranging from a 1% to a 4% reduction per reading. As the soil
    moisture level remained above the threshold of 30%, there was no need for the
    system to activate the watering process. It is anticipated, however, that the
    system would have been triggered between 10:00 p.m. and 10:30 p.m., considering
    the observed trends and moisture level progression. Fig. 5 provides an overview
    of the temperature fluctuations recorded during the testing period obtained from
    the DHT11 sensor readings. Fig. 5. Temperature ( ∘ C) data from the DHT11. Show
    All At the start of the testing, specifically at 2:00 p.m., the temperature reading
    was measured at 29.8 ∘ C . This temperature remained constant until 2:30 p.m.,
    following which it experienced a slight decrease of 0.5 ∘ C , reaching its lowest
    point at 29.3 ∘ C by 3:00 p.m. Subsequently, at 3:30 p.m., the temperature rose
    back to 29.8 ∘ C and maintained that level until 4:00 p.m. From 4:30 p.m. onwards,
    the temperature increased, reaching 30.3 ∘ C by 4:30 p.m. and peaking at 30.8
    ∘ C by 5:00 p.m. At 5:30 p.m., a slight decline was observed, with the temperature
    reading recorded at 30.2 ∘ C , which remained unchanged until 6:00 p.m. Another
    decrease occurred at 6:30 p.m., resulting in a temperature reading of 29.8 ∘ C
    and a further decline to 29.4 ∘ C at 7:00 p.m. The temperature readings at 7:30
    p.m. and 8:00 p.m. remained constant at 29.8 ∘ C . Consequently, the DHT11 sensor
    provided frequent temperature readings of 29.8 ∘ C , with the highest recorded
    reading reaching 30.8 ∘ C and the lowest at 29.3 ∘ C . The average temperature,
    determined by calculating the values throughout the testing period, was found
    to be 29.9 ∘ C . Fig. 6 depicts the air humidity readings, measured in percentage
    (%), obtained from the DHT11 sensor. Fig. 6. Humidity (%) data from the DHT11
    Show All At 2:00 p.m., the initial air humidity reading was recorded at 80%, which
    remained constant for one hour until 3:00 p.m. Subsequently, at 3:30 p.m., a slight
    increase in humidity was observed, reaching 81%, which remained stable until 4:00
    p.m. However, there was a notable decrease in humidity at 4:30 p.m., with a reading
    of 77%. This decrease could be attributed to the rising temperature, which resulted
    in drier air. The humidity percentage then increased to 79% at 5:00 p.m., followed
    by a further increase to 82% at 5:30 p.m. By 6:00 p.m., the humidity level stood
    at 81%, but it experienced another rise, reaching 84%. Between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00
    p.m., the humidity peaked at 84% and remained constant for the remainder of the
    testing period. Consequently, the lowest recorded humidity during the testing
    period was 77%, while the highest recorded humidity was 84%. The average humidity
    calculated based on the gathered data was 81.3%. Based on the figures obtained
    from the study, it is evident that when the soil moisture levels exceed the threshold
    of 30%, the pumping mechanism remains inactive, thereby preventing any further
    increase in moisture content. Notably, the soil moisture level steadily diminishes
    at a consistent rate of 2.4% per half hour. Analyzing the data in Fig. 5 and Fig.
    6 provides valuable insights into the environmental conditions surrounding the
    soil placement, revealing a warm and humid climate with an average temperature
    of 29.9 ∘ C and an intermediate humidity level of 81.3%. These crucial data points
    are subsequently transmitted to the user''s smartphone via the SCWS application,
    enabling them to monitor the system remotely conveniently. SECTION V. Conclusion
    Our prototype stands out due to its unique features and capabilities, setting
    it apart from other smart sprinkler controller systems. While competitors offer
    various sensor options and weather-based scheduling, we optimize water usage and
    minimize wastage through precision irrigation techniques. It aligns directly with
    SDG 6, Target 6.5, emphasizing integrated water resource management and sustainable
    water withdrawals in agriculture. By using precision irrigation, our prototype

    It maximizes water-use efficiency and minimizes environmental impact, supporting
    broader sustainable agriculture and water resource management goals. Our dedication
    to achieving SDG 6, Target 6.5, underscores our commitment to responsibly addressing
    global water scarcity challenges in agriculture. By promoting sustainable water
    practices, we contribute to safeguarding ecosystem services and reducing water-related
    risks for future generations. The prototype''s automation and remote monitoring
    capabilities enhance irrigation management, providing real-time data, alerts,
    and remote adjustments for informed decision-making. To enhance the system further,
    we aim to make it compatible with all soil and crop types. SCWS is a crucial first
    step in addressing farmers'' irrigation challenges. Its development brings us
    closer to realizing the vision of water-saving in agriculture. With ongoing improvements
    and advancements, we can make significant strides in achieving water efficiency
    and sustainability in agriculture, positively impacting our environment and global
    food security. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This research was supported by Universiti Tun Hussein

    IEEE Conference Location: Tashkent, Uzbekistan SECTION I. Introduction In recent
    years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a transformative technology,
    revolutionizing various industries with its ability to connect and automate devices.
    One sector that stands to benefit significantly from IoT implementation is agriculture
    [1]. By integrating IoT into agricultural practices, farmers can gain real-time
    insights, optimize resource allocation, and enhance productivity while ensuring
    sustainability [2]. Smart agriculture management involves the integration of advanced
    technologies and data-driven solutions to streamline farming operations. An integrated
    IoT system plays a pivotal role in achieving these objectives by enabling the
    seamless connection and communication between sensors, devices, and agricultural
    equipment [3] This comprehensive system harnesses the power of IoT, cloud computing,
    data analytics, and machine learning to create a holistic approach to agriculture.
    At its core, an integrated IoT system for smart agriculture management comprises
    a network of sensors strategically deployed throughout the farming landscape [4].
    Sensors collect various environmental data points such as soil moisture levels,
    temperature, humidity, light intensity, and even atmospheric conditions. Through
    the connectivity provided by IoT, this data is transmitted in real-time to a centralized
    cloud platform. The cloud platform acts as a central hub where the collected data
    is stored, processed, and analyzed. Advanced analytics algorithms and machine
    learning models process the data to extract valuable insights and action- able
    recommendations for farmers [4] These insights can range from optimal irrigation
    schedules and nutrient management to pest detection and disease prevention strategies
    [5]. The integration of IoT devices extends beyond environmental monitoring. It
    also includes the connectivity of agricultural machinery and equipment. For instance,
    IoT-enabled tractors, harvesters, and drones can be equipped with sensors and
    GPS technology to perform precise and automated tasks such as planting, spraying,
    and crop monitoring. By automating these processes, farmers can improve efficiency,
    reduce labor costs, and minimize environmental impact. Moreover, an integrated
    IoT system can enable farmers to remotely monitor and control their operations
    using mobile applications or web- based interfaces [3]. This allows farmers to
    access real-time data, receive alerts and notifications, and make informed decisions
    from anywhere at any time. Whether they are in the field or managing multiple
    farms, the power of IoT empowers farmers with greater control and flexibility
    in managing their agricultural practices [6]. Furthermore, the integration of
    IoT in agriculture goes beyond individual farms. It opens up opportunities for
    collaboration and knowledge sharing among farmers, agronomists, and researchers.
    By leveraging data from multiple sources, farmers can gain valuable insights into
    industry trends, best practices, and market demands. This collective intelligence
    fosters innovation and facilitates sustainable agricultural practices at a larger
    scale. In short, an integrated IoT system solution for smart agriculture management
    holds immense potential for revolutionizing the way we approach farming. By connecting
    devices, collecting data, and leveraging advanced analytics, farmers can optimize
    resource utilization, improve productivity, and ensure environmental sustainability.
    With continuous advancements in IoT technology, the future of agriculture looks
    promising, with smarter and more efficient farming practices that contribute to

    Review The implementation of an integrated IoT system for smart agriculture management
    requires a well-defined methodology that encompasses various stages of deployment
    and operation. The following paragraphs outline the key steps involved in the
    methodology. The first step in the methodology involves identifying the specific
    needs and objectives of the farm or agricultural operation. This includes understanding
    the key challenges faced by the farmers, such as water management, crop health
    monitoring, or pest control. By clearly defining the goals, the subsequent steps
    can be tailored to address the specific requirements of the farm [1]. In [10],
    a comprehensive analysis of the farm''s infrastructure and environment is conducted.
    This involves identifying the areas where IoT sensors and devices can be strategically
    deployed. Factors such as soil type, topography, and crop types are considered
    to determine the optimal sensor placement for data collection. Additionally, the
    integration of IoT -enabled machinery and equipment is evaluated to automate farming
    operations. Once the sensor and device placement is determined, the next step
    involves selecting the appropriate IoT hardware and connectivity solutions. This
    includes choosing sensors for measuring environmental parameters such as temperature,
    humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity. The selection of IoT gateways or
    hubs, communication protocols, and network connectivity options (e.g., cellular,
    Wi-Fi, LoRa Wan) are also important considerations. After the hardware selection,
    the IoT system''s deployment phase begins. This involves installing the sensors
    and devices in the designated locations across the farm. Careful calibration and
    testing of the IoT infrastructure are conducted to ensure accurate data collection
    and reliable connectivity. The integration of IoT -enabled machinery and equipment
    also takes place during this phase. Once the IoT system is deployed and operational,
    the focus shifts to data management and analytics. The collected sensor data is
    transmitted to a centralized cloud platform, where it is stored securely and processed
    in real-time. Data analytics techniques, including statistical analysis and machine
    learning algorithms, are applied to derive meaningful insights from the collected
    data. These insights can be related to irrigation scheduling, crop health monitoring,
    disease detection, and other relevant factors [6]. The final step in the methodology
    involves the utilization of the generated insights to make informed decisions
    and take necessary actions. Farmers and agricultural professionals can access
    the cloud-based platform through user- friendly interfaces, enabling them to monitor
    the farm''s performance, receive alerts and notifications, and access actionable
    recommendations. This allows for proactive management of the farm, optimizing
    resource allocation, and enhancing productivity. Throughout the entire process,
    continuous monitoring and maintenance of the IoT system are essential. Regular
    checks are conducted to ensure the proper functioning of sensors, connectivity,
    and data transmission. Firmware updates, security patches, and system upgrades
    are performed to keep the IoT infrastructure up to date and protected against
    potential vulnerabilities [5]. to summarize, the methodology for implementing
    an integrated IoT system for smart agriculture management involves identifying
    needs, analyzing the farm''s infrastructure, selecting appropriate IoT hardware,
    deploying the system, managing and analyzing data, and utilizing insights for
    decision-making. Continuous monitoring and maintenance ensure the system''s reliability
    and effectiveness in optimizing farming practices. SECTION III. Proposed Architecture
    The proposed architecture of an integrated IoT system solution for smart agriculture
    management comprises several interconnected components that work together to enable
    efficient data collection, processing, and decision-making. The following paragraph

    such as data filtering and data normalization. The hub also ensures reliable connectivity
    and secure transmission of the data to the cloud platform. The cloud-based platform
    forms a critical component of the architecture. It acts as a centralized repository
    for storing the collected sensor data and provides a scalable and secure environment
    for data processing and analysis. The platform leverages cloud computing technologies
    to handle the large volume of data generated by the sensors. Within the cloud
    platform, advanced analytics techniques are applied to the collected data. This
    includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, and data mining to derive meaningful
    insights. Machine learning algorithms and statistical models are employed to analyze
    the data and identify patterns, trends, and anomalies related to crop health,
    irrigation needs, pest infestation, and other relevant factors. The insights generated
    by the analytics process are made available to the end-users, such as farmers
    and agricultural professionals, through user-friendly interfaces. These interfaces
    can be accessed via mobile applications, web-based dashboards, or other means.
    The end-users can view real-time data, receive alerts and notifications, and access
    actionable recommendations based on the analyzed data. The architecture also includes
    integration with IoT -enabled machinery and equipment. This involves equipping
    agricultural machinery like tractors, harvesters, and drones with IoT sensors
    and connectivity capabilities. These IoT -enabled machines can collect data related
    to their operations, such as fuel consumption, performance metrics, and geospatial
    information. This data can be integrated into the cloud platform, providing a
    comprehensive view of the farm''s operations. Furthermore, the proposed architecture
    emphasizes data security and privacy. Measures such as data encryption, access
    controls, and authentication mechanisms are implemented to protect the sensitive
    farm data from unauthorized access or tampering. Fig. 2: Snapshot of Test Site.

    practices such as rooftop farming, vertical farming, and hydroponics, has emerged
    as a promising approach to address the increasing demand for food in urban areas
    (Su et al., 2020). As the world''s population continues to urbanize, the limited
    availability of arable land and the challenges associated with traditional agricultural
    practices pose significant obstacles to ensuring food security in cities (Kasprzyk
    et al., 2022). However, the integration of smart technologies has the potential
    to overcome these challenges and optimize urban agricultural practices. Smart
    technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence
    (AI), and data analytics, are revolutionizing various industries, and urban agriculture
    is no exception. These technologies offer innovative solutions to enhance resource
    efficiency, improve productivity, and promote sustainability in urban farming
    (Pathmudi et al., 2023). One of the key benefits of smart technologies in urban
    agriculture is the increased feasibility of food production in urban areas. Research
    conducted by Badami and Ramankutty (2015) suggests that urban agriculture is more
    feasible for growing basic daily vegetables for the urban poor in developed countries
    than in developing countries. By leveraging smart technologies, urban farming
    can be made more efficient and productive, making it a viable option for food
    production in resource-constrained urban areas. Resource circularity is another
    area where smart technologies play a crucial role in urban agriculture. Weidner
    et al. (2019) highlight the potential of decentralized anaerobic digestion and
    vermicomposting, coupled with smart technologies, in utilizing organic waste for
    urban agriculture. By closing the loop and recycling organic waste, smart technologies
    contribute to a resource circular economy in urban farming, reducing the reliance
    on external resources and minimizing waste. Water management is a critical aspect
    of urban agriculture, and smart technologies offer improved solutions in this
    regard. Mason et al. (2019) demonstrate the potential of intelligent irrigation
    systems, enabled by IoT and data analytics, to reduce water consumption while
    maintaining crop yield in smallholder farming systems. By integrating sensors,
    wireless communications, and data platforms, these systems provide real-time data
    for informed decision-making, enabling precise and optimized water management
    in urban agriculture. In addition to resource efficiency, smart technologies also
    contribute to the environmental sustainability of urban agriculture. Jaramillo
    and Desyouni (2015) emphasize that the current food system contributes heavily
    to global environmental challenges such as biodiversity loss and climate change.
    However, smart urban farming practices, such as vertical farming and greenhouses,
    supported by smart technologies, offer controlled environments that reduce the
    need for land, water, and pesticides. This can help mitigate the negative environmental
    impacts associated with conventional agriculture. While the integration of smart
    technologies in urban agriculture holds great promise, it is essential to address
    the challenges and considerations associated with their implementation. Benis
    and Ferrão (2018) highlight barriers such as high investment costs, narrow profit
    margins, and uncertain marketing channels that hinder the commercialization of
    rooftop farming. Moreover, the potential drawbacks of smart urban agriculture,
    including the dependence on technology and the exclusion of traditional farming
    practices, need to be carefully examined (Glaeser et al., 2021). In conclusion,
    smart technologies have the potential to revolutionize urban agriculture by enhancing
    resource efficiency, improving productivity, and promoting environmental sustainability.
    Through the integration of IoT, AI, and data analytics, urban farming can overcome
    challenges associated with limited land availability, water scarcity, and environmental
    impact. However, it is crucial to consider the socioeconomic aspects, inclusivity,
    and long-term sustainability of smart urban agriculture initiatives. Continue

    prominent contributors include Griffith University, Politecnico di Milano, and
    the Università degli Studi di Salerno. Regarding worldwide research trends, an
    examination of distinct clusters defined by their principal keywords was conducted.
    The following clusters were identified in order of significance based on the number
    of publications: Urban Water Meters, IoT Connection, Communication and Security,
    Grid Management, Water Networks, Hot Water, Groundwater Monitoring, and Smart
    Irrigation. Of particular note is the growing use of machine learning applications,
    especially in the management of distribution networks. This trend opens up a promising
    avenue for addressing complex problems in real time. Keywords: smart metering;
    urban infrastructure; water conservation; energy management; data analytics; sustainable
    resource management 1. Introduction Concerns about water supply and quality have
    been a constant focus in human development. Currently, especially in developed
    countries, there is a significant emphasis on the sanitary and overall quality
    aspects of water. Various regulations establish the criteria to be followed in
    water supply [1]. The consumption of water on our planet has tripled in the 20th
    century, attributed to factors such as continuous population growth, water poverty,
    poor management, and outdated or inadequate facilities, contributing to a global
    water crisis. Consequently, water resources are becoming increasingly expensive
    and scarce, fueling a strong interest in their effective control and efficient
    use. Across various sectors, from industry to agriculture, extensive efforts are
    being made to monitor water distribution networks [2]. To address this significant
    challenge, distribution networks need to become more efficient by reducing losses,
    and consumers must also play a role in decreasing their water consumption. In
    the energy sector, studies and actions have already been undertaken to enhance
    the functioning of related facilities [3]. The substantial user base leads to
    a continuously rising water consumption, necessitating precise control mechanisms,
    despite the high costs associated with installing multiple monitoring instruments
    and their corresponding actuators [4]. Measurement devices often malfunction,
    leading to interventions based on lower-quality data. While studies on urban water
    consumption in broad areas have been conducted [5], research on specific buildings
    is scarce. For individual buildings, the LEED certification (Leadership in Energy
    and Environmental Design) is frequently employed, sought after by many businesses
    in their business plans [6]. Consumption signatures are used to identify the individual
    consumption of each device [7], enabling the identification of more complex consumption
    patterns. Such algorithms have successfully been applied in public buildings for
    energy use rationalization [8]. The role of the Internet of Things (IoT) in water
    supply chain management is crucial for understanding the future trajectory at
    the intersection of computer science and resource management [9]. Actuators play
    a vital role in enabling the automation of various smart city services [10]. The
    primary goal of this study is to scrutinize the entire body of scientific literature
    pertaining to smart water meters on a global scale, emphasizing the significance
    of understanding research trends in this domain. 2. Materials and Methods This
    bibliometric study utilized Scopus databases as the primary source for data retrieval.
    Despite Scopus containing historical content dating back to 1788, the search was
    restricted to the period between 2000 and 2022. The research methodology encompasses
    a comprehensive approach involving data collection, preprocessing, and multifaceted
    analysis to unveil and comprehend scientific communities and their collaborative
    patterns, see Figure 1. Figure 1. Methodology. In the initial phase, scholarly
    publications and their associated metadata were retrieved from the globally recognized
    Scopus database. The Scopus API was leveraged to conduct a targeted search focused
    on documents related to smart water meters, aligning with established research
    methodologies [11]. The search query employed was as follows: TITLE-ABS-KEY (smart*
    AND (water* OR flow*) AND meter*). All documents were downloaded from Scopus leading
    to the annotated search. Crafted to cover a broad spectrum of literature, the
    query specifically addressed terms related to “smart water meter” or “smart flow
    meter” and their practical applications across various communities. However, the
    methodology introduced in this study effectively manages this potential issue,
    thanks to the resulting network graph’s structure and which can be visualized
    with the Gephi (open-source tool). After acquiring the raw dataset, a preprocessing
    phase ensued, employing Microsoft Excel and OpenRefine for basic data organization
    and cleansing. This ensured that the dataset was primed for advanced analysis.
    For the core analysis, the open-source tool Gephi was employed, capitalizing on
    its robust capabilities in statistical analysis and data visualization. The data
    underwent refinement to eliminate documents lacking meaningful connections within
    the main body of scientific literature. This curation process allowed this research
    to focus specifically on the most pertinent documents and their relationships.
    For the primary screening, the open-source tool Gephi was employed, taking advantage
    of its robust statistical analysis and data visualization capabilities. The dataset
    was subjected to a filtering process to eliminate documents that did not establish
    any connection with the rest of the documents. This filtering allowed us to focus
    the cluster analysis on the most relevant documents and their associations. For
    this purpose, we employed a community detection algorithm based on modularity
    in large networks, as detailed in [12]. Specifically, Gephi’s algorithm used Louvain’s
    method, a widely accepted approach for community detection. Louvain’s method is
    optimized for large networks, with the goal of identifying modular structures
    by maximizing a modularity score within the range of −0.5 to 1. This score evaluates
    the density of edges within clusters compared to those between clusters. The Louvain
    method was chosen because of its computational efficiency and its ability to delineate
    clear structures in intricate datasets. Although alternative algorithms such as
    Girvan–Newman, Infomap, and Label Propagation were considered, they proved less
    suitable due to their computational intensity, limited relevance to citation networks,
    or production of less cohesive structures, respectively. For the sorting by year,
    by subject category, and by country, these data are obtained directly from the
    Scopus search in the results analysis section of the website itself. It is possible
    to export them in CSV format. Later, year and subject category data were imported
    and represented using Excel. Country data have been mapped with QGIS software

    In fact, eight of the 20 main keywords, such as Residential Water and Water Efficiency,
    are exclusive to this cluster. Over the past two decades, more or less detailed
    measurement programs, referred to as smart measures, have been developed [13].
    This progress has led to nearly continuous monitoring of water consumption. The
    abundance of available data has prompted the exploration of strategies for modeling
    and managing water in residential areas [14]. Periodic resource scarcity drives
    interest in limiting and controlling losses; leading studies toward water, notably
    by Rahim et al. [15], demand planning, socio-economic analysis, behavioral analysis,
    classification of water-related events, and user feedback. The cluster’s connection
    with information technology is evident, sharing techniques with other supply systems
    such as electricity or gas [16]. These meters enable the identification of the
    final use of water, a crucial aspect for making utility predictions [17]. The
    technology has matured sufficiently to transition from pilot trials to real-world
    implementation in large supply networks [18] and urban supply planning, closely
    intertwined with city planning itself [19]. Additionally, the current analyses
    aim to disaggregate data to reach individual events [20]. Reengineering of existing
    systems can be undertaken in light of the results already achieved [21]. Cluster
    2, denoted as IOT Connection, forms a community centered on Internet of Things
    (IoT) connection algorithms and network implementation. Ranking as the second-largest
    community, Table 4 details the frequency (N) of primary keywords associated with
    this cluster, establishing connections with the Urban Water metering and Communication
    and Security communities, while maintaining ties with the Energy consumption cluster.
    Among its 20 main keywords, 12 are intrinsic to this cluster, and it holds significance
    as the leading community in 8 of them. Its primary associations lie with Clusters
    1, 3, and 4, positioning it as a substantial and interconnected family with promising
    prospects for future development. Current meters are acknowledged for their sluggishness
    and time-intensive nature, promoting water wastage, thus advocating for the adoption
    of smart meters to enhance resource conservation and early fault detection [22,23].
    Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) architectures are anticipated to facilitate
    the integration of multiple networks simultaneously [24], aiming for user interaction
    [25]. The configuration of networks through smart water meters (SWM) and the advantageous
    use of IoT are highlighted in literature [26]. Case studies explore innovative
    applications, such as using pumps as generators or direct interaction with users
    [27], aligning with user interest in these devices [28]. Efficient data transmission
    mechanisms within the network involve relaying data from each node to the nearest
    node [29]. Two critical aspects, namely sensor network energy consumption and
    security issues, are underscored in the literature [30], emphasizing the multifaceted
    nature of research within the IOT Connection cluster. Cluster 3 was identified
    as Communication and Security and stands as the third-largest community. Table
    4 delineates the frequency (N) of principal keywords associated with this cluster,
    which revolves around communication and security aspects in network meters, particularly
    emphasizing energy meters. Remarkably, it encapsulates the top 10 keywords among
    the first 20 across all clusters, asserting its significance in this domain. In
    half of these 20 keywords, this community holds the utmost importance, while in
    the remaining 10, it shares keywords with other communities, primarily with Clusters
    1 and 3. This community is predominantly concerned with communication protocols
    and applications of automatic meters, with a focus on reducing peak consumption,
    a growingly attractive topic [31]. Traditional systems, effective thus far in
    electricity and water distribution, are deemed insecure and lacking user feedback
    capabilities [32]. Smart energy meters can be leveraged to monitor other types
    of meters, integrated into networks [33,34]. The computerized control of these
    networks [35] presents a challenge in terms of vulnerability to intrusions [36],
    necessitating resolution in future developments [37]. Data aggregation allows
    for processing while maintaining user privacy [38]. The Communication and Security
    cluster, thus, contributes significantly to the exploration of secure and effective
    communication protocols in smart metering systems. Cluster 4 was identified as
    Grid Management. Table 5 provides an overview of the primary keywords associated
    with this cluster. Positioned as a peripheral cluster, it primarily addresses
    the challenges in managing vast amounts of grid data. Although it shares keywords
    with other communities, it assumes a leading role in what is termed Big Data,
    highlighting its auxiliary nature in supporting other fields. This specialized
    community focuses on the implementation of intelligent algorithms for information
    acquisition, data processing, and swift action in extensive supply networks, predominantly
    in energy but extending to other domains such as water or gas [39,40,41]. The
    characterization of overall consumption holds a prominent place in this cluster,
    particularly in the context of water, leveraging time series [42] or neural networks
    [43]. Grid Management emerges as a crucial contributor to the application of intelligent
    algorithms for efficient data management and consumption characterization in large-scale
    supply networks. Cluster 5, labelled as Water Network Partitioning, is outlined
    in Table 5, featuring the primary keywords associated with this cluster. Characterized
    as an isolated cluster, it addresses the challenges of metering an extensive network
    through the analysis of smaller network components. Despite being a smaller cluster,
    it holds significance, representing 1.97% of the keywords. Within this group,
    all authors are closely interconnected, collaborating on a specific strategy for
    distribution network analysis. This strategy involves studying reduced sectors
    of the network to simplify the analysis [44,45,46]. The methodology employed includes
    the installation of valves and smart meters on main lines, accompanied by the
    development of specialized software for these meters, referred to as SWAM [47,48].
    This technique has been applied in fault detection and pollution control [49]
    through recursive sectorization [50]. The Water Network Partitioning cluster,
    although smaller in size, plays a vital role in the exploration of innovative
    strategies for network analysis, particularly in the context of simplifying analysis
    through the study of smaller network components. Cluster 6 focuses on Water Heating
    and the associated metering of this valuable resource, as detailed in Table 5
    with the primary keywords for this cluster. Comprising 1.13% of the keywords,
    this well-defined community primarily interacts with Cluster 1. The majority of
    the keywords within this family are unique to it, although none stands out as
    particularly abundant. The substantial cost of this resource amplifies the significance
    of this family, as highlighted by Bacher et al. [51]. The research within this
    cluster involves the development of prediction models for resource needs, particularly
    emphasizing scenarios in cold climates [52]. Detection of leaks is of particular
    importance due to the high energy costs [53]. This family extends its exploration
    to related networks such as domestic heat and gas, demonstrating a comprehensive
    approach to resource management [54,55]. The Water Heating and metering cluster,
    while relatively small, delves into crucial aspects of resource prediction, environmental
    considerations, and the efficient management of expensive resources. The remaining
    clusters are of limited size but represent emerging sectors with promising prospects
    for future studies. Cluster 7 is a small cluster centered on Groundwater Monitoring,
    utilizing various approaches. It occupies a peripheral position in the diagram
    and is related to Cluster 1, accounting for 0.99% of the keywords. Similar to
    Cluster 8, the majority of the keywords within this group are specific to it,
    sharing few words with other clusters. Table 6 lists the most representative keywords
    for this cluster. Water crisis and the threat of resource shortage are identified
    as direct consequences of factors such as limited precipitation, traditional irrigation
    methods, and inefficient monitoring and control systems in agriculture [56]. This
    cluster serves as a unique case within monitoring, often supported by simulation
    models [57,58,59]. It places special emphasis on control elements and leverages
    other components, such as energy meters, to enhance information completeness [60].
    Additionally, Cluster 7 connects with the use of unconventional water sources,
    such as desalinated water for urban use and reclaimed water for agricultural purposes
    [61]. Cluster 8, also a small cluster, is dedicated to Smart Irrigation control,
    representing 0.85% of the keywords. This group features highly specific keywords,
    occasionally shared with Cluster 1 and Cluster 3. Table 6 displays the most representative
    keywords for this cluster. Focused on intelligent control of irrigation systems
    to promote water savings and efficiency [62], this cluster emphasizes user satisfaction
    as a crucial parameter [63]. Initially applied in residential landscaping [62,63],
    smart irrigation is currently being implemented in agricultural areas [64,65,66].
    This family exhibits significant development potential, with numerous sensors
    of this type being deployed in agricultural areas [67]. In the analysis, two clusters
    with minimal representation emerge—one focused on data acquisition, sensors, and
    pattern recognition of consumption. For instance, Grigoras et al. [68] present
    an innovative solution in the form of a software platform for sustainable water
    supply system management. This platform incorporates advanced ICT solutions, including
    Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence, along with smart concepts such as smart
    metering and demand response, offering benefits to both the energy and water sectors.
    Additionally, there is another cluster specialized in automated decision making,
    utilizing learning programs, decision support programs, etc. [69,70]. 5. Discussion

    studies indicate [71]. This cluster’s emphasis on user satisfaction and its potential
    application in agricultural areas signal a positive trend toward sustainable water
    use in farming. Additionally, the intersection of Water Network Partitioning (Cluster
    5) with unconventional water sources like desalinated water and reclaimed water
    opens up opportunities for diversifying water supply strategies. Exploring innovative
    approaches to network analysis and water source utilization can contribute to
    more resilient and sustainable water supply systems. It is worth noting the increasing
    use of machine learning applications, especially in the management of distribution
    networks. This trend opens up a promising avenue for addressing complex problems
    in real time [72]. So, the challenges lie in further exploring and integrating
    emerging clusters, while the prospects include advancements in smart irrigation,
    secure communication protocols, and diversified water supply strategies, ultimately
    contributing to the development of more efficient and sustainable smart water
    metering systems. 6. Conclusions In conclusion, the analysis of smart water metering

    Agricultural practices are rapidly changing in the face of the increasing demand
    for food and water resources. Traditional methods of irrigation have proven to
    be inefficient, causing water scarcity and soil degradation. The concept of aquaponics,
    a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics, offers an alternative solution to
    sustainable agriculture. It utilizes a closed-loop system where fish and plants
    are grown in the same environment, creating a symbiotic relationship where the
    waste from fish is utilized as nutrients for plants, and the plants clean the
    water for the fish. Fish waste is converted into nitrates by bacteria present
    in the soil, which can be readily absorbed by the plants. This system also provides
    the plants with a much more consistent nutrient supply as compared to traditional
    irrigation systems. Experts say that the aquaponic way of irrigation conserves
    as much as 90% of the water that is wasted in traditional irrigation systems.
    It is also observed that plants grow faster in this system because nutrients are
    readily available to them and they do not have to expend energy searching for
    them. Overall, the nutrient-rich, controlled environment of an aquaponics system
    provides the ideal conditions for plant growth, making it a superior option for
    growing plants. The proposed system takes various samples of tap water as well
    as Potheri Lake water with varying differences in pH, turbidity, and water temperature.
    The pH level of lake water can vary widely depending on various factors such as
    the surrounding environment, the presence of aquatic life, and the weather conditions.
    In general, lake water can have a lower or higher pH level than tap water, depending
    on the lake''s distinctive characteristics and the way the local area''s tap water
    is treated. For instance, tap water is usually treated to have a pH level between
    6.5 and 8.5, which is considered safe for human consumption and does not cause
    corrosion in pipes. The naturally occurring presence of suspended particles like
    silt, sand, and algae in lake water can cause it to have a greater turbidity level
    than tap water. 2 Literature Review The hardware design of one system [1] includes
    various components such as sensors, actuators, relays, an Ethernet shield, Arduino,
    and routers. The monitoring of temperature and humidity is accomplished using
    an Arduino microcontroller, an Ethernet Shield, an FC-28 humidity sensor, and
    a DHT11 temperature sensor. A router is utilized to connect the Arduino Ethernet
    to a server. The relay module functions as a control switch for various actuators,
    which respond to the sensor output. The aquaponic box contains several actuators,
    such as two 12V DC exhaust fans, a mist maker, a 5V DC fan, two LED Grow Light
    lamps, and a 12V DC pump [2]. Another system kept track of numerous environmental
    factors, and over time it would be able to control how the farm operated and create
    a fully automated system. Publishers (nodes), brokers (local servers), and subscribers
    (local servers) all communicated via the MQTT protocol, which allows for the use
    of any data type. Monitoring can also be done with the help of a GUI program,
    a communication network, and [3] wireless sensors. A graphical user interface
    is provided by AWSM to address the aforementioned issues. Farmers can get real-time
    notifications and advice about water quality even when they are not there by using
    AWSM''s mobile applications built on IoT technology. When compared to the conventional
    approach, the introduction of the AWSM-based IoT application in the Aquaponics
    system has shown substantial gains. Additionally, it is feasible to [4] investigate
    many characteristics observed by smart systems, IoT technologies, and aquaponics.
    A ZigBee module [5] can be used in place of the Wi-Fi module to broadcast the
    data gathered by the Arduino while also displaying the values on the LCD without
    performing any control actions. A fish tank, a grow bed, and a light panel that
    simulates the sun''s rays for plant growth make up the aquaponics system described
    in [6]. The fish waste provides nutrients to the plants, which in turn receive
    water from the fish tank as a filter. The system makes use of actuators to operate
    the water pump, light panel, heater, and oxygen provider as well as sensors to
    monitor and control pH levels, temperature, and humidity. To direct the actual
    citrus production process, nutrient monitoring [7] in citrus plants can also be
    done in real time according to the soil situation. Another method that primarily
    focuses on finding magnesium and nitrogen deficiencies in image processing [8]
    in MATLAB for the detection of rice illnesses and nutritional deficiencies. A
    Raspberry Pi, a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, and solenoid valves make
    up the hardware employed in this technique. A deep learning method can help in
    the detection of diseases and the prediction of crop growth by utilizing many
    sensors that measure the pH value, temperature, humidity, and water level [9].
    Astute farming is described by the author of reference [10] as the integration
    of a wireless sensor and irrigation system that keeps track of factors including
    soil moisture, nutritional content, and pH levels. A GSM module is used to manage
    the system via wireless communication. 3 Architecture Diagram The proposed system
    shown in Fig 1 comprises two sets of sensors—one for the fish tank and the other
    for the crop soil. The data from these sensors are sent to the Arduino board.
    The Arduino board processes the data and sends it to the NodeMCU Wi-Fi module
    which sends it to the Adafruit cloud platform for visualization and analytics
    [11,12,13,14,15]. The system gathers real-time sensor data from the fish tank
    and crop soil using a variety of sensors, including a soil moisture sensor, temperature
    and humidity sensor, pH sensor, turbidity sensor, and water temperature sensor.
    The physical layer or sensor is made up of this. The data is gathered and transferred
    to the Arduino board regularly. Fig. 1 Architecture diagram of proposed system
    Full size image 4 Methodology The construction of an aquaponics monitoring system
    for effective irrigation is the main goal of the suggested system. The system
    uses a variety of sensors, including a soil moisture sensor placed in a tomato
    plant, pH, water temperature, and turbidity sensors. The irrigation process is
    controlled by the readings from these sensors. Hardware Setup: The hardware setup
    consists of an Arduino board that, via Arduino programming in the Arduino IDE,
    receives data from the sensors. The NodeMCU Wi-Fi module, which is set up to work
    on any internet network, receives the data after that. A personal hotspot or local
    Wi-Fi network was used for this project. The data is sent from the NodeMCU to
    Adafruit.io, a cloud-based platform for IoT data analytics and visualization.
    On this platform, real-time data changes can be tracked and examined. Every 30–45
    s, the sensors update their readings. A CSV file containing the data gathered
    from the Adafruit.io platform can be downloaded. Then, using the downloaded data,
    three classification algorithms—KNN, ANN, and Naive Bayes—are trained and tested.
    To forecast the soil''s irrigation needs, data is analyzed. Jupyter Notebook is
    used to analyze and visualize machine learning. Utilizing visualization techniques,
    the three classification systems are compared for accuracy. The system’s overall
    goal is to create an aquaponics monitoring system that controls irrigation by
    using a variety of sensors. Machine learning algorithms are used to analyze the
    sensor data and estimate the need for irrigation, which can result in more effective
    irrigation and higher agricultural yields. 4.1 Machine Learning Algorithms Used
    KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor). To use KNN, we must first select a value for k, which
    specifies the number of neighbors to take into account. Then, when we have a fresh
    batch of data to categorize, we determine how far away each point in the training
    set is from the fresh data and select the k-nearest points. Finally, we designate
    the class for the new data point as being the one that is most prevalent among
    those k points. Naïve Bayes’ classifier. Based on the Bayes theorem, which quantifies
    the likelihood of a hypothesis given evidence, it is a probabilistic categorization
    model. The term “naive” refers to the assumption made in Naive Bayes that the
    features are conditionally independent of the class. ANN (Artificial Neural Network).
    It is a machine learning model that takes its cues from how the human brain is
    organized and works. It is made up of many interconnected layers of neurons that
    analyze data and produce predictions. The features of the instance to be classified
    are sent to the input layer of an ANN classification model, and the predicted
    class is generated by the output layer. There are one or more hidden layers in
    between that process the input and transmit data to the output layer. The weighted
    total of the inputs is applied by each neuron in the hidden layers using a nonlinear
    activation function. 5 Components Used 5.1 Hardware The proposed irrigation system
    based on aquaponics uses various components to measure and transmit real-time
    data to the cloud platform for visualization and analytics. The sensors used in
    the system are summarized below. Soil moisture sensor (LM393). An electrical tool
    called the soil moisture sensor (LM393) measures the amount of water in the soil.
    It measures the soil moisture using the LM393 comparator integrated circuit and
    outputs a digital signal based on the predetermined moisture threshold. This sensor
    comprises two probes that are put into the soil; as a function of the moisture
    content of the soil, the resistance between the probe changes. Temperature and
    humidity sensor (DHT11). A widely used electrical device that can detect both
    temperature and humidity levels in the environment is the DHT11 temperature and
    humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor to monitor humidity levels
    and a Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistor to measure temperature.
    The sensor sends digital outputs of temperature and humidity data to an 8-bit
    microcontroller through a one-wire protocol. pH sensor and turbidity sensor: A
    pH sensor is an electronic device that determines whether a solution is acidic
    or alkaline. The pH scale, which has a range of 0–14 with 0 being the most acidic,
    14 being the most alkaline, and 7 being neutral, serves as the basis for how it
    functions. The fish tank’s water clarity, which is crucial for fish health, is
    measured by the turbidity sensor. Water temperature sensor. A common sensor for
    measuring the temperature of liquids, including water, is the DS18B20. This sensor
    is a digital thermometer that communicates with other devices via a 1-Wire interface.
    With an accuracy of 0.5 °C in the range of − 10 to + 85 °C, the DS18B20 can measure
    temperatures from − 55 to + 125 °C. Arduino board. Arduino Uno is based on the
    ATmega328P microcontroller. It is an open-source hardware board created for people
    of all skill levels who want to develop a variety of electronic projects. The
    board contains a USB port, a power jack, six analog inputs, an ICSP header, and
    14 digital input/output pins. The Arduino programming language, which is based
    on C/C++, can be used to program the board. NodeMCU Wi-Fi module. The board is
    a great option for IoT applications because it combines the capabilities of a
    microcontroller and a Wi-Fi module. The Arduino IDE or the Lua programming language
    is used to creating programs for the NodeMCU ESP8266 device. Various sensors,
    actuators, and other electronic devices can be connected to the board''s GPIO
    pins. Additionally, it has Wi-Fi connectivity functionality built-in, enabling
    it to connect to the internet and communicate with other devices. A USB cable
    or an external power source can be used to power the board. 6 Implementation The
    sensor data was collected for over a month on an hourly basis. Visualizations
    were created based on the data. The data was also collected in the form of CSV,
    and three different binary classification algorithms were applied to it, namely
    KNN, ANN, and Naive Bayes. The working model of the aquaponic system is shown
    in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Turbidity, water temperature, and pH sensor along with connections
    Full size image 7 Results The suggested technique gives a thorough strategy for
    effective aquaponic irrigation management. Real-time sensor data visualization
    and analytics offer insightful information on fish and agricultural growth conditions.
    The three machine learning methods’ comparison offers useful insights into effective
    irrigation prediction in aquaponics. For visualization and analysis, the Adafruit
    platform can be accessed on a smartphone, laptop, tablet, or any other electronic
    device that can be connected to the internet. Visualization on Adafruit.io is
    shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Fig. 3 Real-time values of data acquired from sensors

    7.1 Comparing the Accuracy of Various Classification Models The selection of a
    classification algorithm for agricultural data is influenced by the details of
    the data, the resources at hand, and the objectives of the classification activity.
    A standard criterion for assessing a classification model''s performance is accuracy.
    It calculates the percentage of cases in the dataset that were correctly categorized.
    To put it another way, accuracy is the proportion of true positives and true negatives
    in all instances. The model is operating effectively and properly predicting the
    class labels of the instances in the dataset when the accuracy value is high.
    A classification model could be taught to determine whether or not a certain soil
    sample needs irrigation based on its characteristics, such as its temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture content. In this situation, a classification model
    with high accuracy might be helpful since it can make precise predictions about
    the soil samples’ irrigation requirements. As a result, farmers may be better
    able to decide when and how much to irrigate their crops, which may result in
    the more effective use of water resources and higher crop yields. On comparing
    the accuracy of all three algorithms as in Fig. 5, Naive Bayes was observed to
    have the highest accuracy of 94.12%. This is followed by ANN with an accuracy
    of 91.18% and then by KNN having an accuracy of 88.24. Fig. 5 Grouped bar chart
    for comparison of the accuracy of different models used Full size image 8 Conclusion
    In conclusion, we have presented an irrigation system based on aquaponics that
    utilizes real-time sensor data to monitor and irrigate crops efficiently. The
    system gathers information from a variety of sensors, including soil moisture
    sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, pH sensors, turbidity sensors, and
    water temperature sensors. This information is then processed and instantly displayed
    on the Adafruit platform. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of three classification
    algorithms, namely KNN, Naive Bayes’, and ANN, for deciding when to irrigate the
    soil. We discovered that ANN had the maximum accuracy, making it the best algorithm
    for our system''s irrigation timing prediction. As a future scope, we plan to
    further enhance our system by incorporating features that will enable the user
    to receive alerts on their mobile device, indicating when the crop needs water.
    We also plan to compare our results with additional classification algorithms
    to identify the best-performing algorithm for our system. Overall, this system
    provides a significant advancement in the automation of aquaponics-based irrigation,
    offering a more efficient, accurate, and sustainable way of managing crops. References

    and efficient solution for early fault detection and intervention, thereby revolutionizing
    farming practices towards increased efficiency and sustainability.

  explanation: 'The authors of this study sought to investigate the potential of automated,
    real-time irrigation management systems to contribute to the efficient use of
    water resources and enhance agricultural productivity. They conducted a systematic
    review of case studies and real-world implementations to identify effective and
    reliable approaches to integrating components within automated irrigation management
    systems and achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. The key
    findings of the study are as follows:


    1. **Innovative approaches for real-time system health assessment:** The authors
    identified the need for advanced monitoring techniques to ensure the robustness
    and reliability of automated irrigation systems, including resilience, fault tolerance,
    advanced monitoring techniques, closed-loop control, and addressing security concerns
    and risks in large-scale deployments.

    challenges encountered, and potential benefits of employing wireless sensor nodes
    for proactive fault detection and monitoring.


    3. **Effective fault detection and diagnosis methods:** The authors analyzed various

    In the face of escalating global food demand and the imperative need for sustainable
    agricultural practices, the fusion of technology with farming methodologies has
    emerged as a pivotal solution. With the advent of wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
    and their seamless integration into various industries, agriculture has witnessed
    a paradigm shift towards precision farming. In this context, the deployment of
    wireless sensor nodes presents a promising avenue for proactive fault detection
    and real-time monitoring within agricultural landscapes. The conventional agricultural
    practices, while effective, often lack the precision and responsiveness demanded
    by the dynamic environmental conditions and evolving crop health challenges. Addressing
    this gap, the use of wireless sensor nodes offers an innovative approach by facilitating
    continuous and granular data collection across vast agricultural expanses. These
    sensor nodes, strategically placed throughout fields, enable the monitoring of
    crucial parameters such as soil moisture levels, temperature fluctuations, humidity
    variations, and vital plant health indicators. Harnessing the capabilities of
    these sensors coupled with advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms,
    agricultural practitioners gain unprecedented insights into the intricacies of
    their farming ecosystems [1, 2]. This research endeavors to explore, analyze,
    and validate the efficiency of employing wireless sensor nodes as a cornerstone
    for smart fault detection in agricultural systems. By elucidating the technological
    framework, data acquisition methods, and the application of intelligent algorithms,
    this study aims to demonstrate the potential transformative impact of this technology
    on modern farming practices. Moreover, it seeks to address the challenges encountered
    in implementing wireless sensor networks in agriculture while highlighting their
    role in bolstering irrigation and fertilizer efficiency, predictive harvesting,
    minimizing crop losses, and fostering sustainable farming methods [3]. As the
    global population burgeons and the pressure on agricultural productivity intensifies,
    the need for innovative and proactive measures in farming becomes increasingly
    paramount. The integration of wireless sensor nodes stands poised to revolutionize
    the agricultural landscape, heralding a new era of precision, sustainability,
    and resilience in crop production. This paper endeavors to contribute to this
    unfolding narrative by providing empirical insights into the promising frontier
    of wireless sensor networks use for smart fault detection in agriculture, thereby
    reshaping the future of farming practices worldwide. In this research endeavor,
    the subsequent sections delve into various aspects of fault detection in the agricultural
    domain. Following the introduction, the second section meticulously examines the
    mechanisms and techniques employed for detecting defects, establishing a comparative
    analysis of their reliability and effectiveness. Emphasis is placed on the significance
    of using the WSN (wireless sensor nodes) technique while addressing the challenges
    it entails and offering potential solutions. Section three is dedicated to elucidating
    the motivation behind the robustness of WSN in contrast to contemporary and existing
    techniques for defect analysis and determination. The proposed methodology is

    results. Subsequently, in the sixth section, a detailed interpretation of these
    findings is presented, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed method in
    comparison to alternative models. Notably, limitations inherent in the approach
    are explicitly addressed, encompassing potential challenges, drawbacks, and constraints
    specifically related to the use of WSNs within this context. Additionally, the
    discussion encompasses prospective avenues for future research and enhancements,
    unveiling opportunities for further advancement. Finally, the conclusion section
    encapsulates the research outcomes and insights gained. 2 Literal Review 2.1 Position
    of WSN Over Models Agriculture is undergoing a significant transformation owing
    to technological advancements, with wireless sensor networks (WSNs) emerging as
    a critical tool for precision farming. This review aims to comprehensively analyze
    the role, challenges, and potential of WSNs in smart fault detection within agricultural
    systems. WSNs have revolutionized agriculture by enabling real-time monitoring
    of crucial environmental parameters. These sensor nodes, strategically positioned
    across fields, collect data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and plant
    health indicators. Their integration with IoT technologies facilitates seamless
    data transmission and analysis, empowering farmers with actionable insights for
    informed decision-making [4, 5]. Despite their potential, the deployment of WSNs
    in agriculture presents several challenges. Power management, data accuracy, network
    scalability, and interoperability among heterogeneous sensor nodes remain primary
    concerns. Moreover, environmental factors such as signal interference, harsh weather
    conditions, and geographical obstacles pose hurdles in maintaining reliable connectivity.
    As technological framework, advancements in sensor technology, data analytics,
    and machine learning algorithms have propelled the capabilities of WSNs in fault
    detection. Innovations in sensor miniaturization, energy-efficient designs, and
    data processing techniques have enhanced their reliability and accuracy in identifying
    anomalies, diseases, and irrigation issues in crops. Further more, as application
    and benefits, WSNs offer multifaceted benefits in agriculture. They optimize resource
    use by providing precise and localized information, thereby reducing water and
    fertilizer wastage. Early fault detection facilitates timely intervention, mitigating
    crop losses and improving overall yield. Additionally, these systems promote sustainable
    farming practices by minimizing environmental impact through targeted and optimized
    agricultural interventions. Thus, WSN play a pivotal role in agricultural fault
    detection and can be positioned in relation to various strategies commonly used
    in this domain. In Rule-Based Systems, WSN takes a complementary position. It
    can gather real-time data from agricultural fields or equipment, providing continuous
    input for rule-based systems. The WSN feeds data to these systems, enabling the
    application of predefined rules for fault detection based on the collected sensor
    information [6, 7]. In Statistical Analysis, WSN takes an integral component position.
    It provides the necessary data for statistical analysis by continuously collecting
    and transmitting sensor data. The sensor nodes contribute real-time data streams
    that form the basis for establishing statistical models to identify anomalies
    or deviations from normal patterns [8]. In Machine Learning Algorithms, WSN takes
    a fundamental component position. It serves as the primary data collection infrastructure
    for machine learning algorithms. The continuous data streams from sensor nodes
    are used to train and update machine learning models for fault detection, providing
    the necessary input for adaptive learning and pattern recognition. In Fusion of
    Multiple Techniques, WSN has an enabling component position. It acts as the backbone
    for collecting multi-source data necessary for integrating multiple fault detection
    techniques. It provides diverse sensor data, facilitating the fusion and integration
    of rule-based, statistical, and machine learning strategies for comprehensive
    fault detection. In IoT-Enabled Smart Sensors, WSN has an integral component position.
    It consists of smart sensors equipped with communication capabilities, forming
    the basis for real-time monitoring and data transmission essential for fault detection
    in agriculture [9, 10]. In Blockchain-Enabled Systems, WSN has a data source position.
    It contributes to blockchain-enabled systems by providing the data that needs
    to be securely stored and authenticated. It generates the sensor data, which can
    be securely stored on the blockchain to ensure data integrity and traceability.
    In Long-Range Wireless Technologies (LoRa), WSN takes an infrastructure position.
    It leverages long-range wireless technologies for communication between sensor
    nodes and gateways. These technologies serve as the communication infrastructure
    within WSNs, facilitating long-range data transmission from remote agricultural
    areas [11, 12]. Comparing the WSN approach with existing fault detection techniques
    in agriculture involves highlighting the advantages of WSNs over traditional methods
    or other contemporary technologies. Below, an analysis showcasing how WSN approach
    excels in comparison to existing techniques: For Real-Time Monitoring and Timely
    Detection: WSNs enable continuous, real-time monitoring of agricultural parameters.
    They offer immediate fault detection upon deviation from predefined thresholds
    or abnormal patterns, reducing response time and potential losses. Whereas, traditional
    methods, such as manual inspections, periodic checks, or testing equipment, often
    lack real-time monitoring capabilities. They might result in delayed fault detection,
    leading to increased downtime and losses [13]. For Data-Driven Precision and Accuracy:
    WSNs collect and analyze a vast amount of data from multiple sensors, facilitating
    precise fault detection through machine learning algorithms and data fusion techniques.
    This leads to accurate fault identification and reduces false positives or negatives.
    However, some existing techniques rely on simple rules or manual inspections,
    which might lack the depth of analysis or the ability to adapt to complex fault
    patterns, potentially resulting in less accurate detections. Concerning Cost Efficiency
    and Resource Optimization: while initial setup costs for WSNs might be higher,
    they offer long-term cost efficiency by minimizing losses through early fault
    detection, optimizing resource utilization (water, fertilizers, predictive harvesting),
    and reducing manual labor requirements over time. While, traditional methods might
    incur higher labor costs due to manual inspections or require periodic testing
    equipment maintenance, potentially leading to higher operational expenses in the
    long run. About the Scalability and Flexibility: WSNs are scalable and adaptable.
    Additional sensors can be integrated easily into the network, offering flexibility
    in expanding coverage or integrating new sensors for evolving fault detection
    needs. Unlike, some traditional methods might face limitations in scalability,
    especially when relying on manual labor or fixed testing equipment, making it
    challenging to adapt to changing agricultural requirements or expanding operations.
    For Comprehensive Fault Detection and Decision Support: the integration of diverse
    fault detection techniques within WSNs, such as machine learning, statistical
    analysis, and real-time data fusion, offers a comprehensive approach. This enables
    informed decision-making and actionable insights for farmers or stakeholders.
    But, other methods from existing techniques might lack the comprehensive nature
    of WSNs, focusing on specific fault types or lacking the ability to provide holistic
    insights based on real-time, multi-parameter data [14, 15]. Some stations highlighting
    the development and application of WSN in remote fault detection are mentioned
    below. From early 2000s: the concept of WSNs begins to emerge with the development
    of early sensor nodes like Telos, Mica, and Tmote Sky. The Support Vector Machines
    (SVM) as Machine Learning Models gain traction for classification tasks due to
    their effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data. From mid-2000s: creation
    of IEEE 802.15.4 Standard. The standardization of low-rate wireless personal area
    networks (LR-WPANs) lays the foundation for the development of WSNs for various
    applications, including agriculture. Decision tree-based models and ensemble methods
    like Random Forests gain popularity for their ability to handle classification
    tasks and interpretability [16]. From late 2000s to early 2010s: WSNs start being
    adopted in precision agriculture, focusing on soil monitoring, weather forecasting,
    and crop health assessment. Deep learning approaches, particularly neural networks,
    see a resurgence due to advancements in computational power and data availability.
    From mid-2010s: the integration of WSNs with the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem
    becomes prevalent, enabling seamless data collection, processing, and analysis
    from agricultural sensors. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and its variants (e.g.
    XGBoost, LightGBM) gain attention for their superior performance in classification
    and regression tasks [16, 17]. From late 2010s to early 2020s: increased adoption
    of cloud-based platforms for data storage, processing, and scalability in handling
    large volumes of sensor data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially long
    short-term memory (LSTM) networks, gain prominence for time-series analysis and
    prediction in agriculture, considering temporal dependencies in sensor data. Actually,
    recent developments focus on developing machine learning models that offer interpretability
    and explainability, such as Explainable AI (XAI), in detecting faults to aid decision-making
    in farming practices. Federated Learning explores federated learning techniques
    to train models collaboratively across different agricultural sites while preserving
    data privacy and security [18]. From another horizon, integrating blockchain technology
    into the realm of agricultural equipment and irrigation systems, especially concerning
    fault detection and data management, offers several potential benefits. Blockchain
    provides a tamper-proof and immutable ledger, ensuring the integrity of data collected
    by sensors in agricultural equipment. This feature prevents unauthorized alterations
    or manipulations, ensuring the authenticity of fault detection records.Through
    blockchain, every change or transaction recorded within the system can be traced
    back to its origin. This traceability can be valuable for tracking the history
    of faults detected in equipment or changes in irrigation systems over time. Blockchain''s
    decentralized nature enables secure data storage across multiple nodes, reducing
    the risk of a single point of failure and enhancing data security. Blockchain
    can facilitate controlled and permissioned access to sensor data. Authorized stakeholders,
    including farmers, agronomists, and maintenance personnel, can securely access
    specific data relevant to their roles. Smart contracts, self-executing contracts
    with predefined conditions, can automate tasks triggered by fault detections.
    For instance, when a fault is identified in an irrigation system, a smart contract
    could automatically trigger a maintenance request or adjust irrigation settings
    based on predefined parameters. Blockchain''s transparency can aid in tracking
    agricultural equipment and components throughout their lifecycle. This transparency
    ensures authenticity and reliability in the supply chain, allowing farmers to
    verify the origin and authenticity of equipment [19]. Implementing tokenization
    through blockchain could incentivize stakeholders for efficient equipment maintenance
    or early fault reporting. This system can reward participants with tokens or digital
    assets for contributing valuable data or maintaining equipment in optimal conditions.
    Blockchain can facilitate interoperability between different agricultural systems
    and platforms, allowing seamless integration of data from various sources. Standardization
    of data formats can enhance compatibility and collaboration among different stakeholders
    and systems. Blockchain-enabled systems can track environmental impact data associated
    with agricultural practices, including water usage, energy consumption, and carbon
    emissions. This transparency can help in adopting more sustainable and environmentally
    friendly practices [20]. Integrating blockchain technology into fault detection
    in agricultural equipment and irrigation systems requires careful consideration
    of implementation challenges such as scalability, interoperability, and regulatory
    compliance. However, leveraging blockchain''s inherent features can significantly
    enhance the security, transparency, and efficiency of fault detection processes
    in agriculture. According to the above descriptions, we have chosen to design
    an agricultural fault detection system based on a Delta-hybridization between
    WSN wireless sensor nodes, Block-chain and a Deep learning classifier ERSOM model
    that stands for Evolutionary Recurrent Self Organizing Map. 2.2 Node Principle
    A Node represents an autonomous real time computational system. It receives the
    signals through its integrated sensors and processes them using a Digital Signal
    Processor DSP. A sensor is a fundamental part of Smart technologies that functions
    as a transducer using various effects like capacitive or inductive (magnetic).
    A set of sensors, forming a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), collaborate autonomously
    to monitor and communicate information regarding potential issues. These autonomous
    microsystems communicate wirelessly in a designated space, known as a collector
    field. Nodes, equipped with high-end sensors, organize themselves into a self-structured
    topology, transmitting collected data to an information system or processing center,
    potentially via specialized nodes called “sinks.” Energy constraints, typically
    from small batteries, underscore the importance of managing energy as a critical
    resource in sensor nodes, making WSN technology pervasive and adaptable across
    diverse domains. In general, wireless sensors typically consist of various components
    including capture, processing, communication, and energy units. Depending on the
    application, additional elements like Global Positioning System GPS for environmental
    tracking or solar-powered mobility systems can be integrated. The resilience of
    WSN heavily relies on sensor material quality and precision. Despite their small
    size, nodes feature an efficient architecture incorporating multiple circuits
    on a single board, comprising detection units, microcontrollers, RF-antennas,
    and power units [21]. Further details on the internal structure of a node are
    depicted in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Architecture of wireless sensor node Full size image
    The detection unit comprises a set of sensors to assess information reliability
    from the environment; in case of sensor failure, it ensures data integrity. Sensor
    outputs link to the processing unit via anti-aliasing filters and an ADC for compatibility.
    This unit functions as the node''s core, managing internal operations, fault detection,
    energy, and coordination among WSN nodes'' processors. ROM and RAM storage support
    processing instructions, communication programs, and collected data. An RF antenna
    circuit enables communication between nodes, while the power unit''s lifespan
    relies on limited resources. External flash memory expands applications limited
    by chip memory, and internal I/O buses ease component communication within the
    node. An RF antenna is integrated at the node''s extremity. 3 Adopted Approach
    Our idea is to design a remote agricultural fault detection model offering better
    reliability and efficiency than those established by existing methods. This approach
    is based on the Delta-Hybridization between WSN wireless sensor nodes, Block-chain
    and a Deep learning classifier ERSOM model that stands for Evolutionary Recurrent
    Self Organizing Map. This last model represents the pivot of the analysis of the
    signals received by sensors. It revolves around a recurrent evolutionary algorithm
    of a self-organizing neural map with unsupervised learning, giving the possibility
    of processing a large volume of data. Recurrence is applied to this neural map
    in order to integrate the dynamic temporal aspect by adapting it to the ability
    to process and evaluate dynamic and not static data information. The fault detection
    and recognition algorithm carried out by this recurrent neural map will subsequently
    be considered a nucleus or an individual of population of iterations supported
    by an evolutionary genetic algorithm ensuring the extension of the search space.
    This insight allows to optimize results and avoid being trapped in an optimal
    static state. This algorithm will be managed by the DSP Mounted on the Sensor
    Node card. This algorithm will be managed by the DSP Mounted on the Sensor Node
    card. The processing result will be carried out based on a comparison between
    the primitives and singularities of the signal received from the system to be
    controlled and the data characterizing all types of faults from an archived database
    and updated at each event at the level of the Block-chain to which it is linked.
    This result will be broadcast in real time through the WSN to a master node linked
    by an HMI interface. The Blockchain and WSN models are detailed previously. The
    following Fig. 2 offers a view on the adopted strategy. Fig. 2 Typical used wireless
    sensor network Full size image RTU stands for remote terminal unit; terminal Node
    mounted on the system to be controlled. MTU stands for master terminal unit; terminal
    Node linked to human–machine interface HMI. The proposed terminal wireless sensor
    node RTU comprises capture, processing, communication, and energy units. The Sensing
    unit includes a physical capture device for local environment data and an Analog
    to Digital Converter (ADC) transforming analog signals into digital ones interpreted
    by the microcontroller. Memories store information from the capture unit. The
    communication unit, known as the Transceiver unit, handles wireless data transmission
    and reception. It can be optical, as in Smart Dust Nodes, or radiofrequency-based,
    with optical communication being robust against electrical interference but requiring
    a direct line of sight. Radio frequency units include modulation, demodulation,
    filtering, and multiplexing circuits. Sensor nodes equipped with various sensors,
    e.g., temperature, humidity, soil moisture, pH sensors, relevant to agricultural
    monitoring. These sensor nodes are distributed across the agricultural area, collecting
    real-time data continuously from the environment such as soil moisture levels,
    temperature variations, humidity, and other relevant parameters related to crop
    health and equipment status. Sensor nodes communicate wirelessly with each other
    and with a central base station or gateway, called sink, using communication protocols
    such as Long Range transmission LoRa. Wireless communication allows the collected
    data to be transmitted over extended distances to a centralized location for further
    processing and analysis. Data collected from various sensor nodes is aggregated
    and transmitted to a centralized system or cloud-based platform. In this centralized
    system, the received data undergoes processing, analysis, and storage for fault
    detection and decision-making. Advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms
    are applied to the collected data to identify patterns, anomalies, or deviations
    from normal conditions. These algorithms analyze sensor data to detect potential
    faults in agricultural equipment, irrigation systems, or anomalies in environmental
    parameters that could affect crop health. Once anomalies or faults are detected
    through data analysis, the system generates alerts or notifications to relevant
    stakeholders, farmers, agronomists, maintenance personnel, for timely intervention.
    Early warning systems or automated alerts enable proactive maintenance, minimizing
    the impact of faults on agricultural operations. It is important to highlight
    that the ERSOM neural model''s learning phase on an agricultural systems fault
    database might take several hours and can reach one day. The duration depends
    on factors such as the database size, model topology, neuron count, learning iterations,
    and stopping criteria. Once the model has learned and becomes proficient in identifying
    these faults, its real-time testing phase will be instantaneous during system
    control. The signal processing steps for the controlled part proceed as follows:
    Firstly, filtering, windowing, and segmenting the signal to extract primitives
    defining the contained information. Various methods define these primitives, such
    as the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) matrix. However, our approach
    opts for determining the primitives as Bi-spectrum matrices, as they are well-suited
    for characterizing highly transient stochastic signals. Thus, the Bi-spectrum
    designates an autocorrelation of order 2, called moment of order 2. Namely that
    the cross correlation is the measure of the analogy between two signals according
    to a time shift applied to one of them. One of the signals will be the signal
    measured by the sensors and the other signal is that of the database as a reference.
    The autocorrelation goes deeper to determine the coefficients of similarities
    between the measured signal and the reference one which resembles it better among
    the samples of signals in the database as a reference. The Bi-spectrum, as an
    autocorrelation of order 2, goes even deeper to be like a more selective filter
    in the determination of the similarity coefficients to a very precise default
    sample. Each matrix of bispectrum coefficients will be concatinated vertically
    in order to reduce it into a line vector, without loss of characteristics, which
    represents the input to our ERSOM model. It will be processed quickly to visualize
    the type of defects on one of the neurons, if any. The computation of the bi-spectral
    coefficients will be performed in the following manner: We examine a discrete
    signal x(n) obtained from the motor-pump machine, with a mean of zero and considered
    a locally stationary random process. The signal''s length, denoted as N, ranges
    from 0 to. N − 1. The expression for its autocorrelation function is as follows:
    $$ R_{xx} (m) = E\\left\\{ {x(n)x(n + m)} \\right\\} $$ (1) The calculated \\({\\text{E}}\\left\\{
    \\cdot \\right\\}\\), known as the mathematical expectation, represents the average
    within a set, serving as a statistical function with a discrete time-delay denoted
    as m. It is also referred to as the second-order moment. If the two signals are
    not correlated, we have the autocorrelation R = 0. In case of resemblance we obtain
    simularity coefficients. The Power Spectrum PS is determined by applying the Fourier
    transform (FT) to the preceding formula [22]. $$ P_{xx} (f) = \\sum\\limits_{m
    = - \\infty }^{ + \\infty } {R_{xx} (m)} \\,e^{ - j2\\pi fm} $$ (2) An alternalive
    formula can be used. $$ P_{xx} (f) = E\\left\\{ {X(f)X^{ * } (f)} \\right\\} =
    E\\left\\{ {\\left| {X(f)^{2} } \\right|} \\right\\} $$ (3) X* represents the
    conjugate of X(f), which computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of our
    primary current signal to be controlled, x(n). $$ X(f) = \\sum\\limits_{n = 0}^{N
    - 1} {x(n)} \\,e^{{ - j\\frac{2\\pi fn}{N}}} $$ (4) Additionally, we derive the
    bispectrum, referred to as bispectral density B(f1, f2), by applying a transform
    function (TF) to the third-order moment depicted in the equation below. $$ M_{3}^{x}
    (k,l) = E\\left\\{ {x^{ * } (n)x(n + k)x(n + l)} \\right\\}. $$ (5) The parameters
    k and l represent time delay points. Essentially, we need to estimate the expected
    bispectrum values from limited data using the following formula. $$ \\begin{aligned}
    \\hat{B}(f_{1} ,f_{2} ) & = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum\\limits_{k = 1}^{M} {X_{k} (f_{1}
    )X_{k} (f_{2} )X_{k}^{ * } (f_{1} + f_{2} )} \\\\ & \\approx E\\left\\{ {X(f_{1}
    )X(f_{2} )X^{ * } (f_{1} + f_{2} )} \\right\\} \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ (6) The
    sensor detects the fault signal x(n), which is subsequently processed by the processor
    within the suitable WSN node. This calculation involves setting f1 and f2 to an
    identical value, denoted as f, and is expressed as: $$ \\hat{B}(f_{1} ,f_{2} )\\left|
    {_{{f_{1} = f_{2} = f}} } \\right. = \\hat{D}(f) \\approx E\\left\\{ {X^{2} (f)X^{
    * } (2f)} \\right\\}. $$ (7) As exemple, considering a fracture defect in the
    bars of a motor-pump rotor estimated from research to constitute 10% of potential
    defects. The features of BRB related to this specific failure type include frequency
    components defined by the following Eq. (8) [22, 23]. $$ f_{BRB} = \\left[ {\\left(
    \\frac{k}{p} \\right)\\left( {1 - s} \\right) \\pm s} \\right]f_{s} $$ (8) Observing
    that the supply frequency is denoted by fs, the number of pole pairs by p, k represents
    a constant proportionality, and s signifies the rotor magnetic slip. Given the
    effects of speed ripple, it''s plausible that supplementary frequency components
    might appear in the stator current spectrum. Hence, an additional Eq. (9) could
    identify these components. $$ f_{BRBs} = (1 \\pm 2ks)f_{s} $$ (9) To identify
    rotor faults through its connected WSN node, analysis of the side-band frequency
    components at (1 ± 2 s)fs has been conducted. We establish that the lower sideband
    represents the primary fault frequency, while the upper sideband signifies the
    harmonic frequency of certain resultant velocity fluctuations. Consequently, we
    can use these two distinct values as effective control factors. To create a singular
    factor, we calculate their average, as shown below. $$ I_{dB} = \\left[ {20\\log_{10}
    \\left( {\\frac{{I_{l} }}{I}} \\right) + 20\\log_{10} \\left( {\\frac{{I_{r} }}{I}}
    \\right)} \\right]/2 $$ (10) Namely, I1 represents the fault module, Ir signifies
    the rotor current module, which is depicted by the upper sideband, and I represents
    the stator current module as the fundamental. Additionally, the stator current
    related to a mechanical BRB fault can be mathematically depicted. This model characterizes
    the stator current concerning electrical asymmetries in the rotor, generating
    what are known as sideband frequencies, expressed by the equation. $$ \\begin{aligned}
    i_{a} (t) & = i_{f} \\cos (\\omega t - \\varphi ) + \\sum\\limits_{k} {i_{l,k}
    } \\cos ((\\omega - \\omega_{f,k} )t - \\varphi_{l,k} ) \\\\ & \\quad + \\sum\\limits_{k}
    {i_{r,k} } \\cos ((\\omega + \\omega_{f,k} )t - \\varphi_{r,k} ) \\\\ \\end{aligned}
    $$ (11) where fs is the fundamental frequency of the electrical power. As \\(\\omega_{f,k}
    = 2ks\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega = 2\\pi f_{s}\\), the above expression will be:
    $$ \\begin{aligned} i_{a} (t) & = i_{f} \\cos (2\\pi f_{s} t - \\varphi ) + \\sum\\limits_{k}
    {i_{l,k} } \\cos (2\\pi f_{l,k} t - \\varphi_{l,k} ) \\\\ & \\quad + \\sum\\limits_{k}
    {i_{r,k} } \\cos (2\\pi f_{r,k} t - \\varphi_{r,k} ) \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ (12)
    The separated formula of the controlled current signal will undergo processing
    by the node''s microcontroller. It will then be compared to a healthy signal used
    as a reference to detect faults in machines.This procedure involves applying a
    transform function to the aforementioned equation to obtain the subsequent spectral
    relationship. $$ \\begin{aligned} I_{a} (f) & = \\frac{{i_{f} }}{2}\\delta (f
    - f_{s} )e^{j\\varphi } + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum\\limits_{k}^{{}} {i_{l,k} \\delta

    {i_{r,k} \\delta (f - f_{r,k} )e^{{j\\varphi_{r,k} }} } . \\\\ \\end{aligned}
    $$ (13) This mathematical model allows for further breakdown into basic elements,
    which are easily comprehensible for the WSN Node''s processor to handle [24].
    $$ \\begin{aligned} B(f_{1} ,f_{2} ) & = I_{a} (f_{1} )I_{a} (f_{2} )I_{a}^{ *

    \\end{aligned} $$ (14) Next, a numerical example simulation will be conducted
    to generate the bi-spectrum. The description of the experimental stator current
    is outlined as follows: $$ i_{a} (t) = i_{f} \\cos (2\\pi f_{s} t - \\varphi )
    + i_{l,1} \\cos (2\\pi f_{l,1} t - \\varphi_{l,1} ) + i_{r,1} \\cos (2\\pi f_{r,1}
    t - \\varphi_{r,1} ) $$ (15) Upon carefully selecting various parameter values
    from the preceding equation, the processor within the WSN Node of the respective
    machine, following the requested information routing at the collection node level,
    enables us to visualize curves labeled accordingly for power spectrum and bispectrum,
    depicted in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 Power spectrum PS and bi-spectrum of a node received
    signal [24] Full size image While this proposed approach offers significant advantages
    in agricultural fault detection, it is not without limitations. Overcoming these
    limitations and planning for future enhancements are pivotal to optimize WSN efficacy
    in agriculture. The constraints include issues such as limited battery life and
    energy consumption, data security and privacy concerns, scalability challenges,
    data management complexities, sensor accuracy reliability, implementation costs,
    and the need for interdisciplinary knowledge integration. To address these, advancements
    in low-power sensor technologies, robust encryption, improved scalability, efficient
    data processing, enhanced sensor reliability, cost-effective solutions, and interdisciplinary
    collaborations are essential. By focusing on technological advancements, refined
    protocols, and collaborative endeavors, WSNs can become more efficient, reliable,
    cost-effective, and user-friendly, ensuring widespread adoption and seamless integration
    into agricultural practices. A techno-economic study shows that implementing Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSNs) in agriculture offers multifaceted advantages, but a comprehensive
    cost–benefit analysis compared to traditional fault detection methods is essential
    to ascertain their overall value. Examining the cost–benefit analysis reveals
    numerous benefits of WSNs in agriculture, such as enhanced precision and efficiency
    in monitoring parameters, real-time data collection enabling timely interventions,
    reduced labor and operational costs, optimized resource utilization, and early
    fault detection capabilities. However, implementing WSNs involves costs related
    to hardware, installation, maintenance, and data management. When compared to
    traditional methods, WSNs showcase superior accuracy, cost efficiency in the long
    run, scalability, comprehensive coverage, and adaptability to changing agricultural
    needs. Despite the higher initial investment, WSNs prove to be more efficient,
    minimizing losses, optimizing resources, and offering real-time, accurate data
    for improved productivity and sustainability in agriculture. In a simplified qualitative
    perspective, WSNs exhibit higher accuracy, real-time capabilities, scalability,
    and potential for cost reduction over time, leading to a moderately high to high
    techno-economic score, whereas traditional methods may offer lower initial costs
    but could result in increased long-term operational expenses and potential losses,
    resulting in a moderate to low techno-economic score. 4 Experiment Results The
    experimental setup consists of the following components: A three-phase induction
    machine under the control of an ‘OMRON’ inverter. The rotor shaft is linked to
    a DC generator, connected to a rheostat for load control. Characteristics of the
    induction machine include: Nominal power: 4 kW Nominal speed: 1480 rpm Moment
    of inertia: J = 0.013 kg m2 Number of stove pairs: P = 2 SKF 6208 ball bearing
    with mechanical rotational frequencies: outer ring (fbext = 89.4 Hz), inner ring
    (fbint = 136 Hz), ball cage (fc = 9.94 Hz), and ball frequency (fbille = 58.4
    Hz). Using a Micro-log portable terminal for acquiring and storing sensor measurements.
    The sensor used is a piezoelectric accelerometer. The entire test bench is defined
    by Fig. 4 below. Fig. 4 Experimental bench Full size image Our ERSOM fault classification
    model was trained using an energetically balanced, locally developed database.
    This database comprises 100 signal samples obtained from the test bench, representing
    diverse failures such as mechanical, electrical, vibration, thermal, and physical
    issues, accompanying the normal signal. The neuron map consists of 100 neurons,
    and the ERSOM model was trained with a stopping criterion after 1000 iterations.
    Subsequently, during the control and testing phase, the ERSOM model analyzed the
    stator signal received from the machine, specifically depicting a mechanical fault
    in the ball bearing. The resulting output of the ERSOM model visualized the topology
    showcased in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 Visualization of the inner ring failure over ERSOM
    model Full size image The topology depicted by ERSOM revealed the presence of
    a ball bearing fault indicated by the frequency Fbi. This fault is accurately
    defined within the inner ring and is constrained by the cutoff harmonics Fn1 and
    Fn2, situated close to the Best Matching Unit (BMU) neuron linked to the fault.
    Additionally, further examination reveals the presence of the reasoning frequency
    Fre generated by the primary fault. Tthe character ‘h’ indicates a healthy signal.
    We plot the spectral amplitude of the processed signal and observe the curve in
    Fig. 6. Fig. 6 Spectrum of the inner ring failure Full size image The main fault
    occupies a frequency of 680 Hz and the two harmonics are present with a difference
    on either side of 25 Hz. This implies that Fn1 has a frequency of 655 Hz and Fn2
    is at a frequency of 705 Hz. In the same way we can see the curve which defines
    the bi-spectrum of the same machine when it is requested by the same frequencies
    of a failure, as shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7 The bi-spectrum of the inner ring failure
    Full size image Furthermore, using Bi-Spectrum analysis will aid in discerning
    the severity of faults. Referring to Fig. 7, it becomes apparent that the encountered
    peaks are extremely abrupt and lack any frequency breadth. In the same way, the
    rules determining the performance criteria of the fault classifier models which
    qualify the operation of the WSN Nodes are established as follows: a. Accuracy:
    measures the overall correctness of the model''s predictions. Its formula is expressed
    as follows [25, 26]: $$ {\\mathbf{Ac}} = \\left( {{\\text{TP}} + {\\text{TN}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {{\\text{TP}} + {\\text{TN}} + {\\text{FP}} + {\\text{FN}}} \\right)
    $$ (16) where TP = True Positives, TN = True Negatives, FP = False Positives,
    FN = False Negatives. Accuracy gives the ratio of correctly predicted instances
    to the total instances in the dataset. b. Precision: indicates the ratio of correctly
    predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations.
    It has the following formula: $$ \\Pr = {\\text{TP}}/\\left( {{\\text{TP}} + {\\text{FP}}}
    \\right) $$ (17) Precision focuses on the accuracy of positive predictions and
    indicates the model''s ability to avoid false positives. c. Recall (Sensitivity
    or True Positive Rate): Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations
    to all actual positives. It is defined by the following formula: $$ {\\mathbf{Recall}}
    = {\\text{TP}}/\\left( {{\\text{TP}} + {\\text{FN}}} \\right) $$ (18) Recall measures
    the model''s ability to identify all relevant instances, showing its sensitivity
    to true positives. d. F1-score: F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and
    recall. It provides a balance between precision and recall. It is calculated using
    the following formula: $$ {\\text{F1-score}} = 2*\\left( {{\\text{Precision}}*{\\text{Recall}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {{\\text{Precision}} + {\\text{Recall}}} \\right) $$ (19) F1-score
    considers both false positives and false negatives and is useful when the class
    distribution is imbalanced. The obtained indicators are presented in Table 1.
    Table 1 Evaluation of classifier models Full size table These findings are highlighted
    by the Fig. 8 represented in below. Wherein, It is remarkable that the proposed
    ERSOM model is clearly advantageous compared to other models. Fig. 8 Performance
    of different classifier models Full size image Based on the Fig. 8 curve, it''s
    evident that neural models, particularly the dynamic model RSOM and the evolutionary
    model ERSOM, hold superior positions in performance compared to others. Nonetheless,
    it''s worth noting that SVM has the potential to surpass both the Kmeans moving
    center algorithm and the static SOM model in terms of performance. 5 Results Discussion
    The ERSOM deep learning model’s topology, Fig. 5, reveals that among the 100 neurons,
    merely 2 neurons remain unoccupied. This signifies an impressive defect identification
    rate of 98% using this model. Thus, it offers a precise objective evaluation with
    a well-defined visualization. The ERSOM map identifies the anomaly on the inner
    ring, delineated by the frequency fbi signified by the winning neuron. Adjacent
    neurons signal frequencies fn1 and fn2, representing fbi + fc and fbi–fc, respectively.
    The indicator fre denotes the resonance frequency of the induction machine''s
    structure. The curve depicted in Fig. 6 represents the spectral amplitude of the
    signal under examination, which help us in mechanical inner ring defect identification.
    However, this assessment remains subjective and lacks defined scores for evaluation.
    The spectrum illustrated in the same Fig. 6, depicting the vibration signal from
    the sensor, discloses the following insights: The amplitude evolution of harmonic
    components follows a pattern such as (555 + k25) Hz, where k = 0, 1, 2, 3, …,
    representing frequencies resulting from the ball''s passage on the indentation.
    A substantial increase in amplitudes, approximately 100 dB around 780 Hz, signifies
    the resonance of the structure, possibly attributed to the 31st harmonic resonance
    of rotation (780.2/25 = 31.2). The identification of the 5th order harmonic (680.2/136 = 5)
    reveals the presence of a mechanical anomaly in the inner ring when observed in
    the spectrum''s zoomed mode. The Bi-spectrum plotted in Fig. 7 distinctly illustrates
    a resemblance to the outcomes presented in the ERSOM topology depicted in Fig.
    5. This similarity indicates that the ERSOM model, trained and tested using Bi-spectrum
    coefficients, aligns closely with the observed results. Consequently, this correlation
    strongly substantiates the accuracy and validity of the ERSOM deep learning model
    employed to steer the WSN Node. As depicted in Fig. 8, it''s evident that the
    ERSOM deep learning evolutionary model stands out significantly due to its efficiency
    compared to other models. This superiority is attributed to its integration of
    three essential criteria: evolutionaryism for broadening the search space, dynamism
    facilitated by a loop of recurrence that incorporates temporal aspects, and a
    neuronal aspect that mimics human thought processes. However, it''s important
    to note that this proposed model demands considerably more time during its unsupervised
    learning phase. Moreover, diverse outcomes arise from various fault detection
    strategies in agriculture: Rule-Based Systems: Swift fault identification using
    predefined rules, as seen in detecting irrigation system faults. Statistical Analysis:
    Identification of anomalies or outliers in soil moisture data, suggesting potential
    system issues. Machine Learning Algorithms: Improved accuracy in spotting subtle
    changes in crop health, aiding in early disease detection. Fusion of Multiple
    Techniques: Enhanced precision by combining strategies like rule-based systems
    and machine learning for fault detection. IoT-Enabled Smart Sensors: Real-time
    monitoring and rapid identification of temperature fluctuations, indicating potential
    crop damage. Blockchain-Enabled Systems: Ensuring secure and traceable records
    of fault detection through blockchain technology. Note that, Zigbee finds common
    usage in home automation, industrial control systems, and healthcare due to its
    cost-effectiveness and low power consumption. Meanwhile, Bluetooth enjoys widespread
    adoption in consumer electronics such as smartphones, audio devices, and wearables
    owing to its user-friendly nature and compatibility. The Internet serves various
    sectors, encompassing communication, commerce, cloud services, and IoT applications.
    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) excel in environmental monitoring, agriculture,
    and healthcare, offering real-time data collection from distant areas. Notably,
    WSN tends to have lower data rates but can cover extensive distances, while the
    Internet exhibits high return on investment ROI potential, particularly in business,
    communication, and data services. Comparably, Wireless Sensor Networks WSN technology
    can have a strong ROI in industries like environmental monitoring, healthcare,
    and agriculture due to their ability to gather data from remote or hazardous locations.
    However, using WSN for fault detection in agriculture encounters key challenges
    such as: Limited access to power sources in remote areas affects device lifespan
    and functionality. Varied landscapes impede signal transmission, affecting accuracy.
    Environmental factors impact sensor accuracy, requiring regular calibration. Efficiently
    handling large data volumes poses computational challenges. High deployment costs
    in vast agricultural areas need a balance for effectiveness. Security and protecting
    sensitive data during transmission is critical. Adapting WSN with existing systems
    is complex, requiring compatibility measures. As avenues for future research and
    improvements to reveal opportunities for further progress, we point out that advancements
    in sensor technology, energy efficiency, and tailored algorithms are crucial to
    overcome these challenges, realizing WSN''s full potential in precise agriculture
    fault detection. 6 Conclusion The WSNs are actually widely applicable in major
    emerging technology. We expressed, in this topic, the ability of the proposed
    Wireless Sensor Node strategy, which becomes a smart powerful tool in remote monitoring
    condition. Our approach is enriched by using the higher order spectrum called
    Bi-spectrum in primitive extraction and analysis of controled signal over an evolutionary
    recurrent self organizing deep learning model ERSOM. This model is implemented
    on the DSP of a Wireless Node Card. Our adopted approach is based on the Delta-Hybridization
    between WSN wireless sensor nodes, Block-chain and a Deep learning classifier
    ERSOM model to overcome some limitations and challenges experienced by traditional
    techniques. The practical application of this method for detecting agricultural
    defects demonstrates its resilience in analyzing these issues and making real-time
    decisions, showcasing promising results in comparison to current techniques. However,
    there are additional paths for further advancement in the future. Data Availability

    integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, offering innovative solutions
    to enhance crop management practices. This research focuses on leveraging IoT
    for the effective management of diseases affecting onion plants in agriculture.
    By employing a network of sensors, data analytics, and automated control systems,
    this study aims to create a smart agricultural framework that monitors, detects,
    and manages onion plant diseases in real-time. The research begins with a thorough
    investigation into the common diseases affecting onion crops and their associated
    environmental factors. Subsequently, a robust IoT infrastructure is designed and
    implemented, comprising sensor nodes for monitoring soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and other relevant parameters. These sensor nodes communicate data to
    a central hub, where advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms analyze
    the information to detect early signs of diseases. In response to disease detection,
    the IoT system employs automated control mechanisms, including precision irrigation,
    targeted application of agrochemicals, and the deployment of environmental control
    measures. The study also explores the integration of remote monitoring through
    mobile applications, allowing farmers to receive real-time alerts and make informed
    decisions promptly. Through field trials and data analysis, the effectiveness
    of the IoT-based disease management system is evaluated, considering factors such
    as disease suppression, yield improvement, and resource efficiency. The research
    also addresses economic considerations and the scalability of the proposed IoT
    framework for widespread adoption in onion cultivation. The findings of this study
    contribute to the advancement of precision agriculture and sustainable farming
    practices, demonstrating the potential of IoT in revolutionizing onion plant disease
    management. As the global demand for agricultural productivity increases, integrating
    smart technologies into traditional farming practices becomes paramount, and this
    research provides valuable insights for stakeholders in the agriculture and technology
    sectors.

    2019 1 Introduction Agriculture is the backbone of the country’s economy and food
    security, accounting for nearly 60% of India’s population [1]. This sector has
    historically adapted to changing climatic conditions and available resources to
    meet the ever-increasing food demands of a growing population [2]. However, the
    relentless pursuit of greater agricultural productivity often necessitates extensive
    use of pesticides, leading to complex challenges related to pest management, crop
    diseases, and environmental factors [3]. In recent years, the combination of agricultural
    mechanization and expanded farm acreage has made these challenges increasingly
    untenable for manual management. Farmers use a variety of pest control methods,
    ranging from manual pesticide application through backpack sprayers to indiscriminate
    spraying implemented through tractor-mounted systems [4]. Despite their effectiveness,
    these methods present inherent risks and require strict safety precautions [5].
    The advent of robotics and automation technologies has ushered in a new era in
    agriculture, offering innovative solutions to these challenges [6]. Agricultural
    vehicles with advanced capabilities, including navigation, detection, and operation,
    have emerged as indispensable assets in contemporary farming practices [7]. These
    vehicles can seamlessly execute a wide range of tasks, from basic agricultural
    operations to the early detection of plant diseases, which is an indispensable
    part of preventing widespread crop damage [8]. Conventional approaches to the
    identification and classification of plant diseases have traditionally relied
    on expert visual inspection, a method characterized by its cost and time-intensive
    nature [9]. However, technological advances, particularly in image and video processing,
    have paved the way for automation of disease detection and control [10]. These
    state-of-the-art technologies leverage the variations in crop color induced by
    invading pathogens to automatically detect and classify plant diseases [11]. This
    revolutionary development not only increases accuracy but also reduces the burden
    on labor and financial resources. In many developing countries, plant diseases
    are a serious threat to agricultural productivity and result in reduced crop quality
    and quantity. Automated systems designed for disease detection and control represent
    promising solutions for reducing these risks [12]. Moreover, the integration of
    automation in agriculture aligns with a critical need to ensure the safety of
    human operators. This system, combined with automation and robotics, reduces direct
    contact with harmful chemicals, minimizes manual pesticide application, targets
    pesticides using real-time sensor data, and enhances safety through remote monitoring,
    thus decreasing pesticide usage and exposure risks in agriculture. This study
    explored the integration of automation and robotics in agriculture, with particular
    emphasis on reducing pesticide use, increasing safety, and enhancing crop health.
    By surveying the current landscape of agricultural robotics and advances in disease
    detection and control, this study underscores the novel and urgent potential of
    these technologies to drive the transformation of modern agricultural practices,
    reduce environmental impacts, and strengthen food security. This study presents
    an analysis of modern agricultural technologies in Indian farming. We then explore
    innovative advances in disease diagnosis and productivity enhancement in Sect.
    2. The development of agricultural robots is described in Sect. 3, emphasizing
    health risk reduction as a part of the systematic methodology. An overview of
    the robot’s operation is provided in Sect. 4. A robot control flowchart is presented
    in Sect. 5, and the sprinkler irrigation system is discussed in Sect. 6. Section
    7 discusses the results and benefits of innovative resource management and cost-savings.
    We conclude Sect. 9 with a discussion of ways to reduce the environmental impact
    of agriculture. Both urban and suburban settings benefit from the system’s low-noise
    performance and environmental friendliness. In addition to providing a seamless
    and eco-conscious solution for urban and suburban environments, it offers the
    advantages of efficient and controlled irrigation. 2 Literature review The challenges
    of reducing the environmental and health consequences of agrochemicals and maintaining
    agricultural productivity have led to significant technological advances. Nicolopoulou-Stamati
    et al. [13] emphasized the adverse effects of agrochemicals on both human health
    and the ecosystem but acknowledged their role in ensuring food security. To address
    these critical concerns, researchers have pioneered innovative technologies aimed
    at reducing agrochemical effects and optimizing crop yields. Among these innovations,
    the dropleaf technique [14] uses water-sensitive markers to accurately estimate
    the coverage area, particularly during insecticide spraying. By enhancing the
    accuracy of pesticide application, this approach not only reduces waste, but also
    demonstrates the potential of employing environmentally sustainable practices.
    Kotkar et al. [15] proposed an automatic insecticide spraying system that uses
    convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms to diagnose plant diseases promptly
    and accurately. The combination of advanced machine learning techniques with agriculture
    has potential for targeted and effective pest management. Automation has found
    a place in this quest, as demonstrated by Suganya and Jayaranjani [16], who introduced
    a solar-powered agricultural machine that can streamline agricultural operations,
    thereby reducing dependence on renewable energy sources and the environmental
    footprint. Furthermore, Chand et al. [17] presented an intelligent multipurpose
    agricultural robot (MpSFR) that uses IoT and computer vision (CV) technology to
    perform tasks ranging from precision pesticide spraying to irrigation. Advances
    in automation and robotics have shaped modern agriculture. Chaitanya et al. [18]
    design an automated system for pesticide treatment with L293d motor driver, Raspberry
    Pi3 system and robot. This integration not only enhances efficiency, but also
    reduces human exposure to harmful chemicals. Recognizing the need for sustainable
    solutions, Ramesh et al. [19] emphasized the need for cost-effective solar-powered
    technologies to protect crops and reduce losses. Similarly, Chaudhary et al. and
    Olabanji, Olayinka Mohammed [20, 21] introduced an intelligent robotic insecticide
    spraying system that uses a Node MCU microcontroller as the core to reduce direct
    human contact with pesticides, while increasing productivity. Furthermore, the
    incorporation of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in agriculture, highlighted
    by Suganya et al. [22], has the potential to optimize resource use by providing
    accurate nutrient requirement estimates and enabling real-time monitoring of land
    and crop conditions, thereby reducing labor and input costs. The nexus between
    technology and agriculture promotes the development of sustainable and efficient
    agricultural practices. These advances, exemplified by Kumbhare et al. [23] and
    Sai Yeswant et al. [24], show promise in reducing the environmental impact, ensuring
    food safety, and enhancing occupational safety for agricultural workers. In this
    innovation landscape, this literature review emphasizes the importance of novel
    solutions that can reshape the future of agriculture. 3 Methodology This study
    provides a methodological framework for developing a robotic model designed for

    contemporary challenges in the agricultural sector. 4 Module description The system
    under consideration comprises of embedded C language, Arduino microcontrollers,
    power sources, DC motors, motor drivers, Bluetooth modules, and Automatic Speech
    Recognition (AMR) capabilities. In Fig. 2 shows the Proposed Assembling of Hardware
    Schematic. Fig. 2 Proposed assembling of hardware schematic Full size image 4.1
    Arduino controller The Arduino boards use AVR microcontrollers with varying amounts
    of flash memory, pins, and features as shown in Fig. 3. The 32-bit Arduino Due,
    based on the Atmel SAM3X8E, was introduced in 2012. The boards use pins or female
    headers that facilitate connections for programming and incorporation into other
    circuits. These may connect with add-on modules termed shields. Most boards include
    a 5 V linear regulator and a 16 MHz crystal oscillator or ceramic resonator. Some
    designs run at 8 MHz and dispense with the onboard voltage regulator due to specific
    form-factor restrictions. Fig. 3 Arduino controller Full size image 4.2 Power
    supply A power supply is a device that provides electrical or other forms of energy
    to an output load or group of loads. Typically, the term “power supply unit” or
    PSU is used to describe such devices or systems. Although power supplies can provide
    various types of energy, the term is most frequently associated with electrical
    power supplies, and less commonly with mechanical or other types of energy. The
    power supply section is an essential component that converts the incoming AC signal
    to a DC signal while reducing the signal’s amplitude. In particular, the AC voltage
    signal from the mains (230 V/50 Hz) needs to be converted to a DC voltage (with
    no frequency) with an amplitude of + 5 and + 12 V for various applications. This
    section typically includes a transformer and bridge rectifier, which are connected
    in series. The output is then passed through voltage regulators for + 5 and + 12
    V (7805 and 7812), connected in parallel via a capacitor (1000 µF ), as shown
    in the circuit diagram in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 Power supply circuit diagram Full size
    image Each voltage regulator’s output is again connected to a set of capacitors
    (100, 10, 1, 0.1) connected in parallel, from which the corresponding output (+ 5
    or + 12 V) is taken into consideration. Overall, the power supply section plays
    a crucial role in providing stable and reliable DC voltage signals to power the
    various components of the circuit. 4.3 DC motor A DC motor is a mechanical device
    that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. To understand the operating
    principle of a DC motor, it is essential to comprehend Fleming’s left-hand rule,
    which determines the direction of force on the armature conductors of a DC motor.
    According to this rule, when the index finger, middle finger, and thumb of the
    left hand are extended in a way that the current-carrying conductor is placed
    in a magnetic field (represented by the index finger) that is perpendicular to
    the direction of current (represented by the middle finger), the conductor experiences
    a force in a direction (represented by the thumb) that is mutually perpendicular
    to the direction of the field and the current in the conductor. Figure 5 shows
    the circuit diagram of the DC motor. Fig. 5 Circuit diagram of the DC motor Full
    size image 4.4 L293D IC motor driver The L293 and L293D are electronic components
    that function as quadruple high-current half-H drivers. These devices are capable
    of bidirectional drive currents of up to 1 A, with a voltage range of 4.5 to 36
    V. The L293 and L293D have a temperature range of 0 to 70 °C for operation. Each
    output of the L293 and L293D is a complete totem-pole drive circuit, consisting
    of a Darlington transistor sink and a pseudo-Darlington source. The drivers are
    enabled in pairs, with drivers 1 and 2 enabled by 1,2EN, and drivers 3 and 4 enabled
    by 3,4EN. The L293D IC Motor Driver is shown in Fig. 6 shows the circuit diagram.

    serial bluetooth module Bluetooth is a wireless communication technology that
    enables the interconnection of mobile phones, PDAs, and personal computers using
    short-range wireless connections. Bluetooth modules chips can be used to establish
    wireless communication between two devices, with each device having its unique
    MAC address. The HC-05 module, depicted in the Fig. 7, is an easy-to-use Bluetooth
    Serial Port Protocol module that facilitates a wireless serial connection setup.
    The module operates using the silicon radio BC417 2.4 GHz Bluetooth chip with
    CMOS technology and employs an external 8 MB flash memory. The HC-05 module requires
    a 3.3 V power supply. It is noteworthy that the HC-05 module is widely used in
    various applications, such as wireless control and data transfer, among others.

    study establishes that voice commands for the robot are analyzed via an android
    application and transmitted through Bluetooth [25]. After thorough deliberation,
    the research team opted for an Android OS interface as the speech processing platform,
    owing to its versatile and extensive functionalities. Furthermore, this platform
    facilitates a seamless and dependable association with the Google Speech processing
    libraries, ensuring seamless and precise speech recognition. Andriod application

    image 5 Flowchart for robot operation The operation of the robot using Bluetooth
    control involves several steps, which are illustrated in the flowchart in Fig.
    9. The following is a description of the steps: (1) Start: The process starts
    with the initiation of the robot system. (2) Initialize port: The ports of the
    system are initialized to ensure that they are ready to receive data. (3) Initialize
    Bluetooth: The Bluetooth module is initialized to enable wireless communication
    between the robot and the control device. (4) Wait for Bluetooth data: The system
    waits for data to be received via Bluetooth from the control device. (5) If data
    received (Yes/No): The system checks whether data has been received. If data has
    been received, it proceeds to the next step. If not, it goes back to step 4 to
    wait for data. (6) If Yes: If data has been received, the system executes the
    command received to move the robot and spray pesticide. (7) End: The process is
    terminated. Fig. 9 Flowcharts for robot operation Full size image This flowchart
    provides a clear representation of the steps involved in controlling the robot
    using Bluetooth. It enables easy understanding and implementation of the system
    by users, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the robot control system. 6 Construction
    of a sprinkler irrigation system The sprinkler irrigation system follows a systematic
    approach, drawing valuable insights from the flowcharts in Fig. 9, which were
    originally designed for robotic operation. This methodology ensures a well-structured
    developmental process. During the system design and planning phases, we used the
    logic of the flowchart to accurately determine sprinkler head positions, sensor
    placements, and irrigation coverage areas. During the hardware assembly, we interface
    the Arduino microcontroller with an embedded C code to establish control over
    the DC motors for precise movement. Inspired by the flowchart principles, we optimized
    the motor control, used Bluetooth for remote access, and integrated sensors, such
    as soil moisture and temperature sensors, to improve system intelligence. The
    sprinkler heads and piping were strategically placed for uniform water distribution.
    Optionally, Automatic Speech Recognition (AMR) can be used for voice control.
    Rigorous testing, motivated by the care of the flowchart, validates system functionality,
    followed by fine-tuning for optimization. After successful testing, the system
    was implemented and maintained for long-term irrigation. We adopted the structural
    approach from the robot operation flowcharts shown in Fig. 9 for our construction
    approach, as shown in Fig. 10. Our approach introduces innovations in irrigation
    technology through the use of a sprinkler irrigation system. By following the
    logic of the flowchart, we precisely planned and designed the system by strategically
    placing sprinkler heads and sensors. The hardware assembly is guided by flowchart
    principles, which include the Arduino microcontrollers, embedded C code, and precision
    motor control. Bluetooth communication improves remote access, and advanced sensors
    provide intelligent irrigation decisions that reflect a streamlined approach to
    robot operation. The sprinkler setup ensures a uniform water distribution, and
    for added innovation, automatic speech recognition (AMR) is integrated for voice
    control. Rigorous testing was used to verify the functionality of the system,
    followed by fine-tuning for optimal performance. With expansion and ongoing maintenance,
    this innovative sprinkler irrigation system ensures efficient and reliable irrigation.

  description: 'Smart management of weather data is an essential step toward implementing
    sustainability and precision in agriculture. It represents an important input
    for numerous tasks, such as crop growth, development, yield, and irrigation scheduling,
    to name a few. Advances in technology allow collecting this weather data from
    heterogeneous sources with high temporal resolution and at low cost. Generating
    and using these data in their raw form makes no sense, and therefore implementing
    adequate infrastructure and tools is necessary. For that purpose, this paper presents
    a smart weather data management system evaluated using data from a meteorological
    station installed in our study area covering the period from 2013 to 2020 at a
    half-hourly scale. The proposed system makes use of state-of-the-art statistical
    methods, machine learning, and deep learning models to derive actionable insights
    from these raw data. The general architecture is made up of four layers: data
    acquisition, data storage, data processing, and application layers. The data sources
    include real-time sensors, IoT devices, reanalysis data, and raw files. The data
    are then checked for errors and missing values using a proposed method based on
    ERA5-Land reanalysis data and deep learning. The resulting coefficient of determination
    (R2) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for this method were 0.96 and 0.04, respectively,
    for the scaled air temperature estimate. The MongoDB NoSQL database is used for
    storage thanks to its ability to deal with real-world big data. The system offers
    various services such as (i) weather time series forecasts, (ii) visualization
    and analysis of meteorological data, and (iii) the use of machine learning to
    estimate the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) needed for efficient irrigation.
    To this, the platform uses the XGBoost model to achieve the precision of the Penman–Monteith
    method while using a limited number of meteorological variables (air temperature
    and global solar radiation). Results for this approach give R2 = 0.97 and RMSE
    = 0.07. This system represents the first incremental step toward implementing
    smart and sustainable agriculture in Morocco.'

  explanation: The proposed system ingests data from multiple heterogeneous real-world
    sources, including weather data, IoT sensor data, reanalysis data, third-party
    meteorological services, and raw files and utilizes a NoSQL database for data
    storage. Missing data imputation is performed using a deep learning approach based
    on reanalysis data and AI to learn the relationship between ERA5-Land reanalysis
    data and ground-based meteorological station data, which is also useful for the
    surrounding regions to the study area. The system offers services such as weather
    time series data forecasting, anomaly and outlier detection using unsupervised
    machine learning methods, missing values handling using a multisource approach
    (reanalysis and in-situ data), estimation of parameters such as the evapotranspiration
    (ET) using machine learning and statistical models and data visualization and
    analysis of meteorological data.

    essential step toward implementing sustainability and precision in agriculture.

    and at low cost. Generating and using these data in their raw form makes no sense,

    1. Introduction Advances in technology and industry have helped humanity to increase
    life quality and expectancy. This includes delegating laborious processes traditionally
    performed by hand to machines that can perform these tasks more efficiently. However,
    it has brought with it several problems as well [1] relating to the overexploitation
    and nonrational use of Earth’s natural resources, which in turn causes disruption
    of the natural balance expressed by climate change effects, such as global warming
    and severe climate events (droughts, flooding, storms, hurricanes, etc.). In response
    to this alarming situation, humanity is asked more than ever to rethink and reconsider
    its way of dealing with the environment, especially in the context of a world
    population that grows at a higher rate [2]. This puts a lot of pressure on our
    food systems to meet the increasing demand and feed the planet. Agriculture is
    the sector that must be addressed, and agricultural management practices need
    to be optimized and become more efficient and sustainable to address these challenges.
    With water resources as an example, agriculture comes in as the largest consumer
    of this resource, with about an average of 70% in use around the world [3]. In
    this sector, water resources are used mainly in irrigation activities that still
    follow unsustainable methods such as gravity irrigation, the most widely used
    type of irrigation globally [4,5]. Additionally, even when using modern methods
    of irrigation, such as drip irrigation, they can be inefficient in the absence
    of good management [6]. The crucial step to achieving an efficient irrigation
    system, whatever the type of irrigation system used, is to know the proper amount
    of water to supply and the time to apply it (when and how much). To this end,
    we need to monitor either the soil, the crop, or the weather. Monitoring the weather
    enables the estimation of evapotranspiration (ET), which is the sum of transpiration
    from plants and soil surface evaporation. Accurately estimating this parameter
    allows compensation of the lost water quantity to the atmosphere. There are two
    methods of estimating the evapotranspiration of a crop. One uses a single crop
    coefficient (Kc) that incorporates all physiological and physical variations between
    the crops and the second where the Kc is split into two separate coefficients:
    Kcb for crop transpiration and Ke for soil evaporation. The Kc coefficient, then,
    is multiplied by the reference evapotranspiration (ET0), which reflects the rate
    of evapotranspiration for a specific crop (grass). It is obtained by monitoring
    various meteorological parameters (air temperature, solar radiation, air relative
    humidity, wind speed, etc.). Therefore, weather monitoring is a key step toward
    implementing efficient irrigation systems and ensuring sustainable agriculture.
    Today, we are able to collect weather data with high spatial and temporal resolution
    thanks to advances in science and technology, including advances in remote sensing
    such as the availability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) [7] equipped with cutting-edge
    sensors with affordable prices, satellite imagery with different spatio-temporal
    resolutions, open-access reanalysis data such as European ReAnalysis data [8],
    MERRA [9], the JRA-55 [10] or NCEP–DOE AMIP-II Reanalysis data [11]. Additionally,
    advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) field have enabled cost-effective sensor
    data acquisition [12,13,14,15,16]. This huge amount of data raised issues regarding
    the efficiency, complexity, interfaces, dynamics, robustness, and interaction
    between these new types of peer-to-peer connected systems that need to be re-examined
    on a large scale, as discussed in [17]. This unprecedented amount of generated
    data is also contributing to what is known as big data, which needs adequate infrastructure
    to be stored and gain insights for assisting agricultural decision making. This
    work aligns with this objective and is intended to provide intelligent ways to
    deal with these abundant data by applying the concepts of big data analytics and
    leveraging the potential applications of artificial intelligence in agriculture
    to help farmers minimize their risks, or at least make them more manageable, which
    represents a step towards the development of smart and precision agriculture.
    2. State of the Art Several researchers have tried to leverage the challenges
    and opportunities of the big data wave in the agricultural field and how it can
    be the driver of sustainability and precision in this sector by gaining insights
    from massive volumes of data that can be used to assist decision making. As surveyed
    in [18], big data analytics is leading to advances in various industries, but
    it has not yet been widely applied in agriculture. The work presents a range of
    suggested solutions, tools, algorithms, and data, including how they were used
    and their impact upon the sector as a whole. It also emphasizes the enormous potential
    of big data analytics in agriculture for smarter farming, demonstrating how the
    accessibility of big data analytics tools, methods, and software, as well as the
    growing openness of heterogeneous data sources (the “open data wave”), will encourage
    more academic research, public sector initiatives, and business ventures in the
    agricultural sector. The paper concludes that the adoption of big data practices
    in agriculture is still challenging and faces several obstacles when applied to
    real-world applications. In the paper [19], the authors developed a system composed
    of three components: (i) hardware to capture crop data, (ii) a web application
    for crop data and field information manipulation, and (iii) a mobile application
    to control irrigation via mobiles. The objective of this work is to analyze the
    suitability of crops in terms of air temperature, air relative humidity, and soil
    moisture to optimize future plans and strategies. The authors of the work [20]
    propose a solution to be adopted in India to help farmers face the unpredictable
    nature and variability of climate and weather circumstances. They built a system
    for managing local weather stations in real time that would keep farmers well-informed
    about the current weather conditions in advance, allowing them to make the right
    decisions at the right time and prevent crop loss. High-speed internet infrastructure
    available even in rural areas is the main motivation for conducting this work.
    It facilitates the communication of collected data to remote servers. Once received
    and analyzed, the information derived from these data gives farmers a way to automate
    their agricultural management practices (irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting)
    by triggering the right action at the right time. Article [21] also presented
    a smart weather station management system intended to be used in agriculture and
    to manage meteorological stations. It is based on Internet of Things technology
    (IoT) to minimize costs. The connected sensors measure air temperature, humidity,
    light intensity, air pressure, and wind speed. It then sends the collected data
    to the server part of the system through the Global System for Mobile Communications
    (GSM) module. The application layer is powered by the ThingSpeak platform, which
    offers standard services to the proposed system such as data visualization and
    data analysis. In regards to dealing with the challenges related to handling huge
    amounts of data generated by sensors, the paper [22] proposed a standard architecture
    for a data infrastructure platform called WALLeSMART, which is a cloud-based solution
    that provides a general architecture to handle the difficulties of gathering,
    processing, storing, and visualizing extremely large amounts of data in batch
    and real-time modes. An initial prototype has been developed and tested at various
    farms in the Wallonia region of Belgium, showing prominent results. This proposed
    system can be used as the basis for developing customized smart agricultural services
    to meet our needs. Our contributions not only propose an architecture containing
    some of the standard pipelines used in the literature to build data platforms,
    namely data acquisition, storing, visualizing, and analysis, but a complete system
    with the aim of going from data to decision making. The proposed system provides
    services such as weather time series forecasting, missing values handling using
    a multisource approach (reanalysis and situ data), and estimating important parameters
    needed in the day-to-day life of farmers, such as the evapotranspiration (ET).
    3. Study Area The study area is situated 40 km east of Marrakesh in the semiarid
    Haouz plain in the heart of Morocco (Figure 1). About 2800 ha of this area is
    irrigated, and it is nearly flat. Cereal crops such as wheat and barley are the
    main dominant crops. The region’s climate is typically Mediterranean semiarid,
    with an average annual rainfall of about 250 mm [23,24], temperatures that range
    from hot in the summer (38 °C in July) to cool in the winter (5 °C in February),
    significant daily and monthly variations that are concentrated primarily from
    autumn to spring, and an average annual ET0 of 1600 mm [25]. Figure 1. R3 district
    study area in Morocco and a Photo of the meteorological station installed. 4.
    System Architecture The proposed system is designed to enable the smart management
    of weather data, which represents the key to implementing smart agriculture. By
    monitoring and analyzing the weather effectively, we can optimize various agricultural
    management practices such as irrigation scheduling and choosing the appropriate
    crop to sow [26]. The design of the platform follows a service-oriented architecture
    (Figure 2) to offer services that address each of the four categories of big data
    analytics. As part of a descriptive data analysis that tries to understand what
    happened in the past, a scenario would be: rainfall declined, and the frequency
    changed over the last decade. The answer to why this happened, in turn, is very
    important, and it takes us to the diagnostic data analysis, where the focus is
    to identify anomalies in data to explain the reasons behind events, such as linking
    this event with long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns observed
    in weather evolution charts. The third type covered by the platform is predictive
    data analysis. It looks beyond the present and tries to predict the future using
    statistical methods and machine learning algorithms that learn from historical
    data in an iterative approach, trying to identify the optimal way to predict the
    future. One such service is weather forecasting. The output of the forecasting
    service can be used to support decision making about what actions to take that
    aim to prevent severe events from occurring in the future. This is carried out
    through the last type, which is prescriptive data analysis. Figure 2. General
    architecture of the platform. The platform can be decomposed into four main layers:
    the data acquisition layer, the data storage layer, the processing layer, and
    the application layer. 4.1. Data Acquisition Layer Heterogeneous data from a variety
    of sources, including meteorological station data, IoT weather sensors, reanalysis
    data, third-party meteorological services, and raw files (CSV, Excel, etc.), are
    used as the input for this layer. The concept of big data is introduced to the
    field by the volume, velocity, and variety that characterize these data. Missing
    values are handled in this layer using the method developed in Section 4.4.1 prior
    to being stored in the NoSQL MongoDB database. 4.1.1. Weather Station Data The
    weather dataset used in this study was collected from a meteorological station
    installed in the study area (Figure 1) at the half-hour scale from 2013 to 2020.
    The used tower is equipped with different sensors [27,28] to measure: Incoming
    solar radiation using (Kipp and Zonen CM5 Pyranometer, Delft, The Netherlands).
    Air temperature in Kelvin, relative humidity (R3_Hr, as a fraction between 0 and
    1) and vapor pressure by using (HMP45C, Vaisala, Helsinki, Finland). Wind speed
    using (A100R Anemometer, R.M. Young Company, Traverse City, MI, USA). Rainfall
    using (FSS500 Tipping Bucket Automatic Rain Gauge, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan,
    UT, USA). Next, records are stored in data loggers before being collected manually
    by agents or sent to a centralized server via a cellular connection. A full description
    of these data is shown in Table 1, which also includes statistics for missing
    values. Table 1. Meteorological station data description. 4.1.2. ERA5-Land Reanalysis
    Data Advances in measurement technologies have enabled us to use various observation
    methods to monitor the Earth’s weather, including weather stations, weather balloons,
    and satellite imagery, to name a few. However the distribution of these observation
    methods does not cover the entire globe, they may have overlapping footprints
    between covered areas, and fewer of them were available in the past, which makes
    it challenging to conduct studies of past years. To deal with this, climate reanalysis
    emerges as a new way of trying to deliver a complete picture of the past and of
    the entire globe by combining the laws of physics, modern weather models, and
    available weather sources. Such data, if accurate, are crucial and will certainly
    assist decision making in several domains such as smart cities, smart management
    of renewable energy stations, sustainable and climate-smart agriculture [29,30],
    climate change assessments, hydrology [31], and much more. In our study, we used
    the fifth generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5-Land) [32] available to be downloaded
    for free through the Climate Data Store (CDS) web platform [33]. ERA5-Land is
    the successor to ERA5 [8], which in turn is the successor to ERA-Interim [34].
    This new product covers the period from 1950 to the present. ERA5-Land has the
    benefit over the predecessors of its high horizontal resolution (9 km against
    31 km for ERA5 and 80 km for ERA-Interim). These strengths were achieved thanks
    to the integration of the ECMWF land surface model forced by the ERA5 climate
    reanalysis with corrected elevation for the thermodynamic near-surface state and
    then applied to Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. The data used in this
    study concern the two pixels that cover our study area (Figure 3). We downloaded
    ERA5-Land weather data from 2013 to 2020. Since the cloud service Climate Data
    Store API (cdsapi) has a limit of 100,000 records per request, we downloaded each
    year separately and combined them all at the end. The downloaded data were then
    converted to a pandas dataframe data structure using the Python language. We also
    developed a function called “get_era5_land_grib_as_dataframe”, available as a
    part of the GIS class of the public library Data Science Toolkit (DST) [35] that
    accepts an ERA5-Land grip file as a parameter and returns a pandas dataframe,
    which is the most commonly used data structure in the data science field. The
    full description of the downloaded parameters is described in Table 2. Figure
    3. The projection of ERA5-Land pixels over the study area. Table 2. ERA5-Land
    downloaded data description. 4.2. Data Storage Layer In our system, most of the
    collected data are time series (meteorological data, reanalysis data, satellite
    data, etc.). This type is characterized mainly by variety (multisource), volume,
    and velocity (each half-hour). To deal with this, the system uses MongoDB, a big-data-driven
    database for storing and retrieving meteorological data. The choice of using the
    MongoDB database comes after several strengths it presents and its suitability
    for our use case, including that it was designed to replace or enhance the classic
    Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), providing it with a variety of
    additional characteristics such as scalability being schema-less. It is also powerful
    at handling large amounts of real-time data and efficiently handling memory, as
    it is written using the C++ programming language. Not to mention the geospatial
    indexing feature, which makes it perfect for real-time geospatial data collection
    and analysis. Figure 4 shows the Entity Relationship Diagram of the weather data
    subcomponent. Figure 4. The Entity Relationship Diagram used in the climate database
    design; ta: air temperature (R3_Tair), rg: global solar radiation (R3_Rg), hr:
    air relative humidity (R3_Hr), p: rainfall (R3_P), ws: wind speed (R3_Vv), wd:
    wind direction (R3_Dv). 4.3. Data Processing Layer The data processing layer takes
    the data from the data storage layer as input and applies the statistical, machine
    learning, and deep learning models to gain insights from the data and turn that
    into services (Figure 2). 4.3.1. Statistical Models Statistical models are used
    in this platform for forecasting purposes. Initially, the model Facebook Prophet
    [36] was used to conduct long-term weather time series forecasting, since it was
    tested on the same data in previous work. 4.3.2. Machine Learning Models The system
    also makes use of machine learning models, given the fact that they can perform
    well on small datasets, for example, the XGBoost [37] model for reference evapotranspiration
    estimation based on stored metrological data [38]. 4.3.3. Deep Learning Models
    Deep learning models or neural networks have gained success in solving complex
    tasks that were previously human-specific and have required some level of human
    intelligence to be solved in different fields. They derive their power by trying
    to mimic the way the human brain works. They are composed of neurons able to process
    huge amounts of data in order to map the output from a set of inputs using internal
    mathematical operations. These neurons are organized into groups called layers
    and, during the propagation of signals between layers in two senses (Forward and
    backpropagation), the deep learning network learns to perform tasks. In our case,
    this is a regression task, where the input is ERA5-Land reanalysis data and the
    output is meteorological station data. 4.4. Application Layer The application
    layer contains multiple services related to weather times series. 4.4.1. Time
    Series Data Imputation Service It is common in real-world meteorological data
    to have missing values for various reasons. Missing values can be due to a network
    error or due to technical issues with certain measurement sensors, etc. These
    missing data can affect the performance of any type of model (machine learning,
    numerical, physical, etc.). As such, they need to be identified and handled efficiently
    during the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing stages. There are
    several techniques for dealing with missing data depending on the use case: Deletion:
    Deleting rows or columns with missing values will remove this unwanted type of
    data from our dataset, but it may drastically reduce the size of the dataset,
    especially in the context of data scarcity. Imputation in time series data: In
    the case of a time series with a trend and seasonality, missing data can be replaced
    using seasonal adjustment, such as using the data from the same period of the
    previous year, which is the case for most weather data. However, this method may
    not be as efficient due to changes in weather patterns around the world. In contrast,
    if the time series do not present a trend or a seasonality, it can be treated
    the same way as imputation for a normal dataset. Imputation in normal datasets:
    Replacing it using statistical measures of central tendencies such as the mean,
    median, or mode of a given window of data that require some assumptions about
    the distribution type of the data to be efficient. This service proposes an approach
    based on reanalysis data and artificial intelligence to build models that can
    learn rules to map ERA5-Land reanalysis data to station meteorological data, which
    is also useful for the surrounding regions of our study area (Section 3), since
    we are in relatively homogeneous areas in terms of elevation and climate. We use
    the ERA5-Land data presented in Section 4.1.2 and two different architectures
    of deep learning models. The steps to implement the method workflow are shown
    in Figure 5. Figure 5. The flowchart of the deep learning approach. a. Exploratory
    data analysis Before implementing the proposed machine learning approach, exploratory
    data analysis (EDA) was the first exercise we conducted. It enabled us to understand
    our collected data, as well as to create hypotheses for further analysis and investigation.
    In this step, we made no underlying assumptions about the variables, and we were
    guided only by the observed data. We first calculated the correlation matrix (Figure
    6). This matrix allowed us to choose potential estimators for each target variable.
    Table 3 shows in the second column the potential estimators based on correlation
    coefficients (|r| > 0.5 means high relationships between variables). In the third
    column are the estimators that are used in the literature. Figure 6. The correlation
    heatmap and hierarchical clustering of the station and ERA5-Land parameters. Table
    3. Potential estimators of meteorological parameters. The variable 𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟 in
    the matrix is calculated using the rule of thumb (Equation (1)), which uses both
    air temperature ( 𝑡2𝑚 ) and dewpoint temperature ( 𝑑2𝑚 ) to estimate air relative
    humidity efficiently for moist air (relative humidity above 50 percent) [39].
    According to the matrix, 𝑅3_𝐻𝑟 has a high negative correlation with 𝑡2𝑚 but a
    very weak correlation with 𝑑2𝑚 . Despite this, using the latter ( 𝑑2𝑚 ) combined
    with 𝑡2𝑚 gives a correlation of 0.87 for 𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟 instead of −0.77, if we take
    only 𝑡2𝑚 into consideration. This motivated us to take both variables as input
    to neural networks for the estimation of 𝑅3 _ 𝐻𝑟 . This is also a confirmation
    for other rule-based (physics-based) approximations that use the same variables
    for air relative humidity estimation derived from the Magnus formula [40] (Equation
    (2)). 𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟=100−5(𝑡2𝑚−𝑑2𝑚) (1) 𝑑2𝑚= 𝜆(ln( 𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟 100 ))+ 𝛽.𝑡2𝑚 𝜆+𝑡2𝑚 𝛽−(ln(
    𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟 100 )+ 𝛽.𝑡2𝑚 𝜆+𝑡2𝑚 ) (2) Equation (2) is valid for air temperatures ranging
    from −45 to 60 degrees Celsius, the Magnus parameters are, in this case, 𝛽 = 17.62
    and 𝜆 = 243.12 degrees Celsius. For global solar radiation ( 𝑅3_𝑅𝑔 ), the study
    uses the surface solar radiation downwards (ssrd) as estimator. Since the objective
    is to predict meteorological station data based only on ERA5-Land data, we evaluated
    the performance of two deep learning models, namely a Feed Forward Neural Network
    (FFNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to predict 𝑅3_𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑟 given 𝑡2𝑚 , 𝑅3_𝑅𝑔
    given the ssrd, and 𝑅3_𝐻𝑟 given 𝑡2𝑚 and 𝑑2𝑚 . b. Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN):
    In this type of neural network, the input signals (ERA5-Land data) are fed into
    the input layer composed of 100 neurons. In each neuron, the data are processed,
    taking the weighted sum of inputs plus a bias and then applying an activation
    function (Figure 7), before forwarding the output to the next layer. The activation
    function introduces nonlinearity to the output. The choice of this function has
    a real impact on the training process and performance of models and must be chosen
    according to the problem at hand. For example, sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent
    activation functions (Equations (3) and (4)) can be used to capture nonlinearity
    that may exist between inputs and outputs. Figure 7. A single neuron model. For
    our case, and given the fact that moving from ERA5-Land reanalysis data to meteorological
    station data is the inverse of inference in statistics, that is, estimating the
    mean of an individual (station data) given the mean of the population (ERA5-Land
    pixels), the error with this assumption is supposed to be linear (polynomial of
    degree one); that said, we used the Rectified Linear Unit function (ReLU) (Equation
    (5)) as the activation function in our neural network layers, which is true for
    both proposed architectures (FFNN and LSTM). 𝑦=𝑓(𝑥)= 1 1+ 𝑒 𝑥 (3) 𝑦=𝑓(𝑥)=tanh(𝑥)=
    𝑒 𝑥 − 𝑒 −𝑥 𝑒 𝑥 + 𝑒 −𝑥 (4) 𝑦=𝑓(𝑥)=𝑚𝑎𝑥(0,𝑥)={ 0, x, if𝑥<0 if𝑥≥0 (5) c. Long Short-Term
    Memory (LSTM): The choice behind using this neural network as a comparison is
    due to its ability to deal with data that have long-term dependency, which is
    the case for climate data. LSTM belongs to the Recurrent Neural Networks family
    (RNN), and therefore also has an internal recurrence, that is, during the learning
    process, a signal is fed back to a neuron or layer that has already received and
    processed it (Figure 8), as well as its ability to remember data through gated
    cells, which are a kind of memory that accept values in the interval [0, 1] and
    are used to decide when the flow of a signal passes through the corresponding
    neuron. LSTM was first developed to resolve the limitations of the vanishing [41]
    and exploding gradient problems that may occur during the training phase. This
    problem stops the learning of the neural network because the updates to the various
    weights become very small. Figure 8. Architectures of FFNN and LSTM used in the
    approach. These two architectures (Figure 8) are trained using the Mean Squared
    Error (MSE) as a loss or cost function that enables calculating the error of a
    network at the end of a forward pass. To optimize the network weights, we used
    the adaptive moment estimation optimization algorithm (Adam), which is characterized
    by fast convergence to the optimal solution and combines the strengths of other
    optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and RMSProp
    during the training phase. Like most other optimization algorithms, Adam uses
    the partial derivative during backward propagation to calculate the error function
    with respect to each weight within the network (Equation (6)). The Adam algorithm
    then updates the network weights for a minimized loss or cost function using rules
    in Equations (7), (8) and (9), respectively. 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑= ∂𝐽 ∂𝜃 (6) 𝑚 𝑡 = 𝛽 1 𝑚 𝑡−1 +(1−

    (9) d. Data normalization Data normalization is performed as part of the data
    preprocessing step and is the process of bringing data to a similar scale. The
    process is also known as feature scaling. In some cases, such as for statistical
    machine learning models, it may not be beneficial, but for deep learning models,
    it is proven to help models to perform better [42,43] in terms of faster convergence,
    reduced training time, and improved stability (preventing models from oscillating
    or divergence). There are multiple methods for data normalization: Min–max standardization:
    Min–max scales the feature values between [0, 1], with 0 being the feature’s minimum
    value and 1 being its maximum value, while maintaining the original distribution
    (Equation (10)). 𝑥 𝑛𝑒𝑤 = 𝑥−𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑥) 𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑥)−𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑥) (10) Decimal scaling: This form
    of scaling is used where values of different decimal ranges are present. For example,
    two features with different bounds can be brought to a similar scale using decimal
    scaling (Equation (11)) 𝑥 𝑛𝑒𝑤 = 𝑥 10 𝑛 (11) Such that n is an integer representing
    the order of the scalings. Z-score: This transformation scales the value toward
    a normal distribution with a zero mean and unit variance using the z-score formula
    (Equation (12)). 𝑥 𝑛𝑒𝑤 = 𝑥−𝜇 𝜎 (12) such that 𝜇 is the mean and 𝜎 is the standard
    deviation of the features’ distribution. This method is very efficient for datasets
    with a Gaussian distribution. In our case, we applied the min–max method (Equation
    (10)). Next, we initialize the hyperparameters of the two proposed architectures
    (Table 4). These parameters are not updated during the learning phase. Table 4.
    Hyperparameters used during the training of FFNN and LSTM models. e. Dataset splitting
    Before training begins, we split our dataset into three sets: training, validation,
    and test sets. The validation set is used to assess the performance of the model
    during each epoch of the training phase. Next, the test set is used to evaluate
    the final trained model. We used 80–20% splitting for the training–test sets,
    respectively, and took 20% of the 80% for the validation set. f. Evaluation Metrics
    To evaluate the trained deep learning models’ performance on the test dataset,
    we employed the most commonly used metrics for regression tasks (Equations (13)–(16)):
    Training time: The time it takes for the model to complete 20 epochs. R2 score
    or R2: The coefficient of determination informs about how well the unknown samples
    will be predicted by our model. It ranges between 0 and 1, but it can be negative
    as well (Equation (13)). R 2 =1− ∑ 𝑛 1 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 ) 2 ∑ 𝑛 1 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̲ 𝑖 )
    2 (13) The Pearson correlation coefficient (R): It measures the linear relationship
    between two normal distributed variables (Equation (14)). R= ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑥
    ̲ )( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̲ ) ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑥 ̲ ) 2 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̲ ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − −
    − − − − − − − − √ (14) Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The average of the squares
    of the errors between real and predicted values by the model (Equation (15)).
    RMSE= 1 𝑛 ∑ 1 𝑛 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − −  ⎷   (15) Mean
    Absolute Error (MAE): This is the average of absolute errors between real and
    predicted values (Equation (16)). MAE= ∑ 𝑛 1 | 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 | 𝑛 (16) Given the
    fact that we applied the scaling in our data using the formula in Equation (10),
    all metrics (from Equations (13) to (16)) are unitless. 4.4.2. Forecasting Service
    The forecasting service helps make projections of the future state of the atmosphere
    (air temperature, air relative humidity, global solar radiation, etc.) by performing
    a univariate time series forecasting task. The Facebook Prophet model is used
    according on the performance it has provided when trained and evaluated using
    the same meteorological dataset to perform long-term weather forecasting tasks.
    4.4.3. Climatic Parameters Calculation and Estimation Service One of the most
    important agricultural practices in the day-to-day life of a farmer is irrigation.
    To achieve efficiency, we need to accurately estimate crops’ water needs at each
    phase of crop growth throughout the agricultural season. This can be performed
    through several methods, among others is the estimation of the evapotranspiration
    (ET). It indicates the amount of water loss caused by transpiration from the crop
    and soil surface evaporation. We can obtain the ET of a crop (ETc) by multiplying
    the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and crop coefficient Kc, which holds all
    the physical and physiological differences of a given crop. This service proposes
    to estimate the ET0 using machine learning, namely the XGBoost model constrained
    by the physical model FAO Penman–Monteith. The proposed approach follows the steps
    presented in Figure 9. First, we resampled the air temperature, global solar radiation,
    air relative humidity, and wind speed to the daily average, and precipitation
    to the cumulative daily values, and then the missing values were deleted. Figure
    9. The flowchart of the proposed method. To select the most important contributor
    variables to the ET0 estimate, the method uses a random-forest-based technique
    that ranks the importance of features based on their occurrences in nodes across
    all trees: the bar chart (Figure 10) shows sorted meteorological variables’ importance
    scores. Next, the dataset containing meteorological data and the corresponding
    FAO Penman–Monteith ET0 estimated values are split and fed into the XGBoost model,
    and the model is then evaluated. Figure 10. The features’ importance bar chart
    of meteorological parameters. The objective of this service is to provide an alternative
    to the FAO Penman–Monteith calculation procedure by learning the behavior of this
    procedure using a limited number of climatic variables (Figure 11). It is either
    suitable for stations that lack the necessary hardware and sensors to provide
    the entire set of meteorological data required for FAO Penman–Monteith or in the
    case of technical problems with sensors, among other things. Figure 11. The logic
    of the Evapotranspiration estimation component. 4.4.4. Weather Data Analysis and
    Visualization Service It is well-known that data in their raw form are useless,
    but the information, knowledge, and wisdom derived from them are not. Moving from
    one state of data to another is known as Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD),
    which is a subset of the modern data science field and can be performed using
    various methods, such as CRISP-DM [44], which stands for CRoss-Industry Standard
    Process for Data Mining, or the proposed standard method in [45]. One example
    of insights data visualization and analysis which can be given in our use case
    is shown in Figure 12. This is achieved by following a hybrid methodology that
    includes the following steps: collecting, storing, cleaning, visualizing, analyzing,
    and mining. Figure 12. An example of the data analysis scenario. The first three
    steps are common for all other services available on the platform. The added value
    of this service is providing different types of visualization options, including
    comparison plots (line charts of weather time series), relationship plots (scatter
    plot of weather data), and automatically generating correlation heat maps, which
    are important steps in the data analysis phase to study how one variable affects
    another. 4.4.5. Custom Early Warning Alerts Service This service is classified
    as an outlier or anomaly detection problem. These special types of data can be
    detected in time series by using, among others, rule-based methods, in which case
    the service alerts administrators via SMS and email once the given condition is
    satisfied. An example of such a condition is a threshold of temperature or rainfall.
    The second method of sending warnings is to identify sequences that are notably
    different from the rest of the historical time series data. These sequences can
    be the result of measurement error or noise and can inform administrators about
    the status of the different sensors installed in the meteorological station and
    inform them about events that could require urgent action. To perform this, we
    use unsupervised machine learning methods that do not require an annotated series
    of anomalies to be trained, in contrast to supervised machine learning algorithms.
    The unsupervised method we used is Local Outlier Factor ( 𝐿𝑂𝐹 ) [46]. It uses
    the KNN algorithm principle to calculate the distance of a point with respect
    to its neighbors. This distance is used, in turn, to obtain the Reachability Density
    ( 𝑅𝐷 ) (Equation (17)). 𝑅𝐷( 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑗 )=𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝐾−𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒( 𝑥 𝑗 ),𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒( 𝑥 𝑖 ,
    𝑥 𝑗 )) (17) Next is measuring the local deviation of the density of a given point
    using Local Reachability Density ( 𝐿𝑅𝐷 ) (Equation (18)), which tells us how far
    the point is from the nearest dense cluster of points. 𝐿𝑅 𝐷 𝑘 (𝑥)= 1 ∑ 𝑥 𝑗 ∈ 𝑁
    𝑘 (𝑥) 𝑅𝐷(𝑥, 𝑥 𝑗 ) || 𝑁 𝑘 (𝑥)|| (18) where 𝑁𝑘(𝑥) is the number of neighbors of
    x whose distance from x is not greater than the k-distance. As a final step, the
    algorithm calculates the 𝐿𝑂𝐹 (Equation (19)). Conventionally the points that have
    a higher anomaly score than their neighbors 𝐿𝑂𝐹 > 1) will be considered as potential
    outliers, but that is not always true, since in anomaly detection there is no
    clear and standard validation approach, and the final decision must relies on
    domain expertise to consider the detected point as an outlier or not, and the
    role of the service ends by notifying the administrators and letting them decide.
    𝐿𝑂 𝐹 𝑘 (𝑥)= ∑ 𝑥 𝑗 ∈ 𝑁 𝑘 𝐿𝑅𝐷( 𝑥 𝑗 ) || 𝑁 𝑘 (𝑥)|| × 1 𝐿𝑅 𝐷 𝑘 (𝑥) (19) 5. Results
    and Discussions 5.1. Time Series Data Imputation As a result, for handling missing
    data using deep learning, Figure 13 shows the curves for the loss function (MSE)
    and R2 in both training and validation sets during each epoch. For both architectures
    (FFNN and LSTM), the learning curves indicate a good fit of the model represented
    by an initially high training loss that steadily decreases as more training instances
    are added and flattens over time (0.04 for air temperature, 0.098 for global solar
    radiation, and 0.116 for air relative humidity), and the same way for R2, which
    begins with nonoptimal values in training and validation and converges to stable
    change (0.96 for air temperature, 0.84 for global solar radiation, and 0.77 for
    air relative humidity). Table 5 shows the performance comparisons between the
    two deep learning architectures used in the test set. Figure 13. Monitoring of
    MSE and R2 during training and validation phases: air temperature: (a) FFNN, (b)
    LSTM, global solar radiation: (c) FFNN, (d) LSTM, air relative humidity: (e) FFNN,
    (f) LSTM. Table 5. Performance of deep learning models. Table 5 shows the performance
    comparisons between the two deep learning models used in the test set. Once trained,
    the final deep learning model will be ready for deployment in the production environment
    and used to make inferences about meteorological station data given the ERA5-Land
    data. In contrast to Numerical Methods for Weather Prediction (NWP), which take
    considerable time to run [47], predictions based on our model are made instantly.
    5.2. Climatic Parameters Calculation and Estimation We split our dataset into
    five randomly shuffled parts (five folds). We used one fold for model evaluation
    and the remaining four to train it. Finally, we assess the model’s performance
    by calculating the regression metrics across the five folds of the dataset (Root
    Mean Squared Error RMSE and the coefficient of determination R2). According to
    the results of Table 6, the main point is not the perfect results obtained by
    using all parameters as estimators but using only air temperature and global solar
    radiation (average RMSE = 0.27 and average R2 = 0.93), which gave promising results.
    This represents a practical data-driven approach for accurately estimating ET0
    by combining two criteria: accuracy of the FAO Penman–Monteith method and using
    limited and simple-to-obtain meteorological variables (air temperature with global
    solar radiation or only air temperature). Table 6. Cross-validation results for
    the three scenarios. According to the results, the proposed method represents
    a practical data-driven approach for accurately estimating ET0 by combining two
    criteria: accuracy of the FAO Penman–Monteith method and using limited and simple-to-obtain
    meteorological variables (air temperature with global solar radiation or only
    air temperature). The results obtained are in agreement with the approach followed
    in [48] for the most contributing variables for ET0 estimation, but it outperforms
    it in terms of RMSE (0.19). In addition, the XGboost model used in this study
    outperforms [49] when using all meteorological variables to train a neural network
    (RMSE = 0.19). 5.3. Prototype of the System The platform is named “FLA7A”, which
    means agriculture in Arabic. Figure 14 shows a screenshot of the platform’s dashboard.
    By default, it contains the real-time visualization of the last three days of
    hourly weather data (line charts). However, the user can customize the period
    according to their needs. Figure 14. A screenshot of the platform’s real-time
    weather time series visualization service. The black dots represent the original
    measurements, while the black line represents the linear interpolation of the
    dots. Figure 14 shows a screenshot of the dashboard that visualizes the last three
    days of hourly weather data. Figure 15 shows the interface of the forecasting
    service. By default, the forecasting period is set to one year. However, the user
    can change this parameter and also customize the number of years it will take
    into consideration when training the model. As mentioned in Section 4.4.2, the
    service initially uses the statistical model Facebook Prophet, which is powerful
    in long-term forecasting. In future work, the platform will integrate more models,
    especially those known for their performance in the task of short-term and mid-term
    weather forecasting, as surveyed in [50]. Figure 15. A screenshot of the platform’s
    forecast service. The light blue is the uncertainty bounds of the uncertainty
    interval around the final predictions (upper and lower), while the dark blue is
    the predicted values, and the black dots represent our original data. This platform
    is the first incremental step towards our goal of creating a decision support
    system intended to implement smart agriculture in Morocco by using artificial
    intelligence and data science to solve real-life problems facing farmers. More
    studies will be performed to add and optimize different parts of this system.
    For example, for data storage, we used MongoDB as a database to deal with real-time
    big data, however, in terms of system scalability or dealing with batch processing
    or long-running ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) jobs, other technologies should
    be considered. A potential candidate for this could be other NoSQL databases [51]
    or the Hadoop ecosystem (Spark, MapReduce, Hive, etc.) [52,53]. Additionally,
    MongoDB has fault tolerance issues, which is true of practically all distributed
    databases. Moreover, in the proposed deep learning method to deal with missing
    data, we do not cover hyperparameter fine-tuning [54], which is one of the biggest
    drawbacks to using deep neural networks. This task can be performed using GridSearch
    [55] or other optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms or the Monte
    Carlo method, which can lead to better results. Despite this, we found promising
    results, confirming the reliability of the ERA5-Land reanalysis data for our study
    area, which could lead to the application of this method using several stations
    in regions with challenging conditions. Finally, for the anomaly detection part,
    we presented an unsupervised machine learning method that is based on how isolated
    a measure is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood to alert administrators
    via SMS and emails, but other efficient methods can be investigated, such as Conformal
    Anomaly Detection (CAP) [56,57]. 6. Conclusions The work conducted in this paper
    makes use of artificial intelligence and big data analytics to develop a platform
    intended for intelligent weather data management, which is essential to implementing
    smart and sustainable agriculture in Morocco. The platform exploits huge amounts
    of generated data to gain insights and help assist decision making. The proposed
    platform offers a number of weather-data-related services such as handling missing
    data, visualization, analysis, estimation, and forecasting. Combining ERA5-Land
    reanalysis data and deep learning algorithms to learn the relationship between
    the two data sources gave promising results (R2 = 0.96 and RMSE = 0.04) for the
    air temperature variable. The same is true for the estimation of the reference
    evapotranspiration using XGBoost (R2 = 0.97 and RMSE = 0.07). The platform is
    designed to be service-oriented and will incorporate other services and solutions
    to help farmers and policymakers. Author Contributions Platform and machine learning

  description: Agriculture is vital for economic sustainability and structural transformation
    in ASEAN. This paper explores the agricultural landscape in ASEAN, focusing on
    Thailand as a prominent rice producer. Challenges such as rural-urban migration,
    the ageing population employed in agriculture, and need to implement innovative
    solutions to strengthen regional food security are discussed. The primary focus
    is the innovative use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in ASEAN agriculture.
    UAVs revolutionize data collection through aerial photography, providing real-time
    insights into terrain, vegetation health, and soil composition. They enable informed
    decisions, optimize resource allocation, and streamline processes, resulting in
    cost savings. Equipped with sensors, UAVs precisely monitor crop health, irrigation
    efficiency, and early pest detection. Integration of advanced software and geographical
    information systems enhances data analysis and visualization. UAVs facilitate
    high-resolution mapping, offering detailed information on crop density, weed infestation,
    and disease outbreaks. This enables targeted interventions, reducing input costs
    and optimizing resource allocation. Multispectral or hyperspectral sensors provide
    insights into plant health, chlorophyll content, and water stress, enabling site-specific
    management strategies for improved sustainability. UAVs are affordable, versatile,
    and continuously advancing. They can potentially improve productivity, efficiency,
    and resource management in agriculture. In rice production, UAVs offer benefits
    like crop monitoring, precise spraying, and uniform seed spreading. They provide
    real-time information on crop health and pest infestations, enabling optimized
    management. Spray drones accurately apply pesticides, while seed-spreading drones
    enhance crop growth and save costs. UAV drones offer significant advantages in
    ASEAN agriculture, addressing workforce challenges and enhancing productivity.
    Supportive measures will lead to efficient UAV integration, enhancing sustainability
    and farmer livelihoods.

    system that provides comprehensive and real-time monitoring of automated irrigation
    systems. The system employs machine learning algorithms to analyze sensor data,
    detect faults, and generate actionable insights, thereby enhancing system reliability
    and sustainability.
  extract_1: '"The proposed system consists of three main modules: data acquisition,
    feature extraction, and fault detection and diagnosis. The data acquisition module
    collects sensor data from the irrigation system, including flow rate, pressure,
    temperature, and humidity. The feature extraction module extracts relevant features
    from the sensor data using statistical and signal processing techniques. The fault
    detection and diagnosis module uses machine learning algorithms to detect faults
    and generate actionable insights."'
  extract_2: '"The AI-driven fault detection and diagnosis system has several advantages
    over traditional fault detection methods. First, it is real-time, which allows
    for timely detection and response to faults. Second, it is comprehensive, as it
    can detect a wide range of faults, including electrical faults, mechanical faults,
    and hydraulic faults. Third, it is actionable, as it provides insights that can
    help operators to correct faults and prevent future failures."'

  description: Rapid, facile and sensitive detection of water-borne pollutants is
    crucial to safeguarding public health. Herein, a miniaturized biosensing platform
    based on a porous silicon (p-Si) interferometer was designed to detect Escherichia
    coli (E. coli) contamination in a rapid and reliable manner. An indirect immunoassay
    followed by simple syringe filtration was adapted to exclude the unreacted antibodies
    tagged with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) from the bacterial suspension, while
    the optical transducer assessed the residual immuno-entities. Quantification of
    minute E. coli concentrations was achieved by the HRP moieties' biochemical activation
    and real-time monitoring of the reaction products' infiltration into the porous
    nanostructure by alternating reflectance spectra. The developed bioassay depicted
    high sensitivity against target microorganism detection, as low as 2 CFU mL−1,
    with a linear response of 101 ̶ 105 CFU mL−1. Furthermore, the selectivity was
    tested using the common interfering pathogens, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella
    enterica serovar Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis
    and Bacillus cereus, resulting in satisfactory output. Finally, the potential
    applicability of the developed platform for real-life scenarios was interpreted
    with respect to the standard culture plate approach while depicting recovery values
    of 92 ̶ 107 % in ground, irrigation and river water, as well as in staple food
    samples (raw and pasteurized milk). Overall, the miniaturized p-Si scaffold can
    be utilized for various emerging applications with pathogenesis-relevant assessments
    conducted under on-site conditions.

  explanation: This study developed and evaluated a miniaturized biosensor platform
    based on porous silicon (p-Si) Fabry-Pérot interferometers for rapid and sensitive
    detection of Escherichia coli in water and milk samples. The unique structural
    features and optical properties of the p-Si platform were optimized to enhance
    the sensitivity of the biosensor. The platform uses an indirect immunoassay to
    detect unreacted antibody-antibody complexes, which are quantified using a biochemical
    amplification reaction. This approach eliminates the need for labeling and provides
    enhanced qualitative and quantitative sensing capabilities.
  extract_1: The developed bioassay depicted high sensitivity against target microorganism
    detection, as low as 2 CFU mL−1, with a linear response of 101 ̶ 105 CFU mL−1.
  extract_2: Overall, the comparative assessment highlights the advantages of the
    optical design for rapid, user-friendly and effective on-site detection of causative
    pathogens.

    and content Highlights • High sensitivity and specificity toward E. coli cells
    contamination in food and water samples. • Efficient, simple and portable assay
    for routine analysis. • Optical signal augmentation by rapid biochemical reaction.
    • Real-time detection and quantification using Fabry–Pérot Interferometer. Abstract
    Rapid, facile and sensitive detection of water-borne pollutants is crucial to
    safeguarding public health. Herein, a miniaturized biosensing platform based on
    a porous silicon (p-Si) interferometer was designed to detect Escherichia coli
    (E. coli) contamination in a rapid and reliable manner. An indirect immunoassay
    followed by simple syringe filtration was adapted to exclude the unreacted antibodies
    tagged with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) from the bacterial suspension, while
    the optical transducer assessed the residual immuno-entities. Quantification of
    minute E. coli concentrations was achieved by the HRP moieties'' biochemical activation
    and real-time monitoring of the reaction products'' infiltration into the porous
    nanostructure by alternating reflectance spectra. The developed bioassay depicted
    high sensitivity against target microorganism detection, as low as 2 CFU mL−1,
    with a linear response of 101 ̶ 105 CFU mL−1. Furthermore, the selectivity was
    tested using the common interfering pathogens, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella
    enterica serovar Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis
    and Bacillus cereus, resulting in satisfactory output. Finally, the potential
    applicability of the developed platform for real-life scenarios was interpreted
    with respect to the standard culture plate approach while depicting recovery values
    of 92 ̶ 107 % in ground, irrigation and river water, as well as in staple food
    samples (raw and pasteurized milk). Overall, the miniaturized p-Si scaffold can
    be utilized for various emerging applications with pathogenesis-relevant assessments
    conducted under on-site conditions. Graphical Abstract Download : Download high-res

    siliconRapid assay 1. Introduction Water sources are vulnerable to intentional
    and inadvertent human pollution by abundant trace contaminants (micropollutants
    of synthetic, geogenic and biological origin), with severe consequences for aquatic
    ecosystems and human health [1]. In particular, the wide spread of pathogenic
    microorganisms in water sources promotes the propagation of infectious diseases
    (primarily intestinal infections such as diarrhea, but also guinea worm disease,
    typhoid fever, cholera and dysentery), causing the loss of millions of lives annually
    [2]. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is perhaps the most commonly known coliform bacterium
    naturally found in the gastrointestinal tracts of warm-blooded animals and the
    human colon''s normal flora [3]. E. coli is an established indicator of fecal
    contamination or poor-hygiene processing conditions in the food industry [1].
    Its existence in drinking water sources at low concentrations is usually harmless;
    however, higher counts may imply the existence of fecal-borne microorganisms (e.g.,
    hepatitis A or Salmonella). Therefore, monitoring and evaluating its biological
    hazard distribution and bioavailability is crucial to safeguarding public health;
    an assessment of water source quality in real-time allows for taking corrective
    measures to mitigate the biological risks [4]. At present, all microbial contaminants
    are recognized by conventional culture plating and molecular diagnostic practices,
    which are highly efficient and precise using laboratory-based facilities, but
    are impractical for rapid and straightforward field diagnosis of the causative
    hazard [1], [3], [5]. In the last two decades, numerous efforts have been made
    to develop high-throughput, rapid, sensitive and accurate sensing devices for
    routine on-site assessment of most emerging pathogenic bacteria related to water-
    and food-contaminants surveillance [1], [4], [6]. The developed alternatives to
    standard practices include a wide range of sensing and biosensing approaches facilitated
    primarily by electrochemical, optical and mass-based transduction mechanisms [7],
    [8]. The plethora of sensing schemes have used antibodies, aptamers, peptides,
    polymers, phages and other capture probes to differentiate bacteria based on their
    morphology, biochemical composition, motility, biofilm formation and antibiotic-resistance
    status [6]. Both direct and indirect sensing approaches (label-free and label-based,
    respectively) have been used to tackle the key concern of any analytical device,
    the inherent limit of detection (LOD). While direct monitoring of minute analyte
    or concentration variations can be restricted by the actual pathogen amount in
    the effective probing area and controlled by the diffusion limit, the indirect
    approach, although sacrifices to provide molecular information, offers enhanced
    qualitative and quantitative sensing capabilities subsequent to the biorecognition
    event [9]. The latter is ascribed to the diversity in sensors'' designs and fabrications,
    and their adaptability to complex biological media and environmental assessments.
    It should be noted that all approaches can be assisted by sensitivity-enhancing
    strategies throughout the analytical workflow, such as fluid mixing, analyte concentration
    or non-target material removal, chemical signal amplification and coupling to
    additional modalities, to improve the diagnostic performance [8], [10]. The trivial
    adaptation of recent nanotechnology-based research advances and the unique merits
    of novel nanomaterials for analytical chemistry applications have gained considerable
    attention [11]. Various nanoparticles, nanowires, nanocatalysts, nanoarrays and
    miniaturized nanodevices have been involved in probing pathogens'' identities
    in biological samples [4], [5], [6]. Specifically, porous silicon (p-Si) is a
    commercially viable platform suitable for on-site label-free sensing and imaging
    applications [12], [13], [14]. The p-Si is acknowledged for its immense internal
    surface area, ease of fabrication and bulky catalog of different functionalities
    attributed to versatile surface modification, which are beneficial for sensor
    design [15], [16]. The layered nanostructures designed in accordance with the
    target analyte''s physical features can complement the practical sensing capabilities
    and minimize matrix effects from interfering species. The optical signal is obtained
    in real-time using deployable instrumentation (hand-held spectrometer and compact
    light source), highlighting its compliance for field assessments [17]. Few works
    have leveraged the utilization of p-Si for the optical sensing of bacteria (whole
    cell, fragments or secreted products) [12], [18], [19], [20], [21]. To the best
    of our knowledge, the current LOD using these porous thin film scaffolds is 102
    CFU mL−1, regardless of the applied sensing mode. Herein, we present a miniaturized
    sensing platform for rapid and reliable assessment of model bacteria (E. coli)
    in contaminated water sources using reﬂective interferometric Fourier transform
    spectroscopy (RIFTS). Initially, all bacterial suspensions were immuno-recognized
    by selective antibodies, then syringe-filtered to exclude target bacteria and
    bound antibodies from the analyzed samples and applied on the p-Si. Immediately
    after, a rapid biochemical amplification reaction was utilized to enhance the
    optical signal and evaluate the residual immuno-entities coupled to the porous
    surface (antibody ̶ antibody complexes) [22]. The general sensing concept is presented
    in Scheme 1. The physical properties of the single-layered Fabry-Pérot interferometer
    were tuned for optimized sensitivity. The selectivity was assessed in detail against
    common water and food-related pathogens. Lastly, the prospective utilization of
    the developed platform for real-life scenarios was interpreted in contaminated
    water and milk samples and related to the standard microbial assay. Download :

    crystal B-doped silicon wafers with 1.0 ± 0.2 mΩ cm were purchased from Sil''tronix
    Corp. Absolute ethanol, acetonitrile, N,N- 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES),
    4-chloro-1-naphthol (4CN), diisopropylethylamine (DIEA), disuccinimidyl carbonate
    (DSC), hydrofluoric acid (48 %, HF), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), gelatine and sodium
    hydroxide were acquired from Merck. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus, ATCC-25923),
    E. coli (ATCC-10798), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis, ATCC-12228)
    and Bacillus cereus (B. cereus, ATCC-11778) were purchased from Biological Industries.
    Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) tagged rabbit anti-E. coli polyclonal antibodies
    (anti-Ec-ab) and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (s-ab) were obtained from
    Zotal Ltd. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) and Listeria
    monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) were kindly received from the Clinical Bacteriology
    and Mycology Department, KVI, Israel, managed by Dr. Shlomo E. Blum. 2.2. Porous
    transducers preparation p-Si Fabry–Pérot interferometers were prepared in accordance
    with a well-documented electrochemical anodization practice described in our previous
    works [23]. Different current densities (231, 385 and 538 mA cm−2) and periods
    (70, 42 and 30 s) were applied to produce various porous nanostructures that alternate
    the physical features. Immediately, the as-etched platforms were subjected to
    thermal oxidation, resulting in oxidized nanostructures (p-SiO2) [24]. The morphological
    features were studied using a Carl Zeiss Ultra Plus HRSEM and spectroscopic liquid
    infiltration method, as previously described [24]. Surface modification stages
    are demonstrated in Scheme 1 and were described in detail in our previous report
    [19]. Briefly, the APTES-modified p-SiO2 were biofunctionalized with a DSC crosslinker
    to anchor s-ab (40 µL of 50 µM) on the interferometer''s surface (resulting in
    s-ab/p-SiO2) [25]. Finally, the exterior surface was blocked with 50 µL of 1 mg mL−1
    gelatin solution (PBS buffer, pH 7.4) to reduce non-specific adsorption with the
    solid support [23]. ATR-FTIR was applied to thoroughly characterize all p-Si surface
    functionalization steps using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50 (Madison, WI, USA).
    2.3. Environmental samples pretreatment All water and milk samples were pretreated
    prior to optical examination to standardize the process. Ground, irrigation and
    river water were acidified to a neutral pH to maintain optimal biochemical response.
    Raw and pasteurized milk samples attained from healthy animals (the institutional
    dairy research farm, ARO) were 10-fold diluted and defatted (2500 g centrifugation
    for 7 min) to minimize filter clogging due to the viscous samples passing through
    and to eliminate matrix interferences [26]. Then, the noted samples were spiked
    with fixed E. coli concentrations (50 and 500 CFU mL−1) and verified through conventional
    microbiological culture assay. The selectivity samples were correspondingly pretreated.
    2.4. Immunoassay The pretreated samples containing E. coli cells (980 µL) were
    incubated with 20 µL of 50 µg mL−1 anti-Ec-ab for 30 min, sieved using a syringe
    filter (0.22 µm pore size PVDF membrane filter, Millex) and applied on s-ab/p-SiO2
    surfaces, see Scheme 1. Note: the filtration process excludes bacteria and bound
    antibodies from the analyzed samples. Then, the porous interferometers were impregnated
    in a flow cell configuration and equilibrated with 0.8 mM of 4CN substrate for
    5 min as an optical baseline. Finally, 0.16 M H2O2 is added to the cycled solution
    to activate the biochemical reaction. 2.5. Reflectivity studies The reflectivity
    data were obtained using Ocean Optics, Inc. (FL, USA) VIS-NIR Flame spectrometer
    at 30 s intervals with 60 ms integration duration and 10 spectral scans averaging.
    A detailed description of the optical setup and data analysis were previously
    described [23], [27]. Concisely, the reflectivity spectra were fast Fourier transformed
    (FFT) into single peaks attenuation, each characterized by indicative effective
    optical thickness (EOT) and intensity values. The former parameter designates
    the scaffold''s average refractive index and its complete thickness governed by
    the Fabry-Pérot equation, while the latter is proportional to the difference in
    refractive index contrast of adjacent interfaces, which delineates the relevant
    layer. The biochemical amplification data are given as the relative intensity
    of the observed FFT peak: (1) where is the obtained optical intensity response
    following the initiation of the biochemical response in the presence of H2O2 needed
    for HRP''s substrate (4CN) oxidation in regard to (baseline intensity values).
    The relative responses of the various bacterial loads are given as the relative
    activity: (2) where represents the relative intensity of different E. coli concentrations;
    is the maximal relative intensity while omitting bacteria from the assay. 3. Results
    and discussion 3.1. Porous transducers characterization The sensitivity of the
    label-free porous transducer is influenced by its inherent structural features,
    thus the physical characteristics of the different p-SiO2-based platforms were
    investigated. Initially, three different nanoscale pore diameters with similar
    void thicknesses were fabricated by alternating the constant current densities
    and etching duration. A highly B-doped Si wafer was subjected to current densities
    of 231, 385 and 538 mA cm−2 applied for 70, 42 and 30 s, respectively. HRSEM was
    used to characterize the resulting features (i.e., pore diameter and thickness)
    of each monolayer after thermal oxidation. Fig. 1a, b and c present characteristic
    non-uniformly shaped pores with average diameters of 23.5 ± 6.3, 41.7 ± 14.5 and
    52.9 ± 15 nm for current densities of 231, 385 and 538 mA cm−2, respectively (see
    pore histograms in Fig. S1). The corresponding p-SiO2 thicknesses are shown in
    a cross-sectional view (Fig. 1d, e and f), revealing cylindrically shaped pores
    and an average thickness of 7.98 ± 0.53 µm. Furthermore, the reflectivity measurements
    were used to assess the characteristic optical properties of the produced scaffolds.
    Fig. S2a depicts the reflectance spectra of the noted porous interferometers.
    A similar Fabry–Pérot interference pattern is observed for all samples, with minor
    attenuations in the frequency and overall spectral intensity. The resulting were
    FFT into single peaks with characteristic EOT and intensity values (Table S1).
    Both parameters decreased in correlation with pore augmentation (e.g., the EOT
    values are 22,703 ± 18, 19,356 ± 169 and 17,179 ± 40 nm for etching currents of
    231, 385 and 538 mA cm−2, respectively). These values were included in the Bruggeman
    effective medium approximation to assess the open porosities and thin film thicknesses
    using the spectroscopic liquid-infiltration method, as previously shown [24],
    [27]. Table S1 shows a profound increase in the thin film porosities, with values
    of 67.5 ± 0.6, 74.8 ± 0.5 and 82.4 ± 0.2 % for current densities of 231, 385 and
    538 mA cm−2, respectively. The corresponding calculated thin film thicknesses
    were inversely decreased upon elevated etching conditions (i.e., 8701 ± 79, 7829 ± 33
    and 7422 ± 11 nm, respectively). Next, the three different p-SiO2 surfaces were
    biofunctionalized using a bottom-up approach (individual layer addition), which
    included alkyl-silane, DSC crosslinker, s-ab, gelatin and anti-Ec-ab. The resulting
    sequential surface-modification steps were characterized using ATR-FTIR analysis
    (see Fig. S3 for the detailed study). Download : Download high-res image (627KB)

    42 s and (c, f) 538 mA cm−2 for 30 s. 3.2. Biochemical signal characterization
    The main limitation of novel sensing approaches for bacterial contamination is
    ascribed to the high sensitivity level needed to detect a single bacterium in
    a complex medium or matrix. Therefore, prior to cross-examining the sensitivity
    threshold of the designed interferometer, the experimental conditions were optimized
    by evaluating the influence of the inherent structural features on optical performance.
    The overall sensing concept is facilitated based on an indirect immunoassay while
    assessing the unreacted anti-Ec-ab content whereby the s-ab/p-SiO2 surfaces. Note:
    prior to applying the pretreated sample solutions on the solid support, all mixtures
    were rapidly sieved through a syringe filter (0.22 µm) to eliminate target microorganism
    and bound antibodies from the analyzed samples. Immediately after, a rapid biochemical
    amplification reaction was utilized to enhance the optical signal and evaluate
    the residual immuno-entities coupled to the porous surface (antibody-antibody
    complexes). The biochemical reaction included catalytic oxidation of 4CN by the
    HRP moieties linked to anti-Ec-ab, as previously shown [22], [28]. Initially,
    the three different functionalized transducers were subjected to different filtered
    final concentrations of anti-Ec-ab (1, 0.8, 0.6 and 0.4 µg mL−1) to simulate the
    dynamic response and assess the optimized biosensing platform based on pronounced
    optical performance. It should be noted that no bacterial suspensions were used
    at this point, as the anti-Ec-ab content was varied using controlled conditions.
    Fig. 2 depicts representative sensorgrams of the HRP catalytic activity products’
    infiltration into the different platforms. All sensorgrams show a similar descending
    trend of optical values with decreasing anti-Ec-ab concentration. For example,
    the relative intensities of the first nanostructure, characterized by minor pore
    size (23.5 ± 6.3 nm), revealed values of 1.54, 1.32, 1.16 and 1.10 for 1, 0.8,
    0.6 and 0.4 µg mL−1 anti-Ec-ab, respectively, see Fig. 2a. The attained data can
    simulate a similar optical response of increased bacterial concentrations, in
    which minute unbound anti-Ec-ab amounts pass through the syringe filter and interact
    with the s-ab/p-SiO2 surface, resulting in decreased relative responses for all
    studied nanostructures. In addition, the relative intensity values were increased
    in response to pores enlargement, as previously shown [27], [29]. Fig. 2d presents
    the corresponding relative activity values for all noted platforms. It should
    be highlighted that the activity values were normalized with respect to the maximal
    relative intensity of each platform (i.e., 1 µg mL−1 anti-Ec-ab). Significant
    differences were obtained for nanostructures with increased pore diameter etched
    at the maximal current density of 538 mA cm−2 (p ≤ 0.01), whereas others presented
    inconsistent differences between adjacent antibody concentrations (p > 0.05).
    The latter is ascribed to the high level of porosity accessible for the insoluble
    products’ infiltration and accumulation (favoring larger pores), thus amplifying
    the refractive index variation between the different treatments. Therefore, based
    on the achieved data, the greater pore size etched by 538 mA cm−2 was preferred
    for the sequential study. Download : Download high-res image (307KB) Download

    (b) 41.7 ± 14.5 and (c) 52.9 ± 15 nm, produced by 231, 385 and 538 mA cm−2 anodization,
    respectively. The s-ab/p-SiO2 surfaces were pre-interacted with different filtered
    anti-Ec-ab concentrations (1, 0.8, 0.6 and 0.4 µg mL−1), fixed in a custom-made
    cell followed by reflectivity spectra assessment (every 30 s). Each sensorgram
    consists of (I) baseline acquisition with 0.8 mM 4CN in HEPES buffer (pH 8) and
    (II) signal amplification by 0.16 M H2O2 introduction to the cycled solution.
    (d) The corresponding relative activity values of the dissimilar pore diameters
    upon interaction with various anti-Ec-ab concentrations. Data are presented as
    mean ± SD (n = 3). Next, the influence of the porous layer''s total depth was
    assessed through optical performance evaluation. Three different layers were anodized
    by varying the process duration (538 mA cm−2 applied for 10, 20 and 30 s). The
    resulting thicknesses were 2.7, 5.2 and 7.9 µm, respectively, obtained by HRSEM
    characterization (Fig. S4). Fig. S2b shows that the frequency of the Fabry–Pérot
    interference pattern increases upon porous layer thickening, as previously shown
    [30]. Finally, the calculated FFT values and Bruggeman effective medium approximation
    indicators are summarized in Table S1. The EOT values directly correlated with
    porous layer thickness, whereas the porosities were retained for all analyzed
    voids. Next, a similar biochemical characterization using simulating conditions
    of different filtered anti-Ec-ab concentrations (1, 0.8, 0.6 and 0.4 µg mL−1)
    was applied to the resulting interferometers. Again, no bacterial suspensions
    were used in the conducted assay. Fig. S5 shows the relative activity values of
    the dissimilar layers upon interaction with anti-Ec-ab concentrations. Significant
    optical differentiation of the various treatments was obtained for the thickest
    layer (7.9 µm, p ≤ 0.01) with respect to the other studied platforms. Therefore,
    based on the obtained data, the maximal porous depth of the interferometer was
    adapted as an optimized condition for practical sensor examination. 3.3. Sensitivity
    and selectivity of the sensing scaffold The optical performance of the optimized
    sensing scaffold toward the detection of pathogenic bacteria was elucidated by
    constructing a specific calibration curve. Briefly, different bacterial loads
    under spiked water conditions (10 – 106 CFU mL−1 E. coli) were allowed to interact
    with the anti-Ec-ab, passed through a syringe filter and applied on s-ab/p-SiO2
    surfaces. Note: the various bacterial counts were confirmed using conventional
    plate assay. Fig. 3a shows the biochemical response sensorgrams of the HRP catalytic
    activity products’ infiltration upon different filtrated solutions interactions
    with the s-ab/p-SiO2. The relative intensities declined gradually with increasing
    bacterial load as fewer free (unreacted) capture probes could associate with the
    porous support. For instance, the obtained relative values were 1.83, 1.66, 1.54,
    1.43, 1.37, 1.25 and 1.24 for the control condition (omitting bacteria from the
    assay), 101, 102, 103, 104, 105 and 106 CFU mL−1, respectively. The insufficient
    differences obtained at highest bacterial count, revealed saturation of the assay
    and inadequacy to quantify pronounced concentrations (i.e., ≥ 106 CFU mL−1). Thus,
    the corresponding values were used to calculate the relative activities with respect
    to the control condition and calibrate the assay. Fig. 3b shows a linear optical
    response to increasing E. coli concentrations, which is governed by the relationship
    of Rel. Activity = −0.1387 × (log CE. coli) + 0.9975 (R2 = 0.996). The calculated
    LOD is 2 CFU mL−1 within the studied range using the ratio between three standard
    deviations of the y-axis and the fitted line regression slope. The resulting calculated
    threshold level is highly attractive, especially using miniaturized equipment
    compatible with on-site detection. Download : Download high-res image (165KB)

    Note: The s-ab/p-SiO2 surfaces were pre-interacted with different filtered anti-Ec-ab
    concentrations, fixed in a custom-made cell, followed by reflectivity spectra
    assessment (every 30 s). Each sensorgram consists of (I) baseline acquisition
    with 0.8 mM 4CN in HEPES buffer (pH 8) and (II) signal amplification by 0.16 M H2O2
    introduction to the cycled solution. (b) The corresponding calibration curve.
    Data are reported as mean ± SD (n = 3). The label-free optical interferometers
    are susceptible to non-specific interaction between the sensing device or its
    counterparts and other common interfering molecules. This leads to false-positive
    indications and assessments of the overall target bacterial content in the examined
    matrix. Thus, the selectivity of the developed immunosensor was evaluated against
    different interfering pathogens, i.e., L. monocytogenes, S. Typhimurium, S. aureus,
    S. epidermidis, B. cereus and their mixtures with and without the inclusion of
    E. coli cells to the mixture compound. The concentrations of all inspected species
    were fixed to 103 CFU mL−1 and were correspondingly subjected to the pretreatment
    protocol. Fig. 4 presents the relative activities of the different interfering
    pathogen solutions without including E. coli in the analyzed solution. The obtained
    values present insignificant deviation with respect to the control condition (eliminating
    all bacteria from the assay), with relative activity values of 0.90 ± 0.09, 0.91 ± 0.05,
    0.92 ± 0.01, 0.98 ± 0.08, 0.96 ± 0.10 and 0.94 ± 0.06 for L. monocytogenes, S.
    Typhimurium, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. cereus and their mixtures, respectively.
    The negligible interference from all studied microorganisms is ascribed to the
    highly selective biorecognition probes used in the assay, which explicitly interact
    with the target bacteria and the porous nanostructure. Moreover, to exemplify
    a marginally complex matrix, the analyzed bacterial suspensions were spiked with
    E. coli and evaluated by the optical transducer. The responses were 0.58 ± 0.03,
    0.59 ± 0.13, 0.62 ± 0.01, 0.62 ± 0.05, 0.63 ± 0.10 and 0.61 ± 0.08 for L. monocytogenes,
    S. Typhimurium, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. cereus and their mixtures, respectively
    (while E. coli alone showed values of 0.61 ± 0.02). Thus, these results further
    strengthen that the indirect immunoassay design toward target bacteria detection
    reveals high selectivity in the presence of interfering microorganisms without
    compromising its performance measures. Download : Download high-res image (107KB)

    as mean ± SD (n = 3). 3.4. Environmental sample analysis The water samples from
    different origins (ground, irrigation and river) were used to exhibit the efficacy
    and accuracy of the biosensing platform for real-life scenarios. Two additional
    complex samples were also assessed by the s-ab/p-SiO2 platforms: non-contaminated
    raw and pasteurized milk samples obtained from representative healthy udders.
    The matrix-related complexity stems from milk constituents (e.g., fat globules,
    proteins, nutrients, white cells, etc.) that can block the porous nanostructure
    and impair its optical performance. Successful assessment of the latter samples
    was expected to provide insight into the suitability of the developed approach
    for food-related matrices. Thus, the noted samples were initially verified for
    null bacterial contamination prior to inoculation. Then, fixed E. coli concentrations
    (50 and 500 CFU mL−1) were similarly spiked in all samples and evaluated by conventional
    culture assay. The optical responses obtained from the porous transducers were
    used to calculate bacterial concentration using the regression relationship of
    the calibration curve, see summarized data in Table 1. The relative optical responses
    declined proportionally to increasing bacterial load, where less unreacted anti-Ec-ab
    can interact with the s-ab/p-SiO2 platforms, thus minimizing the biochemical reaction
    products’ output. The calculated recovery values for spiked ground, irrigation
    and river water were found between 93 % and 107 % with RSD of 7–14 %. Similarly,
    the recovery values of the spiked milk samples (raw and pasteurized) were between
    92 % and 103 %, with RSD ≤ 11 %. The obtained optical performances indicated that
    the developed assay is well-suited for the detection of pathogenic species such
    as E. coli in a rapid, reliable and accurate manner using environmentally relevant
    matrices. The system''s characteristics (e.g., detection range, LOD, assay duration
    and assessment of actual media) were further compared with recent optical biosensing
    approaches focused on E. coli quantification, see Table 2. In comparison, our
    method bridges the gap by offering a comprehensive detection range and practical
    LOD for water and milk samples within a shorter timeframe, surpassing the capabilities
    of other comparative methods. However, it is important to acknowledge that our
    approach does have some notable limitations. The main limitation of the bioassay
    is the sensitivity with respect to traditional culture-based and molecular-based
    methods capable of detecting a single CFU per 100 mL in 24 h or ∼ 100 fg target
    pathogen DNA in 5 h, respectively [1], [31]. The assay in its current state uses
    disposable sensing platforms, one s-ab/p-SiO2 unit for each dedicated test, hence
    non-reusable. Additionally, some pretreatments are necessary for the environmental
    samples, which might pose a challenge in certain scenarios [26]. Despite the noted
    limitations that can be alleviated by additional optimization steps, the method
    represents a significant advancement in detecting and analyzing water and milk
    samples. First, the separation process using syringe filtration excludes microorganisms
    from the complex media, therefore minimizing the need for time-consuming and instrumentation-based
    separation techniques (e.g., centrifugation and magnetic separation). Second,
    no enrichment process was involved in the pretreatment procedure, which simplified
    the execution of the presented bioassay. Third, label-free real-time qualitative
    and quantitative measurement of target pathogen using simple, portable, cost-effective
    sensing equipment. Fourth, the presented methodology is highly generic and could
    be potentially applied to study other relevant composite matrices. Overall, the
    comparative assessment highlights the advantages of the optical design for rapid,
    user-friendly and effective on-site detection of causative pathogens. Table 1.

    an effective sensitive detection method for E. coli cells contaminated water and
    food samples. The indirect immunoassay was coupled to a miniaturized p-SiO2 interferometer
    that was used as a physical sieve to accommodate the insoluble biochemical reaction
    products in correspondence with bacterial concentration. The sensing approach
    demonstrated several significant advantages for on-site field analyses, such as
    high sensitivity, attractive dynamic range and rapid assessment (2 CFU mL−1, 101
    to 105 CFU mL−1 and 80 min, respectively). The former was achieved by a simple
    separation procedure (syringe filtration) to eliminate microorganisms from the
    complicated environments, thereby minimizing most interferences with the porous
    support. Finally, besides being portable and low-cost, the developed interferometer
    is not constrained by exterior light (label-free transduction) while performing
    the assay outdoors using the RIFTS technique. Thus, we assume that the miniaturized
    sensing platform can be utilized for various emerging applications with pathogenesis
    relevance assessment conducted in most complex media. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: Nowadays, internet is considered a basic need to humankind, whose usage
    has penetrated in almost all part and parcel of life. It is possible due to the
    successful implementation of systems using Internet of things (IoT). IoT signifies
    an interconnected system using smart devices and sensors, which are capable of
    communicating with each other through real-time data transfer. Concept of IoT
    is used for monitoring and control of various systems not limited to only domestic
    and industrial applications but utilized in environment domains, resulting in
    the development of smart garden. IoT provides a smart solution for the condition
    monitoring during plantation in the field by using the various available sensors
    for temperature, soil moisture, light intensity, crop health, etc., with an automation
    system for irrigation. Hence, the field condition can be monitored from anywhere
    by using the system developed through IoT. This chapter deals with the IoT application
    for condition monitoring of plantation to develop a smart garden. The moisture
    content of the field soil and sunlight availability are monitored on a regular
    basis and the IoT platform is used for data collection. Data are verified and
    further processed by using a cloud-based logic after which an SMS is initiated
    to the smartphone through a cloud communication platform, enabling 384the user
    to take the appropriate action. Hence, the smart system developed by using IoT
    helps in better care of the plantation without the physical appearance of the
    user.

    need to humankind, whose usage has penetrated in almost all part and parcel of
    life. It is possible due to the successful implementation of systems using Internet
    of things (IoT). IoT signifies an interconnected system using smart devices and
    sensors, which are capable of communicating with each other through real-time
    data transfer. Concept of IoT is used for monitoring and control of various systems
    not limited to only domestic and industrial applications but utilized in environment
    domains, resulting in the development of smart garden. IoT provides a smart solution
    for the condition monitoring during plantation in the field by using the various
    available sensors for temperature, soil moisture, light intensity, crop health,
    etc., with an automation system for irrigation. Hence, the field condition can
    be monitored from anywhere by using the system developed through IoT. This chapter
    deals with the IoT application for condition monitoring of plantation to develop
    a smart garden. The moisture content of the field soil and sunlight availability
    are monitored on a regular basis and the IoT platform is used for data collection.
    Data are verified and further processed by using a cloud-based logic after which
    an SMS is initiated to the smartphone through a cloud communication platform,
    enabling 384the user to take the appropriate action. Hence, the smart system developed
    by using IoT helps in better care of the plantation without the physical appearance
    of the user. Previous Chapter Next Chapter Your institution has not purchased

    1 Introduction Water quality is a critical aspect of human health and environmental
    sustainability. Water bodies can become contaminated with various pollutants [1],
    such as chemicals, pathogens, and algae, which can have adverse effects on human
    health and aquatic ecosystems. The recent rise in waterborne diseases is a cause
    for concern. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 79% of
    health issues in developing nations are linked to inadequate water quality, leading
    to approximately 25% mortality [2]. Therefore, monitoring and maintaining water
    quality is essential to prevent potential health hazards and ecological damage.
    The conventional method of water quality detection, which is widely used, involves
    laboratory testing that is tedious, prolonged and requires experienced personnel
    to carry out appropriate chemical tests using specialized substances. The digital
    image processing technique is increasingly popular and has been extensively adopted
    in various industries due to its affordability, visual nature, and contactless
    approach [3]. To address the limitations of conventional methods, image processing
    methods have been utilized in this study. Deep learning algorithms like Convolutional
    Neural Networks (CNNs) can be trained to identify patterns and anomalies in water
    quality data, providing accurate predictions and classifications. Image processing
    techniques can be used to detect visual changes in water quality, such as color,
    turbidity, and algae growth, and provide a visual representation of water quality.
    By providing timely and accurate information about water quality, the water quality
    detection system enables stakeholders to take necessary actions to mitigate potential
    health and environmental risks. 2 Related Work Water quality detection systems
    have been a subject of extensive research in recent trends as a response to the
    growing concern about water pollution. Numerous studies have been carried out
    to develop effective and reliable water quality detection systems using various
    techniques and technologies. Here are some examples of related work in this field:
    Machine learning algorithms have been widely used in water quality detection systems.
    For instance, in one study, [4] a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was developed
    to detect the presence of heavy metals in water samples based on various water
    quality parameters. In another study, [5] a deep learning model was developed
    to classify water quality based on physical, chemical, and biological parameters
    [6]. The Internet of Things (IOT) technology has been extensively used to develop
    water quality detection systems. Optical sensors are an emerging technology for
    water quality detection [7]. These sensors use light to measure various water
    quality parameters such as turbidity, chlorophyll, and dissolved organic matter
    [8]. Biosensors are another technology used in water quality detection. These
    sensors use biological components such as enzymes, antibodies, or microorganisms
    to detect specific pollutants in water. Many studies have used a combination of
    different techniques and technologies to develop water quality detection systems.
    For instance, [9] in one study, a hybrid system combining IoT-based sensors and
    machine learning algorithms was developed for real-time water quality monitoring
    [10]. Another study developed a system that combines optical sensors and machine
    learning algorithms for detecting microplastics in water. 3 Methodology 3.1 Data
    Acquisition About 2100 sample images are collected from standard websites such
    as Google earth engine, Shutter stock [11, 12], etc. were as illustrated in Fig.
    1. All of the collected images were classified into categories based on expert
    knowledge and saved in the JPG format [13]. There are four categories in total
    for the water quality samples, each with a certain number of images. These categories
    represent different grades of water quality, based on water color, including dark
    green, yellow, brown, blue, black and light green [14]. These grades have been
    classified as algae water, clean water, mud water and polluted water respectively.
    The images are resized to 150 × 150 pixels to fit the model for subsequent calculations.
    Fig. 1 Samples collected and categorized Full size image 3.2 Overview The following
    is an overview of the water quality monitoring approach, as shown in Fig. 2. The
    first step involves collecting suitable water sample images and using image incision
    technology to isolate representative portions [14]. The sample images are categorized
    based on expert knowledge and labelled to form a sample library for modelling.
    The samples are input into proposed CNN models, to train the data. CNN models
    evaluate the output through different layers of the network by using a process
    called feature extraction [15]. The network consists of multiple layers, each
    performing a specific function. Fig. 2 Architecture of proposed system Full size
    image During each layer''s operation, the CNN model extracts important features
    from the input image, such as color, edges, corners, and textures. These features
    become increasingly complex as they move deeper into the network [16]. The output
    of each layer is assessed according to its capacity to detect the features it
    was designed to identify. To evaluate the output of each layer, CNN models use
    a technique called activation mapping. Activation mapping involves visualizing
    the output of each layer as a heatmap, where the brightest areas indicate the
    most significant features detected by that layer. Overall, CNN models use feature
    extraction and activation mapping to evaluate the output through different layers
    of the network, allowing for the identification of significant features in the
    input data and improving the model''s performance. The subsequent sections provide
    detailed descriptions of each phase. 4 Proposed Approach 4.1 Image Acquisition
    and Pre-processing Image acquisition and pre-processing are essential steps in
    preparing data for CNN models. Here are the typical steps involved in image acquisition
    and pre-processing: Image acquisition- the first step is to acquire high-quality
    images that represent the target object or scene. This is done by collecting around
    2100 images from standard websites from google. Image resizing- most CNN models
    require images of a specific size for optimal performance [17]. Therefore, it
    is essential to resize the images to the required dimensions to 150 × 150. Image
    normalization- it involves transforming the pixel values of the image to a standard
    range. This helps to reduce the impact of differences in image brightness, contrast,
    and color balance, which could affect the CNN model''s performance. 4.2 Data Augmentation
    Data augmentation is a method used in deep learning to increase the amount of
    data available for training a model by creating new, altered versions of pre-existing
    data as shown in Fig. 3. The idea behind data augmentation is to introduce variations
    in the original data, such as rotation, scaling, translation, flipping, or adding
    noise. This allows the model to learn more robust and generalized features, which
    can improve its performance on new and unseen data. For example, rotating an image
    by a certain angle can create a new sample that is similar to the original but
    with a slightly different viewpoint, so the collected water images have been rotated
    by 90°, 180° and 270°. Flipping an image horizontally can create another new sample
    that is a mirror image of the original and here the images have been flipped horizontally
    as well as vertically. Adding noise to an image can create new samples that simulate
    different lighting or atmospheric conditions [5]. Fig. 3 Modified versions of
    algae content water using data augmentation Full size image Data augmentation
    is especially useful when the amount of available training data is limited. By
    generating more data from the existing samples, the model can learn a wider range
    of variations and improve its ability to generalize to new data. Moreover, data
    augmentation can also help to prevent overfitting. 4.3 Proposed CNN Model A typical
    CNN-based image processing system architecture includes input layer, convolutional
    layers, pooling layers, activation function, fully connected layers, and output
    layer, allowing the network to learn complex features and relationships between
    them for accurate image classification or other image processing tasks [18]. There
    is no one CNN architecture that fits water quality classification. To determine
    the best model, the existing architectures should be tested, and the most appropriate
    one should be chosen based on the particular scenario. The pre-trained models
    are initialized with pre-existing weights from ImageNet and the upper layers are
    redefined to serve the purpose of classification. In order to assess whether a
    trained model is appropriate for its intended purpose, it is essential to test
    it for both underfitting and overfitting. To prevent overfitting, data augmentation
    techniques have been proposed. The pre-trained models utilized Adam optimizer
    to minimize the loss function. The global average pooling layer is added to every
    model, which reduces the dimensionality of the output from the previous layers.
    A dropout layer is added to the model, which randomly drops out a portion of the
    activations during training to prevent overfitting. A fully connected output layer
    is added with 4 nodes (one for each class), using the softmax activation function
    to output a probability distribution over the classes. Finally, various CNN approaches
    are utilized to train and validate the models on the water quality image dataset.
    The pretrained models used are InceptionV3, VGG16, ResNet50, DenseNet201 and MobileNet.
    5 Results and Discussion The models were trained using a batch-size of 10 for
    30 epochs. The complete dataset was randomly divided into training and testing
    data in a 80–20 ratio. The ModelCheckpoint callback is defined to save the best
    model weights based on validation loss during training. It will save the weights
    of the model to a file with a specified format, including the epoch number, validation
    loss, and validation accuracy. The EarlyStopping callback is defined to stop training
    early if there is no significant improvement in validation loss for a designated
    number of learning cycles. The ReduceLROnPlateau callback is defined to reduce
    the learning rate if there is no significant improvement in validation loss for
    a designated number of epochs. Figures 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 show the variation in
    accuracies and losses of the training data and validation data when data has been
    trained under different pre-trained cnn models. The x-axis indicates the number
    of epochs, and the y-axis denotes the accuracy rate in the chart. Fig. 5 ResNet-50,

    and losses of the trained and validation data and the testing accuracies (obtained
    when the model has been tested on unseen images) are as shown in Table1. Observing
    Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 and Table 1, our evaluation indicates that the DenseNet
    model outperforms all others in terms of training performance, achieving the highest
    validation accuracy. Based on these results, we selected DenseNet for further
    testing on unseen images and achieved an accuracy of 91.75%. The precision, recall
    and f1-score values across all categories are as shown in Table 2. Table 1 Comparing
    various techniques based on their accuracy and loss metrics Full size table Table
    2 Evaluation indicators of DenseNet201 class prediction Full size table Due to
    the limited amount of data available, the DenseNet model did not yield reliable
    prediction results, despite implementing data augmentation techniques during model
    training. However, it has shown a notable ability to classify features within
    the dataset, making it a viable option for water quality evaluation, even with
    a limited dataset. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we presented a water quality monitoring
    approach that leverages image processing and deep learning techniques. Then image
    classification is performed for water quality evaluation. Different experiments
    are conducted and compared the results with the state-of-the-art CNNs, the pre-trained
    models for image recognition. Notably, DenseNet201 model achieved higher classification
    accuracy i.e. 96.26% even in the absence of massive training samples. Further
    research can be conducted to explore the systems scalability and reliability in
    real-world scenarios, paving the way for sustainable and effective water quality
    management. References Seetha M (2018) Accuracy assessment of rough set based

    Introduction Agriculture is one of the key sources that plays a significant part
    in the life of the country''s economy. Traditional agriculture refers to the conventional
    farming methods that have been practiced for centuries, relying on manual labor
    and basic tools. In traditional agriculture, farmers often work in small plots
    of land using traditional seeds and farming practices passes down through the
    generations while traditional agriculture has played a crucial role in meeting
    food demands, it does have it disadvantages. One significant drawbacks is its
    relatively low efficiency and productivity. Manual labor-intensive tasks can be
    time-consuming and labor demanding, leading to potential wastage of water, fertilizers
    and pesticides. Moreover, traditional agriculture is more susceptible to the adverse
    effects of unpredictable weather conditions and environmental factors which can
    result in lower yields and economic losses. Meanwhile, food security is a global
    challenge and impacted by rapidly compounding effects of climate changes, population
    trends and supply chain shortcomings. Agriculture''s global impact cannot be overstated,
    as it remains the primary source of food for humanity. Despite the fact that the
    human population continues to grow, agricultural land remains static (Virk et
    al.2020). The authors (Mesgaran et al. 2017) also discovered that the ever-changing
    climatic conditions significantly reduce agricultural product output in conventional
    agricultural systems. As a result of the varying nature of farming resources and
    poor management, farmers continue to experience low agricultural output. Drawbacks
    of Traditional Farming Due to the low degree of automation in the farming area,
    the current state of the art in agriculture, particularly conventional agricultural
    systems, still confronts significant hurdles in terms of sustainability, labor-intensity,
    and energy efficiency needs. Also, the production level of the crops to be considered.
    Scalability problems also taken into account since the population explosion is
    the major cause. Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming In order to overcome
    the limitations and challenges faced in the conventional farming systems, the
    advent of the smart farming and precision agricultural sector to automate the
    farming processes towards achieving many goals towards sustainable agricultural
    systems. Some of them are listed below: • High quantity of crop yield • Better
    quality of the crops • Efficient resource utilization • Effective to handle climatic
    conditions • Decision making in cropping patterns • Environment and user-friendly
    • Easy maintenance • Minimized crop losses • Easy to handle pests, diseases, weeds
    • Minimize the crop growth time duration • Early prediction on the crop loss or
    gain • Ensures and motivates organic way of crop cultivation • Improves the growth
    of wide variety of crops • Reduces the usage of pesticides, fungicides and other
    chemicals that are not good for health. • Though huge amount for installations,
    less chances for failures and lasts for longer life-time. Continue Reading References

    Monitoring reservoirs in near real time using remote sensing provides water quality
    information integrated into early warning systems for harmful algal blooms. 1
    INTRODUCTION Nutrient runoff from agriculture, animal feeding operations, and
    wastewater treatment plants promote the growth of algae and cyanobacteria or blue-green
    algae (BGA). Extreme rainfall events transport large amounts of pollutants including
    sediments and nutrients into surface water bodies and reservoirs that adversely
    affect ecosystem health and cause harmful algal blooms (HABs). Sedimentation,
    sediment resuspension, and eutrophication diminish the utility of reservoirs and
    negatively impact human health (Zhang et al., 2020). Increasing agricultural activity
    to meet demands of growing populations and excessive use of fertilizers exacerbate
    HAB events, resulting in water impairment issues. HABs cause taste and odor problems
    in drinking water due to the release of geosmin (Antoniou et al., 2005; Deng et
    al., 2017; van der Ploeg & Boyd, 1991). The decay of HABs creates ecological dead
    zones due to the depletion of dissolved oxygen in surface water, which create
    unfavorable conditions for the sustenance of flora and fauna in water bodies (Bennett,
    2017; Chislock et al., 2013; Zohdi & Abbaspour, 2019). HABs can produce toxins
    in water which pose health risks to mammals when consumed (Anderson, 2009; Park
    et al., 2017). Because of the toxic risks of exposure and increasing occurrences
    of HAB events, there is a critical need for novel water quality monitoring technologies
    to understand HAB formation and nutrient transport in surface water. Successful
    monitoring of water bodies requires observations of spatial and temporal trends
    in turbidity and HAB formation. Existing satellite technologies provide spatial
    and temporal observations that can be used to study water quality in inland water
    bodies. For instance, Landsat-8 and Landsat-9 orbit the Earth in sun-synchronous
    near-polar orbit with a 16-day repeat cycle, where they collect multispectral
    imagery of the Earth''s surface (Blackwell, 1979; Carpenter & Carpenter, 1983;
    Masek et al., 2020). Landsat-8 has two instruments, including the Operational
    Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS). Landsat-8 imagery has been
    widely used to monitor water quality, including chlorophyll-a (chl-a), turbidity,
    mineral suspended solids, and surface temperature (Fraser, 1998; Harrington et
    al., 1992; Olmanson et al., 2016; Potes et al., 2012; Silva et al., 2016; Trinh
    et al., 2017; Watanabe et al., 2015). Similarly, the Sentinel-2 mission uses two
    satellites, S2A and S2B, in sun-synchronous orbit, which are phased at 180° to
    each other to collect multispectral data of the Earth''s surface. Sentinel-2 satellites
    have 13 spectral bands with variable spatial resolutions from 10 to 60 m. The
    frequency of revisit time of each Sentinel-2 satellite is 10 days and the combined
    constellation revisit is 5 days. Multispectral data from these platforms provide
    the reflectance of water surfaces at spectral regions beyond the visible range,
    which enhances the possibilities to monitor water quality trends in space and
    time. For instance, algal pigments including chl-a and phycocyanin reflect electromagnetic
    radiation that can be estimated using remote sensing. Previously, remote sensing
    methods have been used to estimate the concentrations of chl-a, turbidity, and
    phycocyanin using satellite data in the oceans and reservoirs (Babin et al., 1996;
    Brezonik et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2013; Chipman et al., 2004; Crósta & Moore,
    1989; Hansen & Williams, 2018; Kutser et al., 2006; Ortiz-Casas & Peña-Martinez,
    1989; Porcar-Castell et al., 2014). Monitoring reservoirs and inland water bodies
    is important to ensure provision of freshwater to households (Afroz et al., 2014).
    Besides acting as potential water sources, inland water bodies provide recreation
    and ecosystem provision services for local economies (Cowx et al., 2010; Ward
    et al., 1996). In the United States (U.S.), there are around 90,000 dams that
    have reservoirs that can be monitored remotely using satellite sensors for water
    quality (Song et al., 2021). The Grand Lake O′ the Cherokees (Grand Lake) and
    Hudson Reservoirs are located in northeastern Oklahoma where they are monitored
    and operated by the Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA). Recently, Grand Lake has
    experienced an increase in HAB outbreaks, including shutdowns on the fourth of
    July weekend in 2011 and June 2021, which significantly affected the local economy
    (Mason & Triplett, 2016). Increased occurrences of HABs in Oklahoma and monitoring
    needs for water resource managers like GRDA necessitate near real-time HAB detection
    tools based on remote sensing. The main objective of this study was to develop
    a remote sensing tool to monitor for HABs in near real time (as soon as Level-2
    satellite data are available online) for inland water bodies. To achieve this
    objective, empirical relationships were built using the surface reflectance values
    from both the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellites and in situ data collected at
    Grand Lake and Hudson Reservoir. For active HAB monitoring, an open-source software
    tool in Python was developed that acquires satellite images from the web, extracts
    values of pixels within each reservoir, and estimates water quality data, including
    chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin concentrations. This software can be used to
    visualize present and previous HABs in GRDA reservoirs. The utility of the Landsat-8
    and Sentinel-2 satellites for remote sensing was compared for efficacy in HAB
    estimation. These tools can help guide HAB advisories by automating the image
    data acquisition, estimating water quality parameters, and providing observations
    of HAB dynamics. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Description of the study area The
    study area includes Grand Lake and Hudson Reservoir located in northeastern Oklahoma.
    Detailed information of Grand Lake and Hudson Reservoir involving storage capacity
    and area are provided in Table 1. Grand Lake has a total area of 188.2 km2, a
    mean depth of 11.0 m, a maximum depth of 40.5 m (OWRB, 2009). Three significant
    rivers, including Neosho, Spring, and Elk, drain into Grand Lake. The lake spans
    parts of Craig, Delaware, Mayes, and Ottawa counties in Oklahoma, making it the
    third largest lake in terms of both surface area and water-holding capacity in
    the state (Hunter & Labriola, 2019). The watershed of Grand Lake contains cultivated
    agriculture, livestock, and wastewater treatment plants that act as sources of
    HAB nutrient precursors. Nutrient loadings into Grand Lake vary due to differences
    in land management practices across its many sub-watersheds. In Grand Lake, Horse
    Creek Cove is a point of interest in testing remote sensing methods, because most
    of the HAB events start in this area during the summer months when nutrient-rich
    runoff from agricultural sources and other land use in the Horse Creek Watershed
    flows into the lake. Overall land use in the watershed consists of 57% grassland
    (including planted pasture and natural grassland), 20% agricultural land, 6% developed
    land, and 3% surface water and wetlands. Hudson Reservoir is located in Mayes
    County in the Arkansas River Basin on Neosho River. It is the fourteenth largest
    reservoir in Oklahoma and supplies water to public and private stakeholders authority
    (GRDA, 2009). Hudson Reservoir receives water mainly from releases of Grand Lake
    but is also fed by other tributaries originating in Oklahoma and Arkansas. The
    study areas of both Grand Lake and Hudson Reservoirs are shown in Figure 1. TABLE

    Water quality Grand Lake and Hudson Reservoir have been sampled for water quality
    parameters by GRDA using EXO-1 and EXO-2 multiparameter sondes regularly since
    2011. The in situ data collected by GRDA were used to develop remote sensing algorithms
    for estimating chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin at Grand Lake and Hudson Reservoir
    using the spectral imagery from Landsat-8 since 2013 and Sentintel-2 since 2015
    as described in Section 5. Observations of in situ water quality from Grand Lake
    and Hudson Reservoir were collected as part of the GRDA water quality monitoring
    program. Multi-parameter water quality probes developed by Yellow Springs Instruments
    (YSI) were used to measure chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin. EXO-1 and EXO-2
    sondes with water quality probes were assembled, prepared, and calibrated according
    to procedures detailed in the instrument''s operation manual (XYLEM, 2019). All
    sampling sites used to collect in-situ water quality data for both Grand Lake
    and Hudson reservoirs are shown in Figure 2. Parameters used to build the remote
    sensing tool include the chl-a concentration in μg/L, turbidity in NTU, and phycocyanin
    concentration in RFU. For model building, in situ water quality data within ±5 days
    of satellite data acquisition for chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin were utilized.
    All in situ sensor data utilized in this research were collected within 3 feet
    of the surface. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Locations of in situ
    sampling sites in reservoirs used in this study. 2.3 Satellite data Satellite
    imagery was obtained from both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 and co-located with in-situ
    observations for development of remote sensing algorithms for chl-a, turbidity,
    and phycocyanin. The OLI and TIRS are suitable to assess water quality in surface
    water bodies such as lakes, rivers, and coastal marine zones. The OLI measures
    the reflectivity of Earth''s surface across nine spectral bands, which include
    the panchromatic band; the ultra-blue coastal aerosol band; the blue, green, and
    red bands; the near infrared (NIR) band; the two shortwave infrared bands (SWIR1
    and SWIR2); and the cirrus band. These bands have spatial resolution at 30-m on
    the ground, except the panchromatic band, which is provided at 15-m resolution.
    The Landsat TIRS has two thermal spectral bands that have a spatial resolution
    of 100 m. Sentinel-2 is an Earth observation mission from the Copernicus program
    to acquire satellite imagery with spatial resolution ranging from 10 to 60 m on
    the ground. Currently, the two Sentinel satellites, S2A and S2B, collect imagery
    with 13 spectral bands, which include the blue, green, red, and NIR bands at 10-m
    resolution; the vegetation red edge, narrow NIR, and SWIR bands at 20-m resolution;
    and the water vapor and cirrus bands at 60-m resolution. Details about the Landsat-8
    and Sentinel-2 bands used in this study are shown in Table 2 and in the supplemental
    document in Tables S1 and S2. TABLE 2. Spectral bands with band wavelength used

    including multiple regression, support vector regression (SVR), and random forest
    regression (RFR) were used to develop algorithms for estimating chl-a concentrations,
    turbidity, and phycocyanin concentrations from the co-located observations of
    reflectance and in situ water quality. Since the chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin
    data were not normally distributed, the data were log-transformed (Figure 5) to
    make the distribution closer to normal. Regression models, which are widely used
    to associate algal pigments and water quality parameters with spectral signatures
    of satellites, were then used with these data to minimize the sum of the squared
    errors using the cost function shown in Equation (1). (1) In regression, given
    a training dataset containing dependent variables yi and independent variables
    xi denoted {xi, yi} ∈ , is the function used in the regression for prediction,
    n is the sample size, and v is the vector that defines the function f with same
    dimension; that is, the number of parameters in the vector v and the function
    f must be the same. If the noise generated in the predicted data do not follow
    a Gaussian distribution, then data cleaning to remove outliers and minimize the
    error between predicted and expected values is needed to achieve good model performance.
    For the multiple regression algorithm, the dependent variables included chl-a
    and turbidity, while the independent variables included the spectral bands from
    Landsat-8 OLI and TIRS. A model was developed using multiple regression to find
    a relationship between each dependent variable and the independent variables using
    different band ratios and band combinations as shown in Table S3 with Landsat-8
    images. Multiple regression models with band combinations have difficulty in quantifying
    low chl-a samples and underpredict high chl-a concentrations (Boucher et al.,
    2018). Since algal dynamics in surface water are nonlinear, machine learning models
    including SVR, and RFR were also analyzed as an alternative approach to develop
    remote sensing algorithms for the water quality parameters. SVR is an extension
    concept of support vector machines, which are applied to regression statistical
    analysis. SVR has been successfully applied to develop machine learning algorithms
    for nonlinear, chaotic systems including alternating current cycles, urban traffic
    flows, medical applications, and stock markets (Agarwal, 2011; Alipour et al.,
    2022; Das & Padhy, 2012; Hong et al., 2011; Khan & Zubek, 2008; Liang et al.,
    2010; Weng et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2008). In SVR, the linear
    loss function shown in Equation (2) was used to evaluate model performance (Drucker
    et al., 1996; Vapnik et al., 1995): (2) where L is the loss function in SVR, y
    is the expected value, f(x, v) is the predicted regression function, and is the
    error tolerance. The loss function takes a value 0 when L ≤ , and otherwise has
    a value of when L >  . In this study, the predicted chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin
    were tested with nonlinear machine learning models that required a kernel function
    for SVR. Typically, a kernel function transforms features from original to higher
    dimensions to improve group separation of expected data around a hyper-plane.
    An optimal parameterization was determined by iterating through available kernel
    functions including the linear, polynomial, gaussian, sigmoid, spectral angle,
    and radial basis functions (RBFs). The RBF kernel was selected after testing all
    the available kernel functions to give an optimum prediction for chl-a, turbidity,
    and phycocyanin. The RBF kernel was used to predict water quality and has been
    widely used in regression problems (Chitralekha & Shah, 2010; Nadadoor et al.,
    2012). An RFR is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that contains a large
    number of decision trees such that the algorithm obtains a prediction based on
    a consensus of responses in all the trees. The sample data were partitioned to
    random subsets for predicting chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin. RFR can handle
    large datasets and can predict co-related water quality data without decreasing
    prediction accuracy. In multispectral imagery, there is strong correlation between
    many bands. The RFR algorithm uses numerous de-correlated decision trees randomly
    and assigns weightings based on the performance of each tree, using Gini impurity.
    The RFR algorithm has built-in feature importance method that can be computed
    using Gini impurity. The feature importance data provide important insights into
    the significance of the various spectral bands to remotely sense the water quality
    parameters. Although RFR seems to be a promising model, it is important to check
    if the model is overfitting the training dataset. To prevent overfitting the trained
    dataset, both k-fold cross validation and hyperparameter tuning were performed
    on different training and validation datasets to check RFR model performance.
    3.2 Structure and workflow of python tool The software developed in this study
    is written in Python 3.7. Python is free, open-source, and extensively utilized
    for scientific applications because of its object-oriented, interpretive, and
    interactive programming features (Lutz, 2013; Millman & Aivazis, 2011). Python
    possesses a wide range of extension libraries such as the Geospatial Data Abstraction
    Library, Numeric Python, and Scientific Python that were utilized to ensure smooth
    operation of the procedure to extract imagery and analyze the data. The Google
    Earth Engine Python Application Program Interface (API) was used to acquire Level-2
    Landsat-8 imagery of the study area. Similarly, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
    API was used to obtain Sentinel-2 Level-1 images from Google Cloud Services. Landsat-8
    Level-2 images were obtained using spatial bounds for the lakes in scenarios where
    the cloud cover was less than 10% of the image. Geographic coordinates (latitude
    and longitude) were provided as a Comma Separated Value files such that the Python
    software can find the satellite images within the bound spatial coordinates. In
    the case of Sentinel-2, after acquiring the Level-1 images, Sen2Cor was used to
    process the single date Level-1 top of atmosphere images to Level-2 bottom of
    atmosphere or surface reflectance products (Main-Knorn et al., 2017). Based on
    the geographic coordinates and in situ sampling dates, the software selects raster
    images from the available data for each mission, and then prints the appropriate
    candidates within the spatial bounds of the study area with cloud cover less than
    the specified preference of 10%. The Level-2 data obtained from Earth Engine API
    are atmospherically corrected and have five visible bands, two shortwave bands,
    and one thermal infrared band. In total, there are 19 bands available from the
    Level-2 images, which are shown in Table S1. The Sentinel-2 constellation has
    two satellites operated by the European Space Agency. Both the satellites S2A
    and S2B carry multispectral instruments that image the Earth both in the visible
    and infrared spectrum. The resampled Level-2 images with Sen2Cor have bands with
    spatial resolutions of 10, 20, and 60 m. The 20-m spatial resolution is used to
    build the remote sensing tool to measure the concentration of phycocyanin. A detailed
    description of the bands after processing to Level-2 with surface reflectance
    using Sentinel-2 is shown in Table S2. After acquiring and processing the satellite
    images for both the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellites, the surface reflectance
    values were extracted at the in-situ sampling location that most closely matched
    the sampling time (±5 days). All the surface reflectance values of the reservoirs
    were parsed based on the availability of in situ water quality data. The surface
    reflectance data obtained were split to train the algorithms and test the performance
    of the models using the cost functions for initial model selection. The statistical
    training process involves improving the model performance based on using the error
    metrics, including root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination
    (R2). In addition to error metrics, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning
    were used to improve the performance of the remote sensing algorithms. The details
    of the model calibration, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning are discussed
    in Section 12. The band combinations/band ratios with multiple regression, SVR,
    and RFR did not improve validation performance (Table S3), consistent with the
    findings of previous research (Sudheer et al., 2006). Therefore, based on the
    superior model performance with the initial test/train and split, the RFR model
    was selected for subsequent testing using k-fold cross-validation. After gaining
    confidence that the RFR did not overfit the training dataset, it was selected
    as the final model to be used in the remote sensing tool. The steps involved in
    developing the remote sensing software are shown in Figure 3. FIGURE 3 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Operational structure of the software. API, Application
    Program Interface; ESPA, EROS Science Processing Architecture. The information
    required to use the remote sensing tool requires the user to register on Google
    Cloud and Earth Resources Observation and Sciences (EROS). In addition to login
    information to the publicly available satellite imagery, users must provide the
    desired cloud cover (in percentage), geographic coordinates, and temporal information
    (start date and end date) of the imagery to select the desired satellite images
    within the region of interest. In addition, a boundary shapefile of the waterbody
    must be provided by the user to clip the region of interest and remove unwanted
    regions in the raster. Using all the input information provided by the user, the
    tool searches publicly available datasets from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery
    in Google Cloud and downloads them to the local computer. The spectral reflectance
    values in the region of interest are then extracted by the software. The RFR algorithm
    is applied to the clipped region of interest to produce heat maps of water quality
    parameters, and the unwanted pixels of land are masked by the tool. The masking
    of land was performed using the raster of crop-specific land cover map from Cropland
    Data Layer. In addition to land pixels, the erroneous pixels corresponding to
    clouds and cloud shadows are removed using QA bands. Using the surface reflectance
    values of water, the software estimates the concentrations of chl-a, turbidity,
    and phycocyanin to produce gridded images of water quality. The gridded estimates
    on the satellite raster can be used to provide HAB advisories for further analysis
    based on the concentrations of chl-a and phycocyanin as shown in Figure 4. FIGURE
    4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Logic for classification of algal blooms based
    on satellite imagery using World Health Organization alert levels of chl-a and
    cyanobacterial cells. EROS, Earth Resources Observation and Sciences. The criteria
    to establish a HAB alert is decided based on World Health Organization (WHO) alert
    levels of chl-a and BGA concentrations more than 50 μg/L and 100,000 cells/mL
    respectively (Ahn et al., 2007; Izydorczyk et al., 2009; United States Environmental
    Protection Agency, 2019). Based on a study conducted in Klamath River, California,
    phycocyanin monitoring over 5 years from 2008 to 2013 resulted in a mathematical
    relationship between phycocyanin (RFU) and BGA (cells/mL) (Laurel & Kann, 2016).
    The mathematical relationship between phycocyanin and BGA is shown in Equation
    (3). (3) Communications and a previous study from YSI confirmed that the conversion
    of phycocyanin to BGA on their sondes is based on Equation (3) (YSI, 2012). Phycocyanin
    measurements from the YSI Exo sondes were used to estimate phycocyanin concentration,
    but Equation (3) is used in our software to provide a warning advisory criteria
    for GRDA that was confirmed by further laboratory testing performed that resulted
    in Grand Lake shutdown of 2021. The detailed information on alert concentration
    levels of algal pigments is shown in Table 3. TABLE 3. Recreational action levels
    for chl-a, cyanobacteria, microcystin, and phycocyanin levels. Probability of
    acute health effects Chl-a (μg/L) Cyanobacteria (cells/mL) Estimated corresponding

    to 47 High ≥50 >100,000 >20 >47 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The distribution of chl-a,
    turbidity, and phycocyanin from the in situ observations in the study area is
    shown in Figure 5. The chl-a concentrations used in this study ranged from 0 to
    60 μg/L, turbidity ranged from 0 to 150 NTU, and phycocyanin ranged from 0 to
    53 RFU. Based on the WHO guidelines for recreational water, chl-a concentrations
    more than 50 μg/L and BGA of 200,000 cells/mL indicate a HAB event that requires
    further testing of water samples in the laboratory for toxicity (microcystins).
    The relationship between phycocyanin and BGA in Equation (3) can be used to estimate
    the cyanobacterial cells from phycocyanin concentrations. Both chl-a and turbidity
    can be remotely sensed using Landsat-8 satellite imagery. Landsat-8 satellite
    data since the mission launched in 2013 were compiled to match 1709 in situ observations
    for chl-a and turbidity in the study area. Sentinel-2 data were compiled to remotely
    sense phycocyanin that were matched to 1095 data points from 2015 to 2020. The
    in situ water quality data were positively skewed for chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin
    as shown in Figure 5. Each of the three water quality parameters were log-transformed
    such that the fit is close to a Gaussian or normal distribution used for algorithm
    development. However, nonparametric machine learning models like SVR and RFR do
    not need data to fit a normal distribution. FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Whisker and distribution plots of in situ water quality parameters. After transforming
    the in situ data to a Gaussian distribution, algorithms that translate observations
    from single bands and band combinations into water quality parameters were generated
    using co-located pixels based on coordinates. The bands used in building and testing
    regression algorithms are shown in Table 2 for each water quality parameter and
    satellite mission. For remote sensing of chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin, features
    were extracted using individual bands from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, respectively.
    4.1 Multicollinearity of multispectral bands of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Some
    of the multispectral bands of both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images are strongly
    correlated, which causes data redundancy. Therefore, highly correlated bands with
    coefficient of determination (R2) of greater than 0.9 were dropped. Figure 6 shows
    the correlation matrix between all the observations from the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2
    imagery. The bands that were dropped included Ultra-Blue, Coastal Aerosol (SR_B1),
    and Shortwave Infrared 2 (SR_B7) while estimating chl-a concentrations using Landsat-8.
    Similarly, surface reflectance bands including Ultra-Blue, Coastal aerosol (SR_B1),
    and Shortwave Infrared 1 (SR_B6) bands were dropped for estimating turbidity concentrations
    using Landsat-8. For phycocyanin estimation, surface reflectance bands including
    Red Edge 3 (B7) and Shortwave Infrared 1 (B11) were dropped while using Sentinel-2
    imagery for remote sensing. In addition to surface reflectance bands, surface
    temperature bands were retained because surface temperature is highly correlated
    to chl-a and helps in detecting both chl-a and turbidity concentrations which
    are discussed in Section 11 (Harod et al., 2021). The bands used in machine learning
    algorithms for model calibration were selected based on feature importance as
    discussed in Section 11. FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Correlation
    matrices between water quality parameters, Landsat-8 (top) and Sentinel-2 (bottom)
    bands. 4.2 Feature selection for regression Feature selection for regression was
    done based on the feature importance scores determined by the RFR (Belgiu & Drăguţ,
    2016; Esteban et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020). All three regression algorithms
    are further investigated (multiple regression, SVR, and RFR), and RFR estimated
    the water quality parameters best compared to the other models as explained in
    detail in Section 12. The importance of computed bands based on Gini impurity
    including the surface temperature bands of Landsat-8 plays an important role in
    predicting chl-a and turbidity, as shown in Figure 7. FIGURE 7 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Feature importance using RFR. Besides high correlation, the
    surface reflectance band Ultra-Blue Coastal Aerosol (SR_B1) was dropped because
    of low feature importance, with a Gini impurity close to zero. The surface temperature
    band B10 (ST_B10) was retained for algorithm development because it has been previously
    been used to remotely sense the concentrations of chl-a in water (Allan et al.,
    2011; Tanaka et al., 2004). For phycocyanin, the Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT)
    band of Sentinel-2 was dropped because aerosols in air do not aid in detecting
    phycocyanin pigments. The Red Edge 3 (B7) band was dropped because of low feature
    importance and high correlations between Red Edge 2 (B6) and Red Edge (B7). Also,
    between Shortwave Infrared 1 (B11) and Shortwave Infrared 2 (B12) bands, B11 was
    dropped because of low feature importance and high correlation. However, retaining
    one of the shortwave infrared bands (B12) was important because they help in detecting
    cyanobacterial blooms (Yan et al., 2018). Most of the remote sensing methods predicted
    phycocyanin in the spectral range from 600 to 754 nm (Ogashawara et al., 2013;
    O''Shea et al., 2021; Yacobi et al., 2015). However, SWIR bands have been less
    susceptible to turbidity in detecting algal pigments and distinguish surface cyanobacterial
    blooms and macrophytes (Mansaray et al., 2021; Oyama et al., 2015). Therefore,
    the B12 band was retained in building the remote sensing tool to estimate the
    phycocyanin pigment. 4.3 Machine learning algorithms for remote sensing of HABs
    and turbidity The data from Grand Lake and Hudson Reservoir were used to develop
    and test the three algorithms. Since the log transformed in situ chl-a, turbidity,
    and phycocyanin data were close to a normal distribution, standardization of all
    the features was performed using a standard scaler to remove bias in model fitting
    (Ferreira et al., 2019; Garreta & Moncecchi, 2013). After scaling, the data were
    split for training and evaluation (70%/30%) of models before and after k-fold
    cross validation. As the three regression models were tested using different band
    combinations, the most efficient regression models were selected for chl-a, turbidity,
    and phycocyanin based on R2 values and kernel density plots as shown in Figure
    8. The kernel density plots in Figure 8 show that the multiple regression model
    explains roughly half of the relative variability in the concentrations of phycocyanin,
    chl-a, and turbidity regression (top), SVR (middle), and RFR (bottom). FIGURE
    8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Kernel density plots for measured and predicted
    water quality data using multiple regression (top), support vector regression
    (SVR) (middle), and RFR (bottom). The SVR model overestimated the water quality
    parameters and did not have definitive peaks at mean concentrations of chl-a.
    Out of the three algorithms tested, the RFR estimated the water quality parameters
    closest to the measured testing dataset. The RFR algorithm was further tested
    on datasets for model performance based on RMSE and R2. Based on previous literature
    (Xie et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2015) and trials, the RBF kernel was used in SVR
    for remote sensing of water quality parameters. In both the testing and training
    cases, the R2 values for chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin using the SVR and RFR
    algorithms improved model performance compared to multiple regression, as shown
    in Table 4. The RFR model explained observations of chl-a, and phycocyanin slightly
    better for training than testing. A k-fold cross-validation using random search
    CV was used to validate the RFR model for different potential hyperparameters,
    including maximum depth, maximum features, samples split, and sample leaf (Bates
    et al., 2021; Krstajic et al., 2014). The results of the k-fold cross validation
    for the RFR model after validation are reported in Table 4 and explained in detail
    in Section 13. To visualize the relationship between measured and modeled water
    quality parameters, a scatter plot is shown in Figure 9. TABLE 4. Statistics metrics

    remotely sensed and in situ observations of water quality parameters using multiple
    regression (top), SVR (middle), and RFR (bottom). The best regression fit for
    all the water quality parameters was used to identify outliers which were carefully
    re-examined and removed if necessary, based on errors including sensor malfunction
    present in the database and cloud pixels identified by re-examining satellite
    images. The R2 values are displayed at the bottom of each subplot to illustrate
    the ability of the model to explain the data. The k-fold cross-validation, scatter
    plots, and statistical metrics demonstrate that RFR is the best machine learning
    method of the three approaches to remotely sense HABs using imagery from Landsat-8
    and Sentinel-2. 4.4 Calibration and validation of RFR The RFR model used in the
    development of remote sensing tool was validated using k-fold cross-validation.
    The baseline RFR model with initial train/test split provided satisfactory results
    with R2 of 0.75, 0.82, and 0.79 for the 30% validation datasets of chl-a, turbidity,
    and phycocyanin, respectively. The RFR model hyperparameters were tuned by altering
    the maximum tree depth, maximum number of features, minimum number of samples
    for a split, and minimum number of samples per leaf. A random search was used
    to define a grid of hyperparameter ranges and randomly sample from the grid, performing
    k-fold cross-validation with a combination of values (Schratz et al., 2019). The
    number of iterations performed was 100 with random grid selection. The RFR algorithm
    was tested with 100, 200, and 300 estimators, and 300 estimators were selected
    for further optimization of the RFR algorithm to avoid overfitting the training
    dataset. After random search cross-validation, the optimized hyperparameters for
    chl-a, phycocyanin, and turbidity were computed. As shown in Figure 10, the RMSE
    decreased until a tree depth of 12 was reached for predicting chl-a, phycocyanin,
    and turbidity using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. Tree depths of 12, 11, and 11 were
    selected for predicting chl-a, phycocyanin, and turbidity, respectively. Overfitting
    is always a problem while using nonparametric models like RFR to build remote
    sensing tools. Increasing the tree depth further can overfit the RFR model to
    the training dataset, as shown in Figure 10. The maximum number of features and
    minimum number of sample per split hyperparameters did not impact the model performance
    and were not investigated in detail. FIGURE 10 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Hyperparameter tuning based on RMSE of the random forest (RF) estimators. 4.5
    Uncertainty of model simulation The uncertainty of the RFR model was assessed
    using visualization of the observed values within the prediction intervals of
    different conditional quantiles. The percentiles of the conditional quantiles
    used in this study were 99%, 95%, 50%, and 5%. The number of estimators and other
    hyperparameters used in assessing the uncertainty of the quantiles were the same
    as in RFR model. Figure 11 shows the 95% prediction interval, and 80%, 78%, and
    70% of the data fell into the 95% prediction interval for chl-a, turbidity, and
    phycocyanin, respectively. The length of the prediction intervals for turbidity
    was wider compared to chl-a and phycocyanin. This indicates that the RFR was able
    to make chl-a predictions using Landsat-8 with 10% more certainty when compared
    to phycocyanin with Sentinel-2. FIGURE 11 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Prediction
    intervals shown with observed data using quantile RFR. 4.6 RFR model selection
    Previous analysis of freshwater bodies using multiple regression found that chl-a
    and phycocyanin had large standard deviations from the mean, which required feature
    engineering to model the nonlinear behavior of HABs (Lee & Lee, 2018). However,
    feature engineering in this study did not improve the multiple regression statistics
    for the validation dataset as shown in Table S3. SVR has been shown to outperform
    multiple regression for chl-a and phycocyanin remote sensing in freshwater bodies
    (Chegoonian et al., 2021). However, RFR models have exhibited even better performance
    for estimating algal pigments including chl-a and phycocyanin compared to SVR
    (Li et al., 2018). The RFR models provided a good balance of results for the statistical
    metrics shown in Table 4 when tested for different k-fold cross validation. The
    factors influencing increased concentrations of chl-a and phycocyanin in freshwater
    bodies are nonlinear, so it makes sense that RFR adapts to the nonlinearities
    found in this study area. RFR models have previously been shown to forecast chl-a
    concentrations in freshwater bodies with the best forecasting results over 3 months
    (Yajima & Derot, 2017). Similarly, a study conducted in Lake Geneva found that
    RFR models have the capability of predicting the concentration of harmful cyanobacteria
    over a year (Derot et al., 2020). Based on model performance with random search
    k-fold cross-validation, and previous literature, RFR was selected as a model
    to translate the satellite observations into water quality parameters in this
    study area. The RFR algorithms tested have the capability to remotely sense algal
    pigments with good certainty, showing R2 values of more than 0.7, consistent with
    the previous research (Abdelmalik, 2018; Chen et al., 2021; Duan et al., 2012;
    Lailia et al., 2015; Olmanson et al., 2013; Toming et al., 2016). RFR models are
    able to be interpreted by visualizing the tree estimators used in the model building
    process. The first estimators of RFR algorithms developed in remote sensing of
    chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin are shown in Figure 12. Complete details of
    the estimators used in the RFR algorithms are shown in Figures S1–S3. FIGURE 12
    Open in figure viewer PowerPoint RF estimators.(..), growing nodes; SR, surface
    reflectance bands; ST, surface temperature bands; T, terminal node. 4.7 Remote
    sensing example during recent HAB events In Grand Lake, there were temporally
    coincident satellite flyovers during 4 days in 2021 including February 3, March
    7, April 8, and July 13, and a HAB event occurred in the late spring that ended
    in July 2021. The satellite data and RFR algorithm were used to remotely sense
    chl-a, and phycocyanin as shown in Figure 13. The concentrations of chl-a were
    higher on the edges of Horse Creek in the month of July which is confirmed by
    the field sampling personnel of GRDA. In addition to algal pigments, turbidity
    was also remotely sensed in Grand Lake using RFR. Figure 13 also shows that the
    Landsat 8 remote sensing estimates of turbidity were not affected by the surface
    chl-a and phycocyanin pigment concentrations. FIGURE 13 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Remotely sensed chl-a (μg/L) (top), turbidity (NTU) (middle), phycocyanin
    (RFU) (bottom) using RFR algorithm developed in building the remote sensing tool.
    Since the temporal and spatial data obtained from satellites are relatively coarse,
    increasing number of satellite flyover and high-resolution in situ datasets could
    further improve water quality observation. Besides, there was a significant HAB
    event during June 2021 but due to significant cloud cover the imagery was not
    obtained by the remote sensing tool for further analysis. 4.8 Implications for
    water resource management The remote sensing software developed in this study
    automates the data acquisition, image processing, and visualization of water quality
    parameters for both Grand Lake and Hudson Reservoir in northeast Oklahoma. This
    tool is already integrated with an early warning HAB advisory system of Grand
    Lake that is currently being used by GRDA for reservoir monitoring purposes. Excessive
    sedimentation in the shallow regions of Horse Creek Cove in Grand Lake make it
    inaccessible by boat and difficult to retrieve physical samples during HAB outbreaks
    that are initiated in these shallow regions due to the interactions between shallow
    surface water and sediments. The remote sensing tool provides the concentration
    of chl-a and phycocyanin needed to assess the near-real-time conditions of the
    shallow regions of Grand Lake. With more in situ data of freshwater bodies across
    lakes and reservoirs in the U.S., the remote sensing tool can help lake managers,
    water quality managers, and people enjoying recreation in freshwater bodies to
    detect HAB outbreaks. The software is open-source and easily transferable to new
    study areas. In addition to remote sensing applications, this approach could be
    used to develop high-resolution surface water quality models with software such
    as the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code to understand how sediment and nutrient
    influxes into lakes and reservoirs can cause HAB events in surface water bodies
    (Gao & Li, 2015; Xie, 2012). 4.9 Limitations and future research This research
    has several limitations and possible directions for future research. The software
    tool makes use of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data, which have moderate spatial and
    temporal resolutions when compared to alternatives such as Planetscope. A Landsat
    pixel, which is 900 m2, is susceptible to land-water mixed pixel problems, interference
    from other objects, and low intensity reflectance from low-concentrations of chl-a
    and phycocyanin. In addition, Landsat-8 has temporal resolution of 16 days during
    this time, several HAB events could occur that are not observed. Moreover, satellites
    are not helpful for species identification and detecting toxic algal scum formation
    within hours. Integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned surface
    vehicles to collect remote sensing and in situ data would help address these issues.
    The tools we developed here could be expanded to use the raster datasets collected
    by UAVs and other satellites to remotely sense water quality data. Integration
    of these datasets and applying machine learning and artificial intelligence could
    potentially produce more reliable daily HABs advisories. 5 CONCLUSIONS Key conclusions
    from this research include: The RFR models were able to provide superior performance
    in estimating in-lake water quality parameters for Grand Lake compared to other
    models tested including multiple regression and SVR. The satellite remote sensing
    tool shows the change in concentrations of water quality parameters including
    chl-a, phycocyanin, and turbidity in Horse Creek Cove of Grand Lake from spring
    to summer of 2021. The remotely sensed chl-a and phycocyanin concentrations provided
    GRDA with information regarding spatial and temporal trends of HABs in Grand Lake
    during summer 2021. The spatial and temporal trends of algal pigment concentrations
    were used by GRDA to provide HAB advisories to public during summer 2021. The
    chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin levels in the reservoirs can be remotely sensed,
    which provides estimates in the shallow and inaccessible regions. This remote
    sensing approach could be extended to new water resources when large datasets
    of in situ data water quality data are available to estimate algal concentrations
    on the surface of freshwater bodies. Further improvement of the remote sensing
    technologies with the addition of new image datasets of satellites and calibration
    of models will make the monitoring of freshwater bodies more efficient. The chl-a
    and phycocyanin estimates from remote sensing tool can provide more insights into
    the incomplete historical data of HAB outbreaks spatially and temporally across
    the Grand Lake. The algal pigment concentrations across several years, when integrated
    with the climate data such as precipitation and temperature, can help understand
    the trends of HAB formation due to extreme weather events and answer question
    on how freshwater HABs form in reservoirs such as Grand Lake. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS

    15 March 2024 Introduction In the nineteenth century, coffee cultivation in Brazil
    began to expand into the Cerrado region. The Cerrado is a vast region of savanna
    with poor soils. However, Brazilian coffee farmers developed new techniques for
    improving the soil, such as using lime and fertilizer. As a result, the Cerrado
    is now the world''s largest coffee-producing region. The components nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, Sulphur, and iron can all be found
    in soil that is considered fertile1. The optimal soil for growing coffee is loamy
    soil, found in the state of north Karnataka, India which has a good combination
    of texture, drainage, and water retention. Coffee plantation soil requires well-drained
    soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Coffee plants have extensive root systems
    that extend deep into the soil to absorb nutrients and water2. The presence of
    nutrient-rich soil serves as the fundamental basis for the optimal growth and
    development of coffee plants, hence facilitating the production of superior-grade
    coffee beans. Fertility refers to the soil''s ability to provide essential nutrients
    for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Healthy soil leads
    to healthier coffee plants, which produce higher yields of high-quality beans.
    Coffee plants thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.0–6.5. Crop covering,
    composting, organic fertilizer, reduced tillage, water conservation, and shade
    management are ancient soil fertility strategies. Restoration of dry land to rich
    soil using IoT sensors to monitor and enhance coffee plantation soil health is
    creative and successful3. Soil sensors measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
    Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. Farmers can protect coffee plants from extreme temperatures by tracking
    soil temperature patterns. Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects
    plant growth and nutrient uptake. Analyzing soil temperature patterns protects
    coffee plants from extreme temperatures4. IoT sensors help farmers optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, and other soil management activities for healthier soil and higher
    crop yields by giving real-time soil data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
    a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are well-suited for processing
    sequential data like IoT sensor time-series data. RNNs are useful for time series
    prediction, anomaly detection, and natural language processing because they can
    learn and understand temporal patterns and interdependencies in datasets. Recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) provide the capability to analyze records of soil moisture
    data, enabling the prediction of forthcoming moisture levels. Conduct a comprehensive
    examination of soil nutrient data to predict potential nutrient deficits, hence
    facilitating the efficient and effective application of fertilizers by farmers.
    This research gap identifies characteristic patterns in soil sensor data, with
    a special emphasis on sudden changes in moisture and nutrient levels. Regular
    soil monitoring will monitor the alterations in soil condition and prompt safeguards
    will be implemented5. Develop predictive models that provide suggestions for optimal
    irrigation, fertilization, and other soil management practices. The limited scope
    of traditional soil testing often focuses on soil organic matter, microbial activity,
    and soil structure. However, the use of organic improvement in soil may result
    in delayed progress. Generalized suggestions derived from past data may not consider
    the particular soil characteristics, regional climate, or contemporary methods
    of management. The information provided Erroneous interpretation of soil test
    findings and suggestions might result in misguided conclusions and unproductive
    actions. Insufficient historical analysis, which fails to account for previous
    management techniques and local environmental conditions, can have an influence
    on evaluations of soil health status and long-term patterns. This paper is organized
    as follows: “Literature review” section presents a review of related work in Recurrent
    Neural Networks with the Internet of Things using deep learning. “The proposed
    model” section describes the proposed RNN-IoT approach in detail. “Results and
    discussion” section presents the experimental setup and results. “Conclusion”
    section discusses the results and compares RNN-IoT with existing methods. “Challenges
    and future possibilities” section concludes the paper and discusses future research
    directions. Literature review Aarthi, R., Sivakumar, D., et al., proposed the
    optimal watering schedule and fertilizer application rate. IoT software platforms
    that can be used to develop smart soil property analysis systems such as Thing
    Speak, Blynk, Cayenne, Node-RED, and Azure IoT Hub. Smart soil property analysis
    systems can provide real-time soil conditions data, allowing farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes. Future work is to develop more sophisticated machine learning
    models to improve the accuracy of the predictions6. Na, A., Isaac, W., Varshney,
    S, et al., proposed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for remote monitoring
    of soil characteristics a system that employs sensors to collect data on soil
    properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, temperature, and
    then communicates this data to a cloud platform or another remote location. These
    soil qualities include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and temperature7. Jain,
    N., Awasthi, Y et al., proposed an IoT-based soil analysis system using optical
    sensors and multivariate regression is a system that uses optical sensors to measure
    the color and reflectance of soil and then uses multivariate regression to predict
    soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content. IoT-based soil
    analysis systems can be made small and portable, making them ideal for field use.
    Future work on IoT-based soil analysis systems could focus on making IoT-based
    soil analysis systems more affordable and accessible to small-scale farmers8.
    Patil, P et al., proposed the implementation of IoT to determine the level of
    bicarbonate in the soil a system that uses sensors to measure the pH and electrical
    conductivity (EC) of soil and then uses this data to calculate the bicarbonate
    level. IoT-based bicarbonate detection systems can provide users with the data
    they need to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices9. Adrian Z et al. proposed integrating soil pH measurement
    into an Internet of Things (IoT) application a concept that involves using sensors
    to measure soil pH and then transmitting this data to a cloud platform or other
    remote location using a wireless communication protocol. The dataset collected
    by IoT-based soil pH measurement systems typically includes soil pH, Temperature,
    Humidity, Electrical conductivity (EC), and Timestamp10 as illustrated in Table
    1. Table 1 Literature review for soil health based on different proposed models.
    Full size table IoT (Internet of Things) is a key enabling technology for smart
    agriculture, as it allows for the collection and analysis of data from sensors
    in real-time. IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems can provide real-time
    data on soil parameters, which allows farmers to respond quickly to changes. Future
    work on IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems could focus on making the
    systems easier to set up and maintain18. The materials and methods section describes
    how the soil is fertilized using IoT sensors and Cloud storage. The proposed model
    The primary objective of this research study was to monitor the overall condition
    of the soil and to design an advanced algorithm called RNN-IoT. The present techniques
    for measuring soil health based on existing and past guidelines have yielded inaccurate
    results. The suggested approach has successfully addressed all of the aforementioned
    limitations and obtained a predictable outcome in transforming barren land into
    sustainable and rich soil suitable for coffee cultivation. Build an IoT sensor

    As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the N95S31B NB-IoT outdoor temperature and humidity
    sensor accurately measures air temperature and relative humidity. Figure 1 Working
    prototype for testing soil fertility. Full size image It subsequently sends data
    to an IoT server over NB-IoT. CO2 sensors measure CO. The waterproof, sturdy CO2
    concentration transmitter outputs 0–10 V. Nordic nRF9160 SiP is a low-power, single-chip
    cellular IoT solution. Its Arm Cortex-M33 CPU, low-power RF transceiver, and multiple
    ports make it adaptable. The Nordic nRF9160 SiP''s ADC peripheral measures soil
    moisture. SiP receives soil moisture sensor data20. The Soil EC NPK PH Sensor
    monitors NPK, EC, and pH. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) may indicate salt
    concentration. Higher EC values imply plant-harming soil salt. Growing plants
    need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It means 20% nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium in the soil. Soil pH indicates acidity or alkalinity. Acidic soils have
    pH < 7, while alkaline soils have pH > 7. Electrical conductivity sensors detect
    soil solution. NPK sensors evaluate soil solution light absorption at different
    wavelengths. This data can track soil health trends and identify areas that need
    specialist soil management. LDR soil color sensors like the MNS2-9-W2-CM-020 improve
    coffee plantation soil health monitoring21. The Maxim Integrated DS3231 time stamp
    may improve coffee plantation soil health monitoring in numerous ways. Plantation
    operators can use time stamps to find patterns and trends in soil health data
    as indicated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Virtual abstract for proposed system. Full size
    image Protocol for interfacing serial technology (IST) Soil moisture sensors measure
    volumetric water content. Two electrodes detect soil electrical resistance, which
    fluctuates with water content. Sensor output is usually a soil moisture-proportional
    voltage or frequency as indicated in Eq. (1). Where VWC is the volumetric water
    content which finds the percentage of soil volume occupied by water, can be calculated
    based on the weight of the wet soil minus the weight of the dry soil which divides
    the weight of the dry soil. εa is the apparent dielectric permittivity of the
    soil, εb is the dielectric permittivity of dry soil, εc is the dielectric permittivity
    of water. Where ρn is the neutron count rate in the soil, ρd is the neutron count
    rate in dry soil, and ρw is the neutron count rate in water as indicated in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{a}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{b}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{w}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{c}}} \\right)$$
    (1) $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\uprho {\\text{n}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)/\\left(
    {\\uprho {\\text{w}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)$$ (2) $${\\text{VWC}} = {\\text{M}}
    + {\\text{N}}*{\\text{R}}$$ (3) where R is soil electrical resistance and M and
    N are calibration constants from Eq. (3). A soil temperature sensor is needed
    to understand soil activity and plant growth22. It employs thermistors or thermocouples,
    whose resistance changes with temperature. Equation (4) shows that the sensor''s
    voltage or current output is proportional to soil temperature. Where T is soil
    temperature, R is thermistor electrical resistance, and A and B are calibration
    coefficients. $${\\text{T}} = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}}*\\ln \\left( {\\text{R}}
    \\right)$$ (4) Water level indicators assess soil water table depth. It employs
    a pressure transducer or ultrasonic sensor to detect water-induced pressure or
    sound reflection. Sensor output is generally a water level-proportional voltage
    or frequency. An NPK color value indicator evaluates soil nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium levels. It measures soil extract color with a colorimetric sensor.
    Sensor output is generally an RGB color value or a numerical NPK level value.
    A GPS sensor locates the soil monitoring spot. GPS satellites inform it of its
    latitude, longitude, and altitude. The sensor sends NMEA messages with location
    coordinates as indicated in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7). $${\\text{Latitude}}={\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left({\\text{sin}}\\left({\\upvarphi
    }\\right),{\\text{cos}}\\left({\\upvarphi }\\right)*{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\uplambda
    \\right)\\right)$$ (5) $${\\text{Longitude}} = {\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left( {\\sin
    \\left(\\uplambda \\right),\\cos \\left(\\uplambda \\right)*\\cos \\left( {\\upvarphi
    } \\right) - \\sin \\left( {\\upvarphi } \\right)*\\sin \\left(\\updelta \\right)}
    \\right)$$ (6) $${\\text{Altitude}} = {\\text{R}}*\\left( {\\sin \\left( {{\\upvarphi
    } - {\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right) - \\left( {{\\text{R}}_{0} + {\\text{h}}} \\right)/{\\text{R}}*\\sin
    \\left( {{\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (7) where \\({\\upvarphi }\\)
    is the geodetic latitude, \\(\\uplambda\\) is the longitude, \\(\\updelta\\) is
    the sun’s declination, R is the Earth''s mean radius (6371 km), R0 is its equatorial
    radius (6378 km), h is the GPS antenna’s height above the Earth’s surface, and
    \\({\\upvarphi }_{0}\\) is the reference ellipsoid’s latitude (43.66° LDRs (light-dependent
    resistors) measure soil color to determine nutrient content. It usually uses an
    LDR, which changes resistance when exposed to different wavelengths of light.
    Sensor output is generally a resistance value that fluctuates proportionately
    with soil color as indicated in Eq. (8). $${\\text{R}}=({\\text{Cr}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})/({\\text{Cw}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})$$
    (8) where R is the reflected light, Cr is the red light component of the incident
    light, Cg is the green light component of the incident light, Cb is the blue light
    component of the incident light, and Cw is the white light component of the incident
    light. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to reflect more red light
    and less blue light, while soils with lower organic matter content tend to reflect
    more blue light and less red light. A pH sensor monitors the acidity or alkalinity
    of the soil. Typically, it employs a glass electrode that generates a voltage
    that varies by the pH of the solution that it is surrounded by. The output of
    the sensor is often in the form of a voltage, and its magnitude is typically proportional
    to the pH of the soil as shown in Eq. (9). $${\\text{pH}}=-{\\text{log}}10\\left({\\text{aH}}+\\right)$$
    (9) pH is soil acidity or alkalinity and pH+ is hydrogen ion activity in the soil
    solution. Each soil health measurement is timestamped. Even when the gadget is
    off, its real-time clock (RTC) preserves precise time. Synchronizing soil health
    data with other sources and tracking changes requires the timestamp. Table 2 estimates
    dry land-rich soil in coffee plantations2. IoT sensors may be connected to Arduino
    using IST. The simple and efficient IST protocol is ideal for connecting many
    sensors to an Arduino microcontroller. It includes Master Out Slave, in Master
    in Slave Out, Slave Select, and Serial Clock. SCLK synchronizes master–slave data
    transfer. MOSI and MISO signals send data from master to slave and slave to master.
    The owner chooses the slave via SS. A start condition from the master device starts
    IST communication with the slave. Most starts are high-to-low SS signal changes.
    After supplying the start condition, the master device can send a MOSI bit per
    SCLK clock pulse to the slave device. The slave device receives MISO data and
    delivers a bit to the master device for each SCLK clock pulse. Stop signals from
    master devices to slave devices halt IST communication. SS signals typically rise
    during a standstill. Arduino microcontroller board with enough computing power
    for data handling and communication interfaces. Use appropriate cables to connect
    each sensor to the microcontroller board for proper pinout and voltage. In Algorithm
    1, each sensor''s communication protocols are configured for data acquisition.

    used to trigger actions, such as sending alert messages based on soil health conditions.
    Recurrent neural network The raw data was delivered to the input layer, where
    it was often preprocessed and normalized to ensure network interoperability. Load
    the CSV file into Panda’s data frame. Preprocess the data by performing necessary
    steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection. Sequence

    (11) Loops from 0 to len(data)—sequence length + 1. This loop generates dataset
    sequences. Unfold the RNN into interconnected layers with input, forget, cell,

    that passes cell state information. Gated recurrent units (GRUs) architecture
    trains the dataset properly depending on soil prediction features. At each time

    the error via the unrolled RNN to calculate weight error gradients. Update weights
    to reduce inaccuracy. Prediction and Analysis in the RNN model increase warnings
    and suggestions by predicting soil health metrics from real-time sensor inputs.

    model25. Change specifics to simulate scenarios. Counter-factual recommendation

    It compares with the actual generated out with historical data to generate recommendations.
    They are comparing the recommendation using three ways Present data—Historical
    data, Historical data—Historical data, and Present data—Present data as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Counter-factual recommendations. Full size image For example,
    let us contemplate a hypothetical situation in which a soil health monitoring
    system, based on feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture, provides a recommendation
    for the optimal application rate of fertilizer for a particular agricultural area.
    Counterfactual suggestion has the potential to be employed to generate alternative
    fertilizer recommendations. Manhattan distance, often known as taxi cab distance,
    is calculated by adding the absolute coordinate differences of two places. Imagine
    traveling solely horizontally or vertically in Manhattan’s grid. Distance is calculated
    using present and historical data. Consider N points in K-dimensional space, where
    2 <  = N <  = 10^ {5} and 1 <  = K <  = 5. Find the location with the lowest Manhattan
    distance from the N places. Manhattan distance is two points measured along right-angle
    axes. It is |x1 − x2| +|y1 − y2| on a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2,
    y2). Sorting the points in all K dimensions and outputting the middle components
    of each dimension reduces the Manhattan distance. $$Manhattan\\;Distance = \\left|
    {s1 - s2} \\right| + \\left| {r1 - r2} \\right|$$ (13) The Manhattan Distance,
    which indicates the dissimilarity between the current suggestion and several alternative
    fertilizer options, may be calculated as shown in Eq. (13), where |s1 − s2| denotes
    the absolute difference between the two points’ s-coordinates. |r1 − r2| is the
    absolute difference in r-coordinates. The calculation considers nutritional content,
    application rates, and environmental effects. The system may create counterfactual
    suggestions with Manhattan Distances below a threshold. This keeps alternate options
    comparable to the original advice while allowing for varied perspectives. The
    implementation phase collects and analyzes data. Results and discussion The field
    implementation of the AI-powered system involved deploying IoT sensors in selected
    infertile agricultural fields to collect real-time soil data. These sensors continuously
    monitor soil properties such as moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, and
    electrical conductivity. XG-booster is used for the pre-training model for predicting
    specific soil properties (e.g., nutrient content, and moisture levels) based on
    sensor data. The collected data was then fed into the AI system, which employed
    RNNs and GRUs to identify patterns and trends in soil health indicators as indicated
    in Fig. 6. Figure 6 Agriculture land setup for testing soil fertility. (a) Agricultural

    False Negative, True Positive, True Negative, and False Positive metrics using
    the Recurrent Neural Network and Counter-Factual Recommendation Generation. Field
    setup for improving soil fertility Enhancing the fertility of the soil is essential
    for achieving sustainable agriculture and achieving maximum crop yields. To evaluate
    and enhance the fertility of the soil throughout a range of monitoring periods,
    this experiment describes a field design that makes use of several land portions.
    Datasets are collected in real-time from Madikeri, Coorg, Karnataka total of 640,
    monthly monitoring based on historical data from the past three years recorded
    around 300582. Performance evaluation compared with RNN A proposed model is compared
    to existing models to determine its accuracy. Table 3 shows random forest, SVM,
    K-means clustering, GAN, and feed-forward neural network. This performance is
    measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    score. Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of
    correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of correct
    positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion
    of actual positive instances that are correctly identified as positive. Table
    3 Performance analysis for the proposed model. Full size table $$Accuracy = (True\\;
    Positives + True \\;Negatives) / (Total\\; Samples)$$ (14) $$Precision = True\\;

    * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)$$ (17) $$Specificity = True \\;Negatives
    / (True \\;Negatives + False\\; Positives)$$ (18) The proposed method achieves
    94.25% accuracy, while random forest, SVM, K-means clustering, GAN, and FFNN obtain
    81.22%, 81.66%, 82.12%, 88.12%, and 89.73%. Existing approaches take longer to
    calculate all datasets. Figure 7 shows that the suggested technique detects events
    better than current methods. High EC and TDS readings indicate excessive salinity,
    which can stress and reduce coffee plant output. Most of the 30-day monitoring
    period had optimum EC and TDS values. NPK levels reflect coffee plant nutrient
    availability. Low nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels can decrease
    coffee plant output. The reduction in NPK levels from day 11–30 suggests dietary
    replenishment. During days 1–10, the soil moisture was a little dry, but otherwise,
    it was excellent. The rain prevented soil desiccation and reduced coffee plant
    stress. Figure 8 shows that soil temperature also affects coffee plant development.
    Coffee plants like soil temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. During the monitoring
    period, soil temperature stayed within the optimal range, promoting root growth
    and nutrient absorption. Figure 7 Result analysis for the proposed approach. Full
    size image Figure 8 Mobile application. Full size image Optimization of the model
    To keep the coffee plants healthy and the farm skiing, it is important to monitor
    the soil health of the plantations. Beans with more robust scents and tastes are
    a product of soil that is both healthy and well-tended. Farmers may maximize water
    and fertilizer efficiency and cut down on production expenses by learning what
    their soil requires to be healthy. To maintain healthy and fertile soil over the
    long term, it is important to evaluate it regularly for signs of nutrient imbalances.
    Weekly data analysis utilizing the RNN model is used to monitor soil conditions,
    and farmers are updated on health-related information and comments about soil
    quality. For a more precise prediction, we compare the soil condition from the
    second week of monitoring with that from the first week. In a similar way comparing
    week 2 with week 1 generates correct results, comparing week 3 with week 2 and
    so on also yields accurate results. Measurements taken to enrich the soil of coffee
    plantations in arid regions When substantially monitoring and tracking various
    essential indicators such as electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, soil temperature,
    carbon dioxide (CO2), and soil pH, agricultural practitioners can promptly detect
    potential issues and implement appropriate measures to uphold an optimal ecosystem
    for their coffee crops. The soil solution''s EC and TDS levels indicate salt content
    as indicated in Table 4. Table 4 Measurement Range to fertile the coffee plantation
    soil from dry land. Full size table CO2 levels rose somewhat from day 11–20, indicating
    a healthier soil microbial community. Coffee plants thrive best at 5.5–6.5 soil
    pH as illustrated in Fig. 9. The soil pH remained within the correct range during
    the monitoring period, ensuring that coffee plants could easily obtain nutrients
    as shown in Table 5. Rainfall is vital to soil hydration. The monitoring period
    was without significant precipitation from day one to day fourteen. This shows
    that irrigation was needed to maintain soil moisture levels throughout this era.
    Day 15 brought 15 mm of rain, restoring soil moisture. Coffee plant soil health
    measurements were within optimal levels for most of the 140-day monitoring period
    from week 1 to week 20. Figure 9 Weekly monitoring using the IoT Platform. Full

    Full size table Counter-factual recommendation RNN-IoT model uses historical data
    and real-time sensor readings to predict future soil states and potential crop
    threats. Based on these predictions, the system generates counterfactual recommendations—alternative
    actions your farm could take to achieve desired outcomes. Mobile application sample
    The mobile application was created with the open-source Google framework Flutter,
    employing JavaScript. The RCNN model has been integrated and implemented, resulting
    in the generation of recommendations. These recommendations are created using
    Counterfactual suggestions. Figure 10 is a discussion based on the question raised
    by the agriculturist from various parts of the coffee plantation growers. Soil-rich
    mobile-based applications will provide recommendations after analyzing sensor
    data. Agriculturist question was “How do soil conditions that are too dry, too
    wet, too cold, or too hot affect coffee plants”. The recommendation is generated
    as High or low soil pH can make it difficult for coffee plants to absorb nutrients.
    Solution: Apply soil amendments to adjust the pH to the optimal range. The specific
    type of soil amendment to apply will depend on the current soil pH and the desired
    pH range. Similarly, “How does rainfall affect coffee plants, and what can coffee
    growers do to mitigate the negative effects of extreme rainfall events”. The recommendation
    is generated as Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to water stress or
    soil erosion. Irrigate during periods of low rainfall and implement erosion control
    measures during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important
    to ensure that coffee plants receive the right amount of water26. The proposed
    model is trained using the Training Set, which enables it to discover hyperlinks
    and patterns in the data. To minimize loss and enhance predictions. To evaluate
    the model''s performance and adjust its hyper-parameters, a validation set is
    utilized during its development. Evaluates the model''s ability to be extrapolated
    to new data, which helps avoid excess fitting. The testing set is utilized for
    the final and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance once all training
    and hyper-parameter adjustments have been finished. Ensures the model''s ability
    to apply knowledge to unfamiliar data and offers an accurate evaluation of its
    capabilities as shown in Fig. 11. The total dataset is divided into 60% for training,
    20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The difference between predicted and
    actual values is computed using a loss function by mean square error. The loss
    is propagated backward through time, updating model parameters (weights and biases)
    to minimize the loss. Figure 10 Farmer’s query-based recommendation. Full size

    exhibits the success of a proposed theory27. The data represents the observed
    vs projected results for each week of monitoring. Within the realm of soil fertility,
    weekdays may be classified as several tiers of fertility. For instance, weeks
    1–7 exhibit low fertility, weeks 8–14 demonstrate medium fertility, and weeks
    15–20 showcase high fertility, making them suitable for cultivation as shown in
    Fig. 12. Figure 12 Multiple confusion matrix for monitoring soil accuracy. Full
    size image By using IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient
    levels, coffee farmers can gain valuable insights into their crops'' health and
    needs. Figure 13 data can then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other agricultural practices—a 20-week soil monitoring study
    that tracks the soil condition in a coffee plantation. The study was conducted
    in a coffee plantation in Madekari, Coorg, and Karnataka, India. Ten IoT sensors
    were installed on the plantation, and data was collected every hour for 20 weeks.
    The sensors measured soil moisture, temperature, and pH at a depth of 10 cm throughout
    20 weeks. Due to heavy rainfall in the early weeks of the research, soil moisture
    was maximum. Dry weather diminished soil moisture. The study''s soil temperature
    peaked in the first weeks and then dropped as the weather cooled. pH was almost
    consistent throughout the investigation. Figure 13 IoT sensors monitoring land
    view. Full size image 20-week. The investigation produced soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH maps. These maps helped identify under and over-watered crop regions and
    regulate the irrigation system. The maps were also utilized to identify acidic
    and alkaline soil on the farm and adapt the fertilization program. Conclusion
    The foreseeable future of coffee production demands beyond merely cultivating
    a diverse range of coffee beans; it involves establishing a sustainable and lucrative
    coffee business that will endure for future generations. Utilizing sophisticated
    sensors allows for the monitoring of environmental variables, including precipitation,
    humidity, and temperature, to optimize agricultural productivity. Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have the potential to accurately assess the levels of water
    and nitrogen present in soil. Furthermore, by assessing the CO2 concentration
    in agricultural areas, it is possible to accurately monitor evapotranspiration
    rates, therefore enhancing the monitoring of soil health. This requires equipping
    coffee growers with the necessary tools and expertise to develop intelligent soil—a
    flexible and robust ecosystem that supports the growth of healthy coffee plants
    while reducing environmental harm. Farmers are provided with immediate updates
    on the condition of their soil and receive alerts on any potential issues. This
    enables farmers to promptly address any early signs of soil degradation. The Recurrent
    Neural Network and Counterfactual Recommendations utilize advanced algorithms
    to forecast future trends and provide tailored soil cures for youthful agriculturists.
    Knowledgeable farmers make well-informed choices regarding their soil, leading
    to higher crop production, better quality, and more profitability. The proposed
    method has overcome all of the above drawbacks and achieved the predictable result
    for converting infertile land to fertile land sustainable for coffee plantations.
    The future direction is moving towards installed outside Internet of Things devices
    are subject to severe weather, dust, wind, temperature, and other environmental
    hazards. This is one of the main issues with these devices. Unexpected mechanical
    failure of the complex devices could occur as a result of unfavorable environmental
    circumstances. Therefore, the raw materials used to construct the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices used in smart farming must be able to endure such harsh climatic
    conditions. This will ensure that the devices last longer and provide more consistent
    results. Coffee cherry early detection and recommendation based on advanced deep
    learning technology which empowers farmers to cultivate a sustainable future for
    coffee, one smart earth revolution at a time. Challenges and future possibilities
    Global research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based smart farming
    have revealed positive results. It is employed in several small-scale agricultural
    domains a rural farm, where farmers have less technological expertise, may provide
    more challenges. Even so, the execution of the project on a broad scale is still
    awaiting completion. An obstacle of great importance is the financial burden associated
    with the deployment and installation of IoT-tagged sensors and accessories in
    vast agricultural areas. Furthermore, there is ambiguity regarding the expenses
    associated with implementation and the monetary benefits that may be obtained.
    Deploying IoT-enabled technology incurs substantial expenses for hardware, software,
    and system operation. Supplementary costs may encompass energy usage, system upkeep,
    service enrollment, and labor fees for operating combined hardware and software.
    Enhancing farmers'' digital literacy on a global scale is crucial to facilitating
    the extensive use of IoT technologies. Lack of comprehension and consciousness
    of IoT-based technologies in agriculture might result in the underutilization
    of intelligent systems in farming28. Government policymakers should develop economic
    strategies to facilitate the successful and efficient implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology by farmers in agricultural areas. Data privacy and
    security issues might hinder large-scale IoT and smart system adoption. Attackers
    can manipulate cloud server data to harm automated agricultural activities in
    farmlands. Attacks can negatively impact agricultural output and prevent good
    environmental management. IoT data security concerns contribute to the sluggish
    adoption of smart farming systems. Encryption is crucial for protecting critical
    data and digital systems in smart farming from global cyberattacks. Integrating
    cryptography with strong keys can reduce cyber threats on cloud systems. Additional
    methods, such as integrating multiparty computing with homomorphic encryption
    or block-chain, can yield accurate results. Experimental statement No plants and
    Animals are disturbed for research work. All image datasets information regarding
    plant-based processes or applications was obtained from publicly available and
    ethically sourced data and publications. Plant Collection materials are complying
    with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. So
    we confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines/regulations/legislation.

  description: With the increasing demands on global agriculture, there is an imperative
    need to optimize crop yields and promote sustainable agricultural practices. Real-time
    monitoring and accurate predictions of soil health and crop yields have significant
    implications for farmers, agronomists, and policymakers. While existing soil analysis
    models offer certain predictive capabilities, their efficiency is often hindered
    by issues related to energy consumption, prediction delay, and accuracy levels.
    Contemporary soil models primarily fall short in addressing the multifaceted nature
    of soil attributes and their dynamic interactions. These models also struggle
    to provide real-time insights, frequently leading to delayed interventions, misallocated
    resources, and suboptimal yields. In this paper, we introduce an advanced, low-cost,
    and energy-aware multiparametric IoT-based soil analysis model designed to overcome
    the prevailing limitations. Our system harnesses the synergy of N, P, K, Humidity,
    and Temperature sensors, augmented with temporal datasets to offer a comprehensive
    view of the soil's current state. At the core of our analysis, an ensemble learning
    model combines the strengths of Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, MLP, and
    1D CNN methods, streamlining accurate yield level predictions. To further refine
    the model's efficiency, a Q Learning approach is integrated, ensuring both energy
    conservation and heightened prediction accuracy. When deployed in various agronomic
    scenarios, the proposed model manifested a marked improvement in prediction metrics.
    Notably, we observed a 10.5% enhancement in precision, 9.4% in accuracy, 8.5%
    in recall, and 4.5% in AUC. Moreover, the model reduced the prediction delay by
    9.5% compared to its counterparts. These advancements underscore the potential
    of our model to revolutionize soil analysis techniques, paving the way for smarter,
    energy-efficient, and productive agricultural practices.

    paper PDF 1 Introduction India is the world''s largest producer of sugar, fruits,
    and jute and also the largest manufacturer of 25% overall production. The extremely
    familiar types of disease attacks on plants’ leaves are alternative of viruses
    and fungoid diseases. As for proper growth of plants and crops, the geographical
    conditions are required 15–20 °C for spraying time, and 20–26 °C for maturing
    and picking with rainfall around 75–100 cm. The growing rate of population and
    advanced conditions of climate also cause harm to plant diseases. Now, the main
    cultivation in India is groundnut, cotton, fish, species, livestock, etc. For
    this, various methods of cultivation have been used like livestock farming, arable
    farming, nomadic farming, sustainable farming, and mixed farming. Livestock farming
    is best for employment and waste which gets activated by animals is used as natural
    manure for the maintenance of soil fertility as agriculture enables a large number
    of quantities of grains and other foodstuffs, and arable farming is used for the
    production of crops that include various types of crops from the growth of plants
    it also produces an extensive range of yearly crops the annual crops means total
    life cycle of the crops from germination to grain production enclosed by 12 months.
    Nomadic farming is a type of primary sustainable farming, nomadic live in arid
    and semiarid parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe in Africa nomadic herd cattle,
    goats, sheep, camels, and other animals managed by nomadic including horses, mux-oxen,
    yaks; mixed farming is used to involve growing crops and raise of livestock. Thus,
    pesticides take an essential role in the production of food and the pesticide
    industry had done contribution in 2018 of over 6.75 billion and the Indian industry
    cultivated 9%, the investment is evaluated at 16.7 million. Although there are
    various types of pesticides used in farming like rodenticides larvicides, overuse
    of fertilizers and pesticides affects soil organisms that are similar to humans
    overworked with antibiotics. For example, plants may depend on different types
    of microorganisms to convert atmospheric nitrogen into nitrates, which plants
    can use. As per the Indian government, 40% land about 150 billion corrupted. As
    in agricultural generation, 25% of land gets degraded and the soil carbon, nitrous
    oxide exists the atmosphere. Once there, they can infect plants and animals ranging
    from favorable microorganisms, insects, fish, and birds. The detection can be
    done by using plants leaf, temperature, gas sensor, humidity, and soil moisture
    readings will be received from the sensors. Now, in the advanced period of agriculture
    epoch of Industry 4.0 faces many objections, and IoT with automation is used for
    the fulfillment of “Automatic disease detection to monitor the plant health for
    various plants leaf using image processing techniques and TensorFlow algorithm.”
    1.1 Literature Review The apple leaf disease affects the yields of apples; they
    show a detecting process in real time and a deep learning approach on CNN detection
    of leaves of brown spots, gray spots, and mosaics [1]. In this paper, they have
    discussed and used the technology of bacteria foraging algorithm, image segmentation,
    and neural network. The image processing is done for processing of leaf images
    by using methods like soft computing and conventional method [2]. The arbuscular
    mycorrhizal fungus on growth and development of blast resistance is used and examined
    all rice types which were sensitive root colonization by AM fungus [3]. This paper
    shows plant detection of disease in real time that is affected using a convolutional
    neural network for appropriate fertilizers spread on the damaged portion of plants.
    For improving the accuracy of the system, they have used a TensorFlow framework;
    the accuracy is increased by up to 95%. The remaining area infected by diseases
    is calculated by k-means algorithm [3]. In this paper, they show the detection
    of diseases that affect various plants by using image processing techniques. As
    commonly we know farmers spray pesticides on the plants but also affect humans
    directly and indirectly through health issues or any other [4]. This paper uses
    the technology of ML and processing of image to allow the viral disease from the
    snaps of leaf, and this method identifies the injury of potato leaf disease. Their
    segmentation approaches the utilization by using multiclass SVM [5]. The algorithm
    has used deep learning network for detection of tobacco plants in photos captured
    by using unmanned aerial vehicles. This algorithm has three stages the primary
    stage with morphological and watershed segmentation, the second is convolutional
    neural network is assembled and train with tobacco plant region and the third
    part is post-processing are performed to discard the non-tobacco plant [6]. This
    paper uses forest in identifying plant disease between healthy and disease plants
    for extracting the features of the image. This is used by using the trained dataset
    to detect the virus by using ML technology [7]. They have used a data augmentation
    technique that has been used to do the deviation of the leaf photos in dataset.
    As they have also used the CNN model for image classification, the accuracy is
    98.56% [8]. This paper shows about image detector and the resource-constrained
    using a convolutional network implemented in a low-cost, platform to perform the
    types of plant infection [9]. In this paper, they discussed current trends and
    challenges for plant leaf disease using deep learning method using a k-means clustering
    algorithm [10]. This paper shows the present surveys on current techniques and
    prediction models for the validation and diagnosis of tomato leaf diseases based
    on image processing and the IoT for the verification and various types of tomato
    plant diseases [7]. They show leaf diseases that can be effectively used to detect
    the leaves of plants but the unhealthy plants that we get are unbalanced that’s
    why it is difficult to detect the diseases from the unhealthy plant''s dataset
    for solving this they have used double GAN to generate higher-resolution pictures
    of unhealthy plants leaf using samples [11]. 2 Methodology First of all, the robot
    system will start activating and it will move into the farm for taking photos;
    it will check the height of plants; if it''s too low, then the mechanism will
    spray the fertilizers for the proper growth of plants; if the height is proper,
    then it will again go for taking photos for detection of insects on plants; if
    any parasitic detected, then it will spray pesticides on the affected portion
    of plants and send alert message to the farmer (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Flowchart for
    prototype device Full size image Algorithm Used for Plants Disease Detection:
    TensorFlow: It is a library of Python language used for rapid arithmetic calculations,
    and it can also create models of hierarchical learning exactly. This model detects
    leaf spot diseases and also predicts healthy leaves. The TensorFlow algorithm
    also uses a neural network for training the image classification model. The TensorFlow
    should be run on single central processing unit as well as on graphic processing
    unit and mobile devices. The used dataset is used in training and testing of dataset
    1000 from that 700 images of plants are used for training and remaining 300 images
    are uses for testing. The dataset is identified across the model for the procedure
    of building to escape overfitting. The tested dataset is independent for the training
    set. The test dataset is used to identify the performance of model or accuracy
    of model, and the images of plants classify leaves based on the below parts: Healthful
    part: In this case, the plants’ leaves are healthy and show no symptoms of bacteria
    or infections of any kind (change in color, of leaves, etc.) Bacteria part: In
    this, the bacterial spots are identified, and therefore, the system gives alert
    message to farmer. Viral part: In this case, the color of leaves gets changed
    due to DNA virus that’s why it changes the color. Late Blight part: In this part,
    the harmful plants infection especially affects rice. 2.1 Block Diagram Figure
    2 shows systematic diagram for the observation of farms as the Esp32 module is
    used to collect all data from sensors like LDR. Various sensors are used in the
    farm like temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and gas sensor. As temperature
    sensor is useful while growing the crops which needs wet and dry climatic conditions,
    the temperature sensor measures the presence of heat energy of the soil and also
    determines whether it is good for plants growth. If the temperature rises high
    in the farm, then it causes erosion to the cultivation of yields. If temperature
    is too low on the farm, then it decreases the plant''s enzymes and it causes to
    stunt growth or may cause it to die. The humidity sensor is used for controlling
    and monitoring [12] the humidity as well as the air temperature of the farm. As
    if humidity arises high, then plants get to die and crops get fail. If it arises
    low, then the growth of plants takes more time for the growth and smaller leaves
    get to drop off and the quality of plants is not so good. The moisture sensor
    is used for the capacity of water level of soil and also for good irrigation management
    which gives better crops and increases the profit of the farmer as well as the
    land; if the moisture level is too low in the farm, then plants may not mature
    and they may die. So for the betterment of crops and plants, normally 21–40% of
    moisture level is required. The gas sensor is used on the farm for how much amount
    of gas is present in the farm and environment or if anyone tries to spread petroleum
    in the farm at that time this sensor senses it and gives an alert message to the
    farmer; due to this, our farm can be saved due to unwanted gas spread. The DC
    motor is used in the farm as it plays a necessary part in the farm for scanning
    plants vertically and horizontally for the detection and monitoring of the plant''s
    health if the disease gets detected the LCD will display all the desired conditions.
    And servomotor is used for spraying the pesticides on the affected portion of
    the plant this mechanism is inserted in the robot if any insect is detected, then
    the mechanism will start and spray the pesticides. The water pump is used if the
    moisture of the soil gets low, then water pump will start by triggering the relay.
    If moisture level is too high, then off the water pump. Thus, all the data will
    be sent to on new technology of Blynk cloud to show the data in real time and
    a power supply is provided to all the sensors for proper working and giving the
    results. As in greenhouse automation [13], they used the old Blynk technology
    for controlling the greenhouse system including soil moisture, temperature, and
    humidity. Fig. 2 Schematic diagram of observing farmland Full size image 3 Design
    Implementation The working implementation consists of various parts, processing
    which is defined below: A. Collection of Dataset The analysis depends on the detection
    of affected leaf; [14] I have collected a dataset from an agricultural institution.
    This dataset has images of various disease-affected plants [15] . I organized
    to collect pictures of various types of infection indication. They are apple black
    dots, grape spot, maize gray dots, tomato mosaic virus, and peach bacterial spot
    [16]. One of the most frequent diseases is in apple plants which may be increased
    by fungi. Podosphaera leucotricha is the black spot as its name shows with black
    spots seen on the surface of the leaves. Grape leaf spot shows about fungus Phomopsis
    viticola, and maximal is determined the most critical disease of grapes [17].
    Gray spot on corn results on top side. Yellow spots are viewed on another side
    of white disease wrapping the inner part of a leaf. Tomato mosaic virus is mostly
    known as plant pathogenic [18]. The number of images collected from diseases is
    shown in the table (Figs. 3, 4, and 5). Fig. 3 Table on plants diseases Full size
    image Fig. 4 Various leaves [19] affected by unwanted pesticides Full size image
    Fig. 5 Boxplot on the affected area of the plants (leaf) Full size image 4 Future
    Scope It is used in the animal shed for monitoring domestic animals. It will help
    the farmers to do work in any season and conditions [20, 21] . It reduces the
    time consumed in spraying the pesticides [22]. It works very effectively, and
    it will reduce the danger to farmers [23] from different breathing and physical
    problems. This model is used for the detection of various types of plants disease
    [24]. This system is used for multiple types of plants health and disease. 5 Conclusion
    The agriculture field needs automation in large amounts to make the human work
    easy, [25] and the agriculture [26] hanging robot [27] has been designed for monitoring
    the farm weather (temperature, humidity, and soil moisture) and also plants health;
    thus, system will go detection of insects [28] if any found the system will spray
    pesticides only on the affected portion of plants. By using this technology, there
    will be less time consumed and I can protect the farm as well as plants from unwanted
    pesticides. This proposed model is designed for the detection and quality of leaves
    by using different types of sensors like temperature, humidity, gas sensor, and
    soil moisture sensor. The purpose device is used whether the device is healthy
    or diseased. 6 Software Testing See Figs. 6, 7, and 8. Fig. 6 Monitoring the farm

    In this project, I have used various sensors like DHT11, gas sensor also soil
    moisture; apart from these, I have also used water pumps for the proper nourishment
    of crops health. Although these all sensors have been used for monitoring, the
    farm and sensors give values on LCD in real-time mode [29, 30] . Thus, the proposed
    system also gives suggestion to the farmers for the betterment of farm and how
    to get rid of plants diseases by applying the appropriate amount of fertilizers
    and pesticides. Fig. 9 Output results of the farm on LCD Full size image References

    Highlights • Norovirus, rotavirus, astrovirus, and adenovirus were detected on
    water and vegetables from farms and markets in Tehran. • Twenty percent of samples
    from farms and markets tested positive for at least one virus. • Rotavirus was

    Introduction Food has been recognized as a route of disease transmission for over
    a century when poliomyelitis outbreaks were associated with raw milk (Jubb, 1915).
    While the prevalence of food-borne diseases in the world has increased in recent
    years, increasing focus has been directed at foodborne viruses, as they have been
    estimated to be the leading cause of foodborne illness. Many of the most prevalent
    foodborne viruses are transmitted primarily via the fecal-oral route (Greening
    and Cannon, 2016). Norovirus (NoV), sapovirus (SaV), enteroviruses (EV), adenoviruses
    (AdV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), rotavirus (RV), and astroviruses
    (AstV) have all been associated with foodborne disease outbreaks and are shed
    in feces (Greening and Cannon, 2016). Among these viruses, norovirus is the leading
    cause of foodborne illnesses (Kirk et al., 2015; Scallan et al., 2011). In addition,
    the presence of fresh produce in food outbreaks has recently increased (Gould
    et al., 2013; Miranda and Schaffner, 2019; Torok et al., 2019). An estimates in
    2013 suggest that the consumption of leafy vegetables and fruits-nuts leads to
    35 % and 15 % of viral outbreaks, respectively (Painter et al., 2013). Moreover,
    an examination of data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention''s
    Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System during the period of 1998 to 2013
    revealed interesting trends. The analysis demonstrated an increase in the proportion
    of outbreaks attributed to raw produce over time. Specifically, the percentage
    rose from 8 % in the years 1998 to 2001 to 16 % in the years 2010 to 2013. Among
    the outbreaks involving raw produce, vegetable row crops were most commonly implicated
    (38 %), followed by fruits (35 %) and seeded vegetables (11 %) (Bennett et al.,
    2018). Furthermore, a recent literature review that focused on healthcare-associated
    foodborne outbreaks found that vegetables and fruits were frequently reported
    as the implicated foods in these settings (25 %). These food categories were also
    associated with the highest number of case-patients, accounting for 1308 out of
    3802 cases (35 %) (Boone et al., 2021). This also corresponds to the increased
    consumption of leafy greens by populations in worldwide (Little and Gillespie,
    2008; Yahia et al., 2019). Leafy greens are often consumed raw or semi-cooked
    with minimal washing, making illness with any pathogens more likely if vegetable
    contamination occurs. Foodborne viruses can contaminate produce at any point from
    pre-harvest to post-harvest, including during preparation. Major contamination
    routes are irrigation water and improper food handler hygiene. Studies demonstrate
    that the lack of hygiene during food handling is a key risk factor for transmission,
    as demonstrated by research in New Zealand and the Netherlands linking poor hygiene
    to outbreaks of norovirus and rotavirus, respectively (de Wit et al., 2003; Thornley
    et al., 2013). Though contamination can occur throughout the supply chain, multiple
    studies from Argentina (Prez et al., 2018), South Korea (Cheong et al., 2009;
    Shin et al., 2019), Spain (Truchado et al., 2021), and two recent studies in Egypt
    (Shaheen et al., 2019; Shaheen et al., 2022) detected enteric viruses like NoV,
    AstV, RV, EV, HAV, and AdV on vegetable surfaces and in irrigation water. This
    further highlights the risk of viral contamination during agriculture via irrigation
    water and poor hygiene practices. Overall, produce can be contaminated with viruses
    at nearly any point from farm to fork, underscoring the need for improved safety
    practices throughout the food production and handling system (Greening and Cannon,
    2016). Iran, with its diverse climatic conditions and agricultural practices,
    provides a unique environment for studying the interactions between pathogens
    and vegetables. Tehran, the capital of Iran, stands as the country''s largest
    and most populous city, covering an area of approximately 11,000 km2 and housing
    a population of about 14 million. This city is located on the slopes of the Alborz
    range, which is favorable in terms of climate. A fertile plain to the south presents
    opportunities for agriculture because of the presence of springs, rivers, and
    wells in this area. However, climate change and the depletion of certain water
    sources have compelled farmers to resort to water with high pollution risk, such
    as sewage water or water contaminated with sewage from city canals. Limited research
    has been conducted on vegetable contamination in Iran, which is the predominant
    focus of these studies on bacterial and parasitic pathogens (Azimirad et al.,
    2021; Fallah et al., 2016; Fatemi et al., 2022; Javanmard et al., 2019; Yahaghi
    et al., 2014). The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence of NoV
    genogroups I (GI) and II (GII), RV, AstV, AdV, HAV, and HEV in vegetable samples
    collected from farms and fruit and vegetable centers, along with irrigation water
    in Tehran, Iran. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Background and sample collection
    This study was conducted in Tehran, Iran, in two phases: Phase I, a pilot study
    to validate the methodology and select sample types, and Phase II, a comprehensive
    study. In Phase I, five types of leafy green vegetables (parsley, basil, watercress,
    lettuce, and spinach) were collected from farms in the south of Tehran and Fruit
    and Vegetable Centers (FVCs) (Fig. 1). Over the course of seven months from September
    2020 to March 2021 (Phase I), a total of 145 vegetable and 8 irrigation water
    samples were collected. Approximately 8 samples were collected from farms each
    month during Phase I, except for January, February and March when no farm samples
    were taken. Additionally, around 15 samples were collected from fruit and vegetable
    centers (FVCs) each month in Phase I. In Phase II, which spanned from April to
    August 2021, the focus expanded to include 23 farms and 50 FVCs, with particular
    attention to lettuce and parsley. In this phase, an average of 18 samples per
    month was collected from farms and 45 samples per month from FVCs (Table 1). All
    farms in Phase II were situated within seven agricultural regions of Tehran Province
    (Varamin, Shahr-e-rey, Kahrizak, Jahan Abad, Chahardangeh, Shahriar, and Baghstan)
    and contributed significantly to the vegetable supply in Tehran (Fig. 1). A total
    of 88 samples were collected from the selected farms, along with 16 irrigation
    water samples from these farms, across the seven agricultural regions (Table S1).
    Additionally, the samples were gathered from 226 fruit and vegetable distribution
    centers situated across 22 districts within Tehran. This endeavor was undertaken
    within each geographical zone, with the number of sampling centers ranging from
    1 to 3, proportional to the size of the respective area (Fig. 1, Table S1). The
    study, encompassing both Phases I and II, involved analyzing a total of 475 samples,
    including 123 from farms, 328 from FVCs, and 24 water samples (Table S1). Download

    on the farm. For FVCs, samplers completed a questionnaire while purchasing samples
    to assess the health and quality of available products. All collected samples
    were stored in sterile boxes at 4 °C and transferred to the Virology Laboratory
    of the Research Institute of Gastrointestinal and Liver Diseases (RIGLD) for the
    viral concentration and detection process within 24 h. 2.2. Process controls and
    virus recovery Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) was used to evaluate virus recovery
    from our concentration and detection assays as previously reported (Rafieepoor
    et al., 2022). To assess recovery from water samples, 2 L of autoclaved irrigation
    water was inoculated with 100 μL of IBV suspension containing 1.5 × 106 TCID50
    prior to concentration using a slightly modified version of ISO 15216-2:2019.
    Fresh produce samples of lettuce and parsley were also tested. Leaves were chopped
    into small pieces and 50 g portions were thoroughly washed and exposed to ultraviolet
    light for 20 min. Each produce sample was then divided in half under sterile conditions.
    One-half was inoculated with the same amount of IBV prior to concentration. The
    other half served as an uninoculated control. The recovery efficiency of IBV from
    the inoculated samples was determined as described in the ISO protocol. Additionally,
    representative lettuce and parsley samples collected during the study period were
    each inoculated with IBV as a sample process control virus to validate the full
    concentration and detection process. 2.3. Elution and concentration Any viruses
    present on the surface of vegetables were isolated and concentrated using a TGBE
    elution buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM glycine, 3 % beef extract, pH 9.5) and
    polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation as previously reported (Dubois et al.,
    2002). Briefly, each vegetable sample (25 g) was cut into 2.5 × 2.5 cm2 pieces,
    placed in a sterile plastic bag, and shaken gently with 40 ml of TGBE buffer for
    20 min. The resulting mixture was then passed through Whatman filters (Whatman
    Grade 41, Fast Ashless filter paper, 150 mm circle, 1441–150) for clarification,
    removing debris. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and adjusted
    to pH 7.0 using 6 M HCl. According to the ISO 15216-2:2019 guidelines, polyethylene
    glycol (PEG) 6000 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and NaCl were added to the samples
    to reach final concentrations of 10 % (wt/vol) and 0.3 M, respectively. The samples
    were incubated with a shaker overnight at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at
    11,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the pellet storage at −70 °C in 200 μL of PBS
    (pH 7.4). For water samples, 1.5 l were collected and concentrated using the Katayama
    electronegative method with some modifications (Katayama et al., 2002). The samples
    were passed through 47 mm nitrocellulose filters (Sartorious) with 0.45 μm pore
    size after adding MgCl2 with a final concentration of 25 mM. The nitrocellulose
    filter was washed with 200 ml of 0.5 mM H2SO4, and then an elution buffer consisting
    of 10 ml of NaOH (0.1 mM) was passed through the filter to elute the viruses.
    The elution buffer was neutralized with 100 μL of Tris-EDTA and 50 μL of H2SO4
    (100 mM) in a centrifuge tube. In the second stage, PEG 6000 (12.5 %) and NaCl
    (2.5 %) were used. The samples were placed on a mixer at 300 rpm at 4 °C overnight,
    followed by centrifugation at 11,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C and pellets storage
    at −70 °C in 200 μL of PBS. 2.4. Nucleic acids extraction and cDNA synthesis Nucleic
    acid extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed on both vegetable and water
    samples using commercial kits. The viral RNA or DNA was extracted from 140 μl
    of the final concentrated dissolved pellet suspension using the QIAamp viral RNA
    mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Hilden, Germany), which allowed simultaneous purification
    of RNA and DNA from the samples. The extracted RNA was then converted into cDNA
    using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit, according to the manufacturer''s
    instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The extracted RNA and cDNA were
    stored at −70 °C and − 20 °C, respectively, until further use. 2.5. Molecular
    detection of viruses 2.5.1. AstV, RV, NoV GI, NoV GII, AdV detection assays To
    detect enteric viruses, a multiplex qPCR method was employed, which was designed
    and optimized by van Maarseveen et al. (2010). Briefly, the method involved two
    multiplex qPCR reactions. The first assay targeted AstV, RV, NoV GI, and the second
    assay targeted AdV, NoV GII (Table S2). In this RT-qPCR assay, Equine Arteritis
    Virus (EAV) and Phocine Herpes Virus (PhHV) nucleotide sequences were utilized
    as molecular process controls in each reaction, respectively. These controls were
    employed as internal controls within the samples to monitor the nucleic acid isolation
    procedure and detect any inhibition of amplification. The reactions were carried
    out in 25 μL reaction mixtures containing specific amounts of primers, probes,
    RealQ Plus 2× Master Mix for Probe (Ampliqon, Denmark), and 5 μL of cDNA. Both
    multiplex assays were run with universal thermal cycling parameters on a Rotor-Gene
    Q MDx thermal cycler (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) (Table S2). In case of positive
    control, plasmids were synthesis for targeting DNA and RNA fragments of each virus,
    and for negative control, nuclease-free water were used. Serial dilutions of plasmids
    were prepared to obtain standard curves for each virus studied. 2.5.2. HAV and
    HEV detection assay To detect the presence of Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and Hepatitis
    E virus (HEV) in the collected samples, single qPCR amplification was performed
    based on the primers, probes, and conditions described by Gardner et al. (2003)
    and Jothikumar et al. (2006) was performed. To validate and further investigate
    the initial results, nested PCR was employed due to its higher sensitivity and
    specificity of detection. The nested PCR assays from Tallo et al. (2003) for HAV
    and Inoue et al. (2006) for HEV were performed in two rounds of amplification
    over 40 total cycles to enable detection of viral sequences at lower levels than
    conventional PCR. Thermal cycling for both qPCR and nested PCR was performed using
    optimized instruments - a Rotor-Gene Q MDx thermal cycler (QIAGEN) was used for
    qPCR while an Eppendorf MasterCycler epGradient Cycler Thermo (Model 5341) performed
    the nested PCR thermal profile. 2.5.3. IBV detection assay The SYBR green qPCR
    assay used for detection of Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) previously was published
    (Rafieepoor et al., 2022). The quantification of IBV RNA was performed by generating
    standard curves using serial dilution. The RNA used for the standard curves was
    extracted from the Massachusetts H120 vaccine strain. The resulting standard curve
    exhibited a linear dynamic range spanning from 102 to 106 copies for IBV (y =
    −3.710× + 41.110, R2 = 0.99). 2.6. Statistical analysis The collected data was
    analyzed using SPSS software (version 20, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive
    statistics, including means, standard deviations, frequencies, and percentages,
    were calculated to summarize the demographic characteristics of the study population
    and the prevalence of foodborne viruses. Chi-square analysis was performed to
    examine associations between variables, such as the presence of foodborne viruses
    and study phases, as well as the types of leafy green vegetables and seasonal
    variations in virus detection examined. The significance level was set at p <
    0.05. The results were interpreted alongside laboratory experiments and other
    relevant data to provide a comprehensive understanding of virus prevalence and
    distribution. 3. Results 3.1. Process control and IBV recovery The mean recoveries
    of IBV in the spiked experiment using irrigation water, lettuce, and parsley samples
    were as follows: irrigation water exhibited a mean recovery of 3.36 × 105 ± 1.35
    × 105 GC/g (22.4 %), lettuce had a mean recovery of 3.24 × 105 ± 1.21 × 105 GC/g
    (21.6 %), and parsley showed a mean recovery of 3.16 × 10^5 ± 4.8 × 10^4 GC/L
    (21.1 %). 3.2. Detection of enteric viruses Leafy green vegetables were collected
    from farms, and FVCs, and irrigation water in Tehran, Iran, between September
    2020 and August 2021. The presence of foodborne viruses was determined using qPCR,
    with 16 out of 145 samples (12.97 %) testing positive in phase I and 67 out of
    330 samples (20.30 %) testing positive in phase II (Table 2). The most frequently
    detected virus overall was RV (10.7 %), followed by NoV GII (3.15 %), NoV GI (2.5
    %), AstV (1.05 %), and AdV (0.21 %) (Fig. 2). HAV and HEV were not detected in
    any of the samples. Table 2. Etiological Prevalence of Foodborne Viruses in Fresh

    Fig. 2. The percentage of genomes of different viruses among the contaminated
    samples. The results showed that for Rotavirus, 48 positive samples were quantified
    from the collections mentioned above. The concentration ranged from 1.64 × 101
    to 4.03 × 103 GC/g, with a mean concentration of 2.52 × 102 ± 5.89 × 102 GC/g
    (mean ± SD). Only 3 water samples were positive for Rotavirus, with a concentration
    range of 9.824 × 102 to 4.076 × 103 GC/L and a mean of 2.4281 × 103 ± 1.557 ×
    103 GC/L (mean ± SD). For Astrovirus, five positive samples were quantified ranging
    in concentration from 8.66 × 101 to 2.39 × 102 GC/g, with a mean of 1.4 × 102
    ± 6.08 × 101 GC/g (mean ± SD). Ten samples were positive for Noroviruses genogroup
    I with concentrations between 6.69 × 101 to 2.632 × 103 GC/g and a mean of 5.999
    × 102 ± 8.457 × 102 GC/g (mean ± SD). Only one water sample was positive for Norovirus
    genogroup I at a concentration of 9.12 × 101 GC/L. Finally, for Noroviruses genogroup
    II, 14 positive samples had concentrations from 7.75 to 2.926 × 103 GC/g and a
    mean of 6.663 × 102 ± 9.258 × 102 GC/g (mean ± SD). Interestingly, the detection
    rate for NoV GI and GII was significantly higher in phase I (P = 0.005), while
    AstV and RV were more frequently detected in phase II (P < 0.001) (Fig. 3). This
    may be attributed to the seasonal increase in NoV transmission, which commonly
    occurs during the winter months (CDC, 2023). In phase I, viral contamination was
    not detected in the farm samples, except for one irrigation water sample contaminated
    with NoV GI. Additionally, the contamination in FVCs was much lower compared to
    phase II (Table 2). Out of the five FVCs sampled in phase I, viruses were detected
    in four of them. In November 2020, out of 30 samples collected from four FVCs,
    2 samples were contaminated with NoV GI and 9 samples with NoV GII, indicating
    widespread contamination in distributed fresh produce. However, widespread contamination
    was not observed in other months, with only one sample contaminated with AdV in
    October and one contaminated sample with NoV GI detected in March (Fig. 3). Download

    were detected in 15 farms, with 11 farms having virus detection in only 1 sample,
    three farms with 2 positive samples, and one farm with 3 positive samples. In
    one of the samples collected from this farm, two viruses were detected simultaneously
    (Fig. 4). Additionally, viruses were detected in three irrigation water samples

    in 37 out of 226 collected samples, corresponding to 26 FVCs. Notably, out of
    the 26 FVCs, two centers had 3 positive samples, 7 had 2 positive samples, and
    the remaining had only 1 positive sample. In phase II, out of the 67 samples with
    virus detection, rotavirus was detected in 51 samples by qPCR. This virus was
    observed in all months of phase II, with the highest contamination observed in
    April (n = 18), followed by June (n = 12), May (n = 8), August (n = 7), and July
    (n = 4) (P < 0.001). Other viruses detected in phase II include NoV GI (n = 6),
    NoV GII (n = 5), and AstV (n = 4). As mentioned earlier, phase I examined five
    types of leafy green vegetables (lettuce, parsley, watercress, basil, and spinach),
    while phase II focused on two types (lettuce and parsley). In phase I positive
    samples, spinach, lettuce, watercress, and parsley were contaminated by viruses
    in four, three, three, and one sample, respectively. In phase II, out of the 57
    positive samples, 37 samples were related to parsley, and 20 samples were related
    to lettuce. The majority of positive samples (77 out of 83) were contaminated
    with one viral agent, while 7 samples were contaminated with two viruses. Two
    samples contained AstV and RV, three samples contained RV and NoV GI, and two
    samples contained RV and NoV GII. One sample from phase I was contaminated with
    NoV GI and II (Table 3). Table 3. Frequency and ratio of single and multiple viral

    In the context of the global effort to enhance quality of life and promote healthy
    nutrition, vegetables play a significant role in the modern human diet. However,
    studies have shown that vegetables can serve as common sources of foodborne pathogens,
    including viral pathogens. This transmission may occur due to insufficient initial
    washing, inadequate cooking practices, inadequate hygiene by food handlers, as
    well as specific cultivation and harvesting methods (Little and Gillespie, 2008;
    Moritz et al., 2023). Although viruses cannot replicate outside living cells,
    they can contaminate fresh produce at different stages, both pre-harvest and post-harvest
    (Bosch et al., 2011; Seymour and Appleton, 2001). Viral contamination of irrigation
    water is a known pathway for viral outbreaks linked to the consumption of fresh
    produce (Gerba and Choi, 2006; Shaheen et al., 2019). Additionally, food handlers
    and food processors are potential sources of viral contamination. Notably, NoV
    and HAV are viruses that are most frequently associated with outbreaks through
    the consumption of fresh produce, such as frozen raspberries, green salad, and
    fresh fruit (Moritz et al., 2023; Seymour and Appleton, 2001). Limited studies
    have been conducted on the contamination of leafy green vegetables with enteric
    viruses in farms and local markets in Iran, with a focus on farms in most cases,
    while some work has been done in other countries. For example, a study conducted
    in three European countries (Greece, Serbia, and Poland) shows that in the monitoring
    of production, processing and point of sale AdV, pAdV, HAV, HEV, NoV GI, NoV GII
    and bPyV were detected in 20.09 %, 5.53 %, 1.32 %., 3.42 %, 2 %, 2.95 % and 0.82
    % of the samples by RT-PCR, respectively (Kokkinos et al., 2012). In a study in
    Argentina, NoV was detected in 58 % of samples, RV in 5 % of samples, AstV in
    32 % of samples, and infective enterovirus (iEV) in 79 % of vegetable samples
    which were collected from pre-urban farms (Prez et al., 2018). Meanwhile, some
    studies, like one in Japan, reported no detection of NoV GI, NoV GII, HAV, AdV,
    RV and AstV in cabbage and lettuce samples (Shin et al., 2019). Furthermore, another
    study in Spain failed to detect HAV in any of the 95 leafy green samples taken
    and NoV was detected in 5–6 % of the samples (Truchado et al., 2021). In a recent
    study conducted in Egypt, a Middle Eastern country, it was found that 41.6 % (30/72)
    of surface water samples and 27 % (13/48) of fresh produce samples used for irrigation
    were contaminated with HAV, NoV GI, and NoV GII (Shaheen et al., 2022). The variation
    in virus presence among studies could be attributed to the sample sizes, molecular
    detection methods employed, and differences in the water and public health conditions
    of each country. Regrettably, there is a lack of extensive studies or official
    reporting systems focused on foodborne viral outbreaks in Iran. However, studies
    in other countries have shown associations between norovirus infections and the
    consumption of fresh produce. A study has been conducted in the United States
    and the European Union shows that out of 233 NoV cases from 2004 to 2012 (Callejón
    et al., 2015), 108 cases were related to the consumption of fresh produce. Alternatively,
    in Australia fresh produce was responsible for 4 % of foodborne diseases (Kirk
    et al., 2008). According to a recent report by the National Outbreak Reporting
    System (NORS) to the CDC, it was found that from 2017 to 2019, among the outbreaks
    with a confirmed or suspected agent (555 out of 800, 69.4 %), the most prevalent
    pathogens were norovirus and Salmonella, responsible for 47.0 % and 18.6 % of
    the outbreaks, respectively (Moritz et al., 2023). In this study, conducted in
    Tehran, Iran, we aimed to examine the presence of enteric viruses on the surfaces
    of vegetables collected from farms, irrigation water sources, and fruit and vegetable
    centers (FVCs). The study utilized qPCR to detect enteric viruses and observed
    a significant presence of these viruses on leafy green vegetables in Tehran. It
    is essential to note that while qPCR accurately quantifies viral genomes, it cannot
    distinguish infectious from non-infectious viruses and reports the infectious
    and non-infectious together (Randazzo et al., 2016). As consequence of this, although
    the detection of viral nucleic acid presence on vegetables is valuable and shows
    traces of viral contamination, it does not necessarily indicate the presence of
    infectious viruses. Additionally, the low viral genome copy numbers on vegetable
    surfaces make the methods of concentration, sampling, and detection critical in
    confirming viral presence, and the potential for this method to miss contamination
    at low levels for some of the viruses exists (Hamza et al., 2009). Out of the
    475 collected samples, it was determined that at least one enteric virus, such
    as RV, AstV, NoV GI, NoV GII, HAV, or HEV, was detected in 83 samples. During
    phase I, contamination was observed in limited number of farms and FVCs samples
    (about 12.5 %). However, with the expansion of the study and increase in the number
    of farms and FVCs in Phase II, the rate of contamination approximately increased
    to 20 %. One of the contributing factors for this phenomenon can be attributed
    to the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions, which led to a return to normalcy
    in 2021. As individuals resumed their pre-pandemic activities and interactions,
    there is a possibility of reduced adherence to essential preventive measures such
    as social distancing, mask-wearing, and handwashing which played a crucial role
    in effectively reducing the transmission of not only COVID-19 but also other infectious
    diseases, including enteric viruses during the pandemic. This potential decline
    in compliance likely created favorable conditions for enteric viruses to circulate
    more freely in the community, resulting in an increased risk of transmission which
    obviously could observe in phase II of this study. The results of our study showed
    variation in the viral loads detected among the different foodborne viruses quantified
    in the leafy green and water samples. Although RV was detected at the highest
    concentrations ranging from 1.64 × 101 to 4.03 × 103 GC/g in vegetable samples
    and 9.82 × 102 to 4.08 × 103 GC/L in water samples, Norovirus GII had the highest
    mean concentration of 6.663 × 102 ± 9.258 × 102 GC/g. When compared to other studies
    conducted in Mexico and Egypt, the viral loads observed in our study were generally
    close. A study in Mexico reported mean NoV loads of 2.1 × 102 to 1.3 × 103 RNA
    copies/g, which are similar to concentrations detected in some of our samples.
    However, they found higher concentrations of RV in their positive samples, while
    our study had a higher frequency of positive samples for RV (Felix-Valenzuela
    et al., 2012). Similarly, a study in Egypt found NoV loads ranging from 102 to
    104 GC/g, which are within the ranges we observed (Shaheen et al., 2022). The
    viral loads detected in our study indicate possible contamination risks if products
    are mishandled, though our results were generally comparable to other regional
    studies for NoV and RV. Further research is needed to better understand influencing
    factors. Interestingly, the overall rate of contamination in the farms and FVCs
    was similar in both phases of the study (about 18 %). This evident indicates a
    continuity between the farms and FVCs. Also, most of the viruses which were observed
    in the farms and the FVCs were observed at similar rates, however, the contamination
    rate of irrigation water was not as high as the produce. This could be due to
    a reduced number of water samples taken, as there was difficulty in getting permission
    to sample water from farm owners. As shown in Fig. 4, most of the contamination
    occurs in limited farms and FVCs. 11 farms and 28 FVCs, most of them have one
    contaminated sample and a much smaller number of them had 2 or 3 contaminated
    samples. This result suggests that most of the contamination was not limited to
    a specific farm or FVCs and this contamination could not be the result of a recurring
    source. It is possible that this kind of contamination was related to food handlers,
    although more extensive study is needed for such a conclusion. Undoubtedly, this
    study faced several limitations that warrant consideration in future research.
    The relatively limited sample size, especially in case of irrigation water, may
    have implications for the generalizability of the findings to a broader population.
    To enhance the study''s reliability, future investigation should employ larger
    sample sizes from diverse geographic regions in Iran. Additionally, the qPCR method
    utilized lacked the ability to differentiate between infectious and non-infectious
    viruses, potentially leading to overestimation of contamination risk. Employing
    advanced detection methods with greater sensitivity and specificity would improve
    accuracy in identifying viral pathogens. Another potential limitation of the work
    presented here involves a comparatively limited number of samples of water taken,
    which was not sufficient enough to infer seasonality in contamination, and this
    should be the focus of future work. Moreover, the regional focus solely on Tehran
    limited the study''s scope. Expanding research to include other regions with varying
    agricultural practices and environmental conditions can provide a more comprehensive
    understanding of viral contamination trends. To address these limitations, several
    areas of further study are essential. Conducting longitudinal studies over an
    extended period would offer valuable insights into seasonal variation and trends
    in viral contamination, enabling more accurate risk assessment. Implementing a
    comprehensive viral surveillance program covering various stages of the food supply
    chain, from farm to consumer, is crucial for a holistic understanding of potential
    contamination sources. Exploring the role of food handlers in transmitting viral
    pathogens to fresh produce is vital, considering its potential impact on contamination
    rates. Furthermore, conducting comparative studies across different regions and
    countries with diverse agricultural practices and public health measures would
    shed light on factors contributing to variation in viral contamination rates.
    Detailed evaluation of different water sources used for irrigation, including
    their quality and potential viral contamination, can provide essential data to
    enhance preventive measures. 5. Conclusions In conclusion, this study sheds light
    on the presence of human enteric viruses in irrigation water and fresh produce
    samples collected from farms and food distribution centers in Tehran, Iran. The
    findings emphasize the significance of enhancing viral surveillance programs to
    mitigate the risk of cross-contamination between water sources and fresh produce
    in Iran. Further elucidation of the sources of viral contamination in the future
    could better inform control measures to reduce foodborne transmission. Additionally,
    further study is needed to monitor this pathway step by step to inform solutions
    for minimizing the contamination of produce in Iran. CRediT authorship contribution

  key_findings: Rotavirus was most frequently detected, followed by NoV GII, NoV GI,
    AstV, and AdV. HAV and HEV were not detected in any of the tested samples.
  limitations: null
  main_objective: This study investigates the presence of norovirus, adenovirus, hepatitis
    A virus, hepatitis E virus, rotaviruses, and astroviruses in vegetable samples
    from the fields and fruit and vegetable centers of Tehran City and to investigate
    their presence in irrigation water by RT-qPCR.
  relevance_evaluation: "The paper examines the prevalence of several viruses in vegetables,\
    \ farms, and markets in the Tehran area of Iran. The specific point I am making\
    \ in my literature review is that fresh produce can be contaminated with viruses\
    \ at nearly any point from farm to fork, underscoring the need for improved safety\
    \ practices throughout the food production and handling system. This study provides\
    \ evidence for this point by showing that a significant percentage of vegetable\
    \ samples tested positive for at least one virus, including those destined for\
    \ human consumption. The results highlight the need for improved food safety practices\
    \ to reduce the risk of foodborne illness from vegetables. \n\nIn terms of relevance,\
    \ I would rate this paper as highly relevant (0.8-0.89) to the point I am making.\
    \ The study provides direct evidence of virus contamination of vegetables, and\
    \ although it focuses on a specific region, the findings are likely generalizable\
    \ to other areas where similar agricultural practices are used."

  description: 'Accurately identifying bovine respiratory disease is challenging in
    feedlots, and previous studies suggest behavioral monitoring is important. The
    study objective was to describe individual differences in physical activity (distance
    traveled), feeding/watering patterns (proximity to feed and water), and social
    behavior (average cattle within 3 m) when associated with health status in commercially
    raised beef cattle during the first 28 days on feed. Data from a previous Australian
    feedlot study monitoring cattle behavior and associated health outcomes were analyzed.
    Health status categories were generated for all cattle, and each animal was categorized
    as known healthy (HLTH), known diseased (SICK), or intermediate/uncertain (INTR).
    The INTR animals were excluded from the final analysis. Key findings included:
    differentiation in activity between SICK (n = 138) and HLTH (n = 1508) cattle
    dependent on time of day, SICK cattle spending more time in water and feeding
    zones early in the feeding phase (<6 days on feed), SICK cattle spending more
    time in the water and feeding zone during the overnight hours, and SICK cattle
    spending more time in groups early in the feeding phase but more time in isolation
    after the first week on feed. Results illustrate behavioral data were associated
    with important health outcomes.'
  doi: 10.3390/ani13233692
  explanation: The study aimed to identify the changes in physical activity, feeding/watering
    patterns, and social interactions among beef cattle based on their health status
    during the initial 28 days in a feedlot. The study's primary focus was on innovative
    approaches for assessing the health of animals in real-time.
  extract_1: Sick cattle were less physically active, spent more time by themselves,
    had differing attendance at the feed bunk across days on feed, and spent more
    time near water and the feed bunk at certain times of the day.
  extract_2: Sick cattle were also more social early in the feeding period but less
    social as time progressed.

    Summary Accurately identifying bovine respiratory disease is challenging in feedlots,
    and several studies have highlighted the importance of monitoring behavior to
    determine cattle health status. The objective of this study was to describe individual
    differences in physical activity, feeding/watering patterns, and social behavior
    when associated with health status in commercially raised beef cattle during the
    first 28 days on feed. Data from a previous study monitoring cattle behavior and
    associated health outcomes at two Australian feedlots were used to determine potential
    associations of interest. These data illustrated an association between several
    key behavioral parameters (physical activity, proximity to feed and water, and
    social behavior) and health status categories (healthy vs. sick), and many of
    these effects were modified by the time of day or days spent at the feedlot. Sick
    cattle were less active, spent more time by themselves, had differing attendance
    at the feed bunk across days on feed, and spent more time near water and the feed
    bunk at certain times of the day. Sick cattle were also more social early in the
    feeding period but less social as time progressed. These behavioral observations
    may provide information to help inform the process of diagnosing cattle with bovine
    respiratory disease. Abstract Accurately identifying bovine respiratory disease
    is challenging in feedlots, and previous studies suggest behavioral monitoring
    is important. The study objective was to describe individual differences in physical
    activity (distance traveled), feeding/watering patterns (proximity to feed and
    water), and social behavior (average cattle within 3 m) when associated with health
    status in commercially raised beef cattle during the first 28 days on feed. Data
    from a previous Australian feedlot study monitoring cattle behavior and associated
    health outcomes were analyzed. Health status categories were generated for all
    cattle, and each animal was categorized as known healthy (HLTH), known diseased
    (SICK), or intermediate/uncertain (INTR). The INTR animals were excluded from
    the final analysis. Key findings included: differentiation in activity between
    SICK (n = 138) and HLTH (n = 1508) cattle dependent on time of day, SICK cattle
    spending more time in water and feeding zones early in the feeding phase (<6 days
    on feed), SICK cattle spending more time in the water and feeding zone during
    the overnight hours, and SICK cattle spending more time in groups early in the
    feeding phase but more time in isolation after the first week on feed. Results
    illustrate behavioral data were associated with important health outcomes. Keywords:

    a major challenge in the beef industry, and BRD identification is commonly based
    on subjective assessments with relatively poor accuracy [1,2]. Misclassification
    of diseased cattle is relatively common using current BRD diagnosis techniques
    [3]. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of identifying diseased cattle
    based on signs of clinical illness for BRD have previously been reported to be
    as low as 61.8% and 62.8%, respectively [2]. In simple terms, ~38% of diseased
    calves in a population may go undiagnosed, and ~37% of calves diagnosed with BRD
    may be misdiagnosed when they are actually not diseased [2]. Multiple studies
    have evaluated methods to diagnose BRD more accurately in commercial settings,
    including blood parameters, temperature monitoring devices, and thoracic ultrasound
    [3,4,5,6,7]. Many of these diagnostic systems are designed primarily to confirm
    diagnosis after an animal is preliminarily identified with BRD (e.g., thoracic
    auscultation, thoracic ultrasound, etc.). These systems could help improve the
    specificity of the BRD diagnosis in the population preliminarily identified as
    potentially ill. Other diagnostic systems focus on remotely monitoring cattle
    in real time to identify sick cattle in a normal housing environment (e.g., ruminoreticulum
    boluses, behavioral monitoring, etc.), and these systems may have the potential
    to identify new cases not observed as ill. In a review of several available monitoring
    systems, the authors noted that one of the more promising directions for improving
    BRD diagnosis is the utilization of remote monitoring of behavioral changes [3].
    Whereas the use of remote monitoring technologies in beef cattle is still a relatively
    new field of interest, there has been a significant amount of research done in
    dairy cattle. Although the day-to-day routines and life of dairy and beef cattle
    differ greatly, there are common behavioral measures that may be useful in the
    diagnosis of disease in both types of animals. Physical activity (distance traveled
    or steps taken/lying time), feeding and watering behaviors, and social behaviors
    have all been suggested as potential indicators of cattle health status in both
    dairy and beef cattle [8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18]. Furthermore, these behavioral
    variables have been directly linked to predicting BRD [8,9,11,19,20,21]. Previous
    evaluations of behavioral monitoring have illustrated the ability to find BRD
    cases prior to visual observation with greater accuracy, which may influence treatment
    success [22,23,24,25]. Behavior varies among individual animals, and understanding
    the drivers of differences between cattle may help delineate signs of illness.
    A more refined understanding of behavioral changes may also allow remote monitoring
    systems to be more focused on the accurate detection of BRD. Therefore, the objective
    of this study was to describe individual differences in physical activity (distance
    traveled), feeding/watering patterns (proximity to feed and water), and social
    behavior (average cattle within 3 m) when associated with health status in commercially
    raised beef cattle during the first 28 days on feed (DOF). All of these behaviors
    were expected to change based on an animal’s health status. 2. Materials and Methods
    2.1. Trial Overview The current trial used observational data collected from a
    clinical trial conducted at two feedlot locations in Australia designed to compare
    potential differences between BRD identification methods (the Remote Early Disease
    Identification [REDI] system and conventional visual observation; manuscript under
    preparation). The REDI system is a system used to continuously monitor behavior
    and potentially identify disease [23]. This system utilizes cattle behavior data
    to inform a proprietary algorithm that identifies cattle that are suspected to
    have BRD [23]. The clinical trial consisted of feeding beef steers in 12 pens
    for each method of BRD identification (six pens per method at each location).
    Each study site procured its own cattle, and typical Australian buying practices
    were used to procure cattle from sale yards for site 1 and direct vendor procurement
    for site 2. Breeds at site 1 were Angus, Angus cross, Bos indicus cross, British
    Cross, European, Hereford, Murray Grey, and Shorthorn. Breeds at site 2 were Angus
    cross, Hereford cross, and Shorthorn Cross. A total of 3114 cattle were observed
    using the REDI system (site 1 n = 1800 animals, site 2 n = 1314 animals). There
    were six pens at each site, with 300 animals in each pen at site 1 and 216 to
    223 animals in each pen at site 2. Each pen had 50 m of bunk length and 58 m of
    depth (22.7 cm per animal of bunk space, or 12.3 m2/animal), with a 3% slope.
    All pens had a single strip of shade cloth (11 m wide) in the middle of the pen.
    Pen waterers were shared along the fence line with adjoining pens and cleaned
    weekly. Cattle were fed up to two times per day, with the first feeding occurring
    between approximately 7 and 11 am. Cattle in the REDI pens that were identified
    by the system as positive for BRD using the same criteria as previous work were
    treated [23]. These criteria include monitoring behavioral changes from baselines
    for individual animals. After a targeted 60 DOF, all cattle were monitored using
    visual observation for the remainder of the feeding period. Trained operational
    personnel at each location evaluated cattle daily for visual signs of BRD, including
    increased respiration, anorexia, and depression. Following visual identification
    in the pen, cattle were transported to a hydraulic chute for further examination
    and were treated if BRD was confirmed. Cattle were slaughtered at approximately
    114 DOF for site 1 and 187 DOF for site 2. 2.2. Individual Animal Behavioral Data
    Cattle were monitored with REDI to determine behavioral patterns. The system consisted
    of a REDI tag placed in the ear of each animal that communicated with readers
    surrounding the perimeter of the pen. The hardware was a commercially produced
    system (Smartbow, Vienna, Austria). Communication between tags and readers allowed
    the location engine software to calculate the location of each animal within the
    pen (accurate to within 0.5 m) at approximately 4 s intervals. Location data were
    transferred to the readers that moved data to an on-site server, which calculated
    activity, proximity, and social indices using previously described methods [22,23].
    The cloud server then utilized the REDI disease classification engine [22,23]
    to generate reports containing the BRD status of each individual steer. The reports
    were then relayed to a digital platform for personnel to determine which steers
    needed to be pulled by pen riders for daily treatments. The current trial focused
    on the raw data collected by the REDI system to describe cattle behavior during
    the first 28 DOF. Key behavioral components were selected to describe cattle behavior
    in three areas: activity (distance traveled), proximity to areas of interest (percent
    time in feeding and water zones), and social index (average cattle within 3 m).
    These three areas of behavior provide an overview of individual animal movement
    within the pen, time spent near eating and drinking facilities, and time spent
    around other cattle within the pen. The feeding and water zones were identified
    when an animal was within 1 m of the designated feeding or watering area. These
    values indicate proximity but not necessarily that the animal was actually eating
    or drinking. The decision to analyze data from the first 28 DOF was based on the
    experience of the authors as it pertains to cattle behavior at the feedlot. There
    is little to no data in the literature that definitively describes the time period
    during which cattle behavior is most dynamic at the feedlot, and there is no scientific
    consensus on the time period during which cattle are most at risk for developing
    BRD. However, the authors have anecdotally observed through previous research
    and unpublished foundational work developing the REDI system that cattle behavior
    appears to be the most dynamic during the first 28 DOF due to a wide variety of
    factors that have yet to be fully elucidated. Therefore, only behavioral data
    collected during this time period was analyzed for the purposes of this manuscript.
    Data cleaning consisted of removing unrealistic values that may have occurred
    due to tag losses or hardware issues. Only values considered unrealistic were
    removed from each behavioral outcome. Unrealistic values may have resulted from
    inaccurate data reported from the tag, and cutoffs for levels of unrealistic data
    were determined by the authors. For distance traveled, values ranged from 0 to
    750 m, with 12,946 hourly observations (0.35%) that were greater than 750 m out
    of 3,651,122 hourly observations removed. The percentage time in the feeding and
    water zones ranged from 0 to 100%, and 28 hourly observations (<0.01%) for each
    variable outside of these ranges were removed. The average number of cattle within
    3 m ranged from 0 to 15, with 180 hourly observations (<0.01%) outside this range
    removed. 2.3. Pulmonary Data at Harvest Data were limited to include only cattle
    that died of BRD or received a lung or pleurisy score at harvest. Overall lung
    scores consisted of monitoring pulmonary consolidation and pleurisy scores. Scoring
    was performed by the same three people who were trained prior to initial scoring.
    Pulmonary consolidation was recorded based on a scale of 0 to 100%, similar to
    previous work [26]. Consolidation scores were categorized into three categories:
    0 to 1%, 2 to 9%, and 10 to 55%. Pleurisy scores ranged from 0 to 3. A score of
    0 was no pleurisy, a score of 1 was pleuritic fibrinous attachments between lung
    lobes or on the lung surface with no adhesion on the pleura of the thorax, a score
    of 2 was pleuritic lesions with localized adhesion to the thoracic wall, and a
    score of 3 was severe pleuritic adhesions with the chest requiring “stripping”
    or additional removal, as adhesions between the lungs and plural cavity were extreme.
    In cases where the lungs were adhered to the thoracic wall, a pleurisy score of
    3 was given, but a consolidation score was not recorded (reported as NS). Animals
    that died or were rejected from the trial did not have a lung score recorded.
    Animals that were condemned also did not have a lung score recorded. If an animal’s
    lungs were stuck to the thoracic wall, a consolidation score was not recorded,
    but a pleurisy score was reported. An overall pulmonary disease score was created
    based on the combination of consolidation and pleurisy scores. 2.4. Production
    Data Not all animals in the dataset had an individual live weight prior to slaughter;
    however, a hot carcass weight was available. The average dressing percentage on
    available data of live weight and hot carcass weight was calculated to be 58%
    (based on AUS-MEAT hot standard carcass weight trim). This percentage was used
    to calculate an estimated final live weight for all cattle that were shipped for
    slaughter (even if live weight was available, to maintain consistency). The estimated
    final live weight, initial body weight, and DOF were used to calculate an average
    daily gain (ADG), or how much weight cattle gained per day, over the entire period.
    Animals that died were not included in ADG calculations. 2.5. Health Status Categorization
    Health status categories were generated for all cattle, and each animal was placed
    into one of three categories: known healthy (HLTH), known diseased (SICK), or
    intermediate/uncertain (INTR). Cattle were classified based on their known individual
    overall health outcomes to provide a case definition for comparison of behavioral
    characteristics. Cattle were placed in the HLTH category if they had no lung or
    pleurisy score greater than 1, had never been treated for BRD, did not die, and
    were not rejected for any reason during the trial. Cattle were placed in the SICK
    category if they were classified as having a lung or pleurisy score of 3 (which
    was collected at slaughter), died due to BRD, or were rejected from the trial
    due to BRD. All other cattle were placed in the INTR category. Identification
    of BRD by the REDI system was not an inclusion criterion for any of the three
    health status categories. Although REDI was used to identify cattle for initial
    BRD treatment, follow-up evaluation by trained animal health personnel was required
    to confirm a BRD relapse. The decision to treat an animal multiple times was ultimately
    based on clinical diagnosis. This also applied to the decision to reject an animal
    for BRD, which was made based on an evaluation by trained animal health personnel.
    Animals could also never be treated for BRD but still qualify for the SICK category
    based on post-mortem examination and having a lung or pleurisy score of 3. 2.6.
    Statistical Analysis Data handling and statistical analysis were performed using
    R in RStudio. Descriptive analyses were performed on the final individual animal
    behavioral dataset. Individual animal behavioral data was aggregated to individual
    animals over the period and by hour throughout each day. For the hourly analysis,
    data were evaluated using all the hours for each animal during the period, comparing
    variability over time. For the individual animal analysis, data were aggregated
    to the animal level over the entire trial period. A data subset was created containing
    only cattle in the HLTH and SICK categories, as these case definitions clearly
    delineated health status. In this subset, initial body weight was limited to 300
    to 500 kg and categorized by 50 kg groups to avoid linearity assumptions with
    behavioral outcomes. Animals in the INTR category were not included, as many of
    them had conflicting indications of disease (e.g., pulmonary lesions present but
    never identified with disease or no pulmonary lesions but identified and treated
    for disease). Analyzing only the HLTH and SICK categories allowed for inferences
    of behavior with known health outcomes. Multivariable statistical models (RStudio:lmer)
    were created to evaluate relationships between key behavioral variables and potential
    covariates of interest, including the fixed effects of health status (HLTH/SICK),
    DOF, hour of the day, initial body weight category, and potential interactions
    between health status and DOF, and health status and hour of the day. Each statistical
    model accounted for a lack of independence among observations with random effects
    due to study site, cohort, and repeated measures on individual animals. Independent
    statistical models were created for the first 28 DOF to determine potential associations
    between covariates and each behavioral variable. Only variables with a significant
    (p < 0.05) association with the key behavioral outcomes of interest were reported.
    Comparisons were made among health status groups within DOF or record hours using
    the Tukey adjustment for multiple comparisons (p < 0.05). 3. Results 3.1. Health
    Status Categorization Data were limited to the 3,114 animals monitored with the
    REDI system for behavioral analysis and comparison. These behavioral data contained
    3,651,122 observations (hourly summaries). There was an average of 48.9 days of
    behavioral monitoring per animal. A combination of lung scores, treatment history,
    and health outcomes were used to categorize animals based on health status. Animals
    in the SICK category (n = 138 animals) were rejected due to BRD (n = 10 animals),
    died due to BRD (n = 8 animals), were treated twice for and subsequently rejected
    due to BRD (n = 14 animals), had a lung score of 3 (n = 3 animals), or had a pleurisy
    score of 3 (n = 103 animals). Animals in the HLTH category (n = 1508 animals)
    received no treatment for BRD and did not have a pleurisy or lung score greater
    than 1. Animals in the INTR category (n = 1468 animals) encompassed the remainder
    of the dataset. The distribution of health status categories by study site and
    pen is displayed in Table 1. Table 1. Distribution of cattle in each health category
    by study site and pen. Animals designated to the SICK category had lower weight
    at REDI tag removal, final estimated live weight, and hot carcass weight compared
    to animals in the HLTH category (Table 2). These lower weights translated to decreased
    ADG from arrival to both the time of REDI tag removal and shipment for slaughter
    in the SICK animals compared to the HLTH animals. Table 2. Comparison of common
    performance characteristics among cattle in each health category using multivariable
    models. Superscripts within a row indicate statistical differences at p < 0.05.
    Each model contained relevant covariates of interest and effects to account for
    the lack of independence among data points. ADG = average daily gain, REDI = remote
    early disease identification. 3.2. Distance Traveled and Health Status The effect
    of health status on distance traveled was modified by DOF and hour of the day
    (p < 0.01) but not the initial body weight category (p = 0.56) (Figure 1). Data
    included all SICK and HLTH animals as identified in each health status category
    regardless of when or if the animal had been identified as diseased. The SICK
    animals displayed greater distance traveled relative to HTLH animals over the
    first 2 DOF, then lower distances traveled on days 3, 4, and 5 (Figure 1A). An
    interaction between record hour and health status category was observed (p < 0.01),
    with healthy animals traveling higher distances at hours 9, 14, 15, 22, and 23
    (Figure 1B). Figure 1. Least squares mean distance traveled from the generalized
    model with fixed effects for the interaction between health status and days on
    feed (A) and health status and hour of the day (B). The model included effects
    to control for clustering due to repeated measures on individual animals within
    the pen and study site. Each * signifies a significant difference (p < 0.05) within
    the day or record hour between health status categories. 3.3. Time near Water
    and Feed Associated with Health Status The effect of health status on time spent
    in the water zone was modified by DOF and hour of the day (p < 0.01) but not the
    initial body weight category (p = 0.15) (Figure 2). The average percent of time
    spent in the water zone illustrated several differences among animals classified
    as HLTH compared to those classified as SICK. Early in the feeding phase (2 to
    5 DOF), animals in the SICK category spent a greater percentage of time at the
    water compared to those in the HLTH category (Figure 2A). Figure 2. Least squares
    mean time spent in the water zone from the generalized model with fixed effects
    for the interaction between health status and DOF (A) and health status and hour
    of the day (B). The model included effects to control for clustering due to repeated
    measures on individual animals within the pen and study site. Each * signifies
    a significant (p < 0.05) difference within the day or record hour between health
    status categories. The average time spent in the water zone showed differences
    in watering behavior between the SICK and HLTH categories based on time of day
    (Figure 2B). Animals in the HLTH category spent more time at the water compared
    to SICK animals during mid-morning to late afternoon (10 am to 8 pm). However,
    during night-time hours, SICK animals spent more time at the water. The effect
    of health status on time spent in the feed zone was also modified by DOF and hour
    of the day (p < 0.01) but not the initial body weight category (p = 0.61) (Figure
    3). Similar to water behavior, animals designated as SICK spent more time in attendance
    at the feed bunk early in the feeding period (DOF 1, 2, and 4) and less time later
    in the feeding period (DOF 18, 22, 23, 25) (Figure 3A). Figure 3. Least squares
    mean time spent in the feed zone from the generalized model with fixed effects
    for the interaction between health status and DOF (A) and health status and hour
    of the day (B). The model included effects to control for clustering due to repeated
    measures on individual animals within the pen and study site. Each * signifies
    a significant (p < 0.05) difference within the day or record hour between health
    status categories. Feeding behavior differed by SICK and HLTH animals based on
    the hour of the day monitored (Figure 3B). During the lower activity evening and
    early morning hours (hours 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 04, 05), SICK animals spent more
    time in the feeding zone (p < 0.05), with fewer differences noted during the primarily
    daytime hours (7 am to 5 pm). 3.4. Social Indices and Health Status The average
    number of animals within 3 m is an indication of socialization, and the effect
    of health status on animals within 3 m was modified by DOF and hour of the day
    (p < 0.01) but not the initial body weight category (p = 0.12) (Figure 4). The
    average number of cattle within 3 m illustrated a distinct relationship with health
    status (Figure 4A). Until 6 DOF, the SICK animals had higher numbers of other
    cattle within 3 m (more social), but this changed from day 8 through day 28 when
    the HLTH animals had a higher number of cattle within 3 m (Figure 4A). Figure
    4. Least squares mean average number of cattle within 3 m from the generalized
    model with fixed effects for the interaction between health status and DOF (A)
    and health status and hour of the day (B). The model included effects to control
    for clustering due to repeated measures on individual animals within the pen and
    study site. Each * signifies a significant (p < 0.05) difference within the day
    or record hour between health status categories. Time of day had some effect on
    the differences in social behavior based on health status, with no differences
    noted during mid-day (p ≥ 0.05) and some differences noted in the overnight hours
    (p < 0.05). Animals in the SICK group spent more time with less cattle within
    3 m during the overnight hours (midnight to 7 am). 4. Discussion The objective
    of this study was to describe individual differences in physical activity, feeding/watering
    patterns, and social behavior when associated with health status in commercially
    raised beef cattle during the first 28 DOF. Health status was shown to have a
    significant impact on distance traveled (physical activity), time near water and
    feed, and social behavior. Moreover, many of these effects were modified by time
    of day and DOF, highlighted by novel observations in cattle deemed to be clinically
    sick with BRD. Physical activity and feedlot performance are associated with cattle
    health status categories in the current study. Unsurprisingly, animals designated
    to the SICK category had poor performance compared to those in the HLTH category.
    These findings align with previous research [27,28,29] and indicate that the HLTH
    and SICK categories are correctly delineating degrees of illness. However, these
    findings do not tell the entire story, as the activity of SICK animals differed
    by time of day and DOF. It is unclear why SICK animals traveled a greater distance
    than HTLH animals over the first 2 DOF and whether this observation is truly a
    function of the health status category, but previous work has illustrated lower
    activity in calves with BRD. Many of the behavioral changes identified in other
    research occurred prior to the time of visual diagnosis [8,19]. Similar to DOF,
    the time of day also appeared to modify cattle behavior. One observation to note
    is cattle appear to have high-activity time periods (between approximately 7 to
    9 am and 9 pm to midnight). During these time periods, few differences were identified
    in the morning hours typically associated with feeding time. This may be due to
    social pressures being highest during these time periods when even SICK cattle
    will move with the group. During low-activity times (mid-day), some separation
    (hours 9, 13, 14) in activity levels between the HLTH and SICK animals was observed.
    One conclusion may be that the best time to try to observe potential differences
    in health status is likely a time when baseline activity levels are lower and
    social pressures are not elevated. Interestingly, the HLTH animals appeared to
    be more active closer to midnight than the SICK animals. It is unclear what drove
    this difference, although reasonable speculation might suggest sick animals tend
    to rest more during less social time periods of the day. Time near water may provide
    valuable behavioral information for diagnosing BRD, but time of day and DOF must
    be considered when interpreting these observations. It is noteworthy that SICK
    animals spent a greater percentage of time at water compared to those in the HLTH
    category. This could be due to several potential factors, including acclimatization
    to the new environment and the cattle entering the facility at some level of dehydration,
    which may have increased water consumption. Previous research illustrates that
    shrink, or weight loss during transit (often associated with changes in hydration
    status), is associated with increased BRD risk [30]. One caveat to consider is
    the REDI system only measured water attendance, not consumption; however, previous
    research has illustrated that, when monitored by a real-time location system compared
    to video observation, the probability of cattle drinking when in attendance is
    42–54% [31]. There was also a distinct difference between SICK and HLTH animals
    regarding the hours of the day during which they spent time in the water zone,
    with HLTH animals spending more time near water during the day-time hours and
    SICK animals spending more time during night-time hours. One theory based on past
    observations is that watering behavior during the day may be a more social event,
    whereas in evening hours it is based on individual animal preferences. This finding
    indicates a simple threshold based on time near the location of water may not
    elucidate the differences in health status based on these behavioral patterns.
    Time near feed may also provide valuable behavioral information for diagnosing
    BRD depending on the time of day and days after arrival. Similar to water behavior,
    though, time of day and DOF must also be considered when interpreting these observations.
    Cattle designated as SICK spent more time in attendance at the feed bunk early
    in the feeding period. The feeding area may be an area for socialization and maintaining
    herd cohesion, which may be driving the difference in behavior. However, cattle
    may be trying to participate in herd activities and hide potential illness early
    in the disease process, leading them to spend more time at the feed bunk. Again,
    the time of day also appeared to modify feeding behavior. Observation of anorexia
    or non-aggressive feeding behavior is often considered a hallmark for visual BRD
    diagnosis and has been investigated in dairy cattle as a potential variable of
    interest in predicting health status [18,21,32]. However, these results indicate
    that the timing of observations to identify potentially ill animals may be very
    important. During the highest feeding time activity hours (06, 07), no differences
    were noted based on health status, and few differences were identified during
    the day. Social parameters provided an interesting insight into cattle behavior
    and how they might be used for diagnosing BRD, with differentiation between SICK
    and HLTH animals observed early in the feeding phase. Individual animal isolation
    or separation from the group is often considered a sign of BRD for visual observation
    [16], but in this study, SICK animals spent more time with other HLTH animals
    early in the feeding phase. One behavioral hypothesis is that, due to predator
    and prey relationships, diseased cattle are reluctant to separate from the herd,
    making them harder to identify [33]. These data may indicate that SICK cattle
    were ill early in the feeding phase and did not separate from the herd until after
    the disease had significantly progressed. Among the behavioral attributes monitored,
    socialization illustrated several significant differences based on health status.
    Time of day also appeared to have an effect on the differences in social behavior
    based on health status. Cattle in the SICK group spent less time with fewer cattle
    during the night-time and early morning, which would have been challenging to
    observe during this period without remote monitoring. This is especially noteworthy
    as isolation is commonly considered a hallmark of BRD. Limitations of this work
    include the observational nature of the study, with behavioral changes evaluated
    relative to DOF after arrival. The included study data focused only on known outcomes
    (HLTH, SICK), which allowed for comparison between these two groups but does not
    account for cattle in the INTR group. Thus, the results should not be used as
    definitive predictors of or diagnostic criteria for BRD since there undoubtedly
    were cattle in the INTR group that were sick with BRD. The analysis did not evaluate
    time relative to BRD identification, meaning inferences could only be made about
    the HLTH and SICK cattle based on DOF. Since it is not known when cattle actually
    developed BRD, it is also unclear to what extent cattle behavior was influenced
    by the disease process and how it progressed. The external validity of the results
    is limited to the first 28 DOF at the feedlot. While not a major limitation, it
    is important to recognize that the data reported here cannot be generalized to
    cattle behavior at later stages of the feeding cycle. Due to the retrospective
    nature of the data, the authors were unable to draw any conclusions regarding
    the causation of observations and could only comment on identified correlations,
    which require further experimental investigation. 5. Conclusions Several key behavioral
    parameters (physical activity, proximity to feed and water, and social behavior)
    were associated with health status categories in commercially raised beef cattle
    during the first 28 DOF at the feedlot. Time of the day and DOF modified some
    of these effects to varying degrees. These findings confirm behavioral dogma in
    identifying BRD in feedlot cattle, including observations that sick cattle are
    less physically active and spend an increased amount of time in solitude. However,
    there were additional findings that may help to provide greater context on animal
    behavior as it pertains to health status. The physical activity of sick cattle
    differed by time of day. There were unique times of the day during which sick
    cattle spent more time at the feed bunk. Watering behavior also differed early
    in the feeding phase for sick cattle. A differentiation in social behavior was
    observed early in the feeding phase, with sick cattle behaving more socially (more
    cattle within 3 m) until 6 DOF, after which they became less social. The behavioral
    observations reported here may provide additional information that can be used
    to help inform the process of diagnosing cattle with BRD, as well as improve the
    accuracy of precision monitoring systems in identifying BRD in feedlot cattle.

    Chapter © 2020 1 Introduction The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) involves
    a network in which computing devices, Items, Automated systems, animals, and humans
    are linked together. Each element is equipped with unique identifiers and has
    the capacity to effortlessly exchange information across a system, eliminating
    the necessity for direct interaction between humans or human-computer engagement
    [1]. Agricultural IoT is a network that connects various physical elements including
    animals, plants, the environment, production equipment, and virtual objects in
    agriculture. It enables communication over the internet using agricultural information
    sensing devices and specific protocols. By enabling effective identification,
    location, tracking, and monitoring, its aim is to ensure intelligent management
    of agricultural elements and processes. The interconnection of \"man-machine-object\"
    in agricultural IoT enhances the management of agricultural elements, processes,
    systems, and the understanding of essential aspects of the lives of animals and
    plants. Moreover, it facilitates the management of agricultural emergencies and
    complex agricultural systems [2]. In the agriculture sector, IoT applications
    play a pivotal role, as depicted in Fig. 1. These applications encompass soil
    monitoring to enhance crop growth, efficient irrigation, and fertilizer management.
    Nutrient optimization is crucial to reduce the environmental impact by addressing
    the soil and plant nutrient requirements. Crop monitoring, facilitated by sensors
    and IoT, supports informed decision-making regarding pest control, irrigation,
    and harvesting. Agricultural product storage techniques aid in preserving crops
    and preventing losses. Smart irrigation improves the accuracy of crop watering,
    reduces water wastage, and promotes sustainability. Precision agriculture employs
    drones and sensors for field mapping and precise input application. Finally, IoT
    automates livestock management, including feeding and health data collection.
    Collectively, these IoT applications enhance agricultural efficiency, sustainability,
    profitability, and global food security [3]. Fig. 1. Applications for employing
    IoT technology in the farming domain. Full size image The utilization of agricultural
    data hosted in the cloud as digital evidence is set to streamline administrative
    processes in agriculture in the future. Smart tractors leverage GPS for precise
    steering and optimal route planning, reducing soil erosion and saving fuel. Farmers
    now have the ability to gain in-depth insights into their fields through the use
    of agricultural drones equipped with advanced sensors and cutting-edge imagery.
    These sensors also monitor livestock health and provide alerts aimed at enhancing
    dairy production, as depicted in Fig. 2 [4]. Fig. 2. The Future of Intelligent
    Farming Full size image The integration of the Internet of Things and Artificial
    Intelligence (AIoT) in the field of aquaculture has led to the development of
    smart systems. These systems enhance responsiveness and early warnings by monitoring
    water quality and weather conditions. They have the capability to connect their
    equipment to smart electrical boxes for controlling water wheels, pumps, and other
    power equipment. Utilizing sensors and power data, an AIoT system promotes more
    precise and intelligent aquaculture. This integration results in reduced energy
    consumption, stabilized water quality, decreased labor dependency, and precise
    feeding, ultimately leading to improved aquaculture productivity. Furthermore,
    this approach reduces risks associated with disasters and damages, maximizing
    the benefits of aquaculture. In summary, the IoT and AI significantly contribute
    to the efficiency and sustainability of the aquaculture industry [5]. The core
    issue of this study revolves around exploring the opportunities presented by current
    technologies, specifically the (IoT) and (AI), to optimize the integration of
    existing data. This process aims to enhance water quality monitoring, improve
    fish health, ensure more effective environmental management, optimize agricultural
    operations, and streamline fish stock management while bolstering operational
    efficiency within the context of aquaculture establishments in Morocco. The ultimate
    objective of this endeavor is to stimulate an increase in high-quality fish production
    while ensuring the long-term sustainability of the aquaculture industry. This
    must be accomplished in the face of increasingly stringent environmental constraints
    and growing demand. In essence, the fundamental question we seek to answer is
    as follows: How can we optimize the incorporating of IoT and AI technologies with
    existing data to monitor, regulate, and enhance water quality in Moroccan aquaculture
    facilities, all the while increasing the production of quality fish and securing
    the industry''s viability amidst evolving environmental challenges and dynamic

  description: The poultry business in contemporary India is one of the most important
    and rapidly expanding sectors of the country's agricultural economy. Increases
    in chicken production can be attributed to better manufacturing methods and more
    efficient agricultural methods. The importance of automation in the current world
    cannot be overstated, and neither can the rapid development of the Internet of
    Things (IoT) idea with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Using a certain method, manual
    tasks may be made fully automatic. Poultry farms can benefit from IoT-based operations
    when remote monitoring and repair are required, transforming them from traditional
    to cutting-edge operations that make extensive use of automation. In order to
    maintain and enhance chicken health, it is necessary to constantly check for changes
    in a number of variables. In this study, we propose and construct a low-cost Internet
    of Things (IoT)-based system for monitoring environmental factors in a chicken
    farm in real time, including temperature, humidity, ammonia levels, and light
    i ntensity. Information gleaned via sensors and continuous monitoring. By putting
    the planned system into action, we were able to evaluate its viability. Temperature
    and humidity levels, as well as their management, are the most important climatic
    parameters for a poultry farm's output. The purpose of this project is to automate
    the operation of a chicken farm by utilising Internet of Things (IoT) technologies.
    Chicken health is maintained by careful monitoring of environmental conditions
    like temperature, humidity, light, and ammonia gas, as well as through the supervision
    of routine tasks like feeding, watering, and cleaning.

    to the fundamental principles of water irrigation and electric heating method,
    we introduced a novel approach that leveraged the cooling law of the point heat
    source in the monitoring tube to estimate the flow velocity along the irrigation
    pipe, to further detect cracks based on the variations in axial flow velocity.
    Numerical simulations were initially conducted to investigate the effects of factors

    scheme of the monitoring tube and irrigation pipe, and heating power on the cooling
    law of the heat source, to further determined an optimized monitoring scheme.
    A series of model tests was then conducted based on this optimized scheme. First,
    the relationship between cooling discrimination index and axial flow velocity
    was calibrated. Then, by adjusting the water pressure, the leakage rates under
    different crack widths could be obtained, allowing for the derivation of a fitting
    formula to estimate the crack width using the water pressure and leakage rate.
    Finally, in double crack specimen, the proposed multi-crack identification method,

    tracer methodCrack width 1. Introduction The development and utilization of underwater
    space have become increasingly important for convenient transportation, resource
    regulation, and energy development due to improved social production efficiency.
    Underwater structures such as sea-crossing bridges, water pipelines, dams, and
    offshore platforms are continuously constructed, and these underwater structures
    extensively use concrete due to the excellent compressive performance and cost-effectiveness
    of concrete [1]. However, wading-concrete structures face numerous challenges
    in their complex living environment, especially the occurrence of cracks. Underwater
    concrete is prone to cracking due to the corrosive nature of seawater, coupled
    with wave loads and temperature differentials inside and outside the structure
    [2]. These cracks not only accelerate the corrosion of underwater concrete and
    the reinforcement but also reduce the durability of the concrete, thereby compromising
    the integrity and load-bearing capacity of the overall structure [3], [4]. The
    timely detection and monitoring of cracks and their development status is crucial
    to preventing significant economic losses and safety hazards. Therefore, crack
    detection in underwater concrete is critical for maintaining the normal use of
    structures and ensuring their safety. Non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques
    have been widely used for the preventive maintenance of underwater structures.
    Traditional NDT methods primarily rely on visual inspection by human inspectors,
    who must dive underwater to visually examine the structure''s surfaces within
    close range. This method poses personnel safety risks and requires a high level
    of expertise, potentially leading to errors and missed defect detection [5]. In
    recent years, underwater robots have been developed and used for the crack detection
    of underwater concrete structures [6], [7], [8]. Inspectors can remotely operate
    these robots from shore, eliminating personnel safety risks while increasing the
    inspection scope in terms of time and spatial coverage. By combining digital image
    processing techniques, crack detection from images collected by underwater robots
    has become more efficient, intelligent, and robust compared to traditional methods.
    Notably, underwater robot positioning and maneuverability still pose challenges
    [9], [10], especially in complex terrains and environments. Moreover, factors
    such as water turbidity, aquatic flora and fauna, and cleanliness of the structure
    surfaces can affect the quality of the collected images. However, image processing
    of underwater cracks faces several challenges. Traditional digital image processing
    methods cannot accurately identify underwater cracks due to image distortion [11].
    Deep learning algorithms [12], [13] have shown more efficiency and robustness
    compared to traditional methods, but have limitations in terms of calibration
    and scene restrictions, limiting their widespread use in engineering applications.
    Other mainstream NDT methods for underwater structure analysis include ground-penetrating
    radar (GPR)[14], ultrasonic testing [15], and alternating current field measurement
    (ACFM)[16], [17]. However, these methods also have limitations. For example, the
    effectiveness of GPR will depend on the propagation medium of electromagnetic
    waves underwater and will be susceptible to environmental interference. Additionally,
    the attenuation and scattering effects of electromagnetic waves during propagation
    limit the depth range of GPR detection. Ultrasonic testing will be susceptible
    to noise interference underwater. When using ultrasonic imaging technology [18],
    [19] to detect defects in underwater structures, the sensors need to be in close
    contact with the concrete surface. However, detection efficiency remains relatively
    low, even in multi-channel imaging systems. As a recently developed NDT method,
    ACFM can detect defects by analyzing the influence of alternating current flow
    on the magnetic field distribution near the flaws. Furthermore, owing to its excellent
    noise resistance and sensitivity, this method can be used to detect welds in underwater
    structures. However, ACFM technology relies on the electrical conductivity of
    the material under test, and its direct application on concrete surfaces remains
    a challenge due to the low conductivity of concrete. Embedded sensors [20] have
    been widely utilized in the field of structural health monitoring (SHM), enabling
    the long-term and real-time monitoring of the internal structure condition, differentiating
    them from NDT methods that focus on surface and near-surface inspections. Among
    these sensors, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors [21], [22] have been extensively
    used due to their high sensitivity, real-time capabilities, and long-term stability,
    and monitoring approaches based on lead zirconate titanate piezoelectric (PZT)
    sensors have been increasingly assessed for underwater concrete structures [23],
    [24]. As such, by leveraging the piezoelectric effect of the materials, the qualitative
    identification of cracks can be achieved by analyzing the differential electrical
    signals generated at crack locations [25]. However, these embedded sensors have
    limited measurement coverage and cannot be easily repaired or replaced, making
    large-scale deployment challenging in engineering projects. A new approach for
    crack monitoring has been proposed by taking advantage of the unique environment
    of underwater concrete structures. This method involves embedding monitoring components
    that induce changes in thermodynamic parameters or heat transfer boundary conditions
    around the crack locations and utilizes heat transfer principles for crack identification.
    Chen et al. proposed a temperature tracing method based on thermal conduction
    theory, and this specific approach involved embedding a series of monitoring tubes
    with porous casings near the concrete surface [26]. Cracking of the concrete led
    to an increase in the water content within the porous casings, resulting in an
    increase in the thermal conductivity of the medium surrounding the cracks. The
    crack location could then be identified based on the difference in cooling rates
    of the heat source before and after cracking. However, this method exhibited lower
    sensitivity, with the accuracy of crack localization depending on the spacing
    of the casings, and the crack width could not be determined. Zhu et al. addressed
    these limitations by using hollow casings instead of porous casings, which increased
    the difference in cooling rates before and after cracking, thus, enhancing sensitivity
    [27]. Zhang et al. further conducted test studies on crack width monitoring using
    hollow casings and showed that this method could only identify the crack width
    in a flowing water environment, and the monitoring sensitivity depended on the
    distance between the measurement points and the crack. However, the method performed
    poorly when the crack width was less than 1.0 mm [28]. To address these issues,
    Chen et al. proposed a water irrigation and electric heating method, where the
    irrigation pipe was placed adjacent to the monitoring tube [29]. By actively creating
    a post-crack seepage environment using water pressure, the heat transfer boundary
    conditions were altered. Crack localization was then determined according to the
    distribution characteristics of the cooling discriminant index, and crack width
    could be determined based on the relationship between leakage rate and crack width.
    Compared to the casing method, this method improved the range of crack identification
    and localization accuracy. However, this method showed difficulty identifying
    the width of each crack when multiple cracks were present along a monitoring line
    when based solely on the total leakage rate. Therefore, based on the correlation
    between the flow velocity along the irrigation pipe and the cooling law of the
    heat source in the monitoring tube, in this study, we proposed a multi-crack identification
    method. This method not only allowed for systematic and efficient crack localization
    and width identification but also enhanced the measurement accuracy of the monitoring
    system, filling the gap in temperature tracing for the measurement of multi-crack
    widths. To achieve this, the monitoring scheme of water irrigation and electric
    heating method was optimized, by building upon a systematic study of the influencing
    factors on the cooling law of the heat source in the monitoring tube. A series
    of model tests was then conducted using the optimized monitoring scheme, which
    verified the effectiveness of this method for identifying multiple cracks. 2.
    Monitoring system and process 2.1. Monitoring system and principle The monitoring
    system used for water irrigation and electric heating consisted of a heating system,
    a temperature-measurement system, and an irrigation system, as shown in Fig. 1.
    The heating system was comprised of ceramic heating tubes within the sensing-heating
    elements, a heating series circuit, and a regulated power supply. The temperature-measurement
    system consisted of FBG sensors, a sensing series circuit, and an FBG demodulator.
    The irrigation system was composed of an irrigation pipe connected to a water
    tank, which provided constant water pressure, and the constant-pressure tank could
    be replaced by an automatic water supply, boosting the device in actual projects.
    For new construction projects, the monitoring tube and the irrigation pipe were
    embedded in the interior of the structure during the concrete pouring stage. For
    existing structures, they could be embedded by slotting on the concrete surface
    or fixed on the surface of the structure with plain concrete covering. The irrigation
    pipe was composed of a brittle material, such as ceramic or corundum, to ensure
    that it ruptured when the concrete cracked, while the monitoring tube required
    high tensile strength to prevent damage after concrete cracking. The monitoring
    tube was pre-filled with water, and the integrated sensing-heating circuit could
    be dragged to move the sensing-heating element to the designated position for
    measurement. In addition, the sensing heating element could be removed for maintenance
    or replacement, in the event of a malfunction. Download : Download high-res image

    underwater concrete structures [29]. When the sensing-heating element was located
    at P3, as shown in Fig. 1, heat transfer from the heat source to the surrounding
    medium occurred through thermal conduction, as the water within the irrigation
    pipe remained stationary below the crack. The conduction heat transfer could be
    described by the following differential equations: (1) where T is the temperature;
    t is the time; k denotes the thermal conductivity of the medium in different directions;
    ρ is the density of the medium; c is the specific heat of the medium; and Sh is
    the heating power per unit volume of the heat source. According to Equation (1),
    the cooling rate of the heat source at P3 primarily depended on the temperature
    gradient and thermal conductivity of the surrounding medium. When the sensing-heating
    element was located at P1 in Fig. 1, the heat from the heat source could be transferred
    through both conduction and convection, and the differential equation for convective
    heat transfer within the fluid could be expressed by (2) where ρw is the density
    of water, cw is the specific heat of water, v is the velocity of water, and Φ
    is the viscous dissipation function, related to the viscosity coefficient of water.
    According to Equation (2), the cooling rate at P1 was not only related to the
    temperature gradient and thermal conductivity of the surrounding medium but was
    also dependent on the flow velocity of water inside the irrigation pipe. Under
    other constant conditions, a higher flow velocity resulted in a faster cooling
    rate from the heat source. When the sensing-heating element was located at P2,
    as shown in Fig. 1, the rupture of the irrigation pipe caused water to flow along
    the surface of the monitoring tube, increasing the range of convective heat transfer.
    At this point, the heat transfer from the heat source was influenced by the convective
    heat transfer effect in both the v0 and vc flow directions. Therefore, the cooling
    rate at P2 was faster compared to P1. Based on the temperature tracing principle
    mentioned above, the heat transfer modes of underwater concrete would differ between
    locations close to and far away from the cracks, resulting in cooling rate variations
    of the heat source. Therefore, crack localization and width identification could
    be achieved by analyzing the cooling law of the heat source at the measurement
    points. Chen et al. assessed the cooling law of the heat source and defined a
    discriminant index, denoted as ξv, to reflect its cooling rate, as represented
    by Equation (3)[30]. Linear fitting was performed on the period, which showed
    good linearity of the time history curve of lg(T-Tθ), and the absolute value of
    the slope ξv of the fitted line increased with the acceleration of the cooling
    rate of the heat source, serving as a cooling discriminant index: (3) where T
    is the temperature of the measuring point, T0 is the initial temperature for cooling,
    and Tθ is the ambient temperature. 2.2. Identification process for multiple cracks
    When multiple cracks occurred along a monitoring line, as shown in Fig. 2, P1,
    P2, and P3 were considered the measurement points located further away from the
    cracks. The cooling rate of the heat source at these points was not influenced
    by the flow velocity inside the cracks but primarily depended on the flow velocity
    along the irrigation pipe. A higher axial flow velocity resulted in a faster cooling
    rate of the heat source, and as a result, a larger absolute value of the discriminant
    index ξv. Therefore, based on the calibration relationship between ξv and the
    axial flow velocity, the flow velocities v1, v2, and v3 at the corresponding positions
    of P1, P2, and P3 could be determined. The velocities followed the order v1 >
    v2 > v3. Based on this characteristic, we preliminarily inferred that cracks existed
    between P1 and P2, as well as between P2 and P3. Subsequently, the sensing-heating
    integrated circuit was dragged to change the positions of the measurement points,
    and mobile distributed measurements were conducted in the areas where cracks were
    likely to occur. By analyzing the distribution characteristics of ξv at the measurement
    points, the precise location of the cracks could be determined. Download : Download

    multiple cracks along a monitoring line. After inversely estimating the axial
    flow velocities at measurement points P1 and P2, based on the calibration relationship,
    the seepage rates qw1 and qw2 at cracks #1 and #2 could be determined according
    to the principle of mass conservation, respectively, as shown in the following
    equation: (4) where Af is the cross-sectional area of the irrigation pipe. According
    to Equation (4), a linear correlation was observed between the seepage rate and
    axial flow velocity. Therefore, the axial flow velocity could be indirectly calibrated
    through the calibration relationship between ξv and the seepage rate (ξv-qw).
    When the water pressure was constant, the seepage rate would increase with the
    widening of the cracks. Similarly, when the crack width was the same, the seepage
    rate increased with increasing water pressure. Mutual influence was observed among
    the seepage rate, crack width, and water pressure. Consequently, when the seepage
    rate and water pressure were constant, the crack width could be inversely estimated
    based on the calibration relationship between the seepage rate, crack width, and
    water pressure (qw-w-pg). A flowchart for multi-crack identification is illustrated
    in Fig. 3. First, cracks were preliminarily identified through the variation of
    water level within the irrigation pipe. Following cracking, the irrigation pipe
    underwent a transition from an initially dry state to a water-filled state due
    to seepage through the cracks. Subsequently, the sensing-heating element was moved
    to different measuring points along the monitoring circuit for measurements, enabling
    crack localization based on the distribution characteristics of ξv at measuring
    points. Finally, utilizing two pre-calibrated relationships, namely ξv-qw and
    qw-w-pg, facilitated the inversion of multi-crack widths. Download : Download

    factors on the cooling law of the point heat source in the monitoring tube, and
    to optimize the monitoring scheme, a finite element numerical analysis was conducted
    for the fluid–solid coupled heat transfer in the region far from the cracks, and
    the ANSYS Fluent platform was used to solve the heat transfer calculation model.
    The simplified diagram of heat transfer in the region far from the cracks is shown
    in Fig. 4. The water inside the irrigation pipe was assumed to as constant-viscosity
    and an incompressible fluid. When heat transfer was involved, in addition to solving
    the mass and momentum conservation equations, an additional energy conservation
    equation had to be solved. The governing equations for the computational model
    shown in Fig. 4 could be expressed by Equation (5): (5) Download : Download high-res

    heat capacity at constant pressure. 3.1. Numerical model The numerical model for
    heat transfer in the region far from the cracks was established based on Fig.
    4, with the cross-section of the concrete structure consisting of a square with
    a side length of 150 mm, and the longitudinal length of the model was 300 mm.
    An outer fluid layer was created around the concrete structure to simulate the
    external water environment, with a sensing-heating element located in the middle
    of the monitoring tube, and the distance from the center of the sensor to the
    surface of the concrete was 40 mm. The numerical model for the region far from
    the cracks, as well as the corresponding dimensions, are shown in Fig. 5. Download

    Numerical model for the region far from the cracks and corresponding dimensions.
    The model was divided into different regions, including the addition of a boundary
    layer for the fluid domain inside the irrigation pipe. A polyhedral meshing technique
    was used with a maximum mesh size of 5 mm. After diagnosing the mesh quality,
    finite element analysis calculations were conducted using Fluent software. The
    following assumptions were made. First, the water inside the irrigation pipe was
    incompressible and exhibited steady flow. Second, the thermodynamic parameters
    of the materials and the viscosity of the water did not vary with temperature,
    pressure, and time. The initial conditions were set as follows. (1) The wall surfaces
    were treated as adiabatic boundary conditions; (2) the inlet consisted of a velocity
    inlet, while the outlet was a pressure outlet with the gauge pressure set to 0;
    and (3) the ambient temperature Tθ was set to 300 K. The thermodynamic parameters
    of various materials in the model are shown in Table 1. Due to the significant
    influence of thermal conductivity on heat transfer efficiency, the selection of
    simulation materials for the monitoring tube and the irrigation pipe primarily
    considered the magnitude of the thermal conductivity. The values of relevant parameters
    were referred from literature [27] and the standard material library built into
    Fluent. Table 1. Thermodynamic parameters of the materials corresponding to the
    elements. Material Density (kg⋅m−3) Specific heat (J⋅kg−1⋅°C−1) Thermal conductivity

    on the monitoring performance, five different cases were designed by modifying
    the material, cross-sectional shape, and wall thickness of the monitoring tube
    and irrigation pipe, as shown in Table 2. The material parameters for the monitoring
    tube and irrigation pipe corresponding to each case are listed in Table 1. Table

    were the same for each case, according to the following steps. (1) During the
    heating stage, constant power was applied to the ceramic heating tube, which was
    then stopped after 180 s. (2) Transitioning to the cooling stage, the temperature
    at t = 180 s was taken as the initial temperature for the cooling stage at the
    monitoring point, and the calculation concluded at t = 1000 s. (3) By altering
    the inlet velocity, the above calculation steps were repeated to obtain the temperature–time
    data during the cooling stage for each case at different flow velocities. The
    following settings were applied for the model calculations, according to the above
    computational steps. (1) The pressure solver was selected with a transient time
    type, without considering gravity effects. (2) The energy equation was enabled,
    employing the Realizable k-ε turbulence model. (3) The material properties were
    assigned to each element, and the ceramic heating tube element was designated
    as a heat source with a time-varying power function (P = 1 × 107 W⋅m−3 for 0 ≤
    t ≤ 180 s, and P = 0 for t > 180 s). (4) The center point of the ceramic heating
    tube element was designated as the monitoring point, and the temperature–time
    data at this point was recorded. (5) The Simplic algorithm was employed, and the
    calculations were executed after initialization. The time step size was set to
    1 s, with a total of 1000 time steps. 3.2. Factors affecting the cooling law of
    the heat source 3.2.1. Size effect The boundary conditions of the model were assumed
    as adiabatic walls. In practice, consideration of the heat transfer range of the
    heat source will be necessary to ensure the rationality of the model size. As
    a result, the cross-sectional dimensions of the numerical model were modified
    to investigate the size effect by comparing the simulation results. The distance
    between the center of the heat source and the near surface of the concrete was
    maintained at 40 mm, while the side length of the cross-section of the concrete
    was increased to 300 mm. Fig. 6 presents the schematic diagram of the size variation
    for Case 5. Download : Download high-res image (84KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Schematic diagram of the size variations in Case 5. The models with
    two different cross-section sizes in Case 5 were successively simulated, and the
    temperature contours of the profile at the monitoring point under different flow
    rates were obtained at a cooling time of 800 s. Fig. 7(a) presents the temperature
    contours of the model with a size of 150 mm, when the water in the irrigation
    pipe was stationary, and Fig. 7(b) and (c) show the temperature contours when
    the water in the irrigation pipe was flowing. We observed that during the cooling
    stage, heat gradually diffused from the heat source to the surrounding medium,
    and the flow of water in the irrigation pipe significantly accelerated the cooling
    rate of the heat source. Moreover, the faster the flow rate in the irrigation
    pipe, the faster the cooling rate of the heat source. After 800 s of cooling,
    the internal temperature of the model approached the ambient temperature of 300
    K, and heat transfer remained within the computational domain. Download : Download

    to the calculation steps, the time history curves of lg(T-Tθ) during the cooling
    stage were obtained at the monitoring point for the enlarged size model (300 mm)
    and the original size model (150 mm). A comparison of the simulation results is
    presented in Fig. 8. The simulation results of the two models were highly consistent,
    and the calculated discriminant indices were identical. Therefore, we determined
    that assuming an adiabatic boundary condition for the wall surface was appropriate
    when the cross-sectional size of the model was taken as 150 mm. Download : Download

    the cooling stage. 3.2.2. Flow velocity along the irrigation pipe Six different
    flow velocities were simulated for each case to investigate the effect of flow
    velocity along the irrigation pipe on the cooling law of the point heat source
    far from the cracks, corresponding to flow rates of 0, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1000
    mL·min−1. By following the calculation steps, the time-course data of temperature
    T at the monitoring point under different cases could be obtained, and the time
    history curves of lg(T-Tθ) during the cooling stage were determined for each case.
    The simulation results for Case 5 are shown in Fig. 8(a). We observed that a higher
    flow velocity inside the irrigation pipe led to a faster cooling rate at the monitoring
    point, with 0 mL·min−1 corresponding to the stagnant state of the water inside
    the irrigation pipe and serving as a reference for determining the magnitude of
    flow velocity. During the 200 to 500 s cooling interval, linear fitting was applied
    to the time history curve of lg(T-Tθ), as shown in Fig. 9. The results indicated
    that the R-squared values of the fitted lines for the 200 to 500 s cooling interval
    were above 0.99, suggesting that the slope of the fitted line in this interval
    could be used as the discriminant index ξv to characterize the magnitude of flow
    velocity inside the irrigation pipe. Download : Download high-res image (167KB)

    scheme of irrigation pipe and monitoring tube The irrigation pipe and monitoring
    tube combination schemes are presented in Table 2. In Case 1, which corresponded
    to the original setup in [29], both the irrigation pipe and monitoring tube were
    cylindrical and had linear contact, and the sensitivity of the monitoring system
    was relatively low. Therefore, in subsequent cases, both the irrigation pipe and
    monitoring tube were changed to square tubes to increase the contact area and
    enhance the convective heat transfer effect. Additionally, Case 2 differed from
    Case 3 in terms of the irrigation pipe material, Case 3 differed from Case 4 in
    the wall thickness of the irrigation pipe, and Case 3 differed from Case 5 in
    the monitoring tube material. Simulations were conducted for these five cases,
    and the temperature–time data at the monitoring point were obtained under different
    flow rates. Finally, the time history curves of lg(T-Tθ) were obtained, as shown
    in Fig. 10. Download : Download high-res image (444KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 10. Time history curves of lg(T-Tθ) during the cooling stage for the
    cases under different flow rates. When the water inside the irrigation pipe was
    stagnant, as shown in Fig. 10(a), the cooling trend at the monitoring point was
    slow, indicating that heat conduction was the dominant heat transfer mechanism.
    When the water inside the irrigation pipe started to flow, as shown in Fig. 10(b)
    and (c), the cooling trend at the monitoring point accelerated with increasing
    flow rate. In Case 1, the contact area between the monitoring tube and irrigation
    pipe was small, resulting in the weakest convective heat transfer effect and the
    slowest cooling rate compared to the other cases. In Cases 2 and 3, the irrigation
    pipes were composed of ceramic and corundum, respectively. Corundum had a higher
    thermal conductivity compared to ceramic, where the higher the thermal conductivity,
    the stronger the heat conduction effect, resulting in a faster cooling rate in
    Case 3 compared to Case 2. In Case 4, the irrigation pipe wall thickness was reduced
    by 1 mm compared to Case 3. The thermal conductivity of water was lower than solid
    materials. Although the convective heat transfer area increased in Case 4, the
    flow velocity was lower under the same flow rate. Therefore, the cooling trend
    in Case 4 was basically consistent with Case 3. In Cases 3 and 5, the monitoring
    tubes were composed of carbon fiber and stainless steel, respectively. The thermal
    conductivity of the stainless steel was significantly higher than carbon fiber.
    When the water inside the irrigation pipe was stagnant, the cooling curve of Case
    5 exhibited the fastest initial descent rate. When the water inside the irrigation
    pipe was flowing, Case 5 presented the most significant cooling trend change.
    3.2.4. Heating power To investigate the effect of heating power on the cooling
    law of the heat source, three input powers were set, namely, 0.5 × 107, 1 × 107,
    and 2 × 107 W⋅m−3. The temperature contours of the profile at the monitoring point
    for Case 5 were obtained after heating for 180 s, as shown in Fig. 11. With a
    fixed heating time, the higher heating power resulted in a higher initial temperature
    during the cooling stage, and the maximum initial temperatures for the three power
    levels were 313.2 K, 326.3 K, and 352.7 K. Download : Download high-res image

    during the cooling stage under the three different powers and various flow rates
    are shown in Fig. 12. When the flow rates were identical, the cooling curves obtained
    under different powers were essentially parallel to each other, and the calculated
    discriminant index ξv values were the same. This indicated that when using ξv
    as a discriminant index for the flow velocity inside the irrigation pipe, the
    influence of heating power could be eliminated. Download : Download high-res image

    of the monitoring scheme As presented in Section 3.2, five different cases were
    established by varying the monitoring tube and irrigation pipe combination. The
    effects of factors such as the flow velocity along the irrigation pipe, contact
    area between the monitoring tube and the irrigation pipe, and thermal conductivity
    of the medium on the cooling law of the heat source were assessed. The influence
    of size effect and heating power was also considered. We observed that as the
    flow velocity inside the irrigation pipe changed, the magnitude of variation in
    ξv increased, indicating higher sensitivity and better performance of the monitoring
    system. The variation pattern of ξv with the flow velocity along the irrigation
    pipe was simulated for all five cases, as shown in Fig. 13. We observed that among
    the five cases, Case 5 showed the most significant variations in discriminant
    index ξv with respect to the flow velocity. Therefore, the scheme corresponding
    to Case 5, which comprised the monitoring tube and irrigation pipe, was chosen
    as the optimized scheme for further numerical simulations and model tests. Download

    location identification 3.4.1. Numerical model To investigate the thermal effects
    near the cracks, numerical models with different crack widths were established
    according to the optimized scheme, as shown in Fig. 14. The longitudinal length
    of the numerical model was 400 mm, and the crack was positioned at the center
    height of the model, with parameter w representing the crack width, and three
    cases were considered: w = 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mm. In the monitoring pipe, the sensing-heating
    element was moved along the vertical direction with the crack center serving as
    the origin, resulting in different monitoring points. The distance between the
    monitoring point and the crack center was denoted as y. Download : Download high-res

    a crack based on the optimization scheme. 3.4.2. Simulation results Different
    cooling patterns at different measurement points were simulated for models with
    three different crack widths under various flow rates, and the distribution of
    ξv along the monitoring line was obtained through fitting, as shown in Fig. 15.
    We observed that the simulated results for the three crack widths were consistent
    under the same flow rate. As the monitoring point grew closer to the crack center,
    the absolute value of ξv increased, and the absolute value of ξv increased with
    increasing crack flow rate. Therefore, crack localization could be achieved by
    analyzing the distribution characteristics of ξv along the monitoring line, and
    the crack localization accuracy could be improved by increasing the crack flow
    rate. When the monitoring point was located 80 mm below the crack, where no water
    flow occurred, the cooling rate of the heat source decreased. In this case, the
    magnitude of ξv was no longer affected by seepage and could be used as a reference
    value. When the monitoring point was 50 mm above the crack, the value of ξv became
    stable, indicating that the cooling pattern was not influenced by crack flow and
    was only related to the flow velocity inside the irrigation pipe. Therefore, ξv
    at locations away from the crack (y + ≧ 50 mm) could be used for calibrating and
    inverting the axial flow velocity. Furthermore, compared to the numerical model
    without cracks, the presence of the crack in the numerical model resulted in external
    water flow. However, the ξv values for both models at the same axial flow velocity
    were essentially identical, indicating that the flow state of the external water
    had minimal effect on the cooling rate of the heat source. Download : Download

    were conducted using the optimized scheme, according to the numerical simulation
    results. The dimensions of the reinforced concrete beam are shown in Fig. 16.
    The monitoring tube and irrigation pipe were composed of stainless steel and corundum,
    respectively, and both consisted of square tubes with an outer side length of
    18 mm. To facilitate a connection between the irrigation pipe and the circular
    delivery pipe, a heat-shrinkable tube was used to connect the irrigation pipe
    and circular PE-RT pipe near the top surface of the concrete. The connection section
    was embedded inside the concrete to ensure a leak-free joint, as verified in practice.
    The bottoms of the monitoring tube and the irrigation pipe were sealed with hot-melt
    adhesive. Download : Download high-res image (133KB) Download : Download full-size

    shown in Fig. 17. The specimen was placed horizontally in a prefabricated stainless
    steel water tank, and two circular holes on the side of the water tank were used
    to install the drainage pipes. The lower drainage pipe was equipped with a valve,
    which remained closed during the test and was only opened to drain the water when
    removing the specimen after testing. The upper drainage pipe was used to discharge
    the leaking water, and the leakage flow rate was measured using a graduated cylinder.
    The valve and the pressure gauge were installed between the delivery pipe and
    the irrigation pipe, and the sensing-heating element was placed inside the monitoring
    tube. Next, a three-point bending test was conducted on the specimen using a reaction
    frame and hydraulic jack to induce cracking at specific locations. Water was then
    added to the water tank, and the water supply was stopped when the upper drainage
    pipe started leaking. At this point, the valve on the delivery pipe was opened
    to inject water into the irrigation pipe, and the crack leakage water flowed out
    from the upper drainage pipe. Once the pressure gauge readings and leakage flow
    rate stabilized, testing commenced. Download : Download high-res image (240KB)

    was as follows. (1) The fiber optic connectors and circuit connectors of the integrated
    circuit were connected to the demodulator and the regulated power supply, with
    a sampling frequency of 1 Hz and a voltage of 12 V. (2) The demodulator was started
    and testing began when the displayed wavelength value stabilized on the computer.
    Testing was conducted for at least 1 min under ambient temperature, and the average
    wavelength value within that minute was used as the corresponding wavelength λθ
    for the ambient temperature. (3) The regulated power supply used for heating was
    started, then turned off after 3 min, to initiate the natural cooling process.
    (4) The drainage volume was measured using a graduated cylinder, and the wavelength
    data was monitored. The test was stopped once the temperature stabilized during
    the cooling process. (5) The valve on the delivery pipe was adjusted to change
    the leakage rate, and the integrated circuit was moved to change the measurement
    point. The testing procedure was repeated as outlined above, and with each test
    iteration, the leakage rate or measurement point was changed. 4.3. Test results
    The FBG sensor in the sensing-heating element was specifically packaged to avoid
    strain interference, allowing it to be solely sensitive to temperature. The temperature
    change T caused a corresponding change in the reflected wavelength λ of the FBG,
    with the following relationship: (6) where KT is the temperature sensitivity coefficient
    of the FBG sensor. Due to the linear correlation between the wavelength measured
    under the same sensing point and the temperature, Equation (3) could be expressed
    as (7) where λθ and λ0 denote the wavelength corresponding to ambient temperature
    and the initial wavelength during the cooling stage (nm), respectively. 4.3.1.
    Calibration between ξv and axial flow rate The cracking location was located in
    the middle of the specimen, and the measurement point was moved to a position
    20 cm above the crack. Because the measurement was far away from the crack, the
    cooling behavior at this point was not influenced by the crack seepage, and depended
    only on the axial flow velocity. Testing was initiated once the water pressure
    and seepage rate stabilized, by adjusting the valve to change the flow velocity
    in the irrigation pipe. The time-domain data of the wavelength during the 200
    to 500 s cooling interval at the measurement point were obtained according to
    the test. The corresponding discrimination index ξv was obtained by fitting the
    wavelength data during this cooling interval, using Equation (7). A linear correlation
    could be established between the axial flow velocity and the flow rate, therefore,
    the axial flow velocity could be calibrated by calibrating the flow rate. The
    calibration relationship between ξv and the flow rate qw is shown in Fig. 18.

    Fig. 18. Calibration relationship between ξv and qw. We observed that the distribution
    pattern of ξv with respect to the flow rate was generally consistent with the
    numerical simulation results. However, the numerical values of ξv were overall
    lower, and this discrepancy could be attributed to the following reasons. (1)
    The material parameters used in the numerical simulation were based on the recommended
    values from standard databases, which potentially differed from the actual material
    properties. (2) The thermodynamic characteristics of the medium were influenced
    by temperature and pressure variations, but the numerical simulation was simplified,
    and the medium had constant properties. (3) The actual reinforced concrete beam
    was not a homogeneous medium, and the influence of reinforcement was not considered
    in the numerical simulation. 4.3.2. Calibration of qw -w-pg and mathematical model
    fitting To achieve the identification of multiple crack widths, we established
    a calibration relationship and mathematical model between the crack flow rate
    qw, crack width w, and water pressure pg for individual crack. The crack width
    was observed using a crack microscope, while continuously applying load to the
    specimen. A total of nine width values were recorded in the range of 0.28 to 1.23
    mm, and for each crack width, the valve was adjusted to vary the water pressure.
    After the pressure gauge and flow rate values stabilized, we recorded the flow
    rate corresponding to each water pressure at the given crack width. The calibration
    relationship and mathematical model between qw, w, and pg are shown in Fig. 19.
    According to the calibration results, we observed that the flow rate increased
    in a power-law manner with increasing crack width and water pressure. This pattern
    aligned with the trends observed in the experimental cases documented in reference
    [29]. Download : Download high-res image (209KB) Download : Download full-size

    crack monitoring To validate the effectiveness of this method in identifying multiple
    cracks, another specimen was fabricated, as shown in Fig. 16, which indicated
    that the concrete mix proportion and reinforcement were consistent with the calibration
    test. Two cracks were induced by loading the specimen at distances of 60 and 30
    cm from the bottom. After cracking, loading was applied to the middle of the specimen
    to simultaneously expand the widths of the two cracks, resulting in two different
    cases. From the top of the specimen downward, the crack widths for Case 1 were
    0.20 and 0.27 mm, while for Case 2, the crack widths were 0.25 and 0.33 mm. Measurement
    points were arranged at 10 cm intervals, 10 to 80 cm above the bottom of the specimen,
    and tests were conducted for both cases. During testing, the water pressure was
    maintained at 57.8 kPa for both cases. According to the test results, the corresponding
    ξv values were calculated for the measurement points in the two cases, as shown
    in Table 3, and the distribution of ξv along the height of the specimen is presented
    in Fig. 20. Table 3. Values of ξv (10−3) corresponding to the two cases at the
    measurement points. Case Height (cm) Empty Cell 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 1 −1.3978

    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 20. Distribution of ξv along the height
    of the specimen. As shown in Fig. 20, under identical water pressure, the flow
    rate increased with increasing crack width. Therefore, the ξv values for Case
    2 were generally higher than for Case 1. When the measurement points were located
    at heights of 80 and 50 cm, far from the cracks, the cooling rate of the heat
    source at these points was only related to the axial flow velocity, with a larger
    ξv value indicating a higher flow rate within the irrigation pipe. When the measurement
    points were located at the height of the cracks, the ξv values for both cases
    significantly increased due to the enhanced convective heat transfer effect. When
    the measurement points were located below a height of 20 cm, which was unaffected
    by the convective heat transfer effect, the ξv values for both cases were essentially
    identical. According to the above analysis, the distribution of ξv was consistent
    with the pattern observed in the numerical simulation, indicating that the proposed
    method could effectively achieve multi-crack localization. According to the calibration
    results in Section 4.3.1, the ξv values at heights of 80 and 50 cm on the specimen
    were inverted using the fitting equation in Fig. 18 to obtain the flow rates at
    these two locations. Then, the crack flow rates were calculated for each case,
    according to Equation (4). By applying the water pressure and seepage flow rates
    to the calibration equation in Fig. 19, the widths of the two cracks in Cases
    1 and 2 were subsequently inverted. From the top of the specimen downward, the
    inverted crack widths for Case 1 were 0.19 and 0.30 mm, and for Case 2 were 0.23
    and 0.35 mm. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the measured values and
    actual values for the four sets of data was 0.0212 mm, indicating that the measurement
    error was within an acceptable range for engineering applications. This demonstrated
    that the proposed method, based on the optimized scheme, could effectively achieve
    multi-crack localization and width identification. Potential sources for measurement
    errors included: (1) Inconsistent longitudinal gap between the monitoring tube
    and the irrigation pipe. A larger gap correspondingly weakened the convective
    heat transfer effect, resulting in underestimated crack width identification results.
    Therefore, the vertical alignment of the monitoring tube and the irrigation pipe
    was crucial and led to a consistent longitudinal gap between them. (2) Fluctuations
    in the heating power during the heating phase. The temperature rise of the heating
    tube was related to the heating power, and fluctuations in the heating power potentially
    influenced the monitoring results. Therefore, ensuring the stability of the power
    supply was crucial during testing. 5. Discussion In this paper, when the distance
    between two cracks is 30 cm, the monitoring results were satisfactory. When the
    distance between two cracks was relatively small, in one scenario where the spacing
    of measurement points was sufficiently dense, it was still possible to identify
    the positions and quantity of cracks based on the distribution characteristics
    of ξv. However, due to the mutual influence between the cracks, it became challenging
    to accurately identify the axial flow velocity between the two cracks, and consequently,
    the accurate determination of the widths of the two cracks was hindered. Another
    scenario was when the spacing between measurement points was large, resulting
    in the absence of measurement points between two cracks. In this case, the two
    cracks would be identified as a single crack, and the obtained crack width could
    only be used to assess the degree of cracking. During field testing, discrepancies
    might have existed between the irrigation water temperature (Tv) and the ambient
    temperature of underwater concrete (Tθ). Therefore, when the multi-crack identification
    method proposed in this paper was applied for field testing, the impact of temperature
    discrepancies on the cooling law of the heat source was taken into account. In
    cases where significant temperature discrepancies were observed, temperature compensation
    was recommended to be performed when monitoring underwater concrete cracks. Calibration
    tests were conducted at different irrigation water temperatures to establish the
    relationships between ξv, Tv, and Tθ. Subsequently, utilizing the re-calibrated
    discriminant relationships, the crack widths of underwater concrete could be inverted.
    6. Conclusion A new method for identifying multiple cracks in underwater concrete
    was proposed in this work, based on the thermodynamic phenomenon where the flow
    velocity along the irrigation pipe affected convective heat transfer and consequently
    influenced the cooling rate of the heat source in the monitoring tube. First,
    numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the effects of size, axial
    flow velocity in the irrigation pipe, monitoring tube and irrigation pipe combination,
    and heating power on the cooling behavior of the heat source. An optimized monitoring
    scheme was then determined among the five simulated calculation cases based on
    the findings. Calibration between the discrimination index ξv and the axial flow
    velocity, as well as calibration between the seepage rate, crack width, and water
    pressure, was subsequently performed using the optimized scheme. Finally, dual-crack
    detection was carried out according to the proposed multi-crack identification
    method and calibration relationships. Crack inversion was performed for four sets
    of data corresponding to the two cases of dual-crack widths. The following conclusions
    were drawn. (1) The absolute value of the cooling discrimination index ξv increased
    with increasing flow velocity along the irrigation pipe, however, the increasing
    trend gradually slowed down. (2) Increasing the contact area between the monitoring
    tube and the irrigation pipe, as well as their thermal conductivity, enhanced
    the sensitivity of ξv to the axial flow velocity. (3) Calibration results indicated
    that the flow rate increased in a power-law manner with increasing crack width
    and water pressure. (4) Both numerical simulations and model tests showed that
    ξv underwent a sudden change near the cracks, which could be used for crack localization.
    (5) The model test results of dual-crack detection demonstrated good agreement
    between the crack widths inferred by the proposed multi-crack identification method
    and actual crack widths, with an RMSE value of 0.0212 mm. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: 'Smart farming focuses on three crucial areas: soil quality, weather
    conditions, and crop health. Because of the significant impact of weather and
    irrigation factors, many smart farming solutions are tightly integrated with smart
    environment and smart water (pollution, turbidity, nutrients) systems for a holistic
    approach. The Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing soil monitoring, giving
    farmers and growers the means to optimize yields, minimize disease risks, and
    rationalize resource use. Thanks to IoT sensors, it is possible to measure various
    parameters such as soil temperature, NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) levels,
    and soil moisture. The information collected by these IoT sensors is then transmitted
    to a central point or stored in the cloud server for in-depth analysis, visual
    representation, and trend identification. The application of the IoT in agriculture
    is widely referred to as smart farming. The IoT is an essential pillar of precision
    agriculture, enabling more targeted and efficient management of resources. Smart
    sensor systems provide more information about water and crop water requirements.
    This information can be used to mechanically manage the water supply system and
    help farmers optimize their irrigation system. The information acquired by the
    first sensors is transferred to the cloud server. This article proposes and evaluates
    the concept of remote sensing systems. Three sites were selected to test the IoT
    system. At each site, five sensors were employed, specifically designed for soil
    and irrigation water analysis. The sensors dedicated to soil pH, moisture, and
    NPK demonstrated commendable accuracy; equally, the irrigation water pH and turbidity
    sensors exhibited notably precise measurements. The results were noteworthy, with
    an R2 value surpassing 90% across all sensor measurements. These IoT sensors could
    facilitate effective crop monitoring without excessive expenditures and serve
    to safeguard groundwater from nutrient contamination.'

    SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract EN ZH ES Smart farming focuses on three crucial
    areas: soil quality, weather conditions, and crop health. Because of the significant
    impact of weather and irrigation factors, many smart farming solutions are tightly
    integrated with smart environment and smart water (pollution, turbidity, nutrients)
    systems for a holistic approach. The Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing
    soil monitoring, giving farmers and growers the means to optimize yields, minimize
    disease risks, and rationalize resource use. Thanks to IoT sensors, it is possible
    to measure various parameters such as soil temperature, NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus,
    potassium) levels, and soil moisture. The information collected by these IoT sensors
    is then transmitted to a central point or stored in the cloud server for in-depth
    analysis, visual representation, and trend identification. The application of
    the IoT in agriculture is widely referred to as smart farming. The IoT is an essential
    pillar of precision agriculture, enabling more targeted and efficient management
    of resources. Smart sensor systems provide more information about water and crop
    water requirements. This information can be used to mechanically manage the water
    supply system and help farmers optimize their irrigation system. The information
    acquired by the first sensors is transferred to the cloud server. This article
    proposes and evaluates the concept of remote sensing systems. Three sites were
    selected to test the IoT system. At each site, five sensors were employed, specifically
    designed for soil and irrigation water analysis. The sensors dedicated to soil
    pH, moisture, and NPK demonstrated commendable accuracy; equally, the irrigation
    water pH and turbidity sensors exhibited notably precise measurements. The results
    were noteworthy, with an R2 value surpassing 90% across all sensor measurements.
    These IoT sensors could facilitate effective crop monitoring without excessive
    expenditures and serve to safeguard groundwater from nutrient contamination. 1
    INTRODUCTION Soil quality is often related to its use. Thus, the expected quality
    of soil for building is different from that for agricultural production, and the
    indicators to be measured are therefore different. For this reason, scientific
    groups and research institutes, as well as industry, are racing to offer more
    and more Internet of Things (IoT) products to the agricultural sector and are
    laying the groundwork for a clear role for the Internet to become a dominant technology
    (Yang et al., 2021). At the same time, the already popular Internet and big data
    provide sufficient resources and solutions to maintain, store, and analyze the
    huge amounts of data generated by Internet-connected devices. The management and
    analysis of data from the IoT can be used to automate processes, predict situations,
    and improve many activities, even in real time. Indeed, the IoT now enables farms
    to increase operational efficiency by automating and optimizing production lines.
    IoT also brings undeniable benefits for farm management (Subahi & Bouazza, 2020).
    Soil monitoring with IoT uses technology to empower farmers and growers to maximize
    yield, reduce disease, and optimize resources. IoT sensors can measure soil temperature,
    soil fertility status (NPK), volumetric water content, photosynthetic radiation,
    soil water potential, and soil oxygen levels. The data from the IoT sensors is
    then transmitted back to a central location (or the cloud server) for visualization
    and analysis. The resulting data can then be used to optimize farm operations,
    identify trends, and make subtle adjustments to conditions to maximize crop yield
    and quality (Bhatia & Sood, 2017). The use of IoT in agriculture is known as smart
    farming, and IoT is a central component of precision agriculture. This paper will
    focus on the impact that the IoT has had in this field. The supply of hardware
    for farmers is diversifying from drones flying over Zfield to analyze the conditions
    of the soil to robots dispersing pesticides in a targeted manner, tractors performing
    centimetric soil analysis, precision irrigation equipment, and collars studying
    the physical condition of livestock (Badhe et al., 2018). The operation of these
    tools is based on a digital analysis of data collected by various sensors (thermal,
    chemical, soil moisture, etc.). The robots then process these data, but they can
    also be used by other devices (Nandurkar et al., 2014). For example, a tractor
    will be able to analyze soil quality to accomplish its task, but the extracted
    data will also be used for a digital irrigation system. A technological ecosystem
    is superimposed on the life of the farm, made up of connected objects in “conversation”
    with each other, remaining in continuous communication with the system''s software
    or platform (Gutiérrez et al., 2013). 2 MATERIALS, TECHNIQUES, AND SYSTEM STRUCTURE
    2.1 System structure The system developed in this research was tested under various
    soil quality conditions (Figure 1) (Vidya Devi & Meena Kumari, 2013). It measured
    four parameters (pH, temperature, soil moisture, and the value of potassium, nitrogen,
    and phosphorus in the soil in three different agricultural sites). FIGURE 1 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Proposed system flow diagram (Beta et al., 2016).
    referred to as P1, P2, and P3, each located in different regions of Morocco. The
    objective was to closely observe and assess the soil quality and irrigation water
    quality at each of these sites, employing innovative methodologies. To verify
    the performance of the systems, conventional methods were used. For instance,
    atomic absorption was used to check the content of potassium elements, P-Olsen
    for phosphorus, and N-Dumas to determine nitrogen content, as outlined in Table
    1. In addition, the turbidity of the irrigation water was cross verified using
    a turbidimeter. This validation process guarantees the reliability and accuracy
    of the results. TABLE 1. Analysis of soil parameter using conventional methods.

    344.17 2.2 Microcontroller board Arduino UNO board is a microcontroller board
    worked around the ATmega328. The card contains everything that is essential for
    the microcontroller''s task (Figure 2). It is small, has a low power consumption,
    and is essential in any embedded electronics solution (car, garage door, robots,
    etc.). In addition, it is the simplest and most economical microcontroller and
    can be programmed with software available with the microcontroller (Zhang et al.,
    2017). To implement the microcontroller, we need to associate it with a PC via
    a USB connection; as for the energy sources, it can be powered with an external
    power supply or batteries (Hori et al., 2010). FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Arduino UNO cards. 2.3 Sensors Various types of sensors, including
    optical, thermal, magnetic, and others, are employed to assess the quality of
    soil and water. These sensors serve the purpose of gathering essential data about
    different aspects, such as composition, temperature, and magnetic properties,
    contributing not only to an enhanced understanding of soil and water resources
    but also fostering improved crop cultivation practices. 2.3.1 pH sensor The pH
    sensor determines the acidity or alkalinity of the soil and the irrigation water
    (Figure 3). Soil pH affects the amount of nutrients available to plants and soluble
    in soil water because some nutrients are available under acidic conditions, while
    others are more available under alkaline conditions. Incorrect irrigation water
    pH can significantly affect plant growth, soil pH, irrigation equipment, and pesticide
    efficiency and can contribute to the leaching of nutrients to the groundwater
    (Na et al., 2016). FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint pH sensor. The pH
    takes values between 0 and 14, and its measuring temperature is between 0 and
    60°C for pH of water and between 3 and 9 at −30–70°C for soil pH. The measurement
    has an accuracy of ±0.3 pH units and a resolution of 0.1 pH. As a rule, the correct
    balance of soil pH and irrigation water for good crops is between 5.5 and 7.5.
    Thus, checking pH levels regularly can avoid considerable problems that can be
    costly and difficult to correct (Mehta et al., 2018). The IoT pH sensor is equipped
    with a probe of 7 cm allowing for in situ measurements. To ensure accuracy, it
    is appropriate to select a suitable measurement site, devoid of stones, and confirm
    that the probe remains unexposed to hard objects. Before inserting the probe,
    the topsoil should be removed, and depending on the desired measurement depth,
    while maintaining the natural soil density beneath, the sensor is vertically inserted
    into soil ensuring no tilting or swaying from side to side. After a 10-s interval,
    the results will be available. It is advisable to take multiple measurements within
    a small area around a single measurement point and subsequently calculate the
    average. The sensor yields better result in moist soil conditions. 2.3.2 Soil
    moisture sensor The soil moisture sensor (SMS) is a type of sensor used to measure
    the volumetric water content in the soil, as well as to estimate the water stored
    in the soil horizon (Figure 4). The SMS is usually connected to the irrigation
    system for the estimation of the water content of the root zone before each irrigation
    to give the soil the adequate amount of water and interrupt irrigation if its
    water content exceeds the prescribed standards. This method is useful for scheduled
    irrigation systems (Kodali & Sahu, 2016). FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Soil moisture sensor (SMS). The use of SMS has a beneficial effect on water management
    and crops. It provides a better understanding of the behavior of water in the
    soil. It can maximize yields by limiting irrigation costs and avoiding water wastage
    while reducing the demand for irrigation water. And the obtained data can be used
    to improve hydrological models (Soil, Water and Plant Characteristics Important
    to Irrigation, 2017). The SMS calculates the average water content across the
    entire sensor length, with a 2-cm probe section as the influencing zone. The sensor
    must be inserted vertically, ensuring no lateral tilting. The probe is inserted
    in the soil after removing the topsoil, and adjusting the depth according to the
    desired measurement, while retaining the soil''s natural density underneath. 2.3.3
    Turbidity sensor A turbidity sensor (Figure 5) measures the amount of light scattered
    by suspended solids (SS) in the water. An increase in the amount of SS in the
    water leads to a rise in the level of turbidity, which has negative effects on
    underwater life in rivers, lakes, and seas. It interrupts the photosynthesis process
    and reduces dissolved oxygen. Soil erosion and rainwater runoff are the principal
    sources of water turbidity. High turbidity levels also affect irrigation performance,
    reducing soil hydraulic conductivity and polluting the soil surface through surface
    runoff. At the viral level, as known as various viruses and bacteria can be attached
    to solid wet particles and migrate with them. Thus, the elimination of SS is linked
    to the elimination of harmful germs. Water with minimum turbidity, lower than
    2 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) as a standard in different countries, is
    generally considered to be of good quality for irrigation purposes (Jeong et al.,
    2016). FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Turbidity sensor. 2.3.4 NPK soil
    sensor The NPK soil sensor detects the content of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium
    (N, P, K) in the soil (Figure 6). The NPK are the primary macronutrients indispensable
    for plant growth. A lack of plant development, late plant maturation, and lower
    yields explicitly describe symptoms of NPK plant deficiency. And the main symptom
    of excessive NPK in soil is stunted plant growth, making it unable to produce
    flowers or fruit. Aside from that, having very high NPK level in soil can run
    off to the waterways and harm aquatic life by accelerating the eutrophication
    and algae blooms (Benslimane et al., 2023). Therefore, the NPK need to be monitored
    in soil and used in a controlled way. The use of NPK soil sensor allows the determination
    of soil fertility and thus facilitates the systematic evaluation of the soil condition.
    The sensor is equipped with a high-quality probe of 7 cm that resists rust, electrolysis,
    and alkali-salt corrosion. It is suitable for all types of soil and substrate
    too. This sensor does not require any chemical reagents, enabling on-site measurements.
    It has a real-time response and good interchangeability and can be used with any
    microcontroller, but not directly because it uses a Modbus communication mode.
    The sensor works on 9–24 V batteries with a low power consumption (Ma et al.,
    2015). To ensure the sensor precision, it is suitable to choose an appropriate
    measurement location that is free of stones, confirming that the probe remains
    unexposed to hard objects. Prior to inserting the probe, it is recommended to
    clear away the topsoil. Adjust the depth of insertion according to the desired
    measurement depth. Vertically insert the sensor into the soil with utmost care
    to prevent any tilting or swaying. After a 10-s interval, the results will become
    accessible. It is advisable to conduct multiple measurements within a confined
    area around a single measurement point and subsequently compute the average. This
    NPK soil sensor has a good accuracy of about 2% with a measurement resolution
    of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium of 1 mg/kg (mg/L) in a detection range
    from 1 to 1999 mg/kg. FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint NKP soil sensor.
    2.4 Network tools To facilitate data transmission in the local environment, an
    integrated Wi-Fi module was used (Figure 7). This module acts as a conduit for
    the Arduino board to efficiently communicate its data to an access point. Using
    this Wi-Fi module, the Arduino board acquires the ability to share collected measurements
    with smart devices (Ibrahim et al., 2019). The access point itself establishes
    an Internet connection, enabling seamless data transfer. As a result, the access
    point captures data from the local environment and facilitates its transmission
    to a local computer and a remote database (Ojha et al., 2015). FIGURE 7 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Wi-fi module: ESP8682-01. 3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION To
    examine the soil and irrigation water quality, the proposed framework uses pH,
    soil moisture, turbidity, and NPK sensors to get information about soil and irrigation
    water pH, the soil moisture, turbidity of irrigation water, and the concentration
    of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the soil. These sensors are associated
    with the Arduino UNO board, which is associated with a Wi-Fi module that helps
    to send information to the cloud server, to process the information gathered by
    the different sensors (Kumar & Patel, 2014). This piece of information is stored
    in the Influx Cloud server, an open-source, high-availability distributed storage
    system. Most of the time, the information is refreshed in the Influx database
    (Kumari et al., 2018). After calibrating sensors by integrating factors within
    the Arduino code for each sensor, enabling their accurate calibration, and ensuring
    the precise performance of the sensors. Table 1 outlines the analysis of soil
    parameters, elucidating the conventional methods employed for assessing each parameter.
    The summary of obtained soil values is presented in Table 1. The data show there
    is a good match between IoT sensors and the conventional methods, except for the
    nitrogen estimation of the first site, which exceeded the detection range of the
    sensor, but the estimation is still close to the conventional method value, suggesting
    that the sensor works well. The irrigation water pH and turbidity values are given
    in Table 2; the data demonstrate the sensor''s high precision, and the values
    are almost under the standard of turbidity value of 2 NTU. The coefficients of
    determination for all measurements in relation to the conventional method are
    presented in Table 3, indicating an R2 value exceeding 90% for the majority of
    sensor measurements. This provides compelling evidence that these sensors can
    serve as viable alternative methods for measuring soil and water parameters in
    Moroccan soils. TABLE 2. The obtained irrigation water values. Site Measurements

    In order to monitor the soil's moisture level in real time, moisture sensors are
    placed in the field. These sensors wirelessly provide data to the NodeMCU, which
    processes and relays the information. The NodeMCU gathers the sensor data and

    this information, the system starts the water pump and opens the solenoid valves
    to begin the irrigation operation. The NodeMCU coordinates with these valve-opening
    devices via wireless communication. In addition, the system uses online weather
    prediction data to provide more precise watering schedule optimisation. The system
    dynamically modifies the irrigation schedule based on analysis of weather patterns,
    evapotranspiration rates, and crop water needs to save water during times of rain
    or high humidity. The solution makes use of cloud-based platforms to improve scalability
    and accessibility. The gathered sensor data and command instructions are safely
    transferred to the cloud server. This allows farmers to remotely check on and
    adjust the irrigation system by means of the web or mobile apps. In addition,

  description: Precision agricultural (PrA) technology relies on the utilization of
    special equipment to access real time observations on plant health status, chlorophyll,
    nitrogen content, and soil moisture content. In this research new PrA technology
    (i.e., SPAD (Soil Plant Analysis Development), and UAV-based NDVI (Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicle-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) were used to monitor maize
    yield based on different filed trials in eastern part of Hungary. Our study aimed
    to examine the utilization of PrA technology specifically SPAD and UAV-based NDVI
    measurements for monitoring maize GY under irrigated and rainfed experimental
    setups in Hungary with varied nitrogen treatment for the year 2022. The results
    showed that the SPAD increased in all treatments (14.7 %; p < 0.05) from V6–V8
    in the rainfed treatments, decreased significantly (p < 0.05) by 13.9 % (R1) and
    30.6 % (R3). However, implementation of irrigation significantly increased the
    SPAD values in majority of treatments. Also, results reveal that, under irrigated
    and rainfed conditions the highest UAV-based NDVI value (0.703, 0.642) was obtained
    in V12 (A120 treatment) and highest NDVI value (0.728, 0.662) was obtained in
    Vn (A120 treatment). Remarekedly, irrigation led to significant differences (p
    < 0.05) of UAV-based NDVI values compared with none irrigated. On the other hand,
    implementation of 120 kg N ha−1 before sowing led to highest GY, especially under
    irrigated conditions (8.649 Mg ha−1). The overall mean GY under rainfed treatment
    was 6.256 Mg ha−1, while under irrigated treatment it increased by 37.2 % and
    reached 8.581 Mg ha−1 (p < 0.05). In conclusion, PrA technology will support farmers
    in making informed decisions regarding fertilization strategies and timing, which
    will in turn maximize yield and minimize risk.

  explanation: 'The study measures the impact of varying levels of basal and top-dressing
    nitrogen in different maize treatments (control, A60, A120, V690, V6150, V12120,
    V12180) in both rainfed and irrigated conditions on crop parameters such as SPAD,
    UAV-based NDVI, and grain yield.


    The authors conclude that SPAD, UAV-based NDVI, and GY were highly dependent upon
    the effects of N-fertilization treatments in irrigated and rainfed environments.
    This study highlights that irrigation and a basal nitrogen treatment of 120 kg/ha
    before sowing leads to highest grain yields in both irrigated and rainfed conditions.'
  extract_1: Specifically, we analyzed the correlation between different levels of
    basal nitrogen and top-dressing treatments, irrigation, and hybrid on GY. The
    comparison of mean values of different treatment practices were analyzed using
    Duncan multiple range test (DMRT) [68] to avoid the accumulation of first-order
    error.
  extract_2: The SPAD values varied from 23.0 to 48.4 in the rainfed treatment and
    from 24.4 to 51.8 in the irrigated treatment. Under natural rainfall conditions,
    the average SPAD value was 38.5, while under irrigated conditions it was 40.2.

    performanceHungary 1. Introduction Maize is the second most widely grown crop
    globally after wheat and is a key component of animal feed playing a significant
    role in global agri-food systems and securing nutrition [[1], [2], [3]]. The global
    maize production accounts for 197 million ha majorly in Latin America, Asia, and
    Sub-Saharan Africa [2]. Europe is also reported to be a good contributor for maize
    in terms of increasing yield from past two decades [4] sharing 11 % of the world''s
    maize production [2]. The three major crops i.e., wheat, maize, and rice provide
    30% of the dietary calories for more than 4.5 billion people in 94 developing
    countries [5]. With projected world population growth, increasing demand for food
    products and changing diets, increasing the yield, yield stability and quality
    of maize is of key importance [6,7]. The situation is complicated by the loss
    of arable land [8] and increasingly extreme environmental conditions due to climate
    change [[9], [10], [11]]. Numerous climatic extremes including heat stress and
    drought conditions leads to a reduction in cereal grain filling by reducing the
    spikelet fertility and increasing the rate of transpiration ultimately causing
    a significant decline in cereal yield [12]. Frequent occurrence of droughts and
    high temperatures lowers the moisture content, offset the maize plant growth unless
    provided with sufficient irrigation supported with fertilization [13]. It is expected
    that by 2050, there would be a 20 % decline in maize yield under projected climatic
    scenarios of global warming and drought stress [14]. A critical cultivation technology
    component of maize GY improvement is a balanced nutrient supply, with especial
    regard to N-supply [15,16], as it is an essential element of plant biochemical
    and physiological processes [[17], [18], [19]]. Applying the appropriate quantity
    of N fertilizer can help GY growth [20], but applying excessive amounts is wasteful,
    increases costs [21], does not improve GY, impairs water balance, and might cause
    nitrate pollution [22]. Monitoring maize GY largely depends on the reliable information
    about maize leaf chlorophyll content during the growing season that is much needed
    for appropriate application of N-fertilization in plant without environmental
    damage [23,24]. Chlorophyll is the photosynthetic pigment of the plant, playing
    a central role in light absorption, energy conversion and organic synthesis in
    plants [25]. Since chlorophyll content is closely related and correlated with
    leaf nitrogen concentration, and an important indicator for monitoring plant nitrogen
    status, development, growth, and GY [26]. It also provide an opportunity to schedule
    nitrogen fertilizer application and determine the optimal amount [27]. The use
    of PrA technology (refers to an information technology (IT) based farm management
    system) in this regard is indispensable in all types of environmental conditions
    [28]. PrA technology relies on the utilization of special equipment, sensor devices,
    real time kinematic (RTK) and un-named aerial vehicles (UAVs) to access real time
    observations on plant health status, chlorophyll, nitrogen, and soil moisture
    content [29]. Optical sensor devices like Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD)
    meter are cost effective and non-destructive handled PrA technology used to monitor
    in situ plant fertilization or N status to assist improving GY prediction [30].
    The SPAD-502 chlorophyll meter is based on the radiation absorption in leaves
    in the red (R) (650 nm) and near-infrared (NIR) (940 nm) range. The 650 or red
    wavelength is correlated with the chlorophyll content in the leaf while 940 or
    NIR provides the detail of leaf moisture content and plant thickness [31]. Previously,
    it has been used in various studies as a PrA tool for effective farm management
    and GY improvement [32]. The relative chlorophyll content values at leaf level
    measured by the instrument are closely related to the leaf N-value and total chlorophyll
    concentration at different developmental stages, as confirmed by numerous researchers
    [16,33]. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based multispectral remote sensing technology
    is more advanced PrA technology widely used to extract phenophase information,
    leaf area index (LAI), carotenoid estimation, and SPAD prediction [34,35]. A brief
    review of similar recent applications of PrA technology in different crop management
    practices are presented in Table 1. Table 1. A review of recent studies with PrA
    applications in agricultural management practices. Crops/plants PrA tool Objective

    UAV-NDVI, and RENDVI under different nitrogen treatments at plot level RENDVI
    camera performed better than NDVI in SPAD predictions [44] The optical and thermal
    infrared sensors of UAVs are capable to derive several vegetation indices like
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference red edge
    index (NDRE) used to estimate the biomass, chlorophyll, and nitrogen content,
    and predict crop yields in high spatial resolution [44] with flexibility, rapid
    and non-destructive diagnosis [45,46]. It is profitable and cost-effective [47],
    but this can only be achieved by the optimal timing of surveys [48]. However,
    monitoring and measuring the plant chlorophyll and fertilization status from PrA
    technology largely depends on soil moisture content sourced by rainfall in natural
    and irrigation in human developed scenarios [40,49]. Irrigation is a key factor
    that influences the photosynthetic performance of maize due to severe water stress,
    which otherwise can greatly reduce the relative chlorophyll content and net photosynthesis,
    resulting in significant GY loss [50]. Formerly, studies have proven the application
    of SPAD and UAV PrA technology for monitoring GY under stressed and non-stressed
    environment [41,51,52]. For instance, a few studies reported the use of SPAD and
    UAV based measurements for sun-induced chlorophyll and grain yield measurements
    in particular experimental setup in Europe as well [53,54]. Hungary, from central
    Europe experienced moderate to severe drought spells in recent past years with
    unprecedented impacts on maize and wheat yield [[55], [56], [57]]. Specifically,
    the recent drought year of 2022 is well recognized in research [58,59] to cause
    agriculture drought and impact grain yield. In this context, our study aimed to
    examine the utilization of PrA technology specifically SPAD and UAV-based NDVI
    measurements for monitoring maize GY under irrigated and rainfed experimental
    setups in Hungary with varied nitrogen treatment for the year 2022. Specifically,
    we analyzed the correlation between different levels of basal nitrogen and top-dressing
    treatments, irrigation, and chlorophyll content using spectral values (SPAD, UAV-based
    NDVI). It facilitated determining the required amount of N, the timing of its
    application and the influence of irrigation for achieving higher GY. Overall,
    the output of this research provides an effective utilization of PrA technology
    for grain yield monitoring proposing an optimistic future for farm management
    under drought and non-drought conditions to maximize the GY. 2. Materials and
    methods 2.1. Experimental site This research was carried out in central Europe
    within the research station of the University of Debrecen (47° 33′ N, 21° 26′
    E, altitude 111 m) (Fig. 1). The experiment was conducted using factorial design,
    with two-replicate. The main plots were set up with three hybrids (Merida, Armagnac,
    Fornad), split-plots with irrigation (rainfed, irrigated) and split-split-plots
    with nitrogen treatment doses. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    Debrecen; B: layout of the basal and top-dressing nitrogen treatment experiment,
    established by A. Széles, 2011). 2.2. Soil data The soil of the experiment can
    be characterized with high clay loam content (42 %) with humic layer (80–100 cm),
    and medium-compaction, and can be classified as lowland calcareous chernozem (Mollisol-Calciustoll
    or Vermustoll, USDA). The average pHKCl is 6.6 and nitrogen N-supply of the soil
    is medium (humus content: 2.6 %, total N = 0.14–0.18 %). The soil is calcareous
    in the upper 80 cm, but moderately calcareous (12 %) from 100 cm. The original
    AL-soluble P2O5 content of the soil is 130 mg/kg and the AL-soluble K2O content
    is 240 mg/kg. 2.3. Experimental design Before sowing, 27 % Genesis CAN (calcium
    ammonium nitrate) was applied. To meet the factorial design, the nitrogen rates
    were split between basal and top-dressing treatments. All nitrogen doses and period
    are presented in Table 2. Table 2. Nitrogen treatments and period for the factorial

    drought in Hungary, irrigation was considered as the second factor. Thus, plots
    were split to irrigated and none irrigated (rainfed). The total irrigation water
    applied was 115 mm, broken down as follows: 25 mm (21st May); 30 mm (13-16th June);
    30 mm (3rd July) and 30 mm (16th July). The maize was sown on 14.04.2022 and harvested
    on 05.10.2022; the plant density was 73 thousand plants/ha. The evaluation was
    carried out using two maize hybrids of the medium maturity group (FAO 400–499).
    Harvested yield GY (t ha−1) was indicated by correcting it for 14 % moisture.
    2.4. An outlook of climate conditions during the experiment In the first month
    of the growing season (April), rainfall was in line with the average for the reference
    period (1981–2010) (54 mm), while temperatures were 2.2 °C lower. Rainfall in
    May and June was 10 mm and 19 mm respectively, only 15 and 29 % of the multiannual
    average (Fig. 2). This was coupled with mean temperatures in May and June that
    were 1 °C and 2.9 °C above the multi-year average. The drought continued in July
    (21 mm) and August (28 mm), and the situation was exacerbated by the fact that
    the monthly mean temperatures for these two months were 2.1 °C and 2.7 °C above
    the multi-year average. September received the highest rainfall (162 mm), more
    than three times of average. (Fig. 2). Overall, the climatic conditions for the
    growing season 2022 (April–September) deviated from the climatic data for the
    reference period (1981–2010). The rainfall of the growing season was below the
    multi-year average (294 mm), accounting for 85 % of the average, and was characterised
    by an inappropriate temporal distribution. The mean temperature was 1 °C above
    the multi-year average (18.5 °C). Download : Download high-res image (292KB) Download

    temperature of the growing season in 2022 and average for the period 1981–2010.
    The temporal pattern of rainfall during the growing season (from sowing to harvesting)
    and the daily mean temperature trends are shown in Fig. 3. Of the 35 days with
    rainfall, 23 days were below 10 mm and 9 days were above 10 mm. Rainfall exceeding
    20 mm was recorded on 3 days. Reflecting the extreme weather conditions, maize
    water requirements at flowering stage (R1) were 4.5–5.5 mm/ha per day, while there
    was only 3 mm of rainfall during the 31 days between phenophases V8 and R1, and
    average temperature also increased significantly (23.7 °C). Between phenophases
    R1-R3, there was 21 mm rainfall with an average temperature of 22.8 °C. Significant
    rainfall occurred after the R6 phenophase (146 mm). Download : Download high-res

    and daily mean temperature trends from sowing to harvest. Hence, Due to less rainfall
    and prevailing drought conditions during the growing season and the unique challenges
    posed by this specific climatic context, a one-year experimental duration was
    deemed fitting to comprehensively capture the impact of varied nitrogen treatments
    in rainfed and irrigated experimental setups. 2.5. PrA instruments and test methods
    2.5.1. The SPAD-502 A Minolta SPAD-502 portable device (Minolta Camera Ltd., Osaka,
    Japan) was used for the non-destructive assessment of leaf chlorophyll content
    [60]. The illumination system of the device contains two photodiodes, one red
    (max 650 nm) and one infrared (max. 940 nm). The two photodiodes emit light alternately
    with equal brightness. The illuminated area is 6 mm2. The two types of light pass
    through the leaf plate and some of it is reflected (reflection), some is absorbed
    (absorption) while the rest penetrates the leaf (transmission). The light that
    penetrates the leaf is picked up by a sensor consisting of a silicone photodiode
    and converted into an analogue electrical signal. The instrument amplifies the
    electrical signal and converts it into a number. The calculation is based on the
    ratio of the intensity of the infrared and red light passing through the leaf.
    The higher the ratio, the more red light is absorbed by the leaves of the plant,
    which is closely related to the chlorophyll content. The SPAD value can range
    from 0 to over 100 [61,62]. SPAD measurements were performed in the phonological
    phases V6, V8, V12, Vn, R1 and R3. Measurements were taken per hybrid per Nitrogen
    treatment, on the 6th, 7th, and 8th plants of the second left row of each plot.
    Between V6 and R1 phenophase on the latest released fully developed leaf, between
    R1-R6 phenophase on the leaf at the ear [63]. 2.5.2. UAV/drone image acquisition
    The UAV-NDVI measurements were performed using a DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2 drone equipped
    with Sentera Double 4K TrueNDVI and TrueNDRE sensors [64] in six phenophases (V6,
    V8, V12, Vn, R1, R3) simultaneously with the SPAD measurements. The flying height
    was set to 80 m. The precise plot boundaries were determined by another PrA instrument
    i.e., Trimble RTK [65]. All georeferenced UAV images were stitched to make orthomosaic
    with a spatial resolution of 2 cm in open source WebODM program for further analysis
    [66]. The other products developed included digital surface model (DSM) and digital
    terrain model (DTM) which were not used in analysis. The orthorectified photos
    were further processes in open source QGIS environment for NDVI measurements.
    For accurate channels (wavelengths) separation, a set of equations were used to
    subtract out the effect of the out of band channels [64]. These includes eq (1)),
    2), and 3): (1) (2) (3) The resulting NDVI images were analyzed in the QGIS environment
    to calculate mean NDVI of each plot using “zonal statistics” function. 2.6. Statistical
    analysis First, the effects of nitrogen treatments on SPAD and UAV-NDVI for irrigated
    and rainfed conditions are examined in Box-plot distribution plots with significant
    *p < 0.5; **p < 0.1; ***p < 0.001 mean difference plotting from Duncan''s test
    in OriginLab [67]. Multivariate factorial analysis of variance ANOVA from generalized
    linear model (GLM) was used to examine the effects of nitrogen treatments, irrigation,
    and hybrid on GY. The comparison of mean values of different treatment practices
    were analyzed using Duncan multiple range test (DMRT) [68] to avoid the accumulation
    of first-order error. The DMRT is a post-hoc statistical analysis to examine the
    significant differences between various treatments of an experimental setup [69].
    It significantly compares the means of all possible pairs of different treatment
    groups. Currently, DMRT is employed in different nitrogen treatments to evaluate
    the pairwise difference in rainfed and irrigated conditions. Within the homogeneous
    group, the grain yields did not differ at 5 % significance level. Furthermore,
    the significant relationship of nitrogen treatment with SPAD and NDVI values were
    examined by parabolic (quadratic) regression analysis. The independent variable
    was nitrogen treatment, and the dependent variables were SPAD and UAV-NDVI. The
    significant relationship was evaluated based on coefficient of determination (R2).
    The correlation between SPAD and grain yield, and UAV-NDVI and grain yield were
    analyzed using bivariate linear regression analysis. The independent variables
    were SPAD and UAV-NDVI, and the dependent variable was grain yield. Here also,
    the significant relationship was evaluated based on the coefficient of determination
    (r2). The statistical evaluation was performed using the latest version of the
    R environment and results are plotted in OriginLab. 3. Results 3.1. Effect of
    nitrogen treatment and irrigation on studied maize indicators During the growing
    season, the SPAD values varied from 23.0 to 48.4 in the rainfed treatment and
    from 24.4 to 51.8 in the irrigated treatment. Under natural rainfall conditions,
    the average SPAD value was 38.5, while under irrigated conditions it was 40.2.
    The highest SPAD values during the whole growing season were obtained under natural
    rainfall conditions with treatment A60 (40.3; p < 0.05) and under irrigated conditions
    with treatment V6150 (45.5; p < 0.05), which resulted in an increase of 18.5 %
    and 39.6 %, respectively, compared to treatment A0 (Fig. 4, Table 3). Download

    value increased in the V6–V8 phenophase period in the rainfed treatment but varied
    upon nitrogen treatment. The most significant increase (20.7 %; p < 0.05) was
    recorded in the V690 treatment which increased the 60 kg N ha−1 basal treatment
    (A60) with an additional 30 kg N ha−1 dose. After the V8 phenological phase, there
    was a decrease in leaf SPAD values (p < 0.05), 13.9 % (R1) and 30.6 % (R3) (Fig.
    5d). In irrigated treatments, SPAD values increased until the V8 phenophase in
    treatments A0, A60 and A120 (p < 0.05), whereas the top-dressing treatments (V690,
    V6150, V12120 and V12180) increased SPAD values up to phenophase R1 (p < 0.05).
    The highest increase up to phenophase V8 was obtained with A120 (22.8 %) and up
    to phenophase R1 with V6150 (50.6 %) (Fig. 5c and e). By the R3 phenophase, SPAD
    values were identical to those measured at the V6 phenophase, averaged over the
    nitrogen treatments (Fig. 5a–g, Table 4). Furthermore, Duncan test revealed highly
    significant (p < 0.001) SPAD value difference in rainfed and irrigated treatment
    in V8 and V12 phenophase is observed in A0 nitrogen treatment (Fig. 4a), R1 and

    detected in treatment A0 in all phenophases, both in the rainfed and irrigated
    treatments. Evaluating the efficiency of the basal nitrogen and top-dressing treatments
    by phenophase showed that the highest value was 41.8 in phenophase V6 (V12120),
    but the Duncan test did not distinguish between SPAD values in different nitrogen
    treatments. In V8 growth stages, the highest SPAD value was measured in the A120
    treatment (47.3), an increase of 10.0 % (p < 0.05) compared to the A0 treatment.
    After V12 phenophase until R3 phenophase, the lowest spring basal nitrogen treatment
    of 60 kg N ha−1 (A60) proved to be effective (p < 0.05). The nitrogen application
    in R3 phenophase had the greatest effect on SPAD value compared to treatment A0
    (44.8 %). The average nitrogen effect was also highest in the R3 phenophase (39.1
    %). In the irrigated treatment, the statistically proven increase in the vegetative
    phase (V6-Vn) was obtained by the A60 treatment (p < 0.05), while in the generative
    phase (R1-R3) by the A120 treatment increased with an additional 30 kg N ha−1
    (V6150). In the vegetative stage, the V12 phenophase (36.5 %) and in the generative
    stage, the R3 phenophase (102.9 %) had the highest nitrogen treatment effect compared
    to the non-nitrogen (A0) treatment (Table 3). On the other hand, implementation
    of irrigation significantly increased the SPAD values in the majority of treatments
    (Table 4). For the control treatment, the irrigation has a significant impact
    only on the early stages V6 (p < 0.5), V8 (p < 0.001), and V12 (p < 0.001). While
    no significant impact was detected on the other stages (Table 4). For the first
    nitrogen level (60 kg N ha−1 before sowing), the irrigation has no effects on
    SPAD values. However, based on the observed values, the irrigation has no effect
    on SPAD values in Vn stage for all nitrogen levels, where it has an impact on
    R1, and R3. All on all, the irrigation has a significant impact on SPAD for all
    phenological phases except for Vn (Table 4). 3.2. Effect of Nitrogen treatments
    and irrigation on the UAV-based NDVI Nitrogen treatments and irrigation affected
    the UAV-based NDVI values. The values varied from 0.364 to 0.662 in the rainfed
    treatment and from 0.348 to 0.728 in the irrigated treatment. The overall experiment
    mean was 0.541. Under natural rainfall, the UAV-based NDVI for maize was 0.518,
    while under irrigated conditions it was 0.564. The measured data showed that the
    highest average value of the NDVI was obtained in A60 (0.538; p < 0.05) in the
    rainfed treatments and A120 (0.623; p < 0.05) in the irrigated treatments, which
    were 12.3 % and 21.9 % increases, respectively, compared to the treatment A0 (Table
    3). In the rainfed treatment, maize reached the highest UAV-based NDVI value in
    V12 and Vn, with increases of 61.9 % and 64.8 %, respectively (Fig. 6a–g, Table
    5). Then, it decreased in R1 and R3 phenophases (11.3 % and 22.3 %). The measured
    data showed that in V12 phenophases, the highest NDVI values (p < 0.05) were obtained
    in treatments A0, A60, V690 and V6150, while in Vn phenophases, the highest values
    were obtained in treatments A120, V12120 and V12180. Download : Download high-res

    effect: ns = not significant, *p < 0.5; **p < 0.1; ***p < 0.001. Also under irrigated
    conditions, the highest UAV-based NDVI was achieved for V12 and Vn phenophases,
    increasing by 72.1 % for the V12 phenophase and 77.7 % for the Vn phenophase.
    The values have decreased in the R1 and R3 growth phase; by 4.3 % between Vn-R1
    and 17.8 % between Vn-R3. Fertilizer treatments also had an influence in this
    case. At the V12 phenophase, treatments A0, V690, V6150 and V12180 had a significant
    effect (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6a–d, e, & g), while the other treatments had the highest
    effect at the Vn phenophase (Fig. 6b,c, & f, Table 5). Overall, Duncan''s test
    revealed a highly significant (p < 0.001) difference in rainfed and irrigated
    high NDVI values in V12 and Vn phenophase in A60, A120, and V690 nitrogen treatments
    (Fig. 6b, c, & d). Under natural rainfall conditions, the A120 treatment was proven
    to provide the highest UAV-based NDVI value (p < 0.05) throughout the vegetation
    period. Between treatments, the largest increase was recoreded in A120 (38.4 %)
    in the R3 phenophase compared with control one. Under irrigated conditions, the
    result of treatment A60 showed the highest UAV-based NDVI value. Over all the
    highest UAV-based NDVI value were recoreded in A120 (Table 5). Similar to SPAD,
    the UAV-based NDVI value positively affected by irrigation. Irrigation had a positively
    significant effect on the average of treatments based on different phenological
    phases. For A60 and A120 irrigation had a distinct and substantial impact on UAV-based
    NDVI in all phenological phases (Table 5). Under other nitrogen treatments, the
    impact of irrigation on the UAV-based NDVI was inconsistent; it affected certain
    phenological stages while leaving others unaffected. However the average value
    showed that irrigation has significant impact on UAV-based NDVI under all phenological
    phases except for V6. 3.3. Effect of Nitrogen treatments and irrigation on grain
    yield Under rainfed treatments, the A0 provided the lowest GY (4.2 Mg ha−1), which
    was well separated from the other treatments by Duncan''s test (Table 3, Fig.
    3). The 60 kg N ha−1 (A60) resulted in an increase of GY by 64.7 % (p < 0.05).
    This treatment did not increase GY at the 6-leaf stage when increased with an
    additional 30 kg N ha−1 nitrogen rate (V690), and no significant increase was
    measured when an additional 30 kg N ha−1 nitrogen rate was applied at the 12-leaf
    stage (V12120). Treatment A120 provided the largest GY increase (8.649 Mg ha−1),
    which was more than double of the GY of treatment A0 (p < 0.05). However, top-dressing
    treatments above the basal 120 kg N ha−1 resulted in a significant GY reduction
    (p < 0.05). Under irrigated conditions, the lowest GY in terms of nitrogen (5.149
    Mg ha−1) was measured in the A0 treatment. The 60 kg N ha−1 (A60) applied as a
    basal treatment resulted in a GY increase of 4.755 Mg ha−1 (92.3 %; p < 0.05),
    and the 120 kg N ha−1 basal treatment (A120) resulted in a GY increase of 6.715
    Mg ha−1 (130.4 %; p < 0.05) compared to the A0 treatment. Increasing the A60 treatment
    at V6 phenophase with a +30 kg N ha−1 (V690) resulted in a GY increase of only
    3.2 %. Then, at 12-leaf stage, application of an additional 30 kg N ha−1 (V12120)
    reduced GY (−1.363, Mg ha−1; p < 0.05). Compared to the A120 treatment, the effect
    of applying top-dressing (V6150) was minimal on GY reduction. An additional 30
    kg N ha−1 application (V12180) caused further GY reduction (−0.629 Mg ha−1; p
    < 0.05). The 120 kg N ha−1 basal treatment (11.863 Mg ha−1) was found to have
    a reliable GY enhancing effect (Table 3, Fig. 3). The main average yield was 7.419
    Mg ha−1 (rainfed, irrigated). The irrigated variant had a higher average yield
    (8.581 Mg ha−1) (p < 0.05), which was 37.2 % higher than the rainfed version (6.256
    Mg ha−1). In all nitrogen treatments, the irrigated variants provided higher grain
    yields. 3.4. Interaction between yield and different experimental variables Based
    on the factorial ANOVA from GLM analysis (Table 6) different factors with a significant
    impact on GY are identified. Table 6 showed that nitrogen treatments, irrigation,
    and hybrid had a significant impact (p < 0.05), however, the phenological phases
    did not exhibited any impact on GY. Analysis of variance results of chlorophyll
    content expressed as SPAD values in maize hybrids in rainfed and irrigated treatments
    showed that the main factors (nitrogen treatments and irrigation) were strongly
    (p < 0.001) correlated to the development of SPAD values (Table 6). The interaction
    between all variables presented in Fig. 6 revealed the highest rainfed GY (8.6
    Mg ha−1) with the highest NDVI (0.56) and irrigated GY (11.86 Mg ha−1) with the
    highest NDVI (0.62) was obtained under A120 nitrogen treatment (Fig. 7c & f).
    The highest rainfed SPAD value (40.6) is also obtained in A120 nitrogen treatment
    while highest irrigated SPAD value (45.5) is obtained in V6150 nitrogen treatment
    (Fig. 7i). The highest average SPAD value was recorded under irrigated treatment
    (42.9) compared with rainfed (39.7) (Fig. 7h). For GY, the irrigated average treatments
    exceeded the rainfed, while the best GY value were reached with A120 treatments.

    of spectral indexes with nitrogen treatment SPAD and UAV-based NDVI values recorded
    in phenophases were compared with basal nitrogen treatment and top-dressing treatments
    using parabolic regression-analysis (Fig. 9, Fig. 10). The relationship between
    SPAD and applied amount of nitrogen showed that nitrogen application positively
    influenced SPAD in rainfed and irrigated treatments during the growing season.
    Under natural rainfall conditions, the relationship was weakly positive in the
    V6 phenophase (R2 = 0.17**) and nitrogen treatment influenced the SPAD value in
    17.0 %. The relationship between the two variables became stronger for the V8
    phenophase (R2 = 0.4***) and further strengthened for the R1 phenophase (R2 =
    0.47***). A stronger relationship (R2 = 0.67***) was observed for the R3 phenophase,
    with a 67 % influence of nitrogen treatment. Under irrigated conditions, similar
    to the rainfed treatment, the relationship was weak (R2 = 0.23**) for the V6 phenophase
    and became stronger (R2 = 0.83***) in R1 and R3 phenophase. Hence, in R1 and R3
    developmental stages, the influence of nitrogen treatment was the most significant
    (83 % and 83 %) (Fig. 9). Download : Download high-res image (590KB) Download

    Fig. 10. Correlation between N nitrogen treatment and UAV-based NDVI under rainfed
    and irrigated conditions, 2022. The relationship between the UAV-based NDVI values
    and nitrogen application at natural rainfall was moderately close and closely
    correlated in the V12, R1, and R3 phenophases. The strongest correlation was observed
    at the R3 developmental stage (R2 = 0.8***). Under irrigated treatment, the parabolic
    relationship between the two variables was weak at the V6 phenophase and became
    increasingly stronger. It reached to its maximum at R3 phenophase (R2 = 0.82***).
    In this case, the differences between irrigated and rainfed treatments were lower
    than for SPAD (Fig. 10). 3.6. Relationship of spectral indexes with grain yield
    The significant relationship between grain yield and SPAD value under natural
    rainfall conditions was found to be weak to medium until silking (R1) phenophase.
    Furthermore, it improved to a medium level (r2 = 0.51***) by the R3 phenophase.
    For irrigated conditions, it was found to be strongest in R1 phenophase (r2 =
    0.62***) (Fig. 11). Download : Download high-res image (712KB) Download : Download

    improved maize (Zea mays L.) yield. Determining the amount and effective application
    timing of basal and top-dressing fertilizer to achieve optimal grain yields is
    a key research issue under drought stressed environmental conditions. To explore
    the issue, our research effectively utilized PrA technology including Soil Plant
    Analysis Development (SPAD) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV-NDVI) measurements
    in a specified experimental scenario. Under current ongoing climate change, drought
    is considered as one of the natural hazards that has a direct impact on crop production.
    In this context, maize is one of the crops that is directly affected by drought
    and heat waves due to its origin [70]. Many studies reported the sensitivity of
    maize to drought [14,71]. In Hungary, Mohammed, Alsafadi [55] also reported that
    maize is more prone to drought events compare to wheat. The experimental year
    2022 proved to be a record-breaking for extreme weather events with significant
    impacts on agriculture potential of the region [72,73]. Hence meaningful PrA results
    are provided by our research for maize production monitoring under the rainfed
    and irrigated setups in the region. The major findings of the study revealed that
    the SPAD values are highly dependent upon the effects of N-fertilization treatments
    in irrigated and rainfed environments with significant high SPAD values (40.3;
    p < 0.05) reported under rainfed conditions with treatment A60 and (45.5; p <
    0.05) under irrigated condition with treatment V6150 (Table 3, Fig. 4). Formerly,
    János [74] also reported a high SPAD value under irrigated treatment compared
    to low SPAD in non-irrigated treatments. Our research output also reported that
    115 mm irrigated treatment did not reach on average the maximum SPAD range of
    52–56 recommended by Piekielek, Fox [75]. Under rainfed conditions, the early
    top-dressing (V6) suggested by Jaynes [76] had its effect and there was a significant
    (p < 0.05) increase for all nutrient levels for the V8 phenophase. Furthermore,
    in agreement with other research findings [77,78], Following V8 phenophase, water
    deficit significantly (p < 0.05) reduced SPAD, which did not contribute to greater
    accumulation of pre-R1 dry matter. Furthermore, V12 and R3 phenophases had the
    highest effects of fertilizers compared to (A0) treatment. Phenophase analysis
    further revealed that under irrigated conditions in V12 phenophase, maize leaves
    had higher SPAD values than in the rainfed treatment (Table 4, Fig. 5). Due to
    irrigation and top-dressing treatments applied at V6 and V12 phenophases, the
    highest SPAD value developed at silking (R1) stage, the highest increase was observed
    with the V6150 treatment. Like SPAD, the UAV-based NDVI values averaged low i.e.,
    0.518 in the rainfed treatment and high i.e., 0.564 in the irrigated treatment,
    with a significant difference between the two treatments (p < 0.001) as also reported
    by Zhang, Han [79]. Significantly (p < 0.05) highest UAV-based NDVI values over
    the entire growing season in rainfed and irrigated treatments were detected in
    V12 and Vn phenophase with treatment A120 and proved to be most effective for
    achieving high GY (Table 5, Fig. 6). The correlation analysis of GY and UAV-NDVI
    spectral values in agreement with [80] revealed that the early growth stages (V6
    and V8) show a weaker correlation with GY while (V12 and Vn) showed a strong correlation
    with GY. Further research findings exposed that due to extreme weather anomalies
    in 2022, top-dressing had no GY enhancement reflecting the findings of Venterea
    and Coulter [81], as the water stress reduced the transpiration of plants causing
    a decline in N uptake to leaf [33,82]. For instance Ref. [57], also reported that
    several precipitation characteristics including onset and cessation dates, and
    rainy days frequency tend to impact the maize yield in different climatic scenarios
    in Hungary. Another recent study by Rawat, Sharda [83] suggested the significant
    role of climate (in terms of severe heat and less rain) for maize yield predictions.
    Moreover, the negative impact of high temperature is also reported by Liu, Yu
    [84] reducing the chlorophyll index and net photosynthetic rate shortening the
    kernel filling duration. Recent historical climatic conditions of the EU substantially
    impacted the maize yield in rainfed and irrigated conditions with varying fertilization
    treatments [85]. Currently, our findings revealed that the highest grain yields
    were obtained with the application of the spring basal treatment (A120), that
    is in agreement with the results of Drury, Reynolds [86] in both the rainfed and
    irrigated treatments. Moreover, significant (p < 0.001) irrigation effects were
    detected at all nutrient levels with the most significant effect in the V6120
    treatment compared to the A0 treatment. Overall, the coefficient of determination
    R2 of N-nitrogen treatment with both SPAD and NDVI are significantly (p < 0.001)
    strong in irrigated condition compared to rainfed condition except for phenophase
    6 where they have weak correlation (Fig. 9, Fig. 10). Hence, SPAD and NDVI are
    more recommendable to predict maize GY under irrigated condition. From these results,
    the sequence of SPAD correlation with maize GY based on R2 in irrigated conditions
    is as: R1 (0.62) > V12 (0.59) > R3 (0.51) > V8 (0.5) > Vn (0.27) > V6 (0.23) and
    the sequence of NDVI with maize GY is as: R3 > (0.75) > R1 (0.62) > Vn, V12 (0.52)
    > V8 (0.4) > V6 (0.1) (Fig. 11, Fig. 12). Overall, the results of the correlation
    between SPAD and NDVI spectral values and GY agree with other research findings
    [87,88]. Hence, we can conclude that spectral response at regenerative phenophase
    (R1 and R3) are recommendable for GY estimation [80,89]. Our research provides
    a meaningful analysis of PrA technology for effective farm management under irrigated
    and rainfed conditions in drought or stressed environmental condition, however,
    the results of study could be more comparable by using other UAV indices as used
    in other studies [[90], [91], [92]]. 5. Conclusions In the last few decades, the
    agricultural sector has experienced significant advancements by integration of
    advanced agricultural research and technology. Among them, PrA is one of the new
    technologies that are involved in agricultural production. PrA is one of the supporting
    tools that help to improve agricultural production and monitor plant health to
    achieve the maximum yield. In this research, SPAD and UAV-based NDVI were used
    to monitor maize growth in Hungary. The output of thus research can be summarized
    as follow: 1 Different fertilization levels in different maize growing stage led
    to significant differences (p < 0.05) in SPAD, UAV-based NDVI, and GY between
    rainfed and irrigated treatments. 2 Irrigation had increased the yield of maize
    significantly (p < 0.05) in all treatments. 3 SPAD increased in all treatments
    in the V6–V8 phenophase period under rainfed conditions. However, implementation
    of irrigation significantly increased the SPAD values in the majority of treatments.
    4 Under irrigated and rainfed conditions the highest UAV-based NDVI value (0.703,
    0.642) was obtained in V12 (A120 treatment) and highest NDVI value (0.728, 0.662)
    was obtained in Vn (A120 treatment), thus it is'' recommended to use UAV-based
    NDVI in these stages. 5 Irrigation led to significant differences (p < 0.05) of
    UAV-based NDVI values compared with none irrigated. 6 Based on the output of this
    research, implementation of 120 kg N ha−1 before sowing led to highest GY, especially
    under irrigated conditions (8.649 Mg ha−1). On the other hand, both Fertilization*irrigation
    had a positive significant impact on GY. 7 The highest correlation was obtained
    between fertilization and UAV-based NDVI (r = 0.8) under irrigated conditions
    in R3 maize growing stage. A similar pattern emerged where the highest correlation
    between UAV-based NDVI and GY was obtained in R3, also under irrigated conditions.
    Overall, this research recommends using irrigation with 120 kg N ha−1 before sowing
    to increase the maize yield, however more research is needed to confirm this recommendation.
    Also, monitoring the crop using PrA, could indicate potential yield. In this sense,
    high correlation between UAV-based NDVI in R3 stages could reflect high SPAD value
    and potential high yield. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare
    that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships
    that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. Acknowledgments

  description: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a non-destructive and contactless technology
    that provides valuable information about the structure and composition of an object.
    It has the ability to capture detailed information about the chemical and physical
    properties of agricultural crops. Due to its wide spectral range, compared with
    multispectral- or RGB-based imaging methods, HSI can be a more effective tool
    for monitoring crop health and productivity. With the advent of this imaging tool
    in agrotechnology, researchers can more accurately address issues related to the
    detection of diseased and defective crops in the agriculture industry. This allows
    to implement the most suitable and accurate farming solutions, such as irrigation
    and fertilization, before crops enter a damaged and difficult-to-recover phase
    of growth in the field. While HSI provides valuable insights into the object under
    investigation, the limited number of HSI datasets for crop evaluation presently
    poses a bottleneck. Dealing with the curse of dimensionality presents another
    challenge due to the abundance of spectral and spatial information in each hyperspectral
    cube. State-of-the-art methods based on 1D and 2D convolutional neural networks
    (CNNs) struggle to efficiently extract spectral and spatial information. On the
    other hand, 3D-CNN-based models have shown significant promise in achieving better
    classification and detection results by leveraging spectral and spatial features
    simultaneously. Despite the apparent benefits of 3D-CNN-based models, their usage
    for classification purposes in this area of research has remained limited. This
    paper seeks to address this gap by reviewing 3D-CNN-based architectures and the
    typical deep learning pipeline, including preprocessing and visualization of results,
    for the classification of hyperspectral images of diseased and defective crops.
    Furthermore, we discuss open research areas and challenges when utilizing 3D-CNNs
    with HSI data.

  explanation: 'This review summarizes the various methodologies and applications
    of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in analyzing and classifying hyperspectral
    images for agricultural purposes. Hyperspectral imaging is a non-destructive and
    contactless technology that provides valuable information about the structure
    and composition of an object. The high-dimensionality and large volume of hyperspectral
    data can make it challenging to process, analyze, and classify. 3D-CNNs are a
    type of deep learning model that have proven to be effective in handling such
    high-dimensional data.


    The review highlights the challenges associated with using 2D-CNN and 1D-CNN models
    for hyperspectral image classification, including their inability to fully capture
    the spatial-spectral information present in the data. 3D-CNNs, on the other hand,

    data. Abstract Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a non-destructive and contactless
    technology that provides valuable information about the structure and composition
    of an object. It has the ability to capture detailed information about the chemical
    and physical properties of agricultural crops. Due to its wide spectral range,
    compared with multispectral- or RGB-based imaging methods, HSI can be a more effective
    tool for monitoring crop health and productivity. With the advent of this imaging
    tool in agrotechnology, researchers can more accurately address issues related
    to the detection of diseased and defective crops in the agriculture industry.
    This allows to implement the most suitable and accurate farming solutions, such
    as irrigation and fertilization, before crops enter a damaged and difficult-to-recover
    phase of growth in the field. While HSI provides valuable insights into the object
    under investigation, the limited number of HSI datasets for crop evaluation presently
    poses a bottleneck. Dealing with the curse of dimensionality presents another
    challenge due to the abundance of spectral and spatial information in each hyperspectral
    cube. State-of-the-art methods based on 1D and 2D convolutional neural networks
    (CNNs) struggle to efficiently extract spectral and spatial information. On the
    other hand, 3D-CNN-based models have shown significant promise in achieving better
    classification and detection results by leveraging spectral and spatial features
    simultaneously. Despite the apparent benefits of 3D-CNN-based models, their usage
    for classification purposes in this area of research has remained limited. This
    paper seeks to address this gap by reviewing 3D-CNN-based architectures and the
    typical deep learning pipeline, including preprocessing and visualization of results,
    for the classification of hyperspectral images of diseased and defective crops.
    Furthermore, we discuss open research areas and challenges when utilizing 3D-CNNs
    with HSI data. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Hyperspectral

    evaluationDeep learning 1. Introduction Plant diseases pose significant threats
    to global food production, with potential yield losses of up to 30% and substantial
    economic impact [56]. This can have a devastating impact on farmers and communities,
    particularly in low-income countries where access to food is already challenging.
    Precision agriculture and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) offer promising solutions
    for preventing crop damage and losses, ultimately contributing to efforts to promote
    sustainability and reduce the impact of diseases on food production. HSI, also
    referred to as imaging spectrometry, combines two distinct technologies, imaging
    and spectroscopy, to provide both spatial and spectral information, simultaneously.
    Spectral information can provide rich information about biochemical and biophysical
    attributes of the agricultural crops. This is due to the higher spectral resolution
    of hyperspectral sensors compared to multispectral and RGB ones. As a result,
    this feature can lead to better discrimination of objects of similar colors, higher
    accuracy in complex classifications, and the ability to predict chemical composition
    and provide information about the interior of an object [67]. However, the interpretation
    of spectral data can be complex, especially when analyzing and comparing multiple
    samples over extended periods. One approach to simplify spectral analysis is the
    usage of spectral indices. Spectral indices are mathematical expressions that
    combine several spectral bands into a single value, providing an easier representation
    of the data. For example, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) computes
    the ratio between Near Infrared (NIR) and Red (R) bands of hyperspectral channels
    as follows: (1) With the help of spectral indices, one can effectively identify
    trends and changes in the data without requiring an in-depth comprehension of
    the underlying scientific principles governing spectral data, thus enabling a
    simpler data analysis, enhancement of features, standardization, comparability,
    and calibration of data. In the agricultural industry, two common spectral indices
    are the already mentioned NDVI and the Green Chlorophyll Index (GCI). The former
    is used to monitor vegetation growth and health and the latter quantifies the
    amount of chlorophyll in plants. Further indices have been defined, usually in
    the context of remote sensing, to support research for example on agriculture,
    soil, vegetation, water and forestry. A comprehensive database of spectral indices
    that is searchable by application area and hyperspectral sensor is provided in
    Henrich et al. [24]. From a data-perspective, a hyperspectral image is a stack
    of images, known as a hyperspectral cube or a data cube. Each image of this cube
    represents the response of the imager to one of the distinct hyperspectral channels
    [5]. This is illustrated in Fig. 1. It shows a 3D data cube P with dimensions
    , where M and N represent the axes of spatial information and λ represents the
    spectral dimension [74]. In the hyperspectral cube, each pixel, given by its spatial
    coordinates, is a vector of length λ that indicates the reflected radiation of
    a specific part of the object. Download : Download high-res image (79KB) Download

    et al. [74] with modification). It is a three-dimensional array where each pixel
    represents a spectrum containing a range of wavelengths. This spectrum can act
    as a fingerprint and provides information about biophysical and biochemical characteristics
    of the imaged object. The high-dimensionality of this data cube poses a challenge
    to traditional machine learning approaches, resulting in reduced accuracy due
    to their inability to extract complex features. Moreover, the performance of these
    approaches heavily depends on manual feature engineering. Convolutional Neural
    Networks (CNN) have been proven to achieve high classification accuracies in image
    classification tasks and to work well with the high-dimensionality of HSI data.
    In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of 3D-CNN-based models utilized
    in the classification of non-UAV-based hyperspectral images of diseased and defective
    crops. This review is intended to assist computer vision experts and agriculture-domain
    researchers seeking to address HSI classification tasks for crops under stress.
    The paper is organized as follows. In the following Section, we outline the investigation
    protocol used in this review. In Section 3, we briefly describe the structure
    of CNNs and their most important concepts. Following the typical data pipeline
    associated with CNNs, Sections 4 to 7 review data preprocessing, band and feature
    selection, network architecture design, and data visualization. This provides
    a convenient overview of its individual steps for plant classification problems
    using 3D-CNNs. Finally, Section 8 highlights the research gaps and limitations
    associated with the application of 3D-CNNs for HSI data classification. 2. Search

    review examines various applications of 3D-CNN-based models in detecting and classifying
    diseases in agricultural crops, including charcoal rot in soybeans [45], mold
    in peanuts and strawberries [42], [33], bacterial leaf blight (BLB) in rice [10],
    grapevine vein-clearing virus (GVCV) in grapevines [47], and potato late blight
    (PLB) in potatoes [51]. Moreover, the review explores the use of 3D-CNN-based
    architectures for identifying specific defects in crops, such as decay in blueberries
    [52], bruise and brown spots in fruits [50], [28], heat stress in rice [19], as
    well as black, fermented, shell, and broken coffee defects in beans [13]. By harnessing
    the power of 3D-CNN-based models, we can effectively address challenges of classifying
    diseased and defective using hyperspectral images. This can result in the preservation
    of product quality, prevention of yield losses, and ensuring food safety standards.
    3. CNN structure and concepts A CNN is comprised of a series of layers each consisting
    of several neurons. As shown in Fig. 2, each layer is the input for the next layer
    in the network. Key building blocks of a CNN are convolution layers, detector
    layers, and pooling layers. A convolution layer uses convolutional kernels to
    extract low-dimensional features from the input data while preserving the spatial
    relationship between the input data pixels. Fig. 3 depicts the movement directions
    of 1D (spectral), 2D (spatial), and 3D (spatial-spectral) kernels within the hypercube.
    A detector layer applies a non-linear function like Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
    to learn non-linear representations. Pooling layers make features invariant by
    reducing the dimensionality of data. Download : Download high-res image (55KB)

    A CNN consists of multiple layers, including convolution, detector, and pooling
    layers, where each layer serves as the input for the subsequent layer, enabling
    the extraction of low-dimensional features, learning of non-linear representations,
    and dimensionality reduction in the network. Download : Download high-res image

    process using 1D, 2D, and 3D kernels in hypercube. A schematic overview of movement
    directions for (a) 1D, (b) 2D, and (c) 3D convolutions in CNNs over hypercube
    is shown. The X and Y directions indicate the movement of the kernel across the
    spatial dimensions, and Z direction shows the movement across the spectral dimension.
    Classification methods based on 1D-CNN (spectral feature-based) and 2D-CNN (spatial
    feature-based) cannot efficiently classify hyperspectral data as neither utilizes
    spatial and spectral features together. However, a 3D-CNN can extract spatial-spectral
    features from the volumetric data. This is due to its ability to incorporate the
    spectral dimension in addition to the spatial dimensions, which enables it to
    model and learn more complex spatiotemporal representations. On the flipside,
    a straightforward generalization of kernels to their 3-dimensional versions increases
    the number of operations that must be performed to apply a kernel by a factor
    of l. Not only the application of these kernels is computationally more costly,
    but also their training becomes more challenging, as the kernel has more parameters.
    Taking no other model-changes into account (as, for example in Qiao et al. [52])
    we would have to shorten kernel-sides by to keep computational complexity at roughly
    the same level. In the following, a description of previous review papers that
    deal with the topics of CNNs, hyperspectral data, and applications in agriculture
    and plant research is given. The work of Signoroni et al. [63] is aimed at domain
    professionals seeking comprehensive insights into the integration of hyperspectral
    acquisition techniques and deep learning architectures for specific tasks across
    diverse application domains. This resource caters to machine learning and computer
    vision experts, offering a nuanced understanding of how deep learning technologies
    are tailored to effectively process and analyze hyperspectral data, keeping them
    up-to-date with the latest advancements. In Jiang and Li [29] an examination of
    how different CNN architectures have been employed in the assessment of plant
    stress, plant development, and postharvest quality. This review categorizes the
    studies according to the technical advancements achieved in terms of imaging classification,
    object detection, and image segmentation. As a result, it highlights cutting-edge
    solutions for specific phenotyping applications, offering valuable insights into
    the current state of the field. An overview of state-of-the-art CNN models and
    visualization techniques for disease diagnosis in plants is given in Joseph et
    al. [31]. The review given in Gill et al. [21] delves into the plant stress phenotyping,
    specifically examining the utilization of machine learning and deep learning methodologies.
    The study encompasses a wide range of high throughput phenotyping platforms, exploring
    the integration of data from diverse sources. However, it does not discuss 3D-CNN
    architectures. Finally, a review paper that combines all three topics was provided
    in Wang et al. [80]. In that work, the authors provide an overview of the application
    of hyperspectral imaging in agriculture, encompassing areas such as ripeness and
    component prediction, classification themes, and plant disease detection. Additionally,
    the study examines recent advancements in hyperspectral image analysis specifically
    in the context of deep learning models. The review not only highlights the achievements
    in this field but also outlines the existing challenges associated with deep learning-based
    hyperspectral image analysis. Moreover, the study presents future prospects and
    potential directions for further research in this domain. In this review, we update
    and complement the paper of Wang et al. [80] with a particular focus on 3D-CNNs
    and the entirety of the process of creating a high-performant model, including
    preprocessing of data, band selection, exploration of model architectures, and
    data visualization. A deep learning pipeline for HSI classification typically
    consists of several stages, including data preprocessing, band and feature selection,
    model design, model training, testing, and evaluation (see Fig. 4). Data preprocessing
    involves enhancing the quality of raw HSI data, for example, through noise removal,
    radiometric calibration, and dimension reduction. Feature extraction transforms
    the raw data into a new space of features, which is expected to be more discriminative
    for the classification task. Band selection defines a subset of the original spectral
    bands that is the most relevant for the classification task. Model design is the
    configuration of hyperparameters of the CNN model, for example, the number and
    sequence of convolutional layers and dense layers, the activation functions to
    be used, and the usage of dropout or skip connections. During the training step,
    the model is optimized by iteratively adjusting its internal parameters (weights
    and biases) to minimize the error between its predicted output and the actual
    output on the input data. Finally, the model is evaluated to learn patterns and
    relationships in the data and to make accurate predictions on new unseen data.

    discriminative features and bands are extracted from preprocessed HSI dataset
    of crop. Then, the dataset is split to training, validation, and testing sets.
    The training dataset is used to train the 3D-CNN model, the validation dataset
    is employed to assess the model''s performance and fine tune its parameters, and
    the testing dataset serves to evaluate the final performance and generalization
    ability of the trained 3D-CNN model on unseen data. 4. Data preprocessing Data
    preprocessing is a critical step in hyperspectral data analysis, aimed at optimizing
    the quality and quantity of the data. This step enhances the suitability of the
    data for downstream tasks such as classification and feature extraction. Preprocessing
    techniques include patch extraction, radiometric correction and calibration, smoothing,
    dimension reduction, and background removal. Data augmentation also falls under
    preprocessing and has the goal of increasing the volume of training data. 4.1.
    Patch extraction Patch extraction is a technique that involves dividing an image
    into smaller images or patches. In the context of HSI, patch extraction has significant
    advantages for efficient and targeted analysis of specific regions of interest
    within an image. By extracting image patches that contain pixels with similar
    properties, researchers can focus their analysis on areas of the image that are
    most relevant to diseased or defective areas. To give a concrete example, Nagasubramanian
    et al. [45] utilized patch extraction to analyze hyperspectral images of soybean
    crops. In their study, they extracted spatial patches of size 64×64×240 from an
    original image of size 500×1600×240, where the first two dimensions define the
    spatial resolution of the image and 240 denotes the number of spectral bands.
    By analyzing the properties of pixels within these patches, they were able to
    extract features that were more representative of the target disease which ultimately
    improved the accuracy and efficiency of their analysis. Furthermore, patch extraction
    helps to expand the number of images when there is a lack of data. It also reduces
    computational time, as processing hyperspectral images of large sizes can be computationally
    demanding [51], [28]. 4.2. Data augmentation Imbalanced and scarce data is a common
    problem in many machine learning applications (see, for example, [1]) and HSI
    is no exception. Imbalanced data, a special case of data scarcity, refers to the
    situation where the number of samples in each class or category of the data is
    not evenly distributed. This can lead to a bias towards the overrepresented classes
    in the analysis results, which is particularly problematic if the minority class
    is of interest. To address imbalanced HSI data, one common approach is resampling
    [47], which involves either oversampling the minority class or undersampling the
    majority class to balance the class distribution. Resampling can be done randomly
    or using more advanced techniques such as Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
    (SMOTE) [12] or Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) sampling [23]. Other widespread data
    augmentation approaches include transformation techniques such as mirroring [42],
    rotation [42], [13], horizontal and vertical flipping [13], [50], and color jittering
    [50]. Along with above-mentioned methods, patch extraction (Section 4.1) can also
    be used to address imbalance HSI dataset. 4.3. Radiometric calibration and correction
    Radiometric calibration is an essential step in the accurate operation of hyperspectral
    cameras. It aims to establish a quantitative relationship between the response
    of the camera sensor (the radiation sensor) and the actual reflectance (radiation
    level) of an object in a given environment. The calibration process involves assigning
    a “true” value for either radiation intensity or reflectance to the digital numbers
    given by the camera that represent recorded outputs for each pixel and spectral
    channel. To that end, calibrated reflectance standards are utilized, which usually
    consist of a matte Lambertian reflecting surface to ensure that reflected light
    is uniform in all directions [60]. The calibration process is then performed as
    follows: After selecting a radiation source that emits a known type and amount
    of radiation, the detector is placed in close proximity to the source to measure
    the radiation. Next, using calibration factors provided by the manufacturer or
    based on known mathematical formulas (see, for example, [51]) for the particular
    detector, the expected response of the detector is determined. The measured response
    of the detector is then aligned with the expected response based on the known
    radiation level using calibration factors. This calibration process should be
    repeated periodically with different radiation sources to ensure the continued
    accuracy and reliability of the detector''s measurements. Even with calibration
    performed, hyperspectral cameras are susceptible to radiometric errors that can
    arise from a variety of sources, including sensor drift, electronic interference,
    light source, and data transmission and recording issues. For example, one of
    the common radiometric errors which relates to the camera''s sensor is stripping.
    Each sensor consists of multiple individual detectors that sometimes do not function
    properly due to being out of calibration. Consider a push broom (along-track)
    camera where its sensor has multiple detectors aligned in a row. When one of them
    is calibrated slightly different from the adjacent detector the striping effect
    can occur. In this case, lines predominantly consisting of varying shades of dark
    and bright pixels formed. Radiometric correction can register and rectify incorrect
    pixel brightness. To achieve this, a series of procedures are employed including
    noise correction, de-striping, line-dropout correction [17], and black and white
    image correction [19], [10], [13], [28]. Fig. 5(b) shows the calibrated hyperspectral
    image of lettuce using the following computation, (2) where, Raw HSI Data is the
    image taken by the hyperspectral camera without modification, Dark Ref is the
    image captured by closing the camera''s lens, and the White Ref is the imaged
    white reference with even and maximum reflectance across the spectral range. Download

    and white calibration of HSI data. (a) The hyperspectral image of lettuce rendered

    image after black and white image correction using the Equation (2). 4.4. Smoothing
    Smoothing, also known as filtering, is a technique in HSI to improve the quality
    of the data by reducing noise and artifacts and enhancing the signal-to-noise
    ratio of the data. This technique in HSI can be broadly classified into two categories:
    spatial smoothing and spectral smoothing. Spatial smoothing techniques selectively
    smooth out certain features in an image by applying filters that amplify or attenuate
    certain spatial frequencies [17]. Common spatial smoothing techniques include
    Gaussian filtering, mean filtering [54], median filtering, bilateral filtering
    [9], and anisotropic diffusion filtering [39]. Spectral smoothing techniques operate
    on the spectral domain of an HSI image by smoothing the intensity values of neighboring
    spectral bands. As in spatial smoothing the goal is to remove noise [77], reduce
    artifacts, and enhance features in the image. Common spectral smoothing techniques
    include moving average filtering [77], Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering [78], Fourier
    filtering, wavelet filtering, and principal component analysis (PCA). For example,
    Cao et al. [10] eliminated the random noise that was present in the spectral data
    of the different region of interests (ROIs) using SG filtering. The filtering
    process makes it easier to identify the true signal of the sample and remove interference
    caused by size and structure differences between the ROIs. Similarly, Jung et
    al. [33] and Jia et al. [28] used a SG filter to smooth out the spectral data
    and reduce the effect of noise. As Vaiphasa [77] points out, care must be taken
    when applying smoothing techniques. The subjective selection of smoothing filters
    in hyperspectral remote sensing studies can negatively impact the statistical
    properties of the spectral data, which can, in turn, affect subsequent analyses.
    To preserve the statistical properties of the HSI data, the selection of smoothing
    filters should be done through a comparative t-test method that identifies the
    filter with the least statistical disturbances. By using this approach, it is
    possible to mitigate the negative effects of smoothing filters and ensure the
    reliability of subsequent analyses based on statistical class models. 4.5. Dimension
    reduction The large number of spectral bands within hyperspectral data often makes
    it challenging to process and analyze HSI data. Dimensionality reduction techniques
    retain relevant information, while allowing the model to work on smaller hypercubes
    downstream. These techniques are split into linear and non-linear ones. 4.5.1.
    Linear techniques Linear dimension reduction in HSI refers to a set of statistical
    and machine learning techniques that aim to find a lower-dimensional linear manifold
    in the high-dimensional space that captures the essential spectral information
    of the data [35]. By embedding the data into this lower-dimensional linear space,
    the dimensionality of the data is reduced while preserving as much of the spectral
    information as possible. PCA and Random Forest (RF) are two examples of this technique,
    and demonstrations of both can be seen in Cao et al. [10]. The process of PCA
    involves first zero-centering the input spectral matrix (i.e., the matrix of the
    spectral bands) and computing its covariance matrix. Next, the eigenvectors and
    eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are calculated, and the eigenvalues are sorted
    in descending order. The top k eigenvalues are then selected and the corresponding
    eigenvectors space computed. The k-dimensional data is obtained by projecting
    the original spectral matrix into the new space using the selected eigenvectors.
    On the other hand, an RF evaluates the importance of each wavelength by randomly
    replacing it and measuring its effect on the accuracy of the thus trained CNN
    model. To accomplish this, the RF builds many decision trees, and each tree is
    trained on a different subset of the data. The algorithm calculates the importance
    score for each wavelength by measuring the change in the prediction error rate
    before and after randomly replacing the wavelength in the out-of-bag data. The
    wavelength with the highest importance score is selected, and this process is
    repeated until the desired number of wavelengths is achieved. The dimensionality
    of the hyperspectral data is thus reduced, while retaining the most important
    information for accurate predictions. Further linear algorithms for dimension
    reduction of HSI data are described in Fırat et al. [18] and encompass Independent
    Component Analysis (ICA) and PCA-based algorithms like Incremental PCA (IPCA),
    Sparse PCA (SPCA), and Randomized PCA (RPCA). 4.5.2. Non-linear techniques Non-linear
    techniques can handle data with complex and non-linear structures. Yang et al.
    [83] classified these techniques into Kernel-based and manifold learning [83].
    Kernel-based techniques, like Kernel PCA (KPCA), use non-linear mappings to transform
    data into higher-dimensional feature spaces first on which linear techniques can
    be applied. Manifold learning algorithms, on the other hand, aim to directly discover
    the intrinsic non-linear structure of data. See Khodr and Younes [35] for well-known
    manifold learning techniques, including Isometric Feature Mapping (Isomap), Locally
    Linear Embedding (LLE), Local Tangent Space Alignment (LTSA), Diffusion Maps,
    Sammon''s Mapping (SM), and Locality Preserving Projections (LPP). 4.6. Background
    removal The data captured in hyperspectral images contains both foreground, called
    the ROI, and background objects. In scenarios where the target object does not
    cover the entire scanning area the signals from background objects can interfere
    with the data analysis, i.e., the background can contain noise that needs to be
    filtered out [78]. This is especially true when dealing with images that exhibit
    color gradients. By masking the background from the data, researchers can focus
    on the spectral signature of the ROI. This leads to improved target detection
    in classification task. It also reduces the computational complexity of subsequent
    processing steps including the training 3D-CNN models [51]. There are various
    traditional techniques to extract he ROI from the hyperspectral image. These techniques
    can be classified into several categories based on their underlying principles
    and are discussed separately below. 4.6.1. Spectral similarity-based methods These
    methods work based on the similarity between the spectra of the pixels within
    an image. Examples of such methods include Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) [37] and
    Spectral Information Divergence (SID) [53]. SAM computes the spectral angle (3)
    between the target reference spectrum R and each pixel spectrum T for all spectral
    bands λ in the hyperspectral image. This results in a similarity measure that
    is insensitive to illumination variations [2]. On the other hand, SID works based
    on the concept of information theory (entropy). It compares the spectral information
    content of each pixel to a reference spectral information content. In general,
    SAM is better suited for well-defined spectral variations and low background noise,
    while SID is more robust to complex background noise and illumination variations.
    4.6.2. Statistical-based methods These methods leverage statistical techniques
    to identify ROIs that share similar spectral properties and produce a set of uncorrelated
    components capturing different aspects of spectral variability within the image.
    For example, Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) [43] is specifically designed to reduce
    the impact of noise in the data by separating the noise and signal components
    of the HSI data. This makes it particularly useful for operating on noisy HSI
    data but at the expense of more computational time. Another technique, ICA (see
    Section 4.5.1), aims to separate the mixed signals into their independent components,
    providing a more flexible approach to identify subtle spectral differences between
    ROIs. Finally, PCA [13] decomposes the original HSI data into orthogonal components
    that represent the directions of maximum variance in the data. In general, PCA
    is computationally more efficient than ICA and MNF, as it involves a simpler mathematical
    transformation that uses standard matrix operations. 4.6.3. Spatial-based methods
    These methods exploit the spatial correlation present in the image to differentiate
    between pixels within and outside the ROI. Typically, these methods apply morphological
    operations or spatial filtering techniques to extract features such as edges or
    texture, which are then used to segment the image into ROIs. The Morphological
    Attribute Profile (MAP) [14] and the Spatial-Spectral Endmember Extraction (SSEE)
    algorithm [49] are examples of spatial-based methods that use mathematical morphology
    and spatial filtering, respectively. SSEE first identifies the endmembers, or
    pure spectral signatures, present in the HSI data, and then uses a spatial clustering
    algorithm to group adjacent pixels with similar spectral properties into ROIs.
    On the other hand, MAP applies a series of morphological opening and closing operations
    to the image to identify connected regions of pixels with similar morphological
    attributes, such as size and shape. These connected regions can then be used as
    ROIs. These methods are computationally efficient and can be useful in scenarios
    where spectral information alone is not sufficient for accurate ROI extraction,
    such as in cases of low spectral contrast or high noise levels. 4.6.4. Hybrid
    methods These methods combine techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency
    of the ROI extraction process. One approach can be combining statistical-based
    techniques such as PCA, ICA, or MNF with spatial-based techniques such as MAP
    or SSEE. For example, by combining MAP and PCA we can exploit both the spatial
    and spectral information [70] in the HSI data for ROI extraction. These hybrid
    methods can be effective in cases where neither spatial nor spectral methods alone
    are sufficient for accurate ROI extraction. 4.6.5. Machine learning-based methods
    Machine learning algorithms can also be used to extract the ROI. This process
    involves training a model using labeled data to identify and extract regions with
    specific spectral characteristics. Once trained, the model can be used to predict
    the presence of those characteristics in unlabeled data and extract ROIs. This
    procedure is computationally efficient and allows for the extraction of subtle
    and complex patterns that may not be easily identifiable through traditional methods.
    Some instances of such techniques are Support Vector Machines (SVM) [6], RF [7],
    and CNN [40], [79]. 4.6.6. Software-assisted manual annotation Manual definition
    of the ROI can be assisted by software specifically built to handle HSI data.
    Amongst these are for example ENVI [38] and Spectronon [55] as commercial products,
    as well as the MATLAB Hyperspectral toolbox. Examples for open-source and free
    software are SeaDAS [46], the Orfeo ToolBox [11], and RSGISLib [8]. These packages
    provide HSI data analysis for a wide range of tasks discussed before. An example
    of software-assisted annotation is the work of Jin et al. [30] in which the authors
    generated an ROI using ENVI by manually selecting the tissues or areas of interest
    in the false color images of HSI data. Researchers can utilize such software in
    addition to the above discussed algorithms. For example, Gao et al. [19] developed
    an open-source software which is specifically designed for analyzing HSI data
    of seeds. It is able to remove the background of the HSI data and produces a binary
    mask using a user-defined minimum and maximum intensity threshold along with a
    component-searching algorithm. The results are an accurate segmentation of the
    seeds even when they overlap. 5. Band and feature selection The selection of spectral
    bands in HSI is another crucial preprocessing step for classification tasks. It
    entails the identification of a subset of the most discriminative spectral bands
    from all available bands. This process is instrumental in reducing data dimensionality
    by eliminating redundant bands, thereby significantly reducing the computational
    overheads of downsteam tasks. Furthermore, the careful selection of spectral bands
    can also reduce the effects of noise in the data. In general, based on the survey
    of Sun and Du [71], band selection mechanisms can be categorized into six groups
    as follows (another classification of methods is presented in Sawant and Prabukumar
    [58]). 5.1. Ranking-based selection Ranking-based band selection methods evaluate
    the significance of each spectral band based on a predetermined criterion and
    choose the most important bands in a sorted order. These methods can be categorized
    into two types: supervised and unsupervised. In supervised ranking-based methods,
    labeled training samples are utilized to determine the importance of each spectral
    band, while in unsupervised ranking-based methods, statistical properties of the
    data are used for the same purpose. One example of such method is spectral differentiation.
    Qi et al. [51] employed first and second order differentiation to decrease the
    computational complexity of HSI data containing 204 bands. The first derivative
    can effectively pinpoint areas in the spectrum where the rate of change is highest.
    This indicates the presence of sharp spectral features such as absorption or emission
    lines. Moreover, it allows for the selection of bands that capture these features
    and thus, provide critical information for classification or detection tasks.
    The second derivative is useful for identifying regions of the spectrum where
    the rate of change of the first derivative is highest, signifying the presence
    of spectral curvature. The selection of bands that capture the shape of the spectral
    signature, based on this information, can enhance the differentiating power in
    classification or detection tasks. Likewise, Jung et al. [33] achieved an increase
    in accuracy using spectral differentiation and expansion of the input in the vertical
    direction of the raw data. This technique was applied in addition to SG smoothing
    (see Section 4.4) to further improve data quality. 5.2. Searching-based selection
    Searching-based band selection methods involve the creation of a criterion function
    such as Euclidean distance and Bhattacharyya distance [26] to evaluate the performance
    of each spectral band based on a specified optimization objective. The first step
    involves creating an initial subset of bands, followed by an assessment of the
    criterion function for the subset. The next step is applying a searching strategy
    to identify the best subset of bands that maximizes the criterion function, and
    evaluating the selected subset based on data classification performance. This
    iterative process continues until the desired level of performance is reached.
    Searching-based methods largely depend on the quality of the criterion function
    and the optimization strategy employed. Incremental searching [81], [57], updated
    searching [20], [62], and eliminating searching [68] are among the commonly utilized
    strategies. 5.3. Clustering-based selection Clustering-based methods for hyperspectral
    band selection group bands into clusters and select representative bands from
    each cluster to create a final subset. These algorithms can be unsupervised [27],
    [82], supervised [44] or semisupervised [66], [65]. The selection of representative
    bands is typically performed using information measurements, such as mutual information
    or Kullback–Leibler divergence. Commonly used clustering techniques are K-means,
    affinity propagation, and graph clustering. K-means selects the best cluster centers
    that minimize the sum of distances to a set of putative center candidates. Affinity
    propagation selects exemplars by considering the correlation or similarity among
    bands and the discriminative capability of each band. 5.4. Sparsity-based selection
    Sparsity-based techniques for band selection rely on sparse representation or
    regression to identify representative bands. The most common of these methods
    are discussed separately below. 5.4.1. Sparse nonnegative matrix factorization-based
    methods These methods [41] break down the hypercube into a set of building blocks,
    which are both nonnegative and sparsely encoded. This promotes a feature extraction
    process that combines these building blocks to create a parts-based representation
    of the original data. The goal of this method is to identify the most informative
    bands of the HSI data matrix by optimizing an objective function that includes
    sparsity constraints. 5.4.2. Sparse representation-based methods Sparse representation-based
    methods [86], [72] use pre-defined or learned dictionaries to select informative
    bands of the HSI data matrix based on their sparse coefficients. These methods
    rank the bands according to the frequency of their occurrence in the sparse coefficient
    histograms. In some cases, sparse representation-based methods can also be designed
    to solve multiple tasks simultaneously, and an immune clonal strategy can be used
    to search for the best combinations of informative bands. 5.4.3. Sparse regression-based
    methods Sparse regression-based techniques [69], [15] transform the band selection
    problem into a regression problem and estimate the most representative bands by
    solving a sparse regression problem. These methods can also include sparsity constraints
    to encourage the selection of only the most informative bands for the regression
    model. 5.5. Embedding-learning based selection Embedding-learning based methods
    aim to learn a low-dimensional representation of the spectral data, also known
    as an embedding, that captures the most salient features of the data. There are
    several types of embedding learning-based methods that can be used for band selection,
    including autoencoders [75], Deep Neural Networks (DNN) [87], and CNNs [61]. Autoencoders
    learn a compact representation of the input data by training a neural network
    to encode the input into a lower-dimensional space and then decode it back into
    the original space. DNN, on the other hand, consists of multiple layers of interconnected
    neurons. This architecture enables the network to learn complex patterns and features
    in a hierarchical manner, empowering it to extract high-level representations
    from the input data. Meanwhile, CNNs can learn spatially invariant features from
    image data. These techniques aim to learn a set of parameters that minimize an
    objective function that measures the model''s performance on a particular task,
    such as classification or target detection. Band selection is integrated into
    the optimization process by constraining the learning algorithm to focus on a
    subset of the available bands, or by assigning weights to each band that reflect
    its relevance to the task at hand. The resulting model can then be utilized to
    predict the class label of new samples or to detect the presence of specific targets
    in the image. For example, Chen et al. [13] employed a DNN based binary classification
    to identify the foreground and background regions of the HSI data. Subsequently,
    connected component labeling algorithms and edge contours were used to isolate
    the ROI from the image for further analysis. Moreover, Jia et al. [28] implemented
    a CNN-based band selection module that works based on a group convolution technique,
    which involves applying a 1×1 one-dimensional convolution (equivalent to a scalar
    multiplication) to each band of the input hyperspectral image independently. This
    technique helps to overcome the problem of mutual interference between different
    channels. The weights of the convolutional kernel are updated in the early stage
    of the network training using a loss function and an auxiliary classifier (see
    also the next Section 6). The weights represent the importance of each band, with
    a higher absolute value of weight indicating greater importance of the corresponding
    band. 5.6. Hybrid-scheme based selection Hybrid-scheme based methods involve combining
    multiple band selection techniques to select the most appropriate bands. A popular
    combination is clustering and ranking [84], [16], where clustering is used to
    group bands and ranking is used to select the most important bands within each
    cluster. Other hybrid methods combine clustering with searching or combine ranking
    with searching to further optimize band selection. 6. Network architecture design:
    feature extraction and classification The objective of neural network architecture
    design is to create a model that can effectively learn from the input data and
    generalize well to new, unseen data. In order to achieve this for HSI classification,
    a network architecture must be developed that can capture the complex spectral
    and spatial information present in the data. As an integral aspect of designing
    a neural network, the decision of the number of layers to use is a crucial one.
    While the inclusion of more layers in a network has been shown [76], [32] to improve
    performance, it can simultaneously present several challenges. A notable challenge
    arises from the potential occurrence of vanishing or exploding gradients [73],
    where the gradient signal becomes too small or too large as it backpropagates
    through the layers during training (see also Subsection 6.2.1). Such a phenomenon
    makes it difficult for the network to learn and adjust its weights effectively.
    Moreover, as the number of layers and parameters increases, the risk of overfitting
    rises, which is characterized by the network''s ability to perform exceptionally
    well on the training data, but not generalize well on unseen data. Consequently,
    the network may become computationally expensive to train and use due to its high
    processing power and memory requirements. Additionally, gradient computation time
    increases, thereby impeding the training''s efficiency. Hence, careful consideration
    of these challenges and trade-offs is imperative to designing a network that balances
    complexity and performance. For this review, we classified 3D-CNNs into hybrid
    and non-hybrid structures. A network is hybrid if it includes either specific
    module(s) that improve feature extraction, accuracy, and performance or if it
    integrates 2D-CNN within the 3D-CNN architecture. In the following, we present
    3D-CNN models for the classification of diseased and defected crop using HSI data.
    A summary of these architectures is also given in Table 1, Table 2. 6.1. Non-hybrid
    networks Nagasubramanian et al. [45] presented a 3D-CNN model to classify healthy
    and diseased crop. This model consists of two convolution layers with max pooling
    layers, and two Fully Connected (FC) layers, trained using the Adam optimizer.
    To prevent overfitting, dropout mechanisms were used after the first max pooling
    and first FC layer. A Weighted Binary Cross Entropy (WBCE) function of the form
    (4) was implemented to address imbalanced training data. Here y and represent
    binary variables for whether the ground truth and predicted result belong to a
    given class, respectively (see also Section 4.2 for a discussion on how to counteract
    imbalances in datasets). Using the coefficient β the WBCE loss function assigns
    higher weights to the minority class, for example, the false negatives rate decreases
    if β is set higher than 1, while setting it smaller than 1 reduces the false positive
    rate. Although the above technique can classify and detect diseased crop, detection
    of asymptomatic diseased crops at early stage and differentiating it from the
    healthy crops can be more challenging. In this respect, Jung et al. [33] developed
    a 3D-CNN model that improves classification accuracy of the asymptomatic diseased
    crop without modification and preprocessing of input HSI data. The model consists
    of four 3D convolution layers in which the first and fourth layers each are followed
    by a 3D max pooling layer and a batch normalization. The rest of the convolution
    layers are only followed by batch normalization. The output of the last 3D convolution
    layer is passed through a global average pooling and two dense layers. In Jung
    et al. [33] the results were improved further by preprocessing the input HSI data
    which went through spectral differentiation, vertical expansion, and smoothing.
    Automating the classification procedure of HSI data using software can effectively
    mitigate the time-consuming process of implementing a deep learning pipeline.
    In this respect, Gao et al. [19] developed an open-source software that classifies
    seeds at pixel level using 3D-CNN. Though at first it was developed for a specific
    crop (rice), the test experiments over other seeds are promising. This software
    utilizes a 3D-CNN that consists of two 3D convolution layers, with two and four
    3D convolution kernels for the first and second layers, respectively. The output
    is then flattened via one FC layer and classification is performed using a softmax
    function. However, this software as part of its feature extraction process does
    not consider the global feature relationship which can improve its ability to
    recognize and classify seeds accurately. Nguyen et al. [47] implemented a 3D-CNN
    for classification of a small size dataset. The feature extraction part is implemented
    based on AlexNet [36] and constitutes 5 convolutional layers followed by a flattening
    layer. The input layer takes an input of size 512×512×203, where 203 stands for
    number of bands. The first two convolutional layers are followed by a max pooling
    layer and a batch normalization. After that each convolutional layer is followed
    by a max pooling layer and after the last max pooling layer batch normalization
    and flattenings is applied before feeding the result into a RF or SVM for binary
    classification (healthy or diseased crop). 6.2. Hybrid networks 6.2.1. 3D-CNN
    architectures based on ResNet To address the challenges of vanishing or exploding
    gradients Qiao et al. [52] proposed to leverage residual convolutional blocks
    within a 3D deep ResNet architecture. This approach reduces the number of channels
    through the use of identity residual blocks and a convolutional residual blocks.
    The identity residual block maintains the same input and output dimensions, while
    the convolutional residual block changes the number of channels. The use of a
    l×l×l convolution kernel as the shortcut in the convolutional residual block reduces
    the number of parameters and computational complexity. To further improve efficiency,
    Qiao et al. [52] adopt a bottleneck structure, that reduces the number of required
    convolution operations. Each convolutional layer is followed by a batch normalization
    layer to prevent vanishing gradient and enhance convergence rate. The network
    uses Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) as the non-linear activation function, which
    addresses the problem of dying neurons in ReLU. In order to identify the appropriate
    hyperparameters, the authors employed a Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE)
    as an optimization algorithm. The TPE utilizes a probabilistic model to approximate
    the distribution of the objective function and guides the search for optimal hyperparameters.
    For the classification, a 7×7×1 global pooling layer and a FC are utilized. This
    model halves the number of parameters and improves the computational time up to
    10%. Moreover, the study of Pourdarbani et al. [50] over performance of well-known
    architectures in detection of defective crop demonstrates that residual connections
    achieve higher accuracy, while training faster despite having more parameters.
    6.2.2. Hypernet-PRMF network Liu et al. [42] presented a feature pre-extraction
    and a multi-feature fusion block to extract peanut characteristics from hyperspectral
    data. The feature pre-extraction includes constructing a Peanut Recognition Index
    (PRI) based on two informative bands to distinguish healthy, moldy, and damaged
    peanuts. The multi-feature fusion block is a technique used in image segmentation
    to fully extract spatial and spectral features from HSI data. This technique involves
    using multiple types of convolution kernels including 2D convolution for common
    texture features, separable convolution for increased feature diversity, depthwise
    convolution for band feature extraction, and 3D convolution for spectral change
    information. The convolutions are concatenated after normalization and activation
    functions to enhance diversity and improve recognition accuracy. Moreover, the
    authors employed feature pre-extraction and multi-feature fusion block techniques
    in their proposed peanut recognition model, called Hypernet-PRMF network. This
    model works at both peanut- and pixel-level recognition. The model consists of
    four parts: feature pre-extraction, down-sampling, up-sampling, and prediction.
    The feature pre-extraction part enhances the differentiation between different
    peanut features. The down-sampling part reduces the size of the image while increasing
    the number of convolution kernels, whereas the up-sampling part reconstructs the
    image while reducing the number of convolution kernels. The prediction works based
    on the softmax function and the class of maximum predicted probability is chosen
    as the final recognition result. The model achieves pixel-wise recognition accuracy
    with the use of the watershed segmentation algorithm. This technique has the potential
    to be employed for detection of other crops like sorghum. 6.2.3. Spectral dilated
    convolution 3D-CNN Cao et al. [10] proposed a spectral dilated convolution (SDC)-3D-CNN
    model to detect crop''s asymptomatic diseases at an early stage. This model consists
    of SDC modules along with residual blocks that prevent the gradient vanishing
    problem. SDC extends the idea of dilated convolution which expands the receptive
    field of convolution kernels without augmenting the model''s parameterization.
    Receptive field is the portion of the input space needed to create a filter at
    any convolutional layer. The 3D-SDC extends the receptive field of convolutional
    kernels to the spectral dimension. It works based on the principle of applying
    a filter to an input with intermittent intervals, which are dictated by the spectral
    dilation rate. The network was tested with top 50, 100, 150, and 200 significant
    wavelengths extracted by RF and Principal Components (PCs) of the same ranking
    by PCA along with different spectral dilation rate to detect healthy, asymptomatic,
    and symptomatic crop. The experiment result shows higher detection performance
    of the network using top the 50 important features extracted by RF at a dilation
    rate of 5. 6.2.4. Merged 2D- and 3D-CNN architectures Chen et al. [13] developed
    a 2D-3D-CNN for real-time crop defect detection. This network is the detection
    module of a real-time coffee-bean defect inspection algorithm (RT-CBDIA). The
    network consists of a 2D-CNN and a 3D-CNN, the former one is responsible to extract
    spatial features and the latter one is accountable for extraction of spectral
    features. Combining these two networks can boost feature extraction by providing
    robust and discriminative spectral-spatial features. The 3D-CNN is comprised of
    two convolution blocks with the same structure as in the 2D-CNN except that 3D
    convolutions and pooling layers are used. The two networks run simultaneously
    and their last pooling layers will be merged and fed to a FC layer and then a
    dropout layer to avoid overfitting. Finally, a softmax layer determines each crop
    health status. Likewise, Qi et al. [51] fully extracted spatial-spectral features
    by merging 2D- and 3D-CNN architectures using AttentionBlock [85] and Squeeze-and-Excitation
    (SE)-ResNet [25]. To accomplish this, the model first creates a neighborhood block
    of size 11×11×10 around a center pixel from the input image. Then, 2D convolution
    operations are used to extract spatial correlation features from the neighborhood
    block, and 3D convolution operations are used to capture spectral correlation
    features. The model uses four 2D convolutional layers and four 3D convolutional
    layers to capture feature maps of various spatial and spectral dimensions. By
    using different sizes of convolution kernels and downsampling steps, varied types
    of information can be captured. Finally, the extracted feature maps are fused
    together to create a final set of feature maps that contain valuable and pertinent
    information required for effective classification. Herein, AttentionBlock and
    SE-ResNet play important role, as outlined immediately below. An AttentionBlock
    is used to highlight important information in the fused spectral space feature
    map. It works by considering the similarity between each pixel in the feature
    map and weighting the relevant pixels with higher importance. This is achieved
    through a series of 2D convolutions with a kernel size of 1×1 to transform each
    pixel into an λ-dimensional vector, where λ represents the number of feature channels
    in the input tensor. The similarity between any two pixels is then calculated
    using the dot-product of their transformed vectors, and the results are weighted
    using a softmax function. The output of an AttentionBlockt is a feature map that
    emphasizes the relevant information while suppressing irrelevant information.
    This process allows AttentionBlocks to focus on the relevance between pixels in
    the entire feature map, rather than just the spatial range of the convolution
    kernel size used in traditional convolution and pooling operations. This results
    in better classification results with little computational complexity. In order
    to enhance the representational power of CNNs, SE modules as a type of attention
    mechanism can adaptively recalibrate the feature maps. It does so by capturing
    channel-wise feature dependencies through a squeeze operation, followed by an
    excitation operation that learns how to weight the importance of each feature
    map. This mechanism allows the model to pay more attention to salient channel
    features and disregards the less significant ones. By integrating AttentionBlocks
    and SE-ResNet, the network of Qi et al. [51] can better generalize in classification
    and achieve higher accuracy. Moreover, in the context of detection of two similar
    crop diseases that are indistinguishable to the naked eyes, a recent study by
    Jia et al. [28] developed a new network called Y-Net. The Y-Net model takes in
    10×10×203 hyperspectral data cubes as input and it consists of a channel attention
    mechanism, a band selection module with auxiliary classifier, a 3D-2D-CNN architecture,
    and a classification module. A CNN architecture is employed to conduct the band
    selection, where 1×1 1D convolutions are assembled to modify the parameters of
    the convolutional kernel in the early phase of the network training. The magnitude
    of the weight of the convolution kernel is indicative of the relevance of the
    band, with greater absolute weight values signifying more distinctive bands. The
    use of group convolution helps in preventing any hindrance from nearby bands,
    while the ReLU activation function is adopted for fast network convergence without
    the problem of saturation. The output of this step will be given to an auxiliary
    classifier that enables early-stage weight updating in the band selection block.
    The auxiliary classifier module updates the loss function of the Y-Net model:
    (5) where y is the ground truth label, is the predicted label, and θ and β are
    hyperparameters that control the trade-off between the two losses and the sparsity
    of the band selection module, respectively. is the weight of the band in the band
    selection module and n is the number of total bands. The loss is a combination
    of the cross entropy losses of the final classifier and the auxiliary classifier
    and the sum of the weights of the band selection module. The purpose of this combination
    is to control the classification accuracy while updating the weights of the band
    selection layer. The adjustment factor θ gradually decreases as the number of
    training iterations increases. The presence of this adjustment factor enables
    the Y-Net model to update the weights in the band selection module in the early
    stages of training and gradually shift towards training the final classifier to
    learn a more accurate classification model. Additionally, the auxiliary classifier
    helps to constrain the weight sparsity of the band selection module, ensuring
    that the score of unimportant features is close to zero. The results of Jia et
    al. [28] show that by removing nonessential and nondiscriminative bands the accuracy
    of the Y-Net model increases and reduces the model size and the number of parameters.
    Moreover, since the band selection module is integrated into an overall architecture,
    the training time does not significantly increase. 7. Visualization techniques
    for HSI classification decisions Visualization techniques can be employed to observe
    the contribution of pixels in the classification decision. These techniques allow
    us to identify the pixel locations associated with the most important spectral
    bands that play a crucial role in the final classification results. Saliency maps
    [64] are one of the essential and traditional visualization tools to identify
    the most sensitive regions (crucial pixels) in an image with respect to a model''s
    predictions. This technique works by computing the gradient of the output class
    score with respect to the input image. This gradient represents how much each
    pixel in the input image contributes to the final classification decision. Next,
    the absolute values of these gradients are summed across the channels to obtain
    a saliency map, which highlights the most salient regions of the input image for
    the predicted class. For example, Nagasubramanian et al. [45] discovered that
    saliency maps can help to locate the most sensitive pixel locations in infected
    crop images, which are often the severely infected areas. Conversely, both healthy
    and infected crop images had saliency map gradients that were primarily focused
    around the mid-region of the crop stem, highlighting the stem''s importance in
    crop classification. Moreover, Cao et al. [10] observed that the significant wavelengths
    extracted by RF from raw HSI data overlaps the saliency-sensitive wavelengths.
    More importantly, saliency maps can determine significant wavelengths for classification
    which are not extracted by RF. Another visual explanation technique for CNN decision
    is the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) [59]. It was introduced
    as an improvement over CAM [88]. CAM involves modifying a pre-existing CNN model
    by replacing the final FC layer with a global average pooling layer, which retains
    essential channel information while reducing the spatial dimensions. This modification
    enables the utilization of feature maps from the preceding layer. By applying
    learned weights to these feature maps through global average pooling, CAM generates
    a map that highlights the crucial regions associated with the predicted category.
    However, CAM provides a coarse localization of the important regions within an
    image. It highlights the regions that contribute most to the predicted class,
    but it does not provide precise boundaries of those regions. To address this limitation,
    Grad-CAM was introduced as an extension to CAM. Grad-CAM enhances the CAM approach
    by incorporating gradient information. Similar to CAM, Grad-CAM also utilizes
    a global average pooling layer after the last convolutional layer to obtain importance
    scores for each channel in the feature maps. However, instead of learning separate
    linear models for each class, Grad-CAM calculates the gradients of the predicted
    class score with respect to the feature maps. These gradients are used to weigh
    the feature maps and enables Grad-CAM to identify more intricate features that
    play a significant role in the classification decision. In addition, there are
    further statistical techniques that help in analyzing the importance of individual
    features (spectral bands) of HSI data in a classification. Light Gradient Boosting
    Machine (LightGBM) [34], [19] is one of such methods that uses decision trees
    in calculating feature importance. It builds decision trees in a leaf-wise manner,
    meaning that the algorithm grows the tree by adding new leaves one at a time which
    is computationally faster compared to level-wise approach by selecting the best
    split based on the maximum reduction in loss function for all leaves in the tree.
    Therefore, LightGBM calculates the importance of each feature by evaluating how
    much it contributes to the reduction in loss function across all trees. The feature
    importance score is calculated by summing up the number of times a feature is
    used to split the data across all trees, weighted by the improvement in accuracy
    achieved by each split. Features that are used more frequently and result in larger
    improvements in accuracy are assigned higher importance scores. 8. Discussion
    and conclusion In this study, we conducted a comprehensive review of 3D-CNN-based
    models applied in the domain of agriculture using non-UAV-based HSI data. Our
    analysis delved into diseased and defective crops, focusing on the structures
    and efficiencies of the models, the quantity of datasets utilized, and the necessary
    preprocessing steps. This review indicates the advantages of 3D-CNNs in capturing
    spatial-spectral information within hyperspectral data, enabling them to outperform
    1D- and 2D-CNN in hyperspectral image classification. With the aim of assisting
    computer vision experts and agriculture-domain researchers in tackling HSI classification
    tasks for crops experiencing stress, this comprehensive review provides valuable
    insights and guidance. In general, HSI holds great potential for detecting subtle
    changes in crop growth and development, making it a promising technique for diagnosing
    crop diseases and defects. Despite this potential, our study indicates that there
    is still limited research conducted that use 3D-CNNs in this context. Furthermore,
    the studies that are performed are often very application-specific and it is unknown
    how well the performed methods and models generalize to a broader range of applications.
    We identify three major challenges that must be overcome to achieve a broader
    adoption of HSI in general and the usage of 3D-CNN for HSI classification problems:
    limited availability of hyperspectral data, computational complexity of 3D-CNN
    models, and the costs of hyperspectral imaging hardware. In the following we address
    each of these challenges in more detail and offer ideas on how to overcome or
    avoid them. Limited availability of varied hyperspectral data on diseased and
    defective crops presents a significant challenge for researchers, farmers, and
    stakeholders in the agriculture industry who rely on data to make informed decisions.
    The lack of data in this area of the research hampers efforts to understand the
    extent of the problem and develop effective solutions. It makes it difficult to
    track the progress and success of any initiatives aimed at improving crop health
    and reducing the prevalence of disease and defects. To address this issue, there
    is a need for increased investment in data collection and data sharing, as it
    has been done in the past, for example, for RGB-data (e.g., Beck et al. [4], [3]).
    Large-scale HSI data collection and publicly available datasets will allow research
    groups to develop the next generation of models, even if they have no access to
    the otherwise required hardware and plant material. Even with small datasets there
    are also techniques to models beyond the specific application case they had been
    trained on. In recent years, transfer learning and active learning techniques
    have been increasingly used together to tackle the challenges posed by limited
    data. By leveraging knowledge from pre-existing models, transfer learning can
    enhance the accuracy of models trained on limited HSI data. On the other hand,
    active learning involves selecting and annotating informative samples to improve
    the effectiveness of models trained on small HSI datasets. By combining the two
    techniques, transfer learning and active learning can address the bottleneck of
    limited HSI data and enable the development of robust 3D-CNN models capable of
    accurately classifying HSI data. The computational complexity of 3D-CNN models
    is a barrier for their deployment in the field, for example, in edge computing
    devices or even as part of an embedded system in UAVs or agricultural equipment.
    Real-time diagnosis could significantly enable farmers to quickly detect and respond
    to disease outbreaks, which can help to prevent the spread of disease and reduce
    crop losses. This requires, however, researchers to explore ways to optimize their
    models for speed and efficiency, particularly their memory-footprint. This can
    be achieved through advancing the capabilities of single board computers, particularly
    their GPU and AI accelerators, on the one side, as well as developing lightweight
    models on the other side, for example, by reduction of used bands or grouping
    of bands into indices. Identifying the spectral bands that are most informative
    for detecting a varied range of diseases and defects would play an important role
    in reducing the model''s training computational time, decreasing the number of
    parameters, achieving higher accuracy and generating a more lightweight model.
    Despite the valuable insights hyperspectral imaging provides regarding the condition
    and health of crops, deploying this technology is relatively costly compared to
    RGB and multispectral imaging technologies. The higher expense is primarily attributed
    to the increased processing power required to analyze the HSI data and the extensive
    range of spectrum offered by hyperspectral cameras. One approach to consider for
    cost reduction is the limitation of the number of bands in hyperspectral cameras,
    as not all spectral bands may be equally crucial for disease and defect detection.
    Therefore, instead of having an imaging device that supports full range of wavelengths
    from the visible to the infrared spectrum, we can deploy imaging systems that
    work with essential wavelengths rather than hundreds of spectral bands. In this
    respect, some companies already provide the facility to design customized multispectral
    systems, which work with bands that had been identified to be the most discriminative
    (see Hamila et al. [22] for a 3D-CNN model training advantage of this approach).
    Therefore, developing methods for identifying the most informative spectral bands
    would also be cost beneficial. Furthermore, by leveraging Machine Learning as
    a Service (MLaaS) platforms [48], the need for required infrastructure to process
    HSI data using 3D-CNN can be eliminated. Additionally, leading MLaaS providers
    can integrate pre-built 3D-CNN models into their offerings for training HSI data,
    thereby reducing the time and effort required for model development, especially
    for individuals in the agriculture domain who may have limited machine learning
    expertise. In summary, the application of 3D-CNNs with hyperspectral data for
    disease and defective crop detection is a promising research area with several
    open research questions. Collecting and sharing HSI data on scale, identifying
    informative spectral bands, developing transfer and active learning techniques,
    and implementing light-weight architectures are some of the key research areas
    that can be considered for future work. The advancement of this research will
    lead to more accurate and efficient disease and defective crop detection, which
    can have significant impacts on the agricultural industry. CRediT authorship contribution

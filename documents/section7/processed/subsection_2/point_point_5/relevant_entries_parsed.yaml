  explanation: The excerpt focuses on advanced monitoring techniques for automated
    irrigation systems in the context of ensuring system reliability in large-scale
    deployments. It highlights the use of real-time system health assessment and data
    analysis for proactive maintenance and fault detection. The goal is to enhance
    the robustness and reliability of the automated irrigation system, enabling continuous
    monitoring and timely intervention.
  extract_1: Traditionally, detecting faults in wireless networks depended on human
    operators analyzing and interpreting alerts, based on fixed thresholds that activated
    alarms when limits were exceeded. These were not suitable for automated irrigation
    systems, which require autonomous operation and immediate fault detection and
    remediation to prevent damage or water waste. Therefore, automated fault detection
    techniques were developed to monitor field devices and network performance data
    in order to extract important patterns and detect faults in real time.
  extract_2: By using automated fault detection techniques, it is possible to reduce
    or even eliminate downtime, improve efficiency, and reduce the maintenance costs
    associated with irrigation systems. This technique includes periodic checks of
    equipment, monitoring system performance, analyzing historical data to identify
    patterns or trends, and predicting future events. These techniques not only help
    in detecting faults but also in preventing them by identifying potential problems
    before they occur.

  explanation: 'This review summarizes the various methodologies and applications
    of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in analyzing and classifying hyperspectral
    images for agricultural purposes. Hyperspectral imaging is a non-destructive and
    contactless technology that provides valuable information about the structure

    data can make it challenging to process, analyze, and classify. 3D-CNNs are a
    type of deep learning model that have proven to be effective in handling such
    high-dimensional data.


    The review highlights the challenges associated with using 2D-CNN and 1D-CNN models
    for hyperspectral image classification, including their inability to fully capture
    the spatial-spectral information present in the data. 3D-CNNs, on the other hand,
    can effectively utilize both the spatial and spectral dimensions of the data,

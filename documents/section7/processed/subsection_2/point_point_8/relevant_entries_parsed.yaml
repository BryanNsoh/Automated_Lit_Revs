  key_findings: '1. Farmers in Jizan, Saudi Arabia, have a significant association
    between their awareness of IoT technologies and their perception of the benefits.

    2. The perceived benefits of IoT technologies have a moderate positive relationship
    with farmers'' willingness to adopt IoT technologies for crop monitoring.

    3. Access to information, training, and the perception of government support also
    have a positive influence on adoption.'
  key_findings_evaluation: null
  limitations: 'Limited scope, as the study focuses specifically on a particular region
    and crop monitoring practices in the context of IoT technology adoption.

    Methodological issues, such as the sample size, sampling technique, and potential
    for bias during data collection, could impact the generalizability of the findings.

    Dated information, as the study was conducted in 2023 and there may have been
    advancements and changes in the field of IoT technology adoption in agriculture
    since then.'
  main_objective: To investigate the perception and adoption of automated systems
    that utilize IoT technologies for crop monitoring among farmers in Jizan, Saudi
    Arabia.

  data_sources: Data from automated irrigation systems, such as sensor data, weather
    data, and soil moisture data.
  explanation: This study on spatial visualization of automated irrigation systems
    aims to provide a methodology for visually representing the health and status
    of such systems using GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and cartographic techniques.
    This approach enables users to visualize various aspects of irrigation systems,
    including data and information, on interactive maps and dashboards. The study
    demonstrates the potential of using heuristic spaces to represent different types
    of stakeholders and their relationships within the ISO management system.
  extract_1: The paper suggests using spatial visualization techniques, such as interactive
    dashboards and augmented reality, to present system health information in an intuitive
    and actionable format.
  extract_2: The study demonstrates the potential of using heuristic spaces to represent
    different types of stakeholders and their relationships within the ISO management

  key_findings: The study demonstrates the potential of using heuristic spaces to
    represent different types of stakeholders and their relationships within the ISO
    management system. The proposed visualization method can help users to quickly
    and easily identify and understand the health and status of automated irrigation
    systems, which can enable them to make informed decisions about system management.
  limitations: The study does not provide a practical implementation or evaluation
    of the proposed visualization method within a real-world irrigation system.
  main_objective: To propose a methodology for visually representing the health and
    status of automated irrigation systems using GIS (Geographic Information Systems)
    and cartographic techniques.
  relevance_evaluation: The study is relevant to the point of focus on employing advanced
    data visualization techniques to present system health information in an intuitive
    and actionable format, as it proposes a method for visualizing and presenting
    complex data from automated irrigation systems using interactive dashboards and
    augmented reality.

    \ has witnessed signiﬁcant advancements in\ntechnology, paving the way for improved\
    \ monitoring and management practices. One\nsuch technological innovation that\
    \ holds great promise is the use of Internet of Things (IoT)\ntechnologies for\
    \ monitoring crop health, growth, and yield prediction. The integration\nof IoT\
    \ devices, sensors, and data analytics offers new possibilities for farmers to\
    \ gain\nreal-time insights into their crops and make informed decisions for optimizing\
    \ agricultural\nproductivity [1,2].\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541. https://doi.org/10.3390/su151914541\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n\
    2 of 19\nAgricultural productivity cannot be overstated when it comes to the importance\
    \ of\ncrop monitoring. In order for farmers to make informed decisions concerning\
    \ irrigation,\nfertilization, pest control, and other agronomic practices, accurate\
    \ and timely information\nabout crop health, growth, and yield potential is necessary\
    \ [3]. There has been a long\nhistory of crop monitoring that relies on manual\
    \ observation and a limited range of sam-\npling methods, which often results\
    \ in inadequate resource allocation and a reduction in\nproductivity. This is\
    \ in spite of the fact that farmers have been able to access continuous\nand detailed\
    \ information about their crops as a result of IoT technologies, enabling them\
    \ to\npractice precision agriculture [4].\nIn agriculture, IoT technologies have\
    \ the potential to offer a number of beneﬁts. As a\nﬁrst step, IoT enables farmers\
    \ to collect real-time data on the health and growth of their\ncrops, allowing\
    \ them to gain valuable insights about them. This allows for proactive inter-\n\
    vention and timely adjustments in irrigation, nutrient application, and pest management\n\
    strategies. Secondly, IoT technologies enhance the accuracy of yield prediction\
    \ models\nby capturing detailed data on environmental conditions, crop physiology,\
    \ and growth\npatterns [5]. Accurate yield prediction enables better planning\
    \ and resource allocation,\noptimizing overall agricultural productivity.\nMoreover,\
    \ IoT technologies facilitate resource management in agriculture by optimiz-\n\
    ing the use of water, energy, and fertilizers. By monitoring soil moisture, temperature,\n\
    and nutrient levels, IoT systems can provide precise recommendations for irrigation\
    \ and\nfertilization, reducing waste and the environmental impact [6]. Additionally,\
    \ IoT-based\nmonitoring can help to identify pest infestations and diseases at\
    \ early stages, enabling\ntargeted interventions and minimizing crop losses [4].\n\
    The Vision 2030 of Saudi Arabia aims to diversify the country’s economy and reduce\n\
    its oil dependence. Agri-food sustainability is the focus of the plan. The achievement\
    \ of\nthese goals will be dependent on technological advancements and innovations.\
    \ The Centre\nfor the Development of Agricultural Techniques (CDAT) is a research,\
    \ development, and\ntechnology adoption center established to promote agricultural\
    \ research, development, and\ntechnology adoption. In order to achieve this aim,\
    \ advanced farming techniques must be\nimplemented, water resources should be\
    \ conserved, and agricultural productivity must\nbe improved. AgTech Investments:\
    \ There has been a lot of investment in agricultural\ntechnology startups and\
    \ innovations in Saudi Arabia. A large portion of these investments\nare targeted\
    \ towards fostering technological advancements in various aspects of agricultural\n\
    production, such as crop monitoring and the optimization of yield.\nThe objective\
    \ of this research is to explore the perception and adoption of IoT tech-\nnologies\
    \ for crop monitoring among farmers in Jizan, Saudi Arabia. Jizan, located in\
    \ the\nsouthwestern region of Saudi Arabia, is known for its diverse agricultural\
    \ activities and\nis a prime area for investigating the potential of IoT technologies\
    \ in improving farming\npractices. By understanding the perceptions, challenges,\
    \ and adoption intentions of farmers\nin Jizan regarding IoT-based crop monitoring,\
    \ valuable insights can be gained to enhance\nthe implementation and effectiveness\
    \ of these technologies in the local agricultural context.\nA major objective\
    \ of this study is to determine how much awareness farmers in Jizan\nhave regarding\
    \ the use of IoT technologies for crop monitoring and what the level of\nawareness\
    \ is. What are the perceived beneﬁts associated with adopting these technologies?\n\
    What is the intention of farmers to adopt IoT technologies for crop monitoring\
    \ in the future?\nAdditionally, this study will explore farmers’ preferred IoT\
    \ technologies, their perception\nof government support, access to information,\
    \ and training resources.\nBy investigating these aspects, this research aims\
    \ to contribute to the existing knowl-\nedge on the use of IoT technologies for\
    \ crop monitoring and provide valuable insights\nfor policymakers, agricultural\
    \ practitioners, and technology providers in Jizan, Saudi Ara-\nbia. The ﬁndings\
    \ of this study will help to identify the factors inﬂuencing the successful\n\
    implementation and adoption of IoT-based crop monitoring solutions, ultimately\
    \ leading\nto improved agricultural practices, enhanced productivity, and sustainable\
    \ farming in\nthe region. In this research paper, we aim to explore the perception\
    \ and adoption of IoT\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n3 of 19\ntechnologies for\
    \ monitoring crop health, growth, and yield prediction among farmers in\nJizan,\
    \ Saudi Arabia, by understanding the awareness, beneﬁts, and adoption intentions\
    \ of\nfarmers regarding IoT technologies in the region.\n2. Literature Review\n\
    In recent years, IoT technologies have gained substantial attention for crop monitoring\n\
    due to the fact that they have the potential to revolutionize agriculture by enabling\
    \ the\nprovision of real-time data on crop health, growth, and yield prediction\
    \ [7,8]. This emerging\nﬁeld offers promising opportunities for farmers to optimize\
    \ resource management, enhance\nproductivity, and make data-driven decisions for\
    \ sustainable farming practices. However,\nthe adoption and successful implementation\
    \ of IoT technologies in agriculture depend on\nmultiple factors that can vary\
    \ across different regions and contexts.\nIoT technologies have been shown to\
    \ have a number of beneﬁts in agriculture in\nprevious research. In the study\
    \ conducted by [7] in a different geographical context, it was\nfound that farmers\
    \ were able to collect precise and timely information about environmental\nfactors\
    \ such as soil moisture, temperature, and other elements through the use of IoT-based\n\
    monitoring systems. This enhanced data availability allowed farmers to optimize\
    \ irrigation\nschedules, resulting in improved water efﬁciency and increased crop\
    \ yields. Similarly,\nref. [8] emphasized the potential of IoT technologies in\
    \ crop yield prediction, demonstrating\ntheir ability to integrate data from multiple\
    \ sensors and provide accurate predictions for\ninformed decision-making.\nIn\
    \ Pathmudi et al. [9], IoT is considered a modern technology comprising physical\n\
    entities that communicate over the Internet with one another. The Internet of\
    \ Things is\neverywhere. Globally, connected systems/organizations are driving\
    \ the growth of IoT\ndevices [10]. Ref. [11] developed an irrigation management\
    \ system that uses the Internet of\nThings. There was a discussion of various\
    \ IoT architectures, deployment models, sensors,\nand controllers that are used\
    \ in agriculture today, cloud platforms for IoT, irrigation\nscheduling software,\
    \ and machine-learning algorithms that allow us to predict real-time\nirrigation\
    \ water demand in the future [12]. A system of automated monitoring of the\nsoil–plant–atmospheric\
    \ continuum at a high spatiotemporal resolution is being developed\nto replace\
    \ the current labor-intensive, experience-based methods of agricultural decision-\n\
    making with a data-driven approach based on data collected by automated monitoring\
    \ [13].\nIt is proposed to develop an Internet of Things (IoT) framework that\
    \ consists of wireless\nsensor networks with intelligent algorithms based on an\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) approach\nthat increases food production while combating\
    \ climatic change [14]. An IoT system\ncould be used for agricultural automation\
    \ and could be governed by a variety of protocol\ncommunications that are used\
    \ to describe its rules. Several factors must be considered\nwhen analyzing parameters\
    \ such as the speed at which data are transferred, the mechanism\nby which data\
    \ are transferred, the encryption level, range, latency, and number of items\n\
    controlled when analyzing parameters.\nIt has been proven that agriculturalists\
    \ and farmers can take advantage of the Internet\nof Things (IoT) not only in\
    \ order to enhance the efﬁciency with which they are able to\ngrow crops and to\
    \ make them more proﬁtable but also to improve their post-harvest\nprocesses and\
    \ the end users’ experience with agricultural products [15]. Furthermore, one\n\
    of the most effective uses of the IoT for agriculture involves implementing technologies\n\
    such as drones for agriculture through the use of the IoT [16], remote sensing\
    \ [17], smart\ngreenhouses [18], smart livestock management [19], computer imaging\
    \ [20], and efﬁcient\nclimate monitoring [21] as indicated in Figure 1.\nSustainability\

    can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence farmers’ attitudes, awareness, and willingness to adopt\
    \ IoT\ntechnologies for crop monitoring and management.\nUnderstanding the speciﬁc\
    \ factors that inﬂuence the adoption intentions of farmers in\nJizan is crucial\
    \ for the successful implementation and utilization of IoT technologies in the\n\
    region’s agricultural sector. Factors such as farmers’ level of awareness, perceived\

    \ support play a\nsigniﬁcant role in shaping their attitudes towards adopting\
    \ these technologies. However,\nthe literature lacks empirical evidence and insights\
    \ into these factors in the context of Jizan.\nTo address this research gap, this\

    \ for crop monitoring among farmers in Jizan, Saudi Arabia. By\nconducting surveys\
    \ and analyzing the collected data, this research will provide valuable\ninsights\
    \ into the speciﬁc factors inﬂuencing farmers’ adoption intentions and inform\
    \ the\ndevelopment of strategies to promote the successful integration of IoT\
    \ technologies in\nJizan’s agricultural practices.\n2.2. Level of Awareness of\
    \ IoT Technologies in Agriculture\nIt has become increasingly apparent in recent\
    \ years that IoT technologies can be used\nfor improving agricultural productivity\
    \ and efﬁciency. IoT technologies offer numerous\nopportunities for enhancing\
    \ crop monitoring, improving productivity, and optimizing\nresource management\
    \ in the agricultural sector. This section discusses the evolving level\nof awareness\
    \ among farmers and stakeholders regarding the potential beneﬁts of IoT\ntechnologies\
    \ in agriculture.\nUsing IoT technologies, the authors of [8] argue that farmers\
    \ will be able to make\nmore informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources\
    \ in order to maximize crop\nhealth and growth during the growing season. The\
    \ study highlights the importance of\ncreating awareness among farmers about the\
    \ capabilities and beneﬁts of IoT technologies.\nSimilarly, [30] emphasize the\
    \ role of IoT-based crop growth monitoring systems in enabling\nfarmers to monitor\
    \ key parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient levels,\nleading\
    \ to improved crop management practices.\nIn a survey conducted by [31], it was\
    \ found that a majority of farmers had some level\nof awareness regarding IoT-based\
    \ smart agriculture. However, the study also revealed\nvariations in awareness\
    \ levels across different regions and farm sizes. This suggests the\nimportance\
    \ of tailoring awareness campaigns and educational initiatives to speciﬁc contexts\n\
    and target groups.\nThe authors discuss the importance of bridging the digital\
    \ divide and ensuring equal\naccess to information and resources related to IoT\
    \ technologies in agriculture. They empha-\nsize the need to address technological\
    \ literacy and provide adequate training and support\nto farmers to enhance their\
    \ awareness and adoption of IoT solutions.\n2.3. The Adoption of IoT Technologies\
    \ in Agriculture\nThe adoption of IoT (Internet of Things) technologies in the\
    \ agricultural sector has\ngained signiﬁcant attention in recent years. Farmers\
    \ are increasingly recognizing the\npotential beneﬁts of using IoT technologies\
    \ for monitoring crop health, growth, and yield\nprediction. This section explores\
    \ the adoption of IoT technologies among farmers and\nhighlights key factors inﬂuencing\
    \ their adoption decisions.\nA study conducted by [32] among farmers in the United\
    \ States found that 70% of the\nrespondents were aware of IoT technologies and\
    \ expressed a positive attitude toward their\nadoption. This indicates a growing\
    \ interest and acceptance of IoT technologies among\nfarmers.\nThe adoption of\
    \ IoT technologies is inﬂuenced by various factors. One crucial factor\nis the\
    \ perceived beneﬁts of using these technologies. Research by [30] demonstrated\
    \ that\nfarmers perceive IoT technologies as beneﬁcial for the real-time monitoring\
    \ of crop health,\nenabling proactive decision-making and optimizing resource\
    \ allocation. The ability to\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n6 of 19\nobtain\
    \ accurate and timely information about crop conditions and environmental factors\
    \ is\nseen as a signiﬁcant advantage of IoT technologies [33].\nHowever, there\
    \ are also challenges associated with the adoption of IoT technologies\nin agriculture.\
    \ Limited technical knowledge and skills to operate IoT devices have been\nidentiﬁed\
    \ as a barrier to adoption [34]. Farmers may require training and support to\n\
    effectively utilize IoT technologies in their farming practices. Additionally,\
    \ concerns about\ndata privacy and security pose challenges to adoption. Farmers\
    \ want assurance that their\ndata will be protected and not misused [2,35].\n\
    Government support plays a crucial role in facilitating the adoption of IoT technologies\n\
    in agriculture. Policies and initiatives that promote the use of IoT technologies\
    \ and provide\nﬁnancial incentives can positively inﬂuence farmers’ adoption decisions.\
    \ Research by [36]\nshowed that farmers who perceived strong government support\
    \ were more likely to adopt\nIoT technologies.\nMoreover, the availability of\
    \ information and training resources is vital for successful\nadoption. Farmers\
    \ need access to reliable and relevant information about IoT technologies,\ntheir\
    \ beneﬁts, and how to effectively implement them. Training programs and workshops\n\
    can enhance farmers’ understanding and competence in utilizing IoT technologies\
    \ for crop\nmonitoring [37–39].\n2.4. Perceived Beneﬁts of IoT Technologies\n\
    The perception of beneﬁts of IoT (Internet of Things) technologies in agriculture\
    \ plays\na signiﬁcant role in determining their adoption. Farmers are increasingly\
    \ recognizing the\npotential advantages that IoT technologies offer for monitoring\
    \ crop health, optimizing\nresource allocation, and improving overall agricultural\
    \ productivity.\nReal-time monitoring and data collection: One of the key perceived\
    \ beneﬁts of IoT\ntechnologies is the ability to monitor crop conditions and collect\
    \ data in real time. IoT de-\nvices equipped with sensors can provide farmers\
    \ with accurate and up-to-date information\nabout soil moisture levels, temperature,\
    \ humidity, and other environmental factors. There\nis a growing need for farmers\
    \ to be given access to data in real-time so that they can make\ngood decisions\
    \ regarding irrigation, fertilization, and pest control and thus improve crop\n\
    health and maximize resource utilization [30,33].\nProactive decision-making:\
    \ IoT technologies enable farmers to take a proactive ap-\nproach to agricultural\
    \ management. By continuously monitoring crop health and environ-\nmental conditions,\
    \ farmers can identify potential issues or anomalies early on and take\nnecessary\
    \ actions to mitigate risks. For example, if a sensor detects a sudden drop in\
    \ soil\nmoisture levels, the system can automatically trigger an irrigation schedule\
    \ adjustment or\nsend an alert to the farmer, allowing for prompt intervention\
    \ and preventing potential crop\ndamage [34].\nYield prediction and crop planning:\
    \ IoT technologies also contribute to yield pre-\ndiction and crop planning. Through\
    \ data analysis and machine-learning algorithms, IoT\nsystems can generate insights\
    \ and forecasts regarding crop yield potential. This information\nenables farmers\
    \ to plan their harvesting, storage, and marketing activities more effectively.\n\
    Additionally, yield prediction helps farmers estimate their future produce, allowing\
    \ for\nbetter ﬁnancial planning and decision-making [36].\n2.5. Willingness to\
    \ Adopt IoT Technologies\nThe willingness to adopt IoT (Internet of Things) technologies\
    \ is a critical factor in the\nsuccessful implementation and integration of these\
    \ technologies in the agricultural sector.\nThis section explores the factors\
    \ inﬂuencing farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies\nand the potential\
    \ beneﬁts associated with their adoption.\nPerceived usefulness: Farmers’ perception\
    \ of the usefulness of IoT technologies sig-\nniﬁcantly inﬂuences their willingness\
    \ to adopt them. Studies have shown that farmers\nare more likely to adopt IoT\
    \ technologies when they perceive them as valuable tools that\ncan enhance their\
    \ farming practices and decision-making processes. The perceived useful-\nSustainability\
    \ 2023, 15, 14541\n7 of 19\nness of IoT technologies stems from their ability\
    \ to provide real-time data on crop health,\noptimize resource management, and\
    \ improve overall agricultural productivity [30,33].\nPerceived ease of use: The\
    \ perceived ease of use refers to farmers’ perception of\nhow easy it is to learn\
    \ and operate IoT technologies. Farmers are more likely to adopt\nIoT technologies\
    \ when they perceive them as user-friendly and accessible. Factors such\nas the\
    \ simplicity of the interface, ease of installation and maintenance, and availability\n\
    of training and technical support inﬂuence farmers’ perception of the ease of\
    \ use. User-\nfriendly IoT technologies increase farmers’ conﬁdence in their ability\
    \ to adopt and utilize\nthese technologies effectively [2,34].\n2.6. Access to\
    \ Information and Training, Perception of Government Support\nAccess to information\
    \ and training, as well as the perception of government support,\nare important\
    \ factors that inﬂuence farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies in our\n\
    targeted area. Here, we explore the impact of these factors on farmers’ adoption\
    \ decisions\nbased on recent studies conducted from 2020 onward.\nAccess to information\
    \ and training: Farmers’ access to relevant information and train-\ning on IoT\
    \ technologies is crucial for their successful adoption. Studies have shown that\n\
    farmers who have access to comprehensive information and training programs are\
    \ more\nlikely to adopt and effectively use IoT technologies in their farming\
    \ practices. Accessi-\nble information channels, such as agricultural extension\
    \ services, workshops, seminars,\nand online resources, contribute to farmers’\
    \ understanding of the potential beneﬁts and\nfunctionalities of IoT technologies.\
    \ Training programs that provide hands-on experience\nand technical knowledge\
    \ further enhance farmers’ conﬁdence and competency in utilizing\nthese technologies\
    \ [8,40].\nPerception of government support: Farmers’ perception of government\
    \ support plays\na signiﬁcant role in their decision to adopt IoT technologies.\
    \ When farmers perceive that\nthe government actively supports the adoption and\
    \ implementation of IoT technologies\nin agriculture, they are more likely to\
    \ embrace these technologies. Government support\ncan take various forms, including\
    \ ﬁnancial incentives, subsidies, policy frameworks, and\nthe establishment of\
    \ dedicated support programs. The perception of government support\ncreates a\
    \ favorable environment for farmers, instilling conﬁdence and reducing potential\n\
    barriers to adoption. It also signals the government’s commitment to the modernization\
    \ of\nthe agricultural sector and the promotion of sustainable farming practices\
    \ [6,41].\nIn our targeted area, the availability of relevant and up-to-date information\
    \ on IoT\ntechnologies through government initiatives and agricultural extension\
    \ services is vital.\nFarmers should have access to training programs that provide\
    \ them with the necessary\nskills and knowledge to effectively use IoT technologies\
    \ for crop monitoring. Additionally,\nthe government should demonstrate a supportive\
    \ stance by offering ﬁnancial assistance,\nsubsidies, and policy measures that\
    \ incentivize the adoption of IoT technologies in agri-\nculture. These efforts\
    \ foster a positive perception of government support, encouraging\nfarmers to\
    \ embrace IoT technologies and integrate them into their farming operations [42].\n\
    2.7. Research Gap\nDespite the growing body of research on the use of IoT technologies\
    \ in agriculture,\nthere is still a notable gap when it comes to understanding\
    \ the perception and adoption of\nthese technologies among farmers in speciﬁc\
    \ regions, such as Jizan, Saudi Arabia. Most of\nthe existing studies have focused\
    \ on general discussions of IoT applications in agriculture\nor have examined\
    \ adoption patterns in different geographical contexts [8,43]. However, the\n\
    speciﬁc factors inﬂuencing the perception and adoption of IoT technologies in\
    \ the context\nof Jizan’s agricultural sector remain largely unexplored.\nJizan,\
    \ located in the southwestern region of Saudi Arabia, has its own unique agricul-\n\
    tural landscape, characterized by speciﬁc climatic conditions, crop varieties,\
    \ and farming\npractices. These contextual factors can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence farmers’\
    \ attitudes, awareness,\nand willingness to adopt IoT technologies for crop monitoring\
    \ and management. Therefore,\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n8 of 19\nit is crucial\
    \ to conduct region-speciﬁc studies to bridge the gap in knowledge and provide\n\
    insights that are tailored to the needs and challenges faced by farmers in Jizan.\n\
    By conducting a focused investigation on the perception and adoption of IoT tech-\n\
    nologies for crop monitoring among farmers in Jizan, this study aims to ﬁll this\
    \ gap in\nthe literature. It is hoped that the ﬁndings will allow us to better\
    \ understand the speciﬁc\nfactors that inﬂuence the adoption intentions of farmers\
    \ in Jizan. These factors include the\nfarmers’ level of awareness, their perception\
    \ of the beneﬁts, and their perception of the\nchallenges associated with IoT,\
    \ as well as their perception of the government’s support.\nThis knowledge can\
    \ inform the development of targeted strategies and policies to promote\nthe successful\
    \ implementation and utilization of IoT technologies in Jizan’s agricultural\n\
    sector.\nObjective and Hypothesis\nObjective 1: To examine the association between\
    \ farmers’ level of awareness of IoT\ntechnologies and their perception of the\
    \ beneﬁts.\nHypothesis 1. There is a signiﬁcant association between farmers’ level\
    \ of awareness of IoT\ntechnologies and their perception of the beneﬁts.\nObjective\
    \ 2: To assess the inﬂuence of perceived beneﬁts of using IoT technologies for\n\
    crop monitoring on farmers’ willingness to adopt these technologies.\nHypothesis\
    \ 2. The perceived beneﬁts of using IoT technologies for crop monitoring have\
    \ a signiﬁ-\ncant and positive inﬂuence on farmers’ willingness to adopt these\
    \ technologies.\nObjective 3: To explore the inﬂuence of access to information\
    \ and training, as well as\nthe perception of government support, on farmers’\
    \ willingness to adopt IoT technologies.\nHypothesis 3. The access to information\
    \ and training and perception of government support have\na positive inﬂuence\
    \ on farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies.\n3. Methodology\n3.1. Research\
    \ Design\nIt is the aim of this research study to identify the factors that inﬂuence\
    \ farmers in Jizan,\nSaudi Arabia, to adopt Internet of Things (IoT) technologies\
    \ for crop monitoring using the\nquantitative method as part of the research design.\
    \ In quantitative research, numerical data\nare collected and analyzed in a systematic\
    \ way, with the objective of testing hypotheses\nand drawing objective conclusions\
    \ based on the statistical analysis of the data.\n3.2. Sampling Technique\nAn\
    \ examination of a representative sample of farmers in Jizan was conducted by\
    \ using\na sampling technique based on stratiﬁcation. Based on relevant criteria\
    \ such as farm size,\nfarming experience, and geographic location, the population\
    \ of the study was divided\ninto distinct strata, which were categorized according\
    \ to relevant factors. To ensure that a\nproportionally representative sample\
    \ of each subgroup was selected, a random sampling\nalgorithm was used within\
    \ each stratum in order to select participants.\n3.3. Data Collection\nData were\
    \ collected through a structured questionnaire administered to the selected\n\
    sample of farmers. The questionnaire consists of multiple-choice and Likert scale\
    \ items\nto gather both demographic information and respondents’ perceptions,\
    \ attitudes, and\nbehaviors related to the adoption of IoT technologies for crop\
    \ monitoring. The questionnaire\nwas pre-tested with a pilot group of farmers\
    \ to ensure clarity and validity.\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n9 of 19\n3.4.\
    \ Data Analysis\nTo address the research objectives and test the hypotheses that\
    \ have been proposed,\nthe collected data have been analyzed using appropriate\
    \ statistical methods. In order to\nsummarize the demographic information and\
    \ the responses from the participants, descrip-\ntive statistics such as frequencies\
    \ and percentages were used. Correlations, associations,\nand yield predictions\
    \ were all examined by using inferential statistical techniques, such as\nreliability\
    \ analysis, correlation tests, and regression analysis.\nAccording to methodology,\
    \ we aim to gather reliable and representative data that can\ncontribute to a\
    \ comprehensive understanding of the factors inﬂuencing the adoption of IoT\n\
    technologies for crop monitoring among farmers in Jizan, Saudi Arabia.\n4. Results\n\
    Descriptive statistics were calculated to provide an overview of a variety of\
    \ charac-\nteristics related to the demographics of the participants, as well\
    \ as their perceptions and\nbehaviors in relation to the use of the IoT for crop\
    \ monitoring technologies. Frequencies\nand percentages were computed to present\
    \ the distribution and central tendencies of the\nvariables under investigation.\
    \ In addition to hypothesis testing, other relevant ﬁndings\nemerged from the\
    \ data analysis. These ﬁndings provide further insights into the factors\ninﬂuencing\
    \ the adoption of IoT technologies for crop monitoring among farmers in Jizan,\n\
    Saudi Arabia. The results highlight patterns, trends, and relationships that are\
    \ important\nin understanding the research topic. This study has some limitations\
    \ that need to be ac-\nknowledged in order for the results to be reliable. Among\
    \ the limitations of the study\nare the constraints on sample size, the possibility\
    \ of bias during data collection, and the\ngeneralizability of the ﬁndings beyond\
    \ the sampled population. These limitations should\nbe considered when interpreting\
    \ the results and implications of the study. The results\nsection presents the\
    \ ﬁndings of the statistical analyses conducted, providing evidence to\nsupport\
    \ or reject the formulated hypotheses and offering insights into the research\
    \ objec-\ntives. The results contribute to our understanding of the factors inﬂuencing\
    \ the adoption\nof IoT technologies for crop monitoring among farmers in Jizan,\
    \ Saudi Arabia. Table 1\npresents the details of the questionnaire.\nTable 1.\

    \ to Table 1, the study speciﬁcally targeted farmers in Jizan, Saudi Arabia, as\n\
    the primary respondents. The total number of questionnaires distributed to farmers\
    \ for\ndata collection was 550. Out of the 550 questionnaires distributed, 500\
    \ questionnaires were\nreturned by the farmers. These results indicate that there\
    \ was a high response rate among\nthe farmers, with 90.91% of the questionnaires\
    \ being returned and providing valuable data\nfor the study. This suggests a good\
    \ level of engagement and interest from the farmers in\nthe topic of using IoT\
    \ technologies for crop monitoring in Jizan, Saudi Arabia. According\nto [44],\
    \ 70% or more is considered to be a good response rate and the response rate can\
    \ be\nconsidered as being excellent if that rate is greater than 70%.\nAccording\
    \ to Table 2 and a graphical representation of demographics analysis, the\nsurvey\
    \ included 500 respondents, of which 68.8% were male and 31.2% were female. The\n\
    participation of both genders indicates a diverse representation among farmers\
    \ in Jizan,\nSaudi Arabia. Among the respondents, 21.5% had an undergraduate degree,\
    \ 54.0% were\ngraduates, 19.3% held a master’s degree, and 5.3% had a Ph.D. The\
    \ majority of farmers in\nthe study had attained higher levels of education, indicating\
    \ a potential correlation between\neducation and the adoption of IoT technologies.\
    \ The distribution of farming experience\nshows that 36.0% of respondents had\
    \ no prior farming experience. Among those with\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n\
    10 of 19\nexperience, 32.8% had 1 to 3 years, 19.4% had 4 to 5 years, 10.0% had\
    \ 6 to 7 years, and\nonly 1.8% had more than 7 years of farming experience. The\
    \ ﬁndings suggest a mix of\nexperienced farmers and individuals relatively new\
    \ to farming, providing insights into the\nperspectives of both experienced and\
    \ novice farmers regarding IoT technology adoption.\nThe marital status of the\
    \ respondents indicates that 20.8% were single, 53.8% were married,\n20.2% were\
    \ divorced, and 5.2% were widowed. The diversity in marital status reﬂects the\n\
    varied life situations of farmers and allows for a comprehensive understanding\
    \ of different\nperspectives on IoT technology adoption. Among the surveyed farmers,\
    \ 68.8% of males\nand 31.2% of females have adopted IoT technologies. This ﬁnding\
    \ highlights a potential\ngender disparity in the adoption of IoT technologies\
    \ among farmers in Jizan, Saudi Arabia.\nTable 2. Demographical details.\nVariables\n\

    \ Arabia. This information serves as a foundation for under-\nstanding the farmers’\
    \ perceptions and adoption patterns regarding IoT technologies for\ncrop monitoring,\
    \ health assessment, growth tracking, and yield prediction.\nAccording to the\
    \ results in Table 3, the topic of using IoT technologies to monitor\ncrop health,\
    \ growth, and yield prediction exhibits a relatively moderate mean, a relatively\n\
    high variance and standard deviation, and a good level of internal consistency.\
    \ The high\nvariance and standard deviation indicate a signiﬁcant degree of variability\
    \ in the data, and\nthe good internal consistency suggests that the measured items\
    \ or variables in the analysis\nare reliable. The Cronbach’s alpha value for the\
    \ Likert scale was 0.872, which indicates that\nall factors in the Likert scale\
    \ have an internal consistency of 0.872. As a result, all factors\nare internally\
    \ consistent with each other. In order to verify the reliability of a test, a\
    \ good\nmeasure is a Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.7 or higher, which, when using\
    \ Cronbach’s alpha\nas a guideline, is generally considered a good measure of\
    \ reliability [45]. This study was\nable to determine a Cronbach’s alpha value\

    \ (r = 0.835\n**) for Hypothesis 1, which examines the relationship between farmers’\
    \ level of awareness\nof IoT technologies and their perception of the beneﬁts\
    \ of using these technologies for crop\nmonitoring. The correlation coefﬁcient\
    \ of 0.835 ** indicates a strong positive correlation\nbetween farmers’ level\
    \ of awareness of IoT technologies and their perception of the beneﬁts\nassociated\
    \ with using these technologies for crop monitoring. This suggests that as farmers’\n\
    awareness of IoT technologies increases, their perception of the beneﬁts also\
    \ tends to\nincrease. The strength of the correlation coefﬁcient suggests that\
    \ there is a substantial\nrelationship between these two variables. The positive\
    \ correlation implies that farmers who\nhave a higher awareness of IoT technologies\
    \ are more likely to perceive greater beneﬁts\nfrom using these technologies for\
    \ crop monitoring. This ﬁnding supports the hypothesis\nthat there is a signiﬁcant\
    \ association between farmers’ level of awareness of IoT technologies\nand their\
    \ perception of the beneﬁts. It indicates that farmers who are more aware of IoT\n\
    technologies are more likely to recognize the advantages and positive outcomes\
    \ associated\nwith implementing these technologies in their crop monitoring practices.\n\

    \ no signiﬁcant evidence to suggest that the variances\nbetween the groups are\
    \ different from one another. Furthermore, there is no strong reason\nwhy the\
    \ null hypothesis should be rejected, as the assumption of homogeneity of variance\
    \ is\nmet. These results are considered good because they imply that the variability\
    \ within each\ngroup is relatively consistent, which makes it more appropriate\
    \ to use statistical methods\nthat assume equal variances, such as the analysis\
    \ of variance (ANOVA) or t-tests.\nAccording to the results in Table 6, the correlation\
    \ coefﬁcient (R) represents the strength\nand direction of the relationship between\
    \ the independent variable (perceived beneﬁts) and\nthe dependent variable (willingness\
    \ to adopt IoT technologies). In this case, the correlation\ncoefﬁcient is 0.458,\
    \ indicating a moderate positive correlation between the perceived bene-\nﬁts\
    \ and willingness to adopt IoT technologies. The coefﬁcient of determination (R\
    \ Square)\nexplains the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that\
    \ can be accounted for\nby the independent variable(s). In this model, the R Square\
    \ value is 0.210, which means\nthat approximately 21% of the variance in farmers’\
    \ willingness to adopt IoT technologies is\nexplained by the perceived beneﬁts.\
    \ The adjusted R Square is a calculation that takes into\naccount the number of\
    \ predictors that are included in a model and calculates the adjusted\nR Square\
    \ value accordingly. A more accurate R Square in this case is 0.209, which is\
    \ slightly\nlower than the standard R Square in this case. As a result, it is\
    \ suggested that when taking\ninto consideration the other variables in the model,\
    \ the perception of the beneﬁts alone\nexplains about 20.9% of the variance in\
    \ farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies. The\nSustainability 2023, 15,\

    zero. The constant coefﬁcient is statistically signiﬁcant (t = 5.028, p < 0.001),\
    \ suggesting that\nit has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the dependent variable. The\

    \ the amount of variance in the dependent variable (farmers’ willingness to adopt\n\
    IoT technologies) that is explained by the predictors (access to information and\

    \ sum of squares is\n3180.032, which is a signiﬁcant value. The amount of unexplained\
    \ variance in a dependent\nvariable is represented by the residual sum of the\
    \ factor of the square. By using this method,\nwe can measure the difference between\
    \ the observed values and the values predicted by\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n\
    14 of 19\nthe regression model based on the observed data. According to this equation,\
    \ the residual\nsum of squares is 13,495.416, which is a signiﬁcant value. In\
    \ order to calculate the variance\nin the dependent variable, the total sum of\
    \ squares must be calculated. The sum of squares\nis calculated based on the regression\
    \ sum of squares and the residual sum of squares. This\nmeans that the total sum\
    \ of the squares is 16,675.448 in this case. There are degrees of\nfreedom that\
    \ serve as a measure of the amount of independent information that can be\ngathered\
    \ for estimation. In the regression model, the degrees of freedom for the predictors\n\
    are two, which is the number of predictors (access to information and training,\
    \ perception\nof government support). The degrees of freedom for the residual\
    \ are 497, which is the total\nnumber of observations minus the number of predictors.\
    \ The mean square is calculated by\ndividing the sum of squares by the degrees\
    \ of freedom. It represents the average amount\nof variance. The F statistic is\
    \ the ratio of the mean square for regression to the mean\nsquare for the residual.\
    \ It indicates whether the regression model as a whole is statistically\nsigniﬁcant.\
    \ In this case, the F statistic is 58.556. As a result of the F statistic, you\
    \ will be able\nto determine the signiﬁcance level (p-value). In other words,\
    \ it represents the probability of\nobtaining an observable F value by chance\
    \ alone, rather than using an algorithm. Using\nthis method of analysis, the p-value\
    \ in this case is 0.001, which is a highly signiﬁcant value.\nSustainability 2023,\

    \ model, which includes the predictors (access to information and train-\ning,\
    \ perception of government support), is statistically signiﬁcant in explaining\
    \ the variance\nin farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies. The predictors\
    \ collectively contribute\nsigniﬁcantly to the model, as indicated by the F statistic\
    \ and the associated p-value.\nTable 11 details the estimated coefﬁcients, standard\
    \ errors, t-values, and signiﬁcance\nlevels associated with the predictor variables\
    \ (access to information and training, percep-\ntion of government support) within\
    \ the regression model for Hypothesis 3 based on the\nestimation coefﬁcients.\
    \ In the case when all predictor variables have a zero value, the\nconstant term\
    \ represents the estimated intercept. There is a constant term in this case of\n\
    5.493. As a result, the t-value for the study is 3.682 with a p-value of 0.001,\
    \ indicating a\nstatistically signiﬁcant result. In terms of access to information\
    \ and training, there is a\ncoefﬁcient of 0.763. For the purpose of the analysis,\
    \ we are trying to estimate how much a\none-unit increase in AIT will affect farmers’\
    \ willingness to adopt IoT technologies while\nholding the other variables constant\
    \ for a one-unit increase in AIT. This coefﬁcient has a\nt-value of 9.112 and\
    \ a p-value of 0.001 which indicates that the coefﬁcient is statistically\nsigniﬁcant.\
    \ This standardized coefﬁcient (Beta) of 0.387 suggests that the adoption of IoT\n\
    technologies by farmers is moderately positive as shown by the effect of AIT.\
    \ A coefﬁcient\nof 0.194 has been found for the perception of government support\
    \ (PGS). The change in\nthe dependent variable is calculated as the change in\

    \ impact on farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies based on its\nstandardized\

    \ of increasing farmers’ awareness of IoT technolo-\ngies in order to enhance\
    \ their perception of the beneﬁts and promote the adoption of these\ntechnologies\
    \ for effective crop monitoring. The perceived beneﬁts of using IoT technologies\n\
    for crop monitoring (PBIT) have a moderate positive relationship with farmers’\
    \ willingness\nto adopt these technologies. However, it is important to note that\
    \ the perceived beneﬁts\nalone explain only a portion of the variance in the willingness\
    \ to adopt, and there may\nbe other factors inﬂuencing farmers’ adoption behavior\
    \ that are not accounted for in the\ncurrent model. The ANOVA table indicates\
    \ that the regression model with the perceived\nbeneﬁts of using IoT technologies\
    \ (PBIT) as the predictor variable explains a signiﬁcant\namount of variability\
    \ in farmers’ willingness to adopt these technologies. The p-value\n(<0.001) suggests\
    \ that the relationship between the perceived beneﬁts and willingness\nSustainability\
    \ 2023, 15, 14541\n16 of 19\nto adopt IoT technologies is statistically signiﬁcant.\
    \ Overall, these ﬁndings support the\nsecond hypothesis, indicating that the perceived\
    \ beneﬁts of using IoT technologies for crop\nmonitoring have a signiﬁcant and\
    \ positive inﬂuence on farmers’ willingness to adopt these\ntechnologies. The\
    \ results suggest that highlighting the advantages and positive outcomes\nof using\
    \ IoT technologies can enhance farmers’ motivation to adopt them in their crop\n\
    monitoring practices.\nThe predictors (access to information and training, perception\
    \ of government support)\nhave a moderate positive relationship with farmers’\
    \ willingness to adopt IoT technologies,\nand they collectively explain a signiﬁcant\
    \ proportion of the variance in the dependent\nvariable. The regression model,\
    \ which includes the predictors (access to information and\ntraining, perception\
    \ of government support), is statistically signiﬁcant in explaining the\nvariance\
    \ in farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies. The predictors collectively\n\
    contribute signiﬁcantly to the model, as indicated by the F statistic and the\
    \ associated\np-value. Overall, the coefﬁcient table provides information about\
    \ the estimated effects of\nthe predictors on farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT\
    \ technologies. The signiﬁcant coefﬁcients\nindicate that both access to information\
    \ and training and the perception of government sup-\nport have a positive inﬂuence\
    \ on farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies, although\nthe effect of access\
    \ to information and training (AIT) is relatively stronger compared to the\nperception\
    \ of government support (PGS).\n6. Conclusions\nThe purpose of this study is to\
    \ make contributions to the understanding of how farmers\nperceive IoT technologies\
    \ and their adoption for crop monitoring among themselves. The\nﬁndings shed light\
    \ on the roles of these technologies in enhancing agricultural practices\nand\
    \ emphasize the need for further research and support in promoting their effective\n\
    implementation in the agricultural sector. The discoveries of the study show the\
    \ importance\nof increasing farmers’ awareness of IoT technologies to enhance\
    \ their perception of the\nbeneﬁts and promote the adoption of these technologies\
    \ for effective crop monitoring. The\nperceived beneﬁts of using IoT technologies\
    \ for crop monitoring have a moderate positive\nrelationship with farmers’ willingness\
    \ to adopt these technologies. However, it is important\nto note that the perceived\
    \ beneﬁts alone explain only a portion of the variance in the\nwillingness to\
    \ adopt, suggesting the presence of other factors inﬂuencing farmers’ adoption\n\
    behavior that were not accounted for in the current model. The predictors, namely\
    \ access to\ninformation and training and the perception of government support,\
    \ also have a moderate\npositive relationship with farmers’ willingness to adopt\
    \ IoT technologies. Collectively,\nthese predictors explain a signiﬁcant proportion\
    \ of the variance in farmers’ willingness to\nadopt. The regression model including\
    \ these predictors is statistically signiﬁcant, indicating\ntheir inﬂuence on\
    \ farmers’ adoption behavior.\n6.1. Decision\nAccording to the results, it is\
    \ recommended that IoT technologies be promoted to\nfarmers and highlighted for\
    \ the beneﬁts associated with their use. Agricultural IoT tech-\nnology beneﬁts\
    \ and practical applications can be explained to farmers through targeted\ninformation\
    \ dissemination and training programs. IoT technologies should also be im-\nproved\
    \ to ensure farmers have access to information and training to adopt and use these\n\
    technologies effectively. Additionally, government initiatives and policies can\
    \ foster a\nsupportive environment for IoT adoption among farmers. Farmers’ adoption\
    \ behavior\nmay not be captured by the current model. IoT technologies in agriculture\
    \ should be\nexplored further in future research. These variables include economic\
    \ considerations, social\ndynamics, and technological infrastructure.\nAs a result\
    \ of the study, we conclude that the key drivers of the adoption of IoT tech-\n\
    nologies for crop monitoring in Jizan, Saudi Arabia include raising awareness,\
    \ promoting\nperceived beneﬁts, and providing access to information and training.\
    \ To improve crop\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n17 of 19\nhealth, growth, and\
    \ yield prediction, policymakers, agricultural extension agencies, and\ntech providers\
    \ can use these ﬁndings to develop strategies and interventions.\n6.2. Future\
    \ Recommendations\n1.\nIn-depth analysis of other factors: Conduct further research\
    \ to explore and under-\nstand additional factors that may inﬂuence farmers’ adoption\
    \ behavior towards IoT\ntechnologies in crop monitoring. Consider variables such\
    \ as economic viability, social\ndynamics, technological infrastructure, and regulatory\
    \ contexts. This will offer a more\ncomprehensive considerate of the barriers\
    \ and drivers of adoption.\n2.\nLongitudinal studies: Conduct longitudinal studies\
    \ to track the adoption of IoT\ntechnologies over time among farmers in Jizan,\
    \ Saudi Arabia. This will help to\nidentify trends, challenges, and opportunities\
    \ associated with long-term adoption,\nas well as to assess the impact of IoT\
    \ technologies on crop health, growth, and yield\nprediction.\n3.\nTailored training\
    \ programs: Develop and implement tailored training programs for\nfarmers in Jizan,\
    \ Saudi Arabia, focusing on building their skills and knowledge related\nto IoT\
    \ technologies. These programs should be designed to address speciﬁc challenges\n\
    and opportunities in the local context, making them more effective in promoting\n\
    adoption and maximizing the beneﬁts of IoT technologies in crop monitoring.\n\
    4.\nCollaboration and partnerships: Foster collaboration and partnerships among\
    \ key\nstakeholders, including farmers, agricultural extension agencies, technology\
    \ providers,\nand government entities. Such collaborations can help in knowledge\
    \ sharing, capacity\nbuilding, and the co-development of IoT solutions that are\
    \ relevant and practical for\nthe local agricultural sector.\n5.\nFinancial support:\
    \ Explore ﬁnancial support mechanisms, such as subsidies, grants,\nor loans, to\
    \ assist farmers in the adoption of IoT technologies. Financial incentives\ncan\
    \ help to alleviate the initial investment costs associated with acquiring IoT\
    \ devices\nand implementing the necessary infrastructure, thus encouraging more\
    \ farmers to\nadopt these technologies.\n6.\nDemonstration farms: Establish demonstration\
    \ farms or pilot projects in Jizan, Saudi\nArabia, where farmers can observe and\
    \ learn ﬁrsthand about the beneﬁts and prac-\ntical applications of IoT technologies\
    \ in crop monitoring. These farms can serve as\nliving examples to showcase the\
    \ effectiveness and economic viability of IoT solutions,\nencouraging other farmers\
    \ to adopt similar practices.\n7.\nPolicy and regulatory frameworks: Develop supportive\
    \ policies and regulatory frame-\nworks that facilitate the adoption and integration\
    \ of IoT technologies in agriculture.\nThis can include standards for data privacy\
    \ and security, streamlined approval pro-\ncesses for IoT devices, and policies\
    \ promoting open data sharing for research and\ninnovation.\nBy implementing these\
    \ recommendations, stakeholders can contribute to the broader\nadoption of IoT\
    \ technologies in crop monitoring in Jizan, Saudi Arabia, ultimately leading to\n\
    improved agricultural practices, enhanced productivity, and sustainable farming\
    \ systems.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, F.A.R., A.J., A.H., M.U.,\

  explanation: This study on spatial visualization of automated irrigation systems
    aims to provide a methodology for visually representing the health and status
    of such systems using GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and cartographic techniques.
    This approach enables users to visualize various aspects of irrigation systems,
    including data and information, on interactive maps and dashboards. The study
    demonstrates the potential of using heuristic spaces to represent different types
    of stakeholders and their relationships within the ISO management system.
  extract_1: The paper suggests using spatial visualization techniques, such as interactive
    dashboards and augmented reality, to present system health information in an intuitive
    and actionable format.
  extract_2: The study demonstrates the potential of using heuristic spaces to represent
    different types of stakeholders and their relationships within the ISO management
    system.

    the future to present the results of research in the discussed field. They concern
    stakeholder relationship management according to the ISO management systems. Appropriate
    technology is required for the application of the model. The study is part of

  key_findings: The study demonstrates the potential of using heuristic spaces to
    represent different types of stakeholders and their relationships within the ISO
    management system. The proposed visualization method can help users to quickly
    and easily identify and understand the health and status of automated irrigation
    systems, which can enable them to make informed decisions about system management.
  limitations: The study does not provide a practical implementation or evaluation
    of the proposed visualization method within a real-world irrigation system.
  main_objective: To propose a methodology for visually representing the health and
    status of automated irrigation systems using GIS (Geographic Information Systems)
    and cartographic techniques.
  relevance_evaluation: The study is relevant to the point of focus on employing advanced
    data visualization techniques to present system health information in an intuitive
    and actionable format, as it proposes a method for visualizing and presenting
    complex data from automated irrigation systems using interactive dashboards and
    augmented reality.

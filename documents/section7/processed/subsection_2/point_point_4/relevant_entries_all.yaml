  description: 'This paper is an overview of a large knowledge based operations optimization
    system that is partially in operation and in part under development for implementing
    deep knowledge schemes as well as adapting protocols and hardware to comply with
    the expected wave on IOT. With the development of sensing, wireless communication,
    and Internet technologies, we are now living in a world that is filled with various
    smart things - the Internet of Things. This paper introduces and prospects an
    emerging research area - the Embedded Intelligence (EI) for agricultural operations.
    This field, in its humanistic scope, aims at revealing the individual behaviors,
    spatial contexts, as well as social patterns and urban dynamics by mining the
    digital traces left by people while interacting with Internet of Smart Things
    (cameras, smart cars, smart cards, etc). In the agricultural sector we add mining
    of existing technology (books, articles, blue prints) to generate high depth Ontologies
    for reasoning and making pro-active decisions. We further include Intelligent
    Data Analysis to discover new knowledge from data records. The paper discusses
    the research history, characteristics, general architecture, major applications,
    and research issues of EI and exemplifies an application of the team in IOT Smart
    Irrigation. In this paper, a greenhouse management system based on knowledge supporting
    technology is designed. It includes three parts: a wireless sensor network (WSN),
    a service platform operating in Internet, and a decision-making support system
    (DMSS) based on knowledge supporting technology. The wireless sensor network is
    used to monitor and acquire all types of environmental information for the crop
    growth, such as air temperature, air relative humidity, CO2 concentration, substrate
    temperature, soil water content, etc. All data collected by WSN is sent to the
    service platform via Internet, and then the data are analyzed through DMSS based
    on cloud service technology. In the DMSS, the data from WSN are sent to the service
    platform where processed with expert''s knowledge, and then derive an optimal
    decision to send back to ground equipment to control the greenhouse. This process
    would realize high resolution optimization management in greenhouse. The efficiency
    of the whole system based on IoT is expected to succeed in many aspects from environmental
    indices (IPM) to economic sustainability, based on targets set to the service
    by the grower.'

    India SECTION I. Introduction According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO), providing adequate food for the increasing world population is one of the
    most serious challenges of the 21st century. Limited cultivable land, declining
    freshwater resource, unsuitable climate, inadequate light for photosynthesis and
    constrained financial resources are some of the major challenges to increasing
    agricultural produce. In this context, industrial greenhouses have a huge potential
    in providing food security in many parts of the world, particularly if they are
    used properly and efficiently. However, greenhouse ecosystem is a complex system
    coupled with dynamics of environmental factors like soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, light and CO2 concentration. Maintaining an optimal greenhouse environment
    may lead to significant improvements in crop produce and hence a key goal for
    today''s advanced agriculture and this is the motivation behind carrying out the
    work described in this paper. IoT driven agriculture monitoring may potentially
    revolutionize the agriculture industry. It enables quality remote monitoring and
    control from anywhere at any time through a combination of devices and also improved
    access to quality information. Reduction in electricity and labour costs, and
    higher convenience are added advantages. The use of IoT based systems for the
    purpose of monitoring and control of greenhouse ecosystem provide several advantages
    over existing methods. A reduction in wiring deployment and maintenance cost,
    quick and easy retrofitting in the existing infrastructure, convenient and non-invasive
    remote monitoring and control without disturbing the plant biome by frequent visits,
    less disturbance to normal farming operations are some of the benefits. In addition
    to these benefits, these systems are more reliable, easily scalable and can be
    extended to more advanced functionalities such as fusion of information from more
    than one sensor node for better inference and precise control of the environment.
    A research carried out by LOFAR Agro Consortium in Netherlands is reported where
    wireless sensor network is used to monitor temperature and humidity for potato
    crop cultivation and hence control Phytophtora Infestans fungous disease [1].
    Zhang et al. developed a small network for monitoring humidity and temperature
    at various points in a plant nursery [2]. Belasare et al. developed a system to
    monitor Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD) in a greenhouse using WSN and visualize
    the data on LabView [3]. Roop Pahuja et al. proposed a GSM based system for remote
    control of various parameters such as humidity, light and temperature using ARM7
    microcontroller in a greenhouse [4]. Ravi et al. (2016) monitored nitrogen, phosphorus,
    potassium and other minerals in soil using electrochemical sensors, and carry
    out drip fertigation when required [5]. Koprda et al. implemented a GSM based
    system for monitoring and control of soil moistures using soil humidity sensors
    [6]. The control is done using Android app. Nattapol et al. proposed the use of
    Wireless Sensing Networks (WSN) and smartphone for monitoring and control of various
    crop parameters like soil moisture, temperature and humidity [7]. Sekulic'' et
    al. developed a smart spraying system for disease forecasting of grapevine downy
    mildew (Plasmopara Viticola) in the vineyard region of Montenegro [8]. The system
    collects weather data from the sensor nodes. Based on the measurements, grapevine
    growth stages and field monitoring of the pathogen development, the system is
    calibrated for disease forecasting. The above-mentioned literature report monitoring
    and control of temperature, soil moisture, soil nutrient content, vapour pressure
    deficit etc. However, research suggests that quality of air as well as intensity
    of individual spectral components of light also affect the growth of plants. Besides,
    most of the systems mentioned above use zigbee based wireless sensor networks
    for monitoring and control, with a limited range of operation, a limited bandwidth
    and lack of cognitive abilities due to limited computing power. In the work presented
    in this paper, an IoT based cloud integrated telemetry and control system is developed
    to remotely monitor and maintain environment suitable for plant sustenance and
    growth in greenhouse. The proposed cloud integrated IoT system has no range limitations,
    the only constraint is the availability of GSM and ethernet/WiFi connections.
    The main objective of the design was to develop a low cost, user friendly system
    for field measurement with the aim of reducing the manual operations and using
    the measured data from the sensor nodes for intelligent inference and remote control.
    The developed system provides realtime wireless sensor data transmission, data
    visualization and processing at the central monitoring server / PC via ThingSpeak
    cloud and ubiquitous GSM infrastructure. The use of lightweight and fast Blynk
    IoT platform for implementing the mobile app for messaging and control of greenhouse
    environment is a key feature of the developed system. Blynk platform enables a
    multilateral connection with the sensor node, Blynk server/software, and mobile
    phone. Real time irrigation needs are received via messages on the Blynk app installed
    on the mobile phone. In order to test system developed in this work, experimental
    tests were conducted in greenhouse by us and the results obtained have been presented
    and discussed in this paper. The paper is organized as follows: Section II describes
    the overall architecture of the proposed system. Section III and IV give the hardware
    and software details of the system, respectively. Section V and VI report the
    experimental results and conclusions, respectively. SECTION II. System Architecture
    Fig. 1. gives the system architecture of the IoT based remotely monitored and
    controlled greenhouse ecosystem. The system comprises of three major components:
    GPRS enabled sensor nodes deployed at various locations in the field, an Ethernet
    connected central monitoring server/PC at the remote station, and mobile controlling
    of actuator connected to the switches controlling devices. A. Sensor Node (SN)
    Each sensor node comprises of sensors, a microcontroller and GSM shield for communication.
    The sampled sensor data is processed, packetized and transmitted wirelessly to
    the server through General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). B. Central Monitoring
    Server The central monitoring server receives, stores, displays and analyse live
    data from the sensor nodes. It may also be programmed/configured to generate/send
    notifications under certain conditions. The server processes the received information,
    makes suitable inferences and send control command to the actuator node. C. Mobile
    Phone Based Monitoring and Control Unit /AN The actuator node (AN) is used to
    wirelessly receive and execute the control commands from the Blynk server. It
    has connections to various coloured LEDs, irrigation pumps fan/cooler etc. Fig.
    1: Data flow architecture of IoT based telemetry and control system for a greenhouse
    Show All SECTION III. System Implementation A. Sensor Node The sensor node employed
    in this work for IoT based greenhouse monitoring uses an Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller
    based on ATMega1280. The board requires a power supply of 7-12V supplied either
    at VIN via an on-board regulator or USB. It operates at frequencies of up to 1
    MHz. It includes up to 128 kB of flash memory, up to 8 kB of SRAM, USB Device
    interface, SPI interface, 4 UART serial ports, digital input-output pins, 1 PWM
    pins and 1 analog input pins[9]. The soil moisture sensor used in the node is
    EVANA SM12. It estimates the soil volumetric water content by measuring the dielectric
    constant (soil bulk permittivity) of the soil. The soil water content and dielectric
    constants are directly proportional to each other. This sensor measures the resistance
    between two pins of its Printed Circuit Board (PCB). Hence, it gives a lower resistance
    when soil moisture is high and vice-versa. The operation of the sensor requires
    a biasing voltage of 3.3-5V. The sensor has a digital as well as analog output
    interface (EVANA SM12 Datasheet) [10]. The ambient light intensity sensor used
    is BH1750. It measures the intensity of the incident light using a photo diode.
    It has a measurement range of 1–553 lx and a resolution of 0.1 lx. The maximum
    input voltage of BH1750 is 4.5V and the operating voltage being around is 3.6V.
    The influence of the infrared radiations on the sensor output is small [11]. The
    air quality sensor MQ135 is used in the node to monitor the CO2 content of the
    atmosphere. As the concentration of CO2 increase, the conductivity of gas sensor
    also increases. It is assumed that the other gases like ammonia, aromatic compounds,
    Sulphur, benzene vapor, smoke etc. to which the sensor is sensitive are constant
    in the atmosphere. The output of MQ135 can be an analog signal that can be read
    with an analog input port of the Arduino or a digital TTL output that can be read
    with a digital input port of the Arduino [12]. GSM Shield SIM900A is used to enable
    communication of the developed sensor node with remote server. The interfacing
    of sensor node electronics comprising microcontroller, sensors and GSM Shield
    is shown in Fig. 2. The function of the sensor node include periodically measuring
    the environmental parameters, data processing and packetization, and wireless
    transmission to ThingSpeak channel. These functions were implemented by a program
    in embedded C language, uploaded on the microcontroller using Arduino IDE (Integrated
    Development Environment). When the sensor node is powered on the program automatically
    starts and follows the logic in the flowchart indicated in Fig. 3. B. Central
    Monitoring Server In the prototype in this work, ThingSpeak is used as a monitoring
    cloud server. ThingSpeak is an IoT analytics platform that enables real time data
    collection, visualization and analysis. The information can be viewed by the user
    when required. Online analysis and processing of the data may also be done in
    MATLAB. Fig. 4 shows the program flow for cloud server used in this work. Fig.
    2: Sensor node electronics Show All Fig. 3: Sensor node program flow Show All
    C. Mobile Phone Based Monitoring and Control Unit (AN) The actuator node consists
    of a microcontroller programmed to sense any control commands from Blynk app installed
    on the remote mobile phone. Whenever, the intensity of light displayed at ThingSpeak
    channel is outside the desired ambient light intensity range, a command is sent
    from the Blynk app to switch on / off the light. Likewise, the irrigation pump
    is switched on / off when the received sensed soil moisture values fall outside
    the desired levels. Microcontroller executes the received commands by controlling
    the relevant switches via the digital input / output pins and connected relays.
    The flowchart for actuator node is shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 4: Cloud server routine

    All SECTION IV. System Working and Results The working of the developed system
    is shown in Fig. 6. The working of the developed system is shown in Fig. 6. The
    developed system was tested to perform a real-time remote environmental monitoring
    of soil moisture, air quality and light for cultivation of tomato plants. The
    sensor and the actuator nodes were installed in the in-vitro culture lab, Department
    of Botany, Faculty of Life Sciences, Aligarh Muslim University (AMU). The monitoring
    started since November 16, 2017 with every one minute interval of measurement.
    The central monitoring server was placed at Advanced Communication Laboratory,
    Department of Electronics Engineering, AMU. The environmental data comprising
    air quality, light intensity and soil moisture was monitored for seven days. Fig.
    7. shows the implemented system setup at the in-vitro culture lab, Department
    of Botany. The actuation function was successfully tested for controlling the
    irrigation pump, air conditioner and artificial lights. Fig. 6: Working of the
    developed system Show All Fig. 7: Testing of the implemented system prototype
    Show All Fig. 8. shows the successful real-time visualization of received measurements
    on ThingSpeak server for a) soil moisture sensor b) light sensor and c) air quality
    sensor. Offline measurement data were also observed on the personal computer.
    The offline measurement record may help keep continuity and robustness of monitoring
    in case of unstable GSM network. The offline data observed on serial monitor of
    Arduino IDE is shown in Fig. 9. Table 1 shows a sample series of successfully
    received environmental data for soil moisture, light intensity and air quality
    over time. Soil moisture sensor values above 1000 indicate the need for irrigation.
    Light intensity values less than 50 indicate darkness. Similarly, air quality
    measurements more than 350 indicate poor air quality. The data can be utilized
    to support daily farm activity. In view of the use of cloud-based system, the
    measured environmental data could be checked using PCs and smartphones anytime
    and anywhere. Depending upon the measured sensor values, required actuation of
    devices can be performed via Blynk app. Analog voltage values measured by the
    above sensors can be calculated from raw mentioned values using the formula: Analog
    sensor voltage output= raw sensor output value 1023 View Source These voltages
    are proportionally indicative of soil moisture percentage, light intensity and
    air quality respectively. Table I: Reading of different sensors collected by ThingSpeak

    the set threshold for soil moisture sensor, the ThingSpeak server displays an
    alert notification on mobile as shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 10: Alert notification
    received on mobile Show All The control of these parameters is done remotely and
    wirelessly via Blynk app which allows user to press a button and turn on/off the
    equipments. This wireless control via Blynk app was tested for switching ON/OFF
    the LED and the results are shown in Fig. 11. These LEDs were replaced by relays
    connecting to the appliances used for actual actuation. Fig. 11: Testing control
    via blynk app Show All SECTION V. Conclusions In this paper, a prototype cloud
    integrated Internet of Things system for tele-monitoring and control of greenhouse
    environment is developed and successfully tested. The system collects measured
    environmental sensor data on ThingSpeak cloud server from the GPRS enabled sensor
    nodes. The sensor node data can be monitored from anywhere using an Internet connected
    laptop / mobile phone. The ThingSpeak platform can analyse the effect of greenhouse
    environment on plant growth from the received sensor data. Through the analysis,
    it enables intelligent control of the greenhouse environment suitable for plant
    growth. The use of lightweight and fast Blynk IoT platform for implementing the
    mobile app for messaging and control of greenhouse environment is a key feature
    of the developed system. Blynk platform enables a multilateral connection with
    the sensor node, Blynk server/software, and mobile phone. Real time irrigation
    needs are received via messages on the Blynk app installed on the mobile phone.
    Fan, lights and irrigation pump in greenhouse are also successfully controlled
    via Blynk mobile phone app using GPRS transmission to the sensor node. Computing
    and telecommunications technologies are still not widely adopted for agriculture
    applications, in many regions of the world. Increasing bandwidths in terms of
    high speed mobile and internet services to rural areas are gradually becoming
    available in these regions. In this scenario, the work presented in this paper
    assumes great significance as the advent of IoT has a great potential to revolutionise
    farming and agricultural practices. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The paper authors would like

    IEEE Conference Location: Paris, France SECTION I. Introduction Smart technology
    deployed for modern farms grow together with the area of Precision Agriculture
    (PA). Public administration and farmers have access to many multimedia browsers
    and auto-guidance systems provided by agromachinery manufacturers. There exist
    many additional sensors and devices which could add new and useful features to
    the agro-system if they could only be integrated with it. The Internet of Things
    (IoT) can help us to join all these elements. Our motivation to perform this research
    comes up because farmers demand a new multimedia platform to determine the most
    efficient decisions to manage and monitor their agricultural fields, especially
    for fertilizing tasks. Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) 2014/2020 implements new
    points inside of the new term “Greening” [1]. This policy aims to obtain energy
    efficiency and the reduction of fertilizers in agriculture productions. These
    goals can be achieved by applying new technologies in farms with strong traditional
    thinking in growth methods, obtaining productions destined to human consumptions
    in a sustainable and healthy way, while decreasing around 70% the use of chemical
    herbicibes. All these issues require additional management tools and applications.
    It could be interesting to implement a direct integration in some few systems
    but it is nearly impossible to develop it on large scale fields as in the case
    of crop production systems. Information technology (IT) industry is aware of this
    problem and tries to solve it with Service Oriented Architectures (SOA), where
    each module exposes a standard interface for communicating with other systems.
    The current documentation and the tutorial are published on the official website
    [2]. Therefore, SOA principles should be investigated in a distributed smart agro
    big data environment. It is another emerging trend in software integration research
    that is suitable to be used in industry with Complex Processing (CP). Related
    literature demonstrates that there are many requirements for agriculture decision
    [3]. These requirements are focused on environment data collection for big data
    systems, vegetation index decision based systems and Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSNs) using complex algorithm models or decision systems. Other requirements
    include scalability issues or ontologies for crop production systems. The quality
    and performance of new integration modeling systems should be addressed here as
    well [4]. Autonomous irrigation controller based on a timer is in most cases insufficient
    to satisfy the growing expectations put on the crop production systems. Research
    interests are nowadays focused on integrating aerial images, smart irrigation
    controllers and data originated by other sensors such as soil humidity sensors,
    temperature and crop aerial Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) analysis.
    Methods based on combining visual data from several data sources like ground sensors
    or events between them are also an interesting research subject [5]. Scalability,
    effective management, and QoS in large and distributed monitoring systems are
    also important topics that must be taken into account. This paper shows how IoT,
    aerial images and SOA can be applied to large and smart farming systems, which
    should be scalable and easily configurable. It presents the design and development
    of the multimedia platform for precision agriculture (called PLATEM PA). It integrates
    an intelligent IoT irrigation system based on a mesh network using the new aerial
    mapping sensor included in AR Drones with HD cameras to monitor an area for growing
    crops (See Fig. 1). The captured video is used to control the irrigation system
    and the blocking of the sprayers, which may produce problems and crop death if
    they are not properly irrigated (See Fig. 2) [6]. The whole system is based on
    an 868 MHz wireless mesh network. The communication system lets the nodes transmit
    data up to 12 Km. Some previous contributions were described in [7]. The rest
    of paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the state of the art about
    the last technologies applied to agriculture, WSN s and aerial image mapping data.
    Section III describes the communication layers architecture, the Low Energy Consumption
    Wireless Mesh Network as well as the system operation. The entire data source
    is integrated on the context service where data is processed by a rule engine.
    It will be in charge of the matching rules, taking decisions and monitoring data,
    sending notification and computing statistics. The implementation is shown in
    Section IV. Section V presents the conclusion and describes the next steps in
    the development of PLATEM PA. SECTION II. Related Work Some time ago, autonomous
    irrigation controllers were designed using analog technology based on timers.
    In the most trivial case, an alarm event was detected with plastic bottles. If
    the bottle was full of water, the irrigation system was working well. If the bottle
    was empty, the system was incorrectly working due to false positives. Currently,
    most of the irrigation controllers can be manually programmed by mobile messages
    or smartphone applications. With high performance computers, additional features
    can be included, e.g. real time irrigation alarm detection and smart irrigation
    schedule according to the index vegetation or environment data. This section shows
    some of the existing works related to our proposal. E. Playán et al. [8] described
    the evolution of irrigation controllers based on simulation models. They found
    two models. The sprinkler irrigation model, which is based on a ballistic model.
    The sprinkler sends the water to the drops, subjected to a velocity vector, wind
    vector and the force resistance. Another type is the crop model, which combines
    the soil water balance, crop growth, and crop yield by using mathematical equations
    implemented in a software application. We focus this proposal on the real time
    image analysis of corn crops using smartphones or tablets to control the irrigation
    system. Sometimes the quality of water changes can include grit or clay that is
    not captured by the filter of the irrigation system. This may result in important
    problems due to the blockading sprinklers. It is necessary to solve this issue
    because the production during the summer period can suffer a drought in warm days.
    H. Z. Wang [9] explored the architecture using IoT based on heterogeneous sensor
    data. They proposed a design for implementing IoT in agriculture based on cloud
    computing. The design was based on a two-tier storage structure of HBase, which
    is a distributed database with high scalability. The access to the database using
    Map Reduce model was performed using a distributed programming framework. Hence,
    this design provided scalable storage, efficient data access, and facilitated
    other data processing tasks. Fig. 1. Weeds detection on maize crops using aerial
    video processing. Show All Captured images are used to estimate parameters usually
    measured by sensors. Depending on the quality of the video stream and the used
    algorithms, the system can classify vehicles, trace lane changes or even recognizing
    license plates. The system usually requires only one camera per monitored location.
    The aerial image, ground data sensor and environment data must be segmented and
    transformed into objects. Their behavior is recognized and tracked. An example
    of such a system was described in [10]. In this case, high multispectral cameras
    are used to monitor the vegetation index by bands reflection processed on normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI) measurement. C. Cambra et al. [11] presented
    an analysis to determine the bandwidth requirements to transmit video in system
    applied to detect problems in the Coefficient Uniformity (CU) of an irrigation
    system. They also analyzed weeds conflicts on maize crop. The key idea of their
    work was to enhance the monitoring tasks with sensors or integrate them with the
    whole sensor network where the aerial sensors are just one type of sensors. Physical
    sensors are connected directly to first level nodes according to their location.
    Nodes create a hierarchical structure. According to the SOA paradigm, software
    should be delivered as loosely coupled and cooperating services, which should
    be described, published and easily discovered. In such environment, new applications
    called business processes can be created by composition of existing services.

    System Description This section presents the proposed solution. The proposal is
    based on a WSN connected to irrigation controllers. Layer 2 consists of a network
    coordinator middleware, a storage system and a multimedia platform browser (See
    Fig. 3). Fig. 3. Layered conceptual framework iot data integration service oriented
    service. Show All The goal of PLATEM PA is to build a platform in order to offer
    services to the farmers through multimedia communication (Fig. 4). The proposal
    is adaptable and offers information about the weather of different places, lands
    conditions, and water requirements necessary for improving the farm efficiency.
    We propose to include the potential of mesh networks in a smart irrigation system
    to adapt the irrigation schedule in order to have a better agronomy decision system,
    to improve the efficiency and save resources. Moreover, intelligent channel assignment
    systems are taken into account to avoid interferences between them [12]. Irrigation
    controllers consist of a mesh network that operates at the 868 MHz ISM Frequency
    Band [13] as LoRa WAN [14] or Sigfox [15]. Irrigation controller and 868 MHz communication
    module are designed with low energy consumption technology that can work during
    one year, transmitting data up to 15 km. Lora Alliance describes a LoRa WAN as
    standard specification of low consumption and wide bandwidth to use data acquisition
    devises thought to be implemented in the world IoT. LoRa WAN aims to provide secure
    bi-directional mobility, location and communication services for smart devices
    in mesh networks. Network Middleware is an implementation which is able to create
    a dynamic transmission based on Multi hop routes between the coordinator access
    point and several irrigation controllers. Sensor inputs can be used as well to
    gather environmental data from weather stations. Sensor probes collect data of
    soil moisture and the system functionality such as pressure and flow sensors.
    Fig. 5 shows the mesh network of irrigation controllers. It also includes the
    irrigation sensor events (pressure, flow and pH) and weather data. Any new monitoring
    scheme for event and danger detection [16] can be added easily. Gathered data,
    i.e., data from the field and controller status are stored in a MySQL data base.
    The rule engine are in charge of getting decision and generating notifications
    taking into account previous data from sensors and status controller''s analysis
    to match a possible rule to trigger. The visual user application is used to interact
    and executing actions in the system such as opening a hydraulic valve or showing
    data in regard to accumulated degrees-day temperature of a specific crop. Modular
    mobile sensor devices gather data from any place. It is easy to connect, add and
    remove devices, which suppose a great advantage. Mesh networks increase the mobility
    of nodes because they allow communication without infrastructure. It benefits
    rural areas and landscapes where there is not electricity and, in most cases,
    without GSM or 3G coverage. We deploy a private radio network with dynamic routes
    inside the monitoring area. For example, irrigation controllers are working with
    a digital radio system with the 868 MHz ISM frequency band. The first part is
    the radio receiver, which has a low bandwidth and a data rate of 1,200 bits/sec.
    The narrow band is spaced in time and has more coverage range. The second part
    is a filter with a very narrow band reception, which is better for noise filtration.
    The network middleware (identified as layer 2) has the role to create the best
    route to communicate devices and add new nodes by the method of discovering neighbors
    with the best signal strength. With the study of this parameter, the best route
    to transmit the information is designed. The system also uploads some essential
    information to the database such as the battery status, the signal strength and
    the deviceID. When a packet is transmitted from the coordinator to the node endpoint,
    2 bytes of this packet include the information about the signal strength. Carrier
    blank method is used to listen to the bursts during 1 minute. Nodes are able to
    discover nodes and provide dynamic routing up to 3 hops. During the data transmission,
    the transmitter emits during 10 msec. short periods of data, which improves energy
    saving. The proposed solution for data computing is based on SOA principles in
    order to address flexibility and easily allow the integration of issues presented
    in crop production systems. It facilitates making quick and smart decisions. SOA
    is an architectural style that supports service orchestration. In particular,
    SOA defines the find-bind-execute paradigm to differentiate between service providers
    and service consumers and their loose coupling. We propose to apply this main
    paradigm to the intelligent farming system, instead of creating a direct relationship
    between the service provider (WSN, aerial crop analysis, irrigation systems and
    weather) and farmers (typically a person who produces cereals or group of them).
    All sensor data belong to the service cloud. Then, someone who acts as a service
    consumer explores the cloud in order to find a relevant service. It can bind to
    its endpoint and execute the service. Referring to SOA principles, a prototype
    solution for a mobile monitoring station has been designed. Fig. 4. PLATEM PA
    visual concept Show All Fig. 5. 868 mhz mesh network with low energy consumption
    technology. Show All Fig. 6. Data annotation processing path Show All The server
    has three main components. The first one is an application that is able to register
    the external sensor data in the system. The only requirement for a device or application
    to register and become a data source is to send the values according to the specified
    format which depends to the type of sensor. The next part introduces the Drools
    Guvnor business management based on the Rete pattern matching algorithm [17].
    It provides the basis for a more efficient implementation that might check each
    rule with facts in a knowledge base, firing the rule, if necessary. There are
    several benefits of this algorithm such as reducing or removing the redundancy
    or allowing an efficient delete of memory when facts are retracted. We called
    rule container to the part of data base where the rules of the system are saved.
    There are inside entities to contain the parameter rules of the system irrigation
    functionality, the agronomy parameter rules and the weather rules. Fig. 7. Flow
    diagram of PLATEM PA operation Show All The system needs to get experiences and
    create new relationships between rules. Each rule contains two main sections:
    the conditions section and the actions section. Declarations start with the rule
    keyword followed by the name of the rule. Fig. 6 shows the process and exchanged
    packets performed by the system to implement the different rules, monitor data
    and, finally, show data through the multimedia platform. Fig. 7 presents the flow
    diagram of PLATEM PA Operation. SECTION IV. Experimental Scenario In order to
    test our system, is this section we implement the rule that detects the potential
    fungus attack. This section also shows the resulting overlapping layers obtained
    by the gathered images and, finally, we check the consumed bandwidth of each node
    during different operation phases. Firstly, Fig. 8 shows the PossiblePesticideEvent
    rule which is able to detect the potential fungus attack in a part of the field,
    concretely area 1. Rule conditions determine when the action has to be implemented.
    In this example, two events must occur: accumulated degree-day temperature is
    1300 °C and five days ago rain sensor storage 5 litters/m2. In our historical
    data base crops ago, fungus appeared when barley has 1300 °C life and the environment
    has a high humidity level. When all conditions are fulfilled, the new event is
    created. The last line of the actions section inserts this event to the rule engine.
    In this way, the new event can be used by other rules. Rules give the user a great
    flexibility in combining low level events into higher level events which should
    trigger proper services or notify the user. Drools Guvnor provides a user-friendly
    interface for building rules so the user does not have to know all the language
    details, e.g., possible fungus attack detected on humidity air data changes. Integration
    with services layer was also tested thanks to sensor data and notification services.
    Complex events add several additional dimensions to the monitoring process. It
    was proven that in the test scenario, the decisions based on extra assumptions
    are more accurate. On the other hand, one sensor usually is not enough to make
    the right decision and take the specified action. We used several sensors as temperature,
    humidity air sensor and rain sensor. When using the combination of those events
    the false calibration rate decreases. In order to detect some real-life context
    events, rules were written in special Drools domain and specific language. The
    experimental scenario comprises the context service that may occur barley fungus
    attack through the context service model to detect humidity air in a 1300°C barley
    life. In the following example, the rule engine automatically starts to select
    possible rules and conflicts and identify two possible rules that can be triggered.
    The rule showed in Fig. 8 has been tested in this case. Checking historical of
    accumulated degree-day temperature and humidity air sensor rules of specific crop
    zone conclude that the scenario is perfect to fungus attack. PossiblePestEvent
    triggers and creates new farmer notification to prepare a pesticide sprayer application
    in few days and irrigation program will be pause during 7 days. After sprayer
    application we can check the effects of fungus attack by aerial tools (satellite
    image or UAV Image) that provide PLATEM PA. The gathered and processed data images
    are represented in Fig. 9. Source data layers, such as satellite layer, provide
    the GPS coordinates of the digital terrain model to geo-locate the areas. The
    next source layer, NDVI, is the result of the vegetation index calculation algorithm,
    which decides how is the health of the plant, the stress hydric, or over hydric,
    by gathering aerial mapping images from UAV or Satellite. The computational result
    layer is able to create differential classification zones where irrigation controllers
    have different parameters such as water and fertilizer for each zone. Finally,
    CAD irrigation layer can be used to elaborate maps and redesign the area. The
    last test performed was to check the consumed bandwidth per node during the different
    phases (Fig. 10 and Fig. 11). We performed two different tests. The first one
    was more focused on basic tasks as starting and stopping the system and sending
    data. In this case, Fig. 10 shows that the biggest value of bytes/s is registered
    when we manually open a valve, although the time is very short. The task that
    generates bigger amount of data as a function of the time is the data sending.
    The second test (Fig. 11) was focused on obtaining data during sending commands
    to modify the program contained in the programmer. Fig. 8. Rule engine example
    (fungus attack conflit set) Show All Fig. 9. Layer overlapping (system irrigation
    project layer, index vegetation layer, post processing sectorized layer. Show
    All Fig. 10. Bandwidth consumed by a node during basic tasks. Show All Fig. 11.
    Bandwidth consumed by a node when sending control commands. Show All In this case,
    the actions that implies bigger bandwidth are the sending the programming contained
    in the programmer to the data base of server with maximum values of (130 Bytes/s)
    and sending the keep alive messages with the Received Signal Strength Index (RSSI)
    to the server (108 Bytes/s) although this action is very short. To understand
    the advantages of using LoRa WAN, we have compared a LoRa WAN and a Zigbee network.
    While Zigbee cannot communicate beyond 1,160 m., LoRa WAN can send commands at
    distances up to 12,300 m. A crop fields can have an extensions of 5 hectares.
    Zigbee is not a suitable solution for that. Regarding to the consumed bandwidth,
    its requirements are very similar. SECTION V. Conclusion This paper describes
    the way that communication technologies and intelligent context-service systems
    provide autonomous decision without human interactions. It uses LoRa WAN network
    protocol, which provides a long distance communication with very low energy consumption
    levels. Recent studies on mesh network [18] show the easy adaptation of Wi-Fi
    protocol to connect devices without infrastructure but it has high energy consumption.
    In this paper, we demonstrated the potential of IoT networks on PA. Results demonstrated
    that the use of 868 MHz mesh networks is the best solution for data acquisition
    in farming systems. Our context service proposal is based on SOA principles and
    tools that can enhance the modern agricultural systems and allow the precision
    agriculture. The flexible composition of smart agricultural services, like smart
    and efficiency irrigation season inside of farmer community, is a great advantage
    for irrigation turns and for saving energy and water. The system events and data
    processing rules can be extended during the development process. The irrigation
    services are described to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed system.
    We also show the future opportunities of such services in the domain of agricultural
    decision systems. This IoT architecture and the way of taking decisions could
    be adapted to many other applications such as emergency rescues [19] among others.
    The crucial part of further development works will be the development of a standard
    communication protocol between irrigation devices, like ISOBus [20], for agro-machinery.
    Moreover, in the first evaluation we have discovered that different irrigation
    controller makers cannot communicate between them or with stations water pumps
    by using private communications protocols, thus, in future works, we want to design
    a standard irrigation communication protocol in cooperation with main irrigation
    manufactures, which will include new secure systems [21] [22]. Authors Figures

  description: 'Water, one of the most valuable resources, is underutilized in irrigated
    rice production. The yield of rice, a staple food across the world, is highly
    dependent on having proper irrigation systems. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD)
    is an effective irrigation method mainly used for irrigated rice production. However,
    unattended, manual, small-scale, and discrete implementations cannot achieve the
    maximum benefit of AWD. Automation of large-scale (over 1000 acres) implementation
    of AWD can be carried out using wide-area wireless sensor network (WSN). An automated
    AWD system requires three different WSNs: one for water level and environmental
    monitoring, one for monitoring of the irrigation system, and another for controlling
    the irrigation system. Integration of these three different WSNs requires proper
    dimensioning of the AWD edge elements (sensor and actuator nodes) to reduce the
    deployment cost and make it scalable. Besides field-level monitoring, the integration
    of external control parameters, such as real-time weather forecasts, plant physiological
    data, and input from farmers, can further enhance the performance of the automated
    AWD system. Internet of Things (IoT) can be used to interface the WSNs with external
    data sources. This research focuses on the dimensioning of the AWD system for
    the multilayer WSN integration and the required algorithms for the closed loop
    control of the irrigation system using IoT. Implementation of the AWD for 25,000
    acres is shown as a possible use case. Plastic pipes are proposed as the means
    to transport and control proper distribution of water in the field, which significantly
    helps to reduce conveyance loss. This system utilizes 250 pumps, grouped into
    10 clusters, to ensure equal water distribution amongst the users (field owners)
    in the wide area. The proposed automation algorithm handles the complexity of
    maintaining proper water pressure throughout the pipe network, scheduling the
    pump, and controlling the water outlets. Mathematical models are presented for
    proper dimensioning of the AWD. A low-power and long-range sensor node is developed
    due to the lack of cellular data coverage in rural areas, and its functionality
    is tested using an IoT platform for small-scale field trials.'
  doi: 10.3390/s21186040
  explanation: 'The proposed automated system uses a WSN consisting of sensors and
    actuators that are integrated with an IoT network to monitor and control the AWD
    irrigation system over a wide area.


    The sensors in the WSN collect field parameters such as water level, gas emissions
    (CH4), temperature, pressure, and humidity, which are then transmitted at 15-minute
    intervals. Another WSN monitors the pipe and pump health parameters, such as pipe
    pressure, flow rate of water in pipes, and pump electric power, and generates
    alarms to shut down the pump in emergency situations. The actuator network operates
    the actuators of the pipe to control the water flow through the pipe and is updated
    every 15 minutes.


    The data transmission from the sensors is controlled by a base station, which
    initiates data request messages to a specific sensor using their unique ID and
    sends an acknowledgement after successful reception of the sensor data. For the
    actuator node, the base station sends the actuator control messages to the actuator
    node, and updates the actuator nodes in the server database after receiving the
    data and from the actuator node. All of these communications between the WSN and
    the base station are performed using LoRa with messages transferred as LoRa packets.
    The base station processes the LoRa data packets and sends them to the IoT server
    as MQTT messages. The commands used to control the pumps and actuators, sent from
    the IoT server, also use MQTT.


    On the user side, a smartphone app and web interface are connected with the IoT
    server through a cloud-implemented MQTT-HTTP gateway. All of the data communication
    and AWD automation processes are performed by the sensor, base station, and cloud
    IoT server.


    The proposed automation algorithm for the sensor node is designed for the field
    trial and used to monitor field, pipe, and pump sensors to continuously monitor
    their condition. The actuator node algorithm is intended for wide-area AWD automation
    and takes all necessary actions according to certain pump operating conditions
    and control logic defined by the user during the initialization phase. The AWD
    automation control logic performed by the IoT server ascertains the irrigation
    phase (TPF or AWD) and makes phase-specific decisions, such as monitoring the
    surface water level (SWL) in terms of TPF and checking the below-surface water
    level (BSWL) for AWD to determine whether to toggle the actuators and pumps on
    or off. After toggling the actuators and pumps, the SWL is measured for both TPF
    and AWD, and then, if the SWL reaches 5 cm above the surface, the actuators and
    pumps are switched off.'
  extract_1: '"This paper presents an approach to automating a wide-area AWD system
    covering a total irrigation area of 25,000 acres. Implementation of AWD in such
    a large irrigation area has not been reported in the existing literature. It is
    imperative that such a large system uses automation instead of the traditional
    manual operation and monitoring approach. The automation can be achieved by integrating
    three essential and intricate wireless sensor networks (WSN): a mechanical subsystem
    comprised of pumps, actuator networks, and a water distribution network, and an
    IoT system that runs the automation algorithm and issues control commands. The
    data from the WSN, along with other operating parameters, are processed at a central
    server that decides whether to activate the pumps and the actuator valves. The
    system is scalable and the algorithm can be adjusted for irrigation areas with
    different sizes within a practical limit. The required set of equations to support
    the design and operation of the overall system is provided in this paper. The
    hardware for the system is presented and described in order to facilitate the
    implementation of the automation system. The communication protocol and automation
    algorithm have also been presented in sufficient detail. A sample study on a small-scale
    field trial is presented as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the effectiveness
    of the proposed system. An analysis of the proposed system''s expected performance
    is discussed by comparing it with manual and automated AWD systems in the existing
    literature. The analysis highlights the large irrigation area and the complete
    automation aspect of the proposed system."'
  extract_2: Despite numerous advantages, such as reduced water consumption, and economic
    and environmental benefits, widespread adoption of AWD is yet to be materialized
    due to social, economic, and technical challenges. This paper demonstrates that,
    with the adoption of existing sensor networks and IoT-based technologies, wide
    area adoption [25] is feasible and economically viable. The proposed wide-area
    AWD system allows for continuous monitoring and real-time decision making along
    with a fair distribution of water amongst the farmers. The authors are optimistic
    that, with the adoption of the proposed system, wide area AWD will be implemented
    in rice-growing countries. These countries will then reap the full benefits of
    the technological advantages that AWD has to offer.

    WSN; smart irrigation 1. Introduction Rice (Oryza sativa) is the second highest
    ranked food staple in the world, feeding one third (2.6 billion) of the population
    (7.8 billion). About 90% [1] of the world’s rice is produced in Asia, and it is
    the fastest growing staple food in Africa and Latin America [2] due to its ease
    of preparation compared to that of corn and wheat. It provides 21% of global human
    energy per capita and is the largest single source of energy [3]. A total of 75%
    of world rice is produced in 92 million hectares of irrigated lowland, and Asia
    occupies 56% of this land [4]. Irrigated rice uses up to 43% of the world’s irrigated
    water, which is two to three times more than other irrigated crops, and thus places
    an excessive demand on water usage compared to other staple crops. Bangladesh,
    an Asian country with a growing population and an increasing demand for rice,
    is playing an important role in rice research. According to the Bangladesh Rice
    Research Institute (BRRI), the main source of irrigation for rice is from ground
    water. However, the ground water is retrieved using shallow tube wells (STW) and
    deep tube wells (DTW), which is resulting in deteriorating ground water levels
    [5]. The production of 1 kg of rice requires 3000–5000 L of water [6], and Boro
    rice, which is generally grown in dry months, predominantly relies upon the groundwater.
    In order to address this situation, the International Rice Research Institute
    (IRRI) developed an irrigation method called alternate wetting and drying (AWD)
    that requires 30% less water than the traditional irrigation method used during
    the growing phase [7]. Studies presented in [8] have shown that, compared to the
    traditional method, AWD requires five fewer irrigation cycles and fewer pumps
    which saves about 40% of fuel. Besides minimizing the use of groundwater, AWD
    reduces irrigation cycles without affecting the yield [9]. Due to intermittent
    flooding in AWD, emission of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) is reduced by 73%
    in the dry season and by 21% in the wet season [10], compared to the continuous
    flooding method. This also decreases arsenic concentration in the shoots of rice
    plants [11]. Unlike other countries adopting AWD, where water is charged based
    on volumetric usage, most of Bangladesh’s irrigation water is charged per hectare,
    without any incentives for the farmers to reduce their water usage. Sharing a
    single pump amongst the farmers often gives rise to conflicts that usually deter
    any collaborative effort [11], which is a key point of AWD. The lack of proper
    knowledge and information sharing are also limiting the adoption of the AWD method.
    Research has shown that there is a significant opportunity for AWD in Southeast
    Asian countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam [12]; however, due to social, economic,
    and technical challenges, the AWD method is not well perceived in these regions
    [13]. Besides the challenges of AWD described above, applying AWD to a wide area
    poses additional challenges, such as monitoring and controlling the complex mechanism,
    before it can become economically feasible. To achieve this, an automated IoT-connected
    wireless sensor network (WSN) is required. WSN is a network of sensors that accumulates
    monitoring data in centrally located storage, such as cloud storage. Most WSNs
    require three different types of network elements including the sensor node (SN),
    the cluster head (CH) and the data sink (DS), also called a base station, as shown
    in Figure 1a. All of the SNs are distributed into multiple, unequal clusters headed
    by a CH that sends sensor data to the DS. Functionally, the clustering process
    and data transfer protocol may vary depending on the nature of the application
    and the distribution of the SNs. Recent applications also require these WSNs to
    be connected with other networks through gateways and to the internet infrastructure
    [14], as shown in Figure 1a. Figure 1. (a) Network elements and functional layers
    of the IoT-connected wireless sensor network (WSN), and (b) Automated AWD-specific
    WSN with IoT connectivity. IoT is the network of various smart devices to facilitate
    information flow to the end-user through the existing internet. The exponential
    growth and distribution of IoT devices are giving rise to numerous innovative
    and real-life applications. COVID-SAFE [15] monitors and predicts the infection
    by monitoring social distancing with the help of wearable IoT devices. Various
    wearable IoT devices are used for human emotion recognition [16] to facilitate
    online communication. The growth of the IoT applications, such as smart health
    using wearable IoT devices and smart cities, results in security threats to the
    network itself. The authors [17] proposed an IoT Botnet Detection using salp swarm
    algorithm (SSA) and ant lion optimization (ALO) models to minimize security threats.
    Authors of [18] proposed an enhanced information-centric networking (ICN) for
    IoT using artificial intelligence (AI) and edge computing in the internet cloud.
    Studies are conducted on the design and fabrication technologies to utilize smart
    IoT devices [19]. The researchers focus on IoT nodes’ accurate and fast localization
    [20]. IoT connected to WSN has been implemented on a limited scale in agriculture
    as reported in [21,22,23,24]. Most WSN- and IoT-based irrigation automation systems
    utilize soil moisture content and other environmental variables to schedule irrigation
    without considering plant growth; however, this is insufficient for automating
    the AWD method and gaining the farmers’ trust. Besides monitoring and controlling
    the pumps, an effective water distribution system through pipes is also required,
    giving rise to the added complexity of having to both monitoring and controlling
    the distribution system. Moreover, present WSN technologies are optimized for
    applications with densely populated SN and small area coverage. Wide-area monitoring
    requires long-range and low-power wireless connectivity [25]. Therefore, wide-area
    AWD automation involves three different WSNs, dedicated for (1) field water-level
    and environmental monitoring; (2) irrigation system monitoring; and (3) irrigation
    system controlling, as shown in Figure 1b. Therefore, densely populated and widely
    distributed sensor and actuator nodes are required for these three different WSNs.
    These three WSNs will be interconnected virtually. Traditional WSN virtualization
    involves multilayer connectivity and control, which increases inter-layer WSN
    traffic [26] for the AWD application. Besides wide-area coverage, automated AWD
    also requires external parameters, such as real-time weather forecast data, plant
    physiological data, and the farmers’ input. These data can be used by connecting
    the WSNs with different servers throughout the IoT network, as shown in Figure
    1b. Literature shows that large-scale irrigation is required to limit water usage
    to provide more water for the growing industrial sectors and increasing urban
    population [27,28]. Large-scale multiple cropping can further limit water usage
    [29] using the automated irrigation framework proposed in this article. Despite
    the inherent advantages of the AWD, both small- and large-scale implementations
    are yet to achieve the expected success for lack of proper adaptation of technologies,
    namely IoT and WSN [30]. Moreover, the large-scale implementation of an irrigation
    system, such as AWD, involves multiple stakeholders and different technologies.
    That may require an effective dimensioning tool for a practical convergent solution.
    The research presented in this article has focused on automation through proper
    technology adoption by providing a mathematical model and addressing all the required
    systems. The proposed mathematical model considers the irrigation system as a
    distributed system. It separates its components into pipe networks, localized
    water control, and clustered pumps with centralized control, thus making the automation
    platform applicable to AWD and non-AWD irrigation systems. The pipe network will
    facilitate both micro- and macro-level irrigation control in a scalable manner.
    The distributed health monitoring of the pipe network and the clustered pumps
    will make the system more fault-tolerant. Various field-level sensors in an IoT-connected
    WSN will help build a long-term database enabling scientific research to study
    the impact of climate change on crop yield [31], physiological changes, greenhouse
    gas emissions for different crops, and the application of various irrigation models.
    The major contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows. (1) Develop
    a dimensioning model for large-scale implementation of AWD using pipes, actuator-based
    water distribution, and clustered pumps. (2) Design WSN architecture combining
    three different functionalities with IoT-based automation for scalability and
    effective control and operation of the overall system. (3) Develop a low-power
    and long-range (LoRa) sensor node and data sink using LoRa, 3G, and WiFi interfaces
    for field monitoring using an IoT network. (4) Sample automation algorithms for
    the closed-loop AWD control using various internal and external parameters that
    can be used in both the WSNs and the IoT connected network. (5) Provision for
    scientific research through the database of long-term sensor data and applying
    Machine Learning (ML) for future wide-area implementation. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews existing literature related to the
    automation of AWD. Section 3 discusses the problem formulation for the automation
    of large scale AWD while Section 4 provides the proposed solution. Section 5 describes
    the system design and integration of WSN with AWD. Section 6 provides a description
    of the related field trial and Section 7 describes the performance of the system.

    2. Related Work Irrigation automation is not a very recent phenomenon and, as
    a result, is usually performed by adopting existing mathematical models and optimization
    algorithms. These primarily control the irrigation pumps to maximize water utilization.
    Baki et al. [32] have proposed a numerical scheme that utilizes weather forecasts
    and the water flow in soils to determine the optimal irrigation depth on scheduled
    irrigation days for the highest irrigation efficiency and optimum crop yield.
    Shahdany et al. [33] developed a mathematical model to automate canal irrigation
    using both known and unknown water demands for different irrigation systems. Besides
    the model-based optimization approaches, machine learning is also used by [34]
    to predict crop irrigation requirements based on soil parameters. Linker et al.
    [35] proposed a real-time and sub-optimal irrigation scheduling system that utilizes
    weather data alongside the crop’s physiological state and soil water availability.
    However, users need to decide between yield and irrigation performance depending
    on their applications. To achieve better optimization, Munir et al. [36] included
    parameters such as the plant type, watering time, air humidity, light intensity,
    and soil type for their fuzzy logic-based irrigation scheduling system that uses
    low power sensor-nodes. In [37], the authors designed an irrigation controller
    prototype based on the fuzzy rule to inspect water wastage by providing an optimal
    irrigation environment for farming. An artificial neural network (ANN) is used
    by [38] to predict soil moisture changes and to schedule irrigation based on climatic
    information and rooting depth. This ANN method was compared with the established
    water stress (WS) method, which well predicted the soil moisture during the main
    growing season, but was error prone at lower soil moisture levels. ANN and non-linear
    regression (NLR) were used by [39] to find the distances between the emitters
    in order to achieve optimum drip irrigation in the wet areas. Human expertise
    is also used by [40] for their proposed online decision support system (DSS),
    which consists of a meteorological model for weather forecasts, and a computational
    model for soil water balance and irrigation scheduling. It generates an irrigation
    schedule for a week in advance based on the DSS data repository. Irrigation automation
    is further upgraded by utilizing various sensors, wireless links, and internet
    infrastructure due to the increasing availability and decreasing cost of these
    technologies. Water level-based scheduling was proposed by [41] and uses a low-cost
    water level sensor along with inputs from the local farmers through the IoT. In
    [42], the authors present a framework using an IoT-based water distribution and
    management system that utilizes water flow meters, ultrasonic sensors and motors.
    The over-usage of freshwater for flood irrigation is addressed by [43]. The author
    proposed an IoT-based intelligent decision support system to improve the farmer’s
    water utilization by using weather data and sensor data. A complete irrigation
    supervisory control and data acquisition ( SCADA) with WSN was implemented by
    [44] to compare seven different irrigation scheduling algorithms and found that
    soil-based approaches were not adequate in providing sufficient water for the
    plants. Recently, more irrigation research on automated AWD systems is being reported
    in the academic literature. Localized pump automation is achieved by sensing the
    water level lacking remote monitoring or IoT connectivity and using solar panels
    as the power source [45]. An IoT-based system integrates laser sensors for precise
    water level measurement for automation of the AWD technique [46]. The proposed
    system was implemented for different sizes of fields, from 0.7 acres to 55.8 acres.
    Besides these local and remote irrigation automations, performance optimization
    of the WSN platform is also focused on by [47]. They developed a 3D ray-launching
    (3D-RL) deterministic algorithm to characterize the radio channel of LoRa and
    LoRa wide area network (LoRaWAN) in order to provide better connectivity to transmit
    sensor data in obstacle filled scenarios for irrigation automation. Cardoso et
    al. [48] have proposed a narrow band IoT (NB-IoT) and LoRa-based system to monitor
    and schedule irrigation using machine learning. Unlike irrigation automation,
    AWD requires additional parameters such as plant physiological data in order to
    automate the irrigation system. As discussed in the previous paragraph, some irrigation
    automation utilizes weather data or plant physiological information from the farmer;
    however, this platform targeted only a single pump as the irrigation control unit.
    Most of these solutions are offline, of the open-loop type, and do not synthesize
    the data from all of the different sources. They lack wide-area considerations
    and do not focus on the complexity that comes with the integration of multiple
    physical and logical WSNs with the IoT. Proper dimensioning of pipe-based water
    distribution networks, pump clustering, irrigation depth, and plant lifecycle-specific
    schedule mapping is absent. Therefore, any one of them individually or in combination
    may not be suitable for the automation of the AWD method in wide area applications,
    which is highly required for the socio-economic success of the AWD implementation.
    3. Problem Formulation As one of the rice-producing countries of southwest Asia,
    Bangladesh produces three types of rice: Aus, Aman, and Boro. The north-west part
    of Bangladesh produces more than one-third of these three types of rice and 35%
    of Boro rice is produced in the country. Hence, the irrigated lowland of this
    part can be considered for the AWD implementation, as shown in Figure 2. Figure
    2a shows the annual Boro production areas in overall Bangladesh. Figure 2. Boro
    production and illustrative implementation of AWD in Bangladesh; (a) Total Boro
    cultivation (2015–2016), (b) Portion of the medium Boro production zone focused
    for AWD implementation as marked in (a) by the red box, and (c) closer view of
    an IoT-based AWD system. For implementation of the wide area AWD, a portion of
    the medium Boro production area that produces less than 16% Boro [49] and lacks
    adequate irrigation facilities, as marked by the yellow box in Figure 2b which
    was chosen as the test site. Figure 2c shows the land condition of this area.
    The AWD zone is 5 km by 20 km, covering more than 24 thousand acres of cultivable
    lands that suffers from lack of irrigation. The closest water source is a river
    which is at least 2 km away from the cultivable land. Therefore, traditional canal-based
    irrigation methods are inadequate as they can suffer from water seepage of about
    40% [50]. Furthermore, manual AWD is not able to provide efficient water level
    control over this large area of irrigated land. The proposed IoT-based automation
    system with pipe-based water transportation and distribution using the AWD system
    may reduce the seepage loss by up to 90% [51]. Local or centralized automation
    is not adequate in monitoring and controlling the large number of elements in
    the AWD system. Therefore, an intelligent layered IoT-based closed-loop automation
    system is required and is proposed for this project. 4. Proposed Solution The
    proposed automation of AWD is a closed-loop control system that uses an IoT based
    WSN, which is represented by a simplified block diagram as shown in Figure 3.
    This system has three different types of inputs, which are: (i) environmental
    inputs from the field and weather forecast server; (ii) irrigation inputs from
    a plant physiology database; and (iii) inputs from the users of the pumping network
    and water distribution system. Figure 3. Functional blocks of the IoT–WSN-based
    AWD automation control loop. The environmental parameters to be monitored are
    temperature, pressure, humidity, and the greenhouse gas methane ( 𝐶 𝐻 4 ) . Rice
    fields emit a considerable amount of methane, which can be reduced significantly
    by the intermittent flooding that occurs in the AWD method. The field temperature,
    pressure, and humidity data are required to calculate the evapotranspiration loss,
    seepage loss, and water level of the field, which are used to calculate the basic
    parameters used in the AWD method. Other environmental parameters, such as wind
    speed and daylight, can be collected from the weather forecast server through
    the IoT cloud. The wide area AWD requires an adequate number of pumping machines
    and a pipe-based water distribution system to meet the field irrigation requirement.
    To maintain uniform irrigation throughout the area, the water pressures of the
    pipes need to be monitored continuously. The actuators for the water outlets and
    pumps are controlled to maintain proper pressure and water flow during the wetting
    phase of the AWD method. Additionally, the pump power and mechanical parameters
    need to be monitored continually. The crop coefficient ( 𝐾 𝑐  ) determines the
    AWD stages and can be determined from plant physiological data stored in the database
    and from input entered by farmers. The external data obtained from sensors in
    the field, the weather forecast, the crop coefficient, and user input are combined
    and processed in the closed control loop by the cloud-based AWD server through
    the IoT network. The control logic generated by the cloud server is then sent
    to the actuators and pumps through the IoT network to control the irrigation processes.
    All of the sensor nodes (SN) and actuator nodes (AN) are grouped into clusters
    and connected with the base-station (BS) through the cluster head (CH) using a
    LoRa wireless interface. The BS connects the whole WSN to the IoT network through
    the general packet radio service (GPRS) or third generation (3G) cellular network
    as per availability and coverage. The BS also acts as the WSN to an IoT gateway
    that converts the SN/AN data packets to message query telemetry transport (MQTT)
    messages. 5. System Design and Integration The proposed AWD automation consists
    of two main parts: (a) design and dimensioning of the AWD system; and (b) design
    and integration of the WSN. The AWD method at its core is an irrigation schedule
    that depends on certain the water requirements which vary depending on soil condition
    and the growth stages of the crop. Automation of the AWD using the IoT and WSN
    requires the sensor and actuator networks to be designed together, integration
    of various service modules, and development of the software algorithm. These are
    described in the following sub-sections. 5.1. Irrigation Scheduling The water
    volume of the irrigated field changes due to evapotranspiration and percolation.
    Evapotranspiration is influenced by the crop’s growing stage, wind speed, solar
    radiation, temperature, humidity, and soil properties. The crop evapotranspiration
    (𝐸 𝑇 𝑐 ) [52] can be calculated as 𝐸 𝑇 𝑐 =𝐸 𝑇 0 × 𝐾 𝑐  (1) where ( 𝐾 𝑐 ) is the
    crop coefficient (potency of soil evaporation and crop transpiration), and (𝐸
    𝑇 0 ) is the reference evapotranspiration. Among the different methods, the Food
    and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) Penman–Monteith method [52] is considered
    to be the best estimation for 𝐸 𝑇 0 , and can be expressed as 𝐸 𝑇 0 = 0.408Δ (
    𝑅 𝑛 −𝐺)+γ 900 𝑇+273 𝑢 2 ( 𝑒 𝑠 − 𝑒 𝑎 ) Δ+γ(1+0.34 𝑢 2 )   (2) where, 𝑅 𝑛 = net
    radiation at the crop surface ( MJ m −2 d −1 ) , G = soil heat flux density (
    MJ m −2 d −1 ) , T = mean air temperature (°C), Δ = slope of saturation vapor
    curve (kPa°C−1), 𝑢 2 = wind speed ( ms −1 ), 𝑒 𝑠 = saturation vapor pressure (kPa),
    and 𝑒 𝑎 = actual vapor pressure (kPa). Water requirements for rice (WRR) in cm/day
    is given in Equation (3), which measures the receding water level. 𝑊𝑅 𝑅 𝑗 =(𝐸
    𝑇 𝑜 × 𝐾 𝑐 𝑗 )+𝑃𝐸𝑅𝐶 (3) where PERC is the percolation loss from water seeping into
    the ground through pores, and j is the growth-stage index (1 to 3). Figure 4 illustrates
    the irrigation scheduling for the AWD method. The irrigation frequency (lower
    row) changes along with the development stages of the crop. Three development
    stages (transplantation, flowering, and panicle initiation) along with a water
    level indicator (middle row) are shown to indicate where continuous standing water
    and irrigation scheduling is required. Figure 4. Irrigation scheduling in alternate
    wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation method. The different crop coefficients, including
    Kc of rice, for these three stages are shown in Figure 4 [53]. It is quite evident
    when AWD is initiated that, for approximately 5 to 8 days, depending on the soil
    type, no irrigation is required [54]. Continuous standing water is required at
    the beginning of all three stages which approximates to about 30 days in total;
    hence, utilization of the AWD method is suspended during these times. Therefore,
    depending on the stages and in accordance with the 𝑊𝑅 𝑅 𝑗 , irrigation scheduling
    is applied. Irrigation scheduling is divided into two sections. The first section
    is for continuous standing water and the second section is for AWD period. Continuous
    Standing Water: For the three development stages, if the standing water level
    recedes to 2 cm from 5 cm as given in Equation (4), then the irrigation schedule
    or cycle 𝐼 1𝑗 is applied using Equation (5). 𝐼 1𝑗 represents the number of times
    the pump is turned on and is used to maintain a continuous water level of 5 cm
    above the ground. In this equation, TPFj is the total number of days related to
    the transplantation, panicle initiation, and flowering stages. 𝑖𝑓 ∑ 𝑡=1 𝑇 𝑊𝑅 𝑅
    𝑗 (𝑡)=3 cm 𝑖𝑛 𝑇 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠, 𝑗∈{1,2,3}  (4) 𝐼 1𝑗 = 𝑇𝑃 𝐹 𝑗 𝑇 (5) Establishment of continuous
    standing water during these stages is necessary as rice is quite sensitive to
    fluctuation in water level. Alternate Wetting and Drying Method: For the AWD method,
    when the water level falls 5 cm from above the ground and reaches 15 cm below
    the surface as given in Equation (6), then irrigation 𝐼 2 , which is the number
    of times the pump is turned on, is implemented using Equation (7), where 𝑊 𝑗 is
    the total days for the AWD method, to bring the water level back to 5 cm above
    the surface. 𝑖𝑓 ∑ 𝑡=1 𝑇 1 𝑊𝑅 𝑅 𝑗 (𝑡)=5 cm 𝑖𝑛  𝑇 1  𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠  𝑎𝑏𝑜𝑣𝑒 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒  𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛
    𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 =15 𝑐𝑚 𝑖𝑛  𝑇 2  𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠 𝑏𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒     (6) 𝐼 2𝑗 = 𝑊 𝑗 𝑇 1 + 𝑇 2 𝑗∈{1,2,3}
    (7) The AWD method is utilized in three different stages of the plant development
    period: (i) 15 days after transplantation; (ii) then seven days before panicle
    initiation; and (iii) finally seven days after flowering. 5.2. Dimensioning of
    the AWD System Proper dimensioning of the water distribution network’s pipes is
    required for the implementation of a large-scale AWD system. Multiple pumps are
    used in several clusters for a field of 25,000 acres to reflood the field in the
    shortest time possible. Multiple clustered-pumps facilitate the multiple inlet
    rice irrigation (MIRI) option available with AWD which allows the water to flow
    into the fields from several inlets, flooding the field in the shortest amount
    of time. The capacities of the pumps are chosen to meet the recommended minimum
    swift flooding rate of 0.00126 m3/s per acre (20 gallons per minute per acre),
    which varies depending on the type of soil [55]. Equation (8) shows the total
    number of pumps required ( 𝑛 ), when operating for 𝑡 hours with pumping capacity
    ( c ) in m3/s. The available pumping capacities include 0.02524, 0.05047, 0.06309,
    0.1009, and 0.1262 m3/s, and are achieved with 400, 800, 1000, 1600, and 2000
    GPM (gallons per minute) pumps that cover an acre of area (A) with q (150/m for
    one cm per hour water delivery) amount of water. 𝑛= 𝐴 𝑐×𝑞×𝑡       (8) Figure 5a
    shows the number of pumps required to irrigate 100 acre-inches. Using our proposed
    area of 25,000 acre-inches, it will require a total of 250 pumps with 2000 GPM
    capacities. Figure 5. (a) Number of pumps required when operating for duration
    of time (b) Average power consumption between different water lifting devices
    (c) Efficacy of the water lifting devices. Beside the volume of water to be delivered,
    the selection of water pump depends on lifting head, water pressure, and parameters
    of the water sources. Depending on the lifting head and the source of the water,
    there are three different types of pumps used for irrigation in South-East Asian
    countries including Bangladesh. For the surface water on bodies of water such
    as rivers and lakes, low-lift pumps are used where the lifting head is between
    1 to 5 m. A shallow tube well (STW) is used for more than 73% of ground water
    irrigation [56]. The rest is performed by pumps with higher lifting capacities
    called deep tube wells (DTWs). Irrespective of the type of pump used, pumps with
    higher efficiencies must be selected [57]. Pumps with 70% efficiency (as commonly
    used) are chosen for better selection among different lifting capacities. Average
    energy consumption (Ea) is calculated using Equation (9). 𝐸𝑎=ℎ𝑝·𝜂· 𝑡  (9) where
    hp is the horsepower of the pumps, η is the pump efficiency, and t is the operating
    time of the pumps. The efficacy of the system is measured using Equation (10).
    𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑐𝑦=𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 ( m 3 /s)/ 𝐸𝑎  (10) The average power consumption and efficacy
    of different water lifting devices are shown in Figure 5b,c. The efficacy curves
    in Figure 5c assume 600 GPM, 400 GPM, and 1110 GPM capacities for the low-lift
    pumps (LLP), STW, and DTW pumps. Figure 5b,c shows that LLPs have greater efficacy
    and low energy consumption compared to the other two types. This is mainly due
    to less heads [58] and thus makes the LLP type an economically feasible solution.
    Therefore, multiple low lift pumps are to be used for the wide-area AWD implementation
    as it would allow for proper utilization of the surface water and help lessen
    the exploitation of groundwater irrigation. The proper dimensions of pipes are
    of paramount importance in carrying surface water to the field; therefore, pipes
    are chosen to ensure minimum friction loss while maintaining the recommended water
    flow velocity [59]. The pipes are placed on a downward slope, as shown in Figure
    6a, to overcome the loss of pressure that occurs when travelling larger horizontal
    distances. Moreover, due to multiple inlets for irrigation, the pressure of water
    may fall from one inlet to the other; hence, when needed, the inlets closer to
    the source can be closed, to ensure sufficient water pressure at the opposite
    end of the field. Figure 6. (a) Downward slope water pipe (b) In-field Automated
    AWD setup. According to Equation (8), 250 units of 0.1262 m3/s (2000 GPM) capacity
    pumps need to be formed into clusters to ensure that the field is reflooded within
    16 to 17 h of operating time. The frictional head loss for a steady pipe’s flow
    is calculated using the Hazen–Williams equation [59], which is given by Equation
    (11). ℎ 100𝑓𝑡 =(0.2083× ( 100 𝑐 ) 1.852 × 𝑞 1.852 )/ 𝑑 ℎ 4.8655 (11) where ℎ 100𝑓𝑡
    = friction head loss, in feet, of water per 100 feet of pipe, c = Hazen–Williams
    roughness constant, q = volume flow (gal/min) and 𝑑 ℎ = inside diameter of the
    pipe (inches). Subsequently, the friction loss in psi [59] can be calculated using
    the following Equation (12). 𝑓 100𝑓𝑡 =(1/2.31)× ℎ 100𝑓𝑡 (12) where, 𝑓 100𝑓𝑡 =
    friction loss in psi per 100 feet of pipe. Equations (11) and (12) are required
    to determine the diameter of pipes needed for specific applications. The holes
    of the inlet would need to be 0.0635 m in diameter to obtain a flow of 0.004732
    m3/s (75 GPM) from every inlet in order to fill the field in the shortest possible
    time [55]. Table 1 shows the proposed AWD system with the number of monitoring
    and driver nodes needed to ensure that water gets dispersed evenly throughout
    the field. Figure 6b shows the AWD setup of the field, designed to ensure that
    all farmers receive a fair share of irrigation water, thus resulting in greater
    acceptance of the AWD. Table 1. Proposed AWD system setup. 5.3. WSN and IoT Integration
    IoT-based automation of the AWD system requires different WSNs for sensors and
    actuators. All of these networks work independently with the same base station.
    A WSN collects field parameters such as water level, gas emissions ( 𝐶 𝐻 4 ),
    temperature, pressure, and humidity. These data are then transmitted at 15 min
    intervals. The other WSN monitors the pipe and pump health parameters, such as
    pipe pressure, flow rate of water in pipes, and pump electric power. Based on
    these data, it generates alarms to shut down the pump in emergency situations.
    There is continuous monitoring at the SN which allows for immediate action when
    needed. The actuator network operates the actuators of the pipe to control the
    water flow through the pipe and is updated every 15 min. Comparing the low-power
    wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies, LoRa was chosen for the WSN in order to
    achieve the wide area coverage needed at the monitoring area for the AWD automation.
    Table 2 summarizes the LPWAN technology features [14] including range, data rate,
    and power requirements. It shows that LoRa is the best suited technology in terms
    of range with higher data rates when compared to Sigfox. Table 2. Basic features
    of wireless technologies. LoRa employs chirp spread spectrum (CSS) modulation
    for better noise immunity and sensitivity in order to achieve low-power and long-range
    wireless connectivity. The LoRa data rate ( 𝑅 𝑏 ) depends on the channel bandwidth
    (BW), coding rate (CR), and the CSS spreading factor (SF), and can be calculated
    using Equation (13). Data Rate=SF [ 4 4+CR ] [ 2 SF BW ]  (13) For the proposed
    automated-AWD system, the LoRa physical layer was chosen instead of LoRaWAN in
    order to customize the channel access interval and achieve better channel utilization
    by implementing a custom MAC (Medium Access Control) layer. Furthermore, WSN coverage
    can be improved by increasing the CSS spreading factor of LoRa, without increasing
    transmission power or changing any network elements [14]. Table 3 summarizes the
    LoRa configuration parameters used for the SN where the data rate Rb is calculated
    using Equation (13). Table 3. LoRa parameters. The multi-purpose sensor node (SN),
    shown in Figure 7a, is designed for all WSNs in order to keep the network homogeneous.
    It consists of a LoRa transceiver module (SX1278) unit, main processor (ATMega
    328), and network specific sensors and actuator drivers. Depending on the specific
    application, the sensor node can be used to either drive actuators or collect
    and monitor sensor data. Figure 7 shows the hardware blocks of the SN with the
    power unit and the base station. Figure 7. Hardware block diagram showing (a)
    Sensor node consisting of sensors, actuator drivers, and power unit; (b) base
    station (BS) with LoRa and cellular data connectivity. The base station (BS) consists
    of a Raspberry Pi-4 which acts as a host computer to control the WSN, data communication,
    and gateway functionalities. It has both LoRa and Wi-Fi/3G/LTE to maintain the
    connection with the WSNs and IoT cloud. Figure 7b shows the hardware block diagram
    of the BS. 5.4. Communication Protocol and Automation Algorithm Data transmission
    from the SN is controlled by the BS. The BS initiates data request messages to
    a specific SN using their unique ID and sends an acknowledgement after successful
    reception of the sensor data. For the actuator node (AN), the BS sends the actuator
    control messages to the AN, and updates the actuator nodes in the server database
    after receiving the data and from the AN. All of these communications between
    the WSN and the BS are performed using LoRa with messages transferred as LoRa
    packets. The BS processes the LoRa data packets and sends them to the IoT server
    as MQTT messages. The commands used to control the pumps and actuator, sent from
    the IoT server, also use MQTT. On the user side, a smartphone app and web interface
    are connected with the IoT server through a cloud-implemented MQTT-hypertext transfer
    protocol (HTTP) gateway. All of the data communication and AWD automation processes
    are performed by the SN, BS, and cloud IoT server. Figure 8a,b show the possible
    software algorithms designed for the SN and AN, respectively. At first, it configures
    and initializes the sensors, LoRa module, and driver unit. It then starts reading
    the field, pipe, and pump sensors to monitor their condition continuously. The
    AN takes all necessary actions according to certain pump operating conditions
    and control logic defined by the user during the initialization phase. All the
    internal control variables are updated according to external parameters at regular
    intervals in a closed loop at node A. These external parameters, such as user
    input, plant-specific data, and weather forecasts, are collected through the IoT
    server. Figure 8c shows the AWD automation control logic performed by the IoT
    server. The SN algorithm, shown in Figure 8a, was used for the field trial (described
    in Section 6). The algorithms, shown in Figure 8b,c, intended for wide-area AWD
    automation, were not used in the field trial. Initially, the irrigation phase
    (TPF or AWD) is ascertained, at which point all of the phase specific decisions
    are taken. For example, the surface water level (SWL) is monitored in terms of
    TPF, and, for the AWD, the below surface water level (BSWL) is checked to determine
    whether to toggle the actuator nodes on or off. Subsequently, after toggling the
    actuators and pumps, the SWL is measured for both the TPF and AWD, and then, if
    the SWL reaches 5 cm above the surface, the actuators and pumps are switched off.

    actuator node algorithm, and (c) Control logic algorithm for the AWD server intended
    for wide-area AWD automation. 6. Field Trial A field trial was performed in two
    phases: (i) WSN formation and data collection at UIU (United International University),
    Bangladesh; and (ii) remote data collection using the IoT network in an AWD plot
    at the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI). Figure 9a shows the location
    of the UIU campus fields and Figure 9b shows the BRRI’s research agricultural
    field on Google Maps. Figure 9. Field trial location: (a) On-campus trial at United
    International University. (b) Agricultural land trial at BRRI. Figure 10a shows
    the IoT-connected (wireless sensor and actuator network (WSAN) architecture which
    is comprised of two sensor networks (WSN1 and WSN2) and one wireless actuator
    network (WSN3), as described in Section 5.3. In phase one, four sensor nodes (SNs)
    were placed at each corner of a 500 m by 500 m field with the indoor base station
    (BS) located in a lab on the fifth floor of the campus building. The approximate
    distances between the SNs and the BS were 500 m to 750 m, as shown in Figure 10b.
    Figure 10. (a) IoT-connected WSAN architecture (b) On-campus trial setup with
    sensor devices connected to a base station IoT-connected WSAN architecture. Sensor
    data were collected on a round-robin basis to avoid the co-channel interference
    that occurs at high frequencies (30 s period), and to evaluate the data transfer
    performance of the WSN. The base station (BS) consisted of a Linux-based (Redhat
    7) Apache web server with Node.js, HTM, Python 3, and Maria Database. It also
    acted as a WSN-IoT gateway using the LoRa–WiFi interface. To collect real-life
    data and to evaluate the AWD algorithm’s performance, SNs were placed in the agricultural
    plots of BRRI in a Boro field. The field was divided into irrigation blocks of
    15 m by 15 m, and the SNs were placed 200 m apart from each other. The irrigation
    system was controlled using a central pump. Figure 11 shows the field setup. Figure
    11. Agricultural field level trial setup: (a) Top view of a sensor device in the
    field (b) The receiver base station setup. The BS located at BRRI acquired all
    the sensor data from the field and stored it in the IoT server in a lab at UIU
    through the 3G cellular network. To monitor and process the field data in real-time,
    a distributed application structure was designed, as shown in Figure 12c. Here,
    a smartphone app, web interface, and other automation applications were developed
    and primarily implemented within the central IoT server [60]. Figure 12a,b show
    the smartphone app and the web interface. Figure 12. (a) Mobile Application, (b)
    Web Application, and (c) client-server connectivity for user interface. The mobile
    and web applications were linked to a Node.js server. A mobile Android application
    was used to collect data, a server was used to store the data and generate notifications,
    and a web client was used as a dashboard to display all the AWD specific information.
    The mobile app and web dashboard used rESTful APIs, HTTP requests, and web sockets
    to interface with the server. Sensor data from the external sensor devices was
    recorded on the server, where it was reactively pushed to the mobile client and
    dashboard using web sockets. Web sockets were used to communicate between the
    server and the clients. Both the Android and web apps provided similar services,
    such as user registration, sensor data acquisition, warning generation based on
    sensor data, and data and AWD status reports on the dashboard. The end user, farmers,
    can reconfigure the AWD parameters, such as water level and pump operation time
    using either the smartphone app or web interface. 7. Performance Analysis In traditional
    irrigation systems, water distribution is performed using earthen canals [50]
    due to their low initial cost. However, these canals result in poor distribution
    efficiency, less area coverage, and, in the long run, results in high maintenance
    costs. The greatest concern in using earthen canals is the high water loss, which
    is expressed as water conveyance loss (S) [51] and can be calculated using Equation
    (14). 𝑆={( 𝑄 1 − 𝑄 2 )÷𝐿}×100 (14) where S = the rate of conveyance loss in the
    canal ( m 3  s −1 ) per 100 m distance, Q1 = rate of flow at the inlet ( m 3  s
    −1 ), Q2 = rate of flow at the outlet ( m 3  s −1 ), and L = distance between
    two points (m). The main factor causing this loss in the earthen canals is due
    to seepage loss. Studies have found that about 40% of the water is lost during
    the distribution time through the earthen canals [50]. The proposed automated
    AWD system using plastic pipes can overcome this conveyance loss, and help reduce
    the irrigation time, which in turn results in less energy (fuel or electricity)
    to operate the pumps. The conveyance loss rate for the proposed project derived
    from [51] is shown in Figure 13. It compares the conveyance loss between earthen
    canals and plastic piping when water is transported 5000 m from the water source
    to the field. Thus, the proposed design saves about 90.91% of water when transporting
    it from the source using plastic piping instead of earthen canals. Furthermore,
    studies conducted by [51] have found that the incorporation of the AWD method
    with plastic pipes has saved about 42% of water, and reduced energy consumption
    by 41.2% compared to the traditional method. Figure 13. Conveyance loss compensation
    between earthen canal and plastic pipe. Using Equations (5) and (7), the frequency
    of irrigations, 𝐼 1𝑗  and  𝐼 2𝑗 , can be used to determine the total energy consumption
    of the pumps. For instance, to reflood a 100-acre field with 3 cm of water while
    maintaining continuous water during TPFj, a single 2000-GPM capacity pump with
    70% efficiency and 12 hp, operating for 18 h, would be sufficient as seen in Figure
    5a. Then, using Equation (9), average power consumption of the pump is found to
    be 142.8 KWh. Similarly, the average energy consumption can be determined for
    the AWD method. Therefore, the total energy consumption for the whole season can
    be found by using Equation (15): 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 (𝐾𝑊ℎ)= 𝐼 1𝑗 ∗𝐸𝑎(𝑇𝑃 𝐹
    𝑗 )+  𝐼 2𝑗 ∗𝐸𝑎(𝐴𝑊𝐷) (15) where 𝐸𝑎(𝑇𝑃 𝐹 𝑗 ) represents the energy consumption during
    the TPF stages in order to supply 3 cm of water to the field, and 𝐸𝑎(𝐴𝑊𝐷) denotes
    the energy required to supply water when water reaches 15 cm below ground during
    the AWD method. It can be observed that, compared to the traditional method which
    utilizes continuous water, the proposed automated system is expected to require
    less energy. Figure 14 shows the dimensioning steps and mathematical calculations
    that are used for the proposed AWD system. Figure 14. Required dimensioning and
    calculation steps for an IoT-based AWD system. Table 4 compares the automated
    AWD method with manual AWD systems. Manual AWD studies focused on limited field
    sizes, soil types, and water sources. Sharing a limited number of water-lifting
    devices amongst numerous farmers tended to cause conflicts among them. Furthermore,
    the number of farmers it supported was generally quite limited. However, in the
    proposed IoT- and WSN-based automated AWD system, large-scale implementation is
    possible using a pipe and actuator-based water distribution system with cluster
    pump operation and monitoring. In this proposed system, 10 clusters, each containing
    25 pumps with capacities of 0.1262 m 3 /s (2000 GPM), can cover an area of 25,000
    acres. In this system, the pumps have 12 hp with an average pumping efficiency
    of 70%, which can support a large number of farmers while still allowing each
    farmer to obtain a fair share of water. Table 4. Comparison between manual AWD
    and automated AWD. In manual AWD, due to manual inspection of water levels throughout
    the irrigation season, pumps may operate for more hours than necessary, resulting
    in the wastage of valuable resources. However, in automated systems, pumps are
    switched off as soon as the water level reaches a certain threshold level, resulting
    in water and energy savings. The experiments presented in [46] showed that the
    automated AWD saved between 13–20% of water, with a 25% decrease in irrigation
    energy cost, and an increase in rice yields by 2–11% over manual AWD. The AWD
    automation scheme proposed in this paper is expected to reduce irrigation costs
    further since it uses plastic pipes to carry water. Moreover, integration of weather
    forecast data will operate the pumps effectively (e.g., keeping pumps off when
    the forecast predicts precipitation). Research in [45,46] presented automation
    of the AWD process by using sensors to precisely measure the water level precisely.
    These studies focused on small areas compared to that of the system described
    in this paper. For large-scale automation of AWD, multiple WSNs need to be designed
    and implemented. While automated AWD systems offer certain advantages over the
    manual AWD, as described in Table 4, the dimensioning of the wide-area automated
    AWD system may face challenges during implementation. The plant physiological
    database for developing countries such as Bangladesh is not regularly updated
    and is not easily accessible. In Bangladesh, where farmers are largely not exposed
    to technology, their knowledge and experiences about rice and irrigation are not
    readily available. Moreover, one of the research constraints is that the weather
    forecast information is not based on the specific local territory. Rather, it
    is based on the general meteorological information of the whole region. 8. Conclusions
    This paper has presented an approach to automating a wide-area AWD system covering
    a total irrigation area of 25,000 acres. Implementation of AWD in such a large
    irrigation area has not been reported in the existing literature. It is imperative
    that such a large system uses automation instead of the traditional manual operation
    and monitoring approach. The automation can be achieved by integrating three essential
    and intricate wireless sensor networks (WSN): a mechanical subsystem comprised
    of pumps, actuator networks, and a water distribution network, and an IoT system
    that runs the automation algorithm and issues control commands. The data from
    the WSN, along with other operating parameters, are processed at a central server
    that decides whether to activate the pumps and the actuator valves. The system
    is scalable and the algorithm can be adjusted for irrigation areas with different
    sizes within a practical limit. The required set of equations to support the design
    and operation of the overall system is provided in this paper. The hardware for
    the system is presented and described in order to facilitate the implementation
    of the automation system. The communication protocol and automation algorithm
    have also been presented in sufficient detail. A sample study on a small-scale
    field trial is presented as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the effectiveness
    of the proposed system. An analysis of the proposed system’s expected performance
    is discussed by comparing it with manual and automated AWD systems in the existing
    literature. The analysis highlights the large irrigation area and the complete
    automation aspect of the proposed system. Despite numerous advantages, such as
    reduced water consumption, and economic and environmental benefits, widespread
    adoption of AWD is yet to be materialized due to social, economic, and technical
    challenges. This paper demonstrates that, with the adoption of existing sensor
    networks and IoT-based technologies, wide area adoption [25] is feasible and economically
    viable. The proposed wide-area AWD system allows for continuous monitoring and
    real-time decision making along with a fair distribution of water amongst the
    farmers. The authors are optimistic that, with the adoption of the proposed system,
    wide area AWD will be implemented in rice-growing countries. These countries will
    then reap the full benefits of the technological advantages that AWD has to offer.
    For future expansion of the proposed system, long-term data can be collected and
    analyzed to improve the system further and to further control the greenhouse emissions
    more effectively. Since the proposed system enables the collection of data and
    creation of a large database, new models can be generated and advanced techniques,
    including machine learning and big data, can be applied for better performance.
    Furthermore, incorporating the farmer’s valuable input alongside previous data
    and algorithms will make it possible to accurately identify the different physiological
    stages of plants during the season, resulting in the improved development of plants
    and yields. Author Contributions Conceptualization, G.M.E.R. and R.M.; methodology,

    extract_1: '"This paper presents an approach to automating a wide-area AWD system
      covering a total irrigation area of 25,000 acres. Implementation of AWD in such
      a large irrigation area has not been reported in the existing literature. It
      is imperative that such a large system uses automation instead of the traditional
      manual operation and monitoring approach. The automation can be achieved by
      integrating three essential and intricate wireless sensor networks (WSN): a
      mechanical subsystem comprised of pumps, actuator networks, and a water distribution
      network, and an IoT system that runs the automation algorithm and issues control
      commands. The data from the WSN, along with other operating parameters, are
      processed at a central server that decides whether to activate the pumps and
      the actuator valves. The system is scalable and the algorithm can be adjusted
      for irrigation areas with different sizes within a practical limit. The required
      set of equations to support the design and operation of the overall system is
      provided in this paper. The hardware for the system is presented and described
      in order to facilitate the implementation of the automation system. The communication
      protocol and automation algorithm have also been presented in sufficient detail.
      A sample study on a small-scale field trial is presented as a proof-of-concept
      to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. An analysis of the
      proposed system''s expected performance is discussed by comparing it with manual
      and automated AWD systems in the existing literature. The analysis highlights
      the large irrigation area and the complete automation aspect of the proposed

    extract_2: Despite numerous advantages, such as reduced water consumption, and
      economic and environmental benefits, widespread adoption of AWD is yet to be
      materialized due to social, economic, and technical challenges. This paper demonstrates
      that, with the adoption of existing sensor networks and IoT-based technologies,
      wide area adoption [25] is feasible and economically viable. The proposed wide-area
      AWD system allows for continuous monitoring and real-time decision making along
      with a fair distribution of water amongst the farmers. The authors are optimistic
      that, with the adoption of the proposed system, wide area AWD will be implemented
      in rice-growing countries. These countries will then reap the full benefits
      of the technological advantages that AWD has to offer.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Jerusalem, Palestine SECTION I. Introduction
    Water plays a significant role in the economic development of countries. Specifically,
    the availability and accessibility of freshwater creates enormous opportunities
    for developing countries and is an effective strategy for sustainable economic
    growth, social, and environmental benefits [1]. Thus, investing in water management
    and improving its services is essential to eradicate poverty and make a difference
    in billions of people''s lives. For example, in Palestine, water scarcity is considered
    one of the most critical problems for environmental and political reasons, as
    water resources are limited, and the Israeli occupation controls most of them.
    Consequently, the optimal utilization of the available resources, as well as implementing
    effective strategies, has become an essential requirement to handle this problem
    [2]. According to AQUASTAT (the Food and Agricultural Organization (FOA) global
    information system), 69% of the freshwater is consumed by the agriculture sector
    at the worldwide level [2], [3]. Water is essential for agricultural production
    and plays an important role in food security. Irrigated agriculture contributes
    to about 40% of the total food produced worldwide [4]. However, farmers often
    use traditional irrigation systems to water their crops. These systems are ineffective
    and consume a IoT of time and effort, especially when several fields are distributed
    in different geographical regions. For example, in developing countries, in particular,
    farmers are obliged to visit their agricultural fields regularly and remain present
    during the irrigation process to direct and organize the irrigation for the areas
    concerned. Moreover, traditional irrigation often leads to the problem of over-irrigation
    and hence consuming large amounts of water. It also may cause an under-irrigation
    problem that negatively impacts the quality of crops [5]. Adapting modern technologies
    to build smart automatic irrigation systems has attracted considerable interest
    in the agricultural domain [6]. The proper design and installation of an automated
    irrigation system have many benefits compared to the traditional one. That is
    to say, it will schedule the irrigation process in an optimal way and thus contribute
    to reducing time, effort, and cost. It also saves significant water while improving
    plant quality. The availability of innovative technologies such as the Internet
    of Things (IoT), sensors, wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and embedded processing
    significantly contributed to building effective irrigation systems. The availability
    of such technologies helps in controlling and monitoring the levels of water available
    for crops without or with minimal human intervention [7]. Moreover, they allow
    generating a vast amount of data that can be stored, visualized, and analyzed
    to extract valuable knowledge that will improve the overall planning strategies
    and decision-making process. In this paper, a smart irrigation system was developed
    based on Raspberry Pi, Arduino Uno, and wireless sensor network technologies to
    control and monitor the irrigation process. The main objectives of this project
    are summarized as follows: Transferring the measured quantities by moisture sensors
    wirelessly to a central processing unit (Raspberry Pi). A WSN using XBee modules
    is utilized to achieve this task. The gathered data is transferred to the cloud
    for storing, visualizing, and monitoring the agricultural parameters. The system
    provides efficient automated irrigation that ensures high quality of crops, saving
    water, and reducing human involvement. The proposed solution, if it is generalized,
    especially in developing countries, will contribute to achieving two of the sustainable
    development goals (SDGs) [8]. First, it will ensure Goal#1 (No poverty). Second,
    it will partially ensure Goal#6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). These facts motivate
    us to provide this solution at the global level and also encourage us to provide
    a solution that contributes to the exploitation of our local water resources in
    Palestine, which suffers from the water scarcity problem. The rest of the paper
    is structured as follows: The related approaches for developing smart irrigation
    systems are reviewed in Section II. Section III presents the details of the proposed
    design and architecture. The implementation and experimental results are discussed
    in Section IV. Finally, the conclusion and future directions are drawn in Section
    V. SECTION II. Review of Related Works Several IoT related approaches have been
    employed in different manners for developing automated irrigation solutions. The
    proposed solutions vary in terms of their complexity, and the modules used in
    them, such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, types of sensors based on the targeted problem
    nature and the main objectives. In this section, we review the recent works that
    are directly related to our proposed system. Anbarasi et. al [9] proposed an IoT-based
    smart irrigation framework with the aim of increasing the crop yield. In this
    system, a real-time decision was made based on the collected data from the land.
    A moisture sensor was used to sense the level of soil moisture, and a pumping
    motor will turn OFF or ON based on the sensed data. To provide the farmer with
    information about moisture content and temperature of the soil at particular times,
    a web-based application was developed. An automated irrigation system using the
    Arduino microcontroller was introduced by Hassan et al. [1]. In this system, a
    soil moisture sensor was utilized to check the soil humidity of the plant. Based
    on the sensed soil moisture level, the system will let the water pump to automatic
    irrigate the plant when it is too dry and turn off the water pump when the soil
    of the plant is wet. The proposed solution is composed of one sensing node. It
    is simple and did not handle the gathered data. It provides the monitoring function
    where users can check the soil moisture based on the reading on the Liquid Crystal
    Display (LCD). In 2018, Al-Omary et al. [10] introduced a smart cloud-based IoT
    strategy for monitoring and controlling the garden irrigation process using Arduino
    Uno. Two sensors (soil moisture and light intensity) were used to monitor and
    maintain the garden soil moisture and the light intensity quantities. These quantities
    are continuously sent to ThingSpeak cloud-based framework in which the received
    data is visualized and analyzed. The proper decision is sent accordingly from
    the cloud to the automatic irrigation system to water the garden. However, the
    authors did not consider other irrigation parameters, such as air humidity and
    temperature. Besides, transferring all gathered data to the cloud would require
    a massive amount of data and increase the latency and privacy issues. Fawzi and
    Jalal [11] utilized a WSN-based IoT strategy to design and implement a smart irrigation
    system. The WSN was employed for gathering, storing, and sharing sensors data.
    Two types of sensors, namely Telosb and VH400, were used. Telosb was employed
    for measuring light, temperature, humidity, and energy, while the VH400 sensor
    was used to measure soil moisture. Gathered data is sent to the cloud server for
    analysis and computation purposes. In this system, the concept of fog computing
    was not considered. In other words, all gathered data is sent to the cloud server
    for analysis and decision making. In 2019, an automatic irrigation system based
    on Arduino was proposed by Okoye et al. [7]. The primary purpose of this study
    was to identify the irrigation time for three different types of soil in Nigeria.
    For this purpose, Arduino Uno integrated with soil moisture was used to control
    the irrigation process. The water level and other essential data status are displayed
    on an LCD. This system is simple and dedicated to studying how irrigation time
    depends on the type of soil. It did not consider the main concept of IoT because
    the collected data are not shared via the internet. Mostly, it is clear from the
    reviewed studies that most of them used Arduino Uno. Few of them deployed WSNs
    and cloud-based approaches. Besides, those who considered the cloud services were
    transferring all gathered data to the cloud for analysis and decision-making.
    Fog computing concepts mostly did not utilize. This strategy is not scalable,
    especially when a massive amount of data is generated and thus increases the latency
    and privacy issues. These facts motivated us to propose an efficient smart irrigation
    framework by utilizing the efficiency of WSN, fog computing, and cloud-based services.
    SECTION III. The Proposed System and Architecture This study aims to propose an
    efficient smart irrigation framework. The system can be divided into three parts
    (or subsystems) that cooperate to achieve the purpose: A Wireless Sensor Network,
    a central processing unit, and cloud computing services. The complete smart watering
    architecture is depicted in Figure 1. The following subsections introduce the
    theoretical background as well as the main components of each part. A. Wireless
    Sensor Network The sensor is a device that measures a property of the physical
    environment, such as moisture, and converts it to data. The WSN consists of interconnected
    sensor nodes that communicate wirelessly to collect data about the surrounding
    environment [12]. In this project, the main parts of the WSN are sensor nodes,
    and the coordinator (gateway). 1) Sensor Node In general, the sensor node is employed
    to gather data from different types of sensors. It can accomplish limited processing
    tasks based on available resources. The main feature is the presence of the transceiver
    that allows the exchange of information with other nodes. The main four units
    that describe any sensor node are sensing unit, processing unit, transceiver unit,
    and power source unit [13]. In this project, we employed the following four components

    Arduino Uno Arduino is an open-source platform utilized for developing electronic
    projects. We selected Arduino Uno due to its flexibility and ease of integration
    with the XBee module. The primary purpose of Arduino in this project is to read
    the input values of the connected sensors and send them serially to the connected
    Xbee module. • YL-69 Moisture Sensor This sensor is usually used to measure the
    humidity of the soil (see Figure 2 (b)). In this project, we used the analog signal
    pin, and thus the output voltage value will be between 0 and 1023. The voltage
    value decreases as the soil becomes more moisture while it increases as the soil
    becomes dry. • The Humidity and Temperature Sensor (DH22) The DH22 is a digital-output
    sensor utilized to measure relative humidity and temperature. This sensor can
    get new readings every 2 second, so timing should be considered carefully. For
    more details, refer to the sensor datasheet [14]. • XBee Wireless Communication
    Module It is a wireless communication module useful for applications that require
    low-power consumption. It is easy to deploy and can be configured using the XBee
    Configuration and Test Utility (XCTU) platform [15]. XBee can also ensure the
    safe delivery of data to the targeted node using addressing, acknowledgments,
    and retries. The checksum approach is used to ensure error-free communication.
    XBee module can be distinguished by two addresses: a fixed 64-bit address that
    is not configurable (MAC address) and a 16-bit configurable address. Two types
    of communication modes, called transparent mode and Application Programming Interface
    (API) mode, can be utilized to describe the way the host device communicates with
    an XBee module through the serial interface. In the API mode, a protocol is used
    to identify the way information is exchanged. In this mode, data is encapsulated
    in a structured packets called frames, the structure of the frame is defined by
    four parts: start delimiter, length, Frame Data, and checksum as shown in Figure
    3. This mode is better for large WSN when data collected from multiple remote
    locations. Therefore, we used it in this work. • Power Source Unit and Power Management
    The moisture sensor will be planted in the soil, so the nodes, as well as the
    attached sensors, are far from the power source. In this prototype, we used a
    9v Alkaline battery to provide the sensor node with the required power. We can
    also utilize solar panels to recharge the batteries. Minimizing the energy used
    by the device or increasing the battery capacity will increase the lifetime of
    the battery and reduce the total cost of ownership of the product. XBee transceiver
    is the most critical part of this project (the most significant energy-consumption
    part). Therefore, the XBee should be appropriately configured to allow it to work
    in the sleep mode most of the time. In this project, the remote XBee remains in
    the sleeping mode for a while and wakes up when it receives data from the microcontroller.
    Moreover, the ZigBee communication protocol used in our solution is distinguished
    as a low power consumption protocol compared to other wireless protocols such
    as Wi-Fi. Fig. 3: API mode frame structure Show All B. Zigbee Wireless Communication
    Protocol ZigBee is a primary type of wireless communication protocol that is used
    for communication in Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN). The low power consumption,
    low data rate, and low cost are the main features of ZigBee. Therefore, it is
    practical for low power and low data rate application domains. A Zigbee device
    in the WSN can be configured to be an end device, router, and coordinator [16].
    In this work, we implemented a WSN that contains two end nodes and one coordinator.
    The XBee modules attached with Arduino are configured to be the end devices, while
    the XBee module connected to Raspberry Pi is configured to be the coordinator.
    C. The Processing Node This is the second subsystem of the proposed framework.
    This subsystem consists of a Raspberry Pi, a coordinator XBee module, and a solenoid
    water electrical valve. The primary purpose of this node is to collect data from
    the remote devices, analyze them, and control the irrigation process. 1) Raspberry
    Pi We utilized a raspberry Pi 3 [17] to control the smart irrigation process.
    The main tasks are summarized as follows: Read data from the connected coordinator
    XBee module, which is collected from the remote wireless nodes. Python code is
    implemented to analyze the gathered sensors quantities. Based on the analyzed
    data, the general purpose input/output (GPIO) pins are utilized to control the
    electrical water valve. In other words, it will decide whether to irrigate or
    not. The collected data are transferred to cloud using ThingSpeak API. Fig. 4:
    The processing node components Show All It is worth mentioning that the Raspberry
    Pi in our solution is considered as the fog computing node. As mentioned earlier
    it has the ability to analyze the data and provide the proper decision. This will
    handle the problems of cloud-based computing, such as high latency and security
    issues. Due to the limited resources available in the Raspberry Pi, we transfer
    the data to the cloud for storing, visualizing, and analyzing the vast amount
    of generated data. 2) The Coordinator XBee and Explorer Dongle We used one XBee
    module as a coordinator. The main purpose is to collect data sent from the remote
    end devices. It is connected directly to the raspberry pi by using the XBee explorer
    dongle, as shown in Figure 4(b). 3) Solenoid Electrical Valve In our prototype,
    we used a 12v solenoid valve to control the flow of water. However, the Raspberry
    Pi can provide a maximum of 5 volts. To handle this issue, we used a 2-channel
    relay module. D. The Cloud Computing Unit (Thingspeak IoT Cloud) Since there is
    a massive amount of generated data, analyzing and storing it is a significant
    challenge. The IoT makes the ability of providing and exchanging different physical
    data efficiently possible. This is achieved by connecting electronic sensors used
    in physical devices to the internet [10]. To improve the effectiveness of the
    proposed system and to benefit from the cloud services, we used ThingSpeak IoT
    cloud. ThingSpeak is an IoT analytical platform cloud service that can be utilized
    to aggregate, visualize, and analyze live data streams in the cloud. The REST
    API calls such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, can be used to create and update
    ThingSpeak channels and charts (update an existing channel, clear a channel feed,
    and delete a channel) or retrieve data from channels. In this project, since the
    Raspberry Pi is connected directly to a stable power supply, and we have enough
    resources, we used the REST API to send data. In summary, we utilize ThingSpeak
    cloud service for three main purposes: Store and visualize the received data from
    the Raspberry Pi using different types of charts. Provide farmers and interest
    persons with a live streaming platform to monitor the status of the plants, create
    instance visualization, and sending alerts. The gathered data can be utilized
    to extract hidden and valuable knowledge by employing Data Mining and Machine
    Learning techniques. This helps farmers and others for planning and decision-making.
    It is also helpful for early prediction purposes. E. Addressing the Major Security
    Issues Protecting the system from intruders is becoming very important challenge
    that should be considered when designing WSN and IoT solutions [13]. In WSNs,
    various threats may pose due to several security issues. These issues are at the
    hardware and software levels. The deployment nature of sensor networks makes them
    more vulnerable to various attacks [18]. For instance, in our proposed WSN, the
    moisture sensor employed in the sensor node should be placed in the soil that
    makes it highly prone to capture and physical vandalism. To handle the majority
    of security issues, our proposed solution have already some efficient techniques,
    and we will suggest other solutions for future application and to make the system
    safer. Regarding the physical/hardware security, we suggest employing a surveillance
    system based on cameras and motion detection techniques to protect and observe
    the whole farm. At the software level, we used the XBee ZigBee module to provide
    efficient strategies that will prevent most of the attacks. It can ensure the
    safe delivery of data to the targeted node using addressing, acknowledgments,
    and retries. The device does not process frames sent through the serial interface
    with incorrect checksums and ignores their data. Moreover, ZigBee offers encryption
    services, authentication, and application services such that each node belongs
    to a predefined cluster and can take a predefined number of actions. These techniques
    are useful against passive information gathering, message corruption, and traffic
    analysis attacks. SECTION IV. Implementation and Experimental Results A. Design
    and Implementation The proposed prototype was designed and implemented using different
    hardware and software components as follows: • Hardware Components 1 x Raspberry
    Pi 3, 2x Arduino Uno, 2x Moisture sensor YL-69, 2x Humidity and temperature sensor
    DH22/AM2302, 3x XBee RF series 1 (2 end devices and 1 coordinator), lx XBee explorer
    dongle, 2x 9v and 1x12 v batteries, 2-channel relay module, 2x solenoid electrical
    valve 12v. • Software and Protocols XCTU, Raspbian Operating System, Arduino IDE,
    Python 3, ZigBee communication protocol, ThingSpeak IoT platform, XBee libraries
    The Arduino is programmed using IDE and C++ programming language, while Raspberry
    Pi was programmed using Python programming language. XCTU platform was used to
    setup the configuration for XBee modules such as PAN, source and destination 16-bit
    addresses, names, and operation modes. The main configurations for the employed
    XBee modules are reported in Table I. The performed steps by the sensing node
    and control unit are presented in Figures 5 and 6, respectively. Fig. 5: Sensor
    node process Show All Table I: XBee modules configurations B. Experimental Results
    At this phase of the project, we were satisfied with verifying that the proposed
    model is working properly in all its parts. The investigated prototype is shown
    in Figure 7. Figure 8 shows a sample of the live data streams visualization obtained
    from ThingSpeak platform over a period of time. Fig. 6: Control unit process Show
    All Fig. 7: The proposed irrigation system prototype Show All Fig. 8: Charts obtained
    from thingspeek cloud platform Show All SECTION V. Conclusion and Future Directions
    In this paper, an efficient cloud-based IoT framework for controlling and monitoring
    the irrigation process was designed and implemented. The main objective is to
    save water and improve the quality of crops. The proposed system was implemented
    based on WSN, Raspberry Pi, and ThingSpak IoT cloud platform. It was obvious from
    the implemented prototype that the WSN integrated with ThingSpeak platform provides
    more flexibility in monitoring and managing the system. For future work, extensive
    experiments will be conducted on real crops and analyze the resulting data using
    machine learning to obtain useful recommendations. A comparison can be performed
    with the traditional irrigation systems in terms of water consumption and the
    quality of crops to ensure the effectiveness of the proposed model. Moreover,
    the system can be adapted to consider more environmental data by adding different
    types of sensors. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like

  description: Generally, it is possible to increase agricultural output while decreasing

    the Internet of things (IoT) played a vital role in designing a platform to monitor
    a farm wirelessly, reducing human involvement, allowing remote observing, and
    remote control of the design using a public IP address based cross-platform, Apache,
    MySQL, PHP and Perl (XAMPP) Apache package. A cloud is appealing when a wireless
    sensor network generates a lot of data. Cloud-based wireless communication systems
    are being tested to monitor and manage a set of sensors and actuators to estimate
    paddy (rice) water requirements in a particular location. The proposed design
    shows robust interaction between two microcontrollers to deal with different sensors
    and simultaneously act as a WiFi unit. The row data obtained from the sensors
    is uploaded to the cloud through specific Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) files to
    store and fetch the data from the database. Through the programming method, the
    system focuses on tracking the paddy growing value and the amount of water available
    in the soil, which should be around (10 Kpa) for an optimum paddy environment.
    The results emphasized that 80% of water is retained when a maximal 10 Kpa of

  description: The Internet of Things (IoT) and convolutional neural networks (CNN)
    integration is a growing topic of interest for researchers as a technology that
    will contribute to transforming agriculture. IoT will enable farmers to decide
    and act based on data collected from sensor nodes regarding field conditions and
    not purely based on experience, thus minimizing the wastage of supplies (seeds,
    water, pesticide, and fumigants). On the other hand, CNN complements monitoring
    systems with tasks such as the early detection of crop diseases or predicting
    the number of consumable resources and supplies (water, fertilizers) needed to
    increase productivity. This paper proposes SAgric-IoT, a technology platform based
    on IoT and CNN for precision agriculture, to monitor environmental and physical
    variables and provide early disease detection while automatically controlling
    the irrigation and fertilization in greenhouses. The results show SAgric-IoT is
    a reliable IoT platform with a low packet loss level that considerably reduces

  explanation: The highlighted section of the manuscript investigates the effectiveness
    of transmitting sensor and camera data to cloud-based platforms using protocols
    like MQTT, CoAP, or AMQP for remote access and analysis. The specific point of
    focus is how this particular step contributes to the overall efficiency and precision
    of automated irrigation systems. The authors demonstrate that the data transmission
    component is foundational to real-time automated irrigation systems because it
    enables continuous monitoring of soil conditions, crop health, and irrigation
    water utilization. This allows for optimized decision-making regarding irrigation
    scheduling, water conservation, and overall crop management. A reliable and efficient
    data transmission system ensures that data is transmitted accurately and securely,
    promoting the reliability and effectiveness of the entire automated irrigation
    system.

    IEEE 802.15.4 1. Introduction As the world population increases uncontrollably,
    two critical resources are becoming a severe problem: water and food. The technical
    report published in [1] estimates that the world population will reach 9.15 billion
    in 2050. This trend motivates a growing food production to accommodate the large
    global population with the consequent limitation in farmlands and a decreasing
    number of farmers as fewer people are willing to work in farming. For example,
    a Virginia winery applied to hire foreign workers to pick grapes after the company
    could not find American citizens who wanted the job [2]. Agriculture provides
    the required food but consumes most of the Earth’s available fresh water. In Europe,
    the agricultural sector consumes a third of the total water supplies, affecting
    the quantity and quality of open water for other uses [3]. In Mexico, 75.72% of
    water is used in agriculture [4]. For example, about 240 gallons of water are
    required to produce a loaf of bread, and a pound of cheese takes about 382 gallons.
    So, a simple cheese sandwich takes about 56 gallons of water [5]. Several governments
    have made investing in the agricultural sector a priority. In Mexico, the Federal
    Government defined agricultural technification as a goal of 520 thousand hectares,
    representing 10 percent of the ground with irrigation systems [6]. In a global
    world, it is critical to efficiently monitor crops to significantly increase production
    and rationalize the use of consumables, materials, and supplies, as well as regulate,
    more precisely, the crop needs regarding irrigation water, fertilizers, fumigants,
    and pesticides. Preserving the water is an essential factor that considerably
    affects agriculture and requires the development of automated mechanisms to use
    it efficiently. Fertilizers, fumigants, and pesticides help grow vital crops and
    produce better harvests. However, when misused, they could be detrimental to plants
    and render them inedible for human consumption. The use of technology will improve
    the proper use of resources applied to agriculture. The purpose of applying technology
    is to improve labor and land yields while optimizing the use of resources. However,
    agriculture automation is complex, as several problems must be solved. Applying
    technology to automate the agricultural environment will demand more technically
    savvy farmers who can manage data. That is why it is necessary to modernize the
    process and train the farmer to develop his technological skills. That is why
    it is necessary to generate simple mechanisms that thoroughly explain the data
    obtained. However, the system must be considered an assistant adapted to the needs
    and knowledge of the farmer. Agricultural production can be affected by different
    circumstances, such as plant diseases and pests, which, according to the FAO,
    are responsible for 20 to 40% of production losses [7]. However, manually monitoring
    all supplies, soil variables, environmental conditions, and crop health is a challenge
    that demands a lot of effort. An easy way to monitor and gather ecological information
    over long periods is required [8]. Therefore, the development and deployment of
    new technological solutions and methods to improve and automatize water use and
    detect crop diseases, considering not only the experience of farmers but also
    soil conditions and characteristics, types of plants, and climatic information,
    are needed. Technology in agriculture evolved into the precision agriculture concept,
    which focuses on ensuring that the crops and soil perform optimally. Precision
    agriculture provides profitability, sustainability, and environmental protection
    [9] based on field information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction,
    and pH level, among others. Farmers can make informed decisions about consumable
    resources and supplies (water, fertilizers, and pesticides) to maximize crop yield
    and protect the environment and their product consumers using precision agriculture.
    In [10], authors defined three essential tasks for precision control of the production
    environment: (I) monitoring parameters that influence the product yield and quality,
    (II) performing an in-depth analysis of collected data for making decisions, and
    (III) applying the best actions and mechanisms based on those decisions. Several
    technology-based solutions for gathering and processing information (such as [11,12,13,14,15])
    to support agriculture, facilitate decision making, and enhance productivity have
    been proposed in the literature. Moreover, recent advances in electronic technology
    enabled the creation of new, smaller, and cheaper devices for gathering environmental
    data to support ubiquitous computing, ad-hoc and sensor networks, cloud computing,
    and the Internet of Things [10,16]. IoT helps cultivate the soil using cheap,
    easy-to-install devices to increase farm productions to meet the world’s food
    demands based on precision agriculture [17,18,19], intelligent irrigation control
    [20,21,22], and greenhouse monitoring [23,24,25]. This technology can be applied
    in open and closed spaces to optimize consumables and supplies (fertilizers, pesticides,
    soil, and water) by setting automated alarms and threshold values for each resource.
    Suppose one collected data is out of the threshold value. In that case, a warning
    will be triggered, thus detecting problems affecting production and reducing the
    excessive consumption of supplies shortage risk. On the other hand, plant monitoring
    is imperative to detect diseases early and implement mechanisms to prevent their
    spread and production losses [26]. Traditional methods focus on either I) expert
    visual estimation or II) laboratory studies [27]. The first method is subjective
    and therefore has low accuracy. The second method identifies morphological characteristics
    to detect the disease. The main problem with these methods is that they are expensive,
    time consuming to process, and their detection efficiency is low. In recent years,
    plant disease detection automatization has integrated technologies such as image
    processing [28,29], pattern recognition [30,31], and computer vision [32,33].
    This paper presents SAgric-IoT, a technology platform based on IoT and CNN for
    monitoring physical variables and plant disease detection for precision farming.
    The platform uses communication algorithms for data monitoring and analysis for
    precision control of the production environment. In addition, it uses convolutional
    neural networks for plant disease identification and classification. We aim to
    develop a robust, low-maintenance, and low-cost IoT platform to control and optimize
    crop production. The remaining paper sections are as follows. Section 2 reviews
    IoT and precision agriculture. Section 3 describes the proposed technological
    platform in detail. Section 4 explains the system evaluation, describes the scenario,
    assessment, and results obtained from a small-scale network, and Section 5 summarizes
    our work and proposes future research. 2. Related Work IoT has had a strong impetus
    in the last few years. In the literature, several works propose IoT architectures
    and platforms suited for applications such as agriculture [19,34,35], traffic
    control [36,37,38], smart cities [39,40,41], education [42,43,44], marine environments
    [45,46,47], and health care [48,49,50,51,52]. Technology and IoT-based agricultural
    applications for control and automatization of physical variables monitoring (such
    as soil temperature and moisture, leaf wetness) for precision agriculture have
    been published in the literature [53,54,55,56,57,58]. The results obtained in
    this work were the nodes’ design, the simple node interconnection architectures
    based on IoT or wireless sensor networks design, and a combination to create a
    communication network of nodes for crop monitoring. Other IoT-based platforms
    control water consumption using cellular technologies and cloud services [59,60,61].
    However, the main problem of these works is that they only show prototype nodes
    that control or monitor water usage but only evaluate their performance without
    showing concrete results. In [62], the authors present a collaboration between
    process control and remote sensors. However, the authors did not explain the data
    acquisition and delivery process from different sources (sensors, actuators, coordinators).
    Most of these applications use proprietary systems to generate and process vast
    amounts of data, sometimes only at the research level [63]. The main problem with
    these works is that they only remain in architecture proposals without developing
    prototype nodes to test in real scenarios. Authors in [64,65] focused on minimizing
    production risk using wireless sensor networks for real-time monitoring and studying
    the inter-temporal environmental variability. Their results showed the importance
    of measuring and recording inter-temporal conditions that contribute to making
    decisions that improve productivity in agriculture, reinforcing the rationale
    for how IoT technology contributes to and facilitates the data collection process.
    In [66,67], authors studied the effects of energy balance in greenhouse production
    and the optimization of energy consumption in grape production to increase energy
    efficiency. The results show an improvement of up to 31% in energy consumption
    in greenhouses compared to those that do not use IoT technologies. In reference
    [68], the authors argue that cleaner crop production procedures would improve
    energy efficiency in agriculture. However, authors in [69] argued that technology
    is not the unique factor influencing modern agriculture. The key to a smooth transition
    toward sustainable agriculture requires the collaboration of technology, farmers,
    industries, financial institutions, and policy and decision-makers, among others.
    This collaboration would resolve conflicts and reduce deficiencies to promote
    sustainable development [70]. For disease detection, convolutional neural networks
    have become one of the most widely used tools for this activity [71,72,73,74].
    In [75], CNNs have been combined with learning vector quantization (LVQ) to detect
    and classify tomato leaf diseases. In another work, the authors combined four
    CNN models (Inception, Resnet, Inception Resnet, and Densenet) for plant disease
    detection, achieving an accuracy of 87% [76]. Other authors have focused on creating
    real-time models for rapidly detecting plant diseases [77,78,79,80] and evaluated
    the performance of models such as LeNet, VGG16, ResNet, and Xception in plant
    disease detection, obtaining accuracy levels of around 95%. Finally, some authors
    have proposed their models, getting results with accuracy levels of up to 98%
    [81,82,83,84]. 3. SAgric-IoT Platform Description SAgric-IoT is an easy-to-deploy,
    use, maintain, and upgrade platform for monitoring and controlling IoT for agricultural
    production. SAgric-IoT is based on low-cost and low-powered components which would
    be adapted to the farmer’s requirements. SAgric-IoT is focused on monitoring,
    data gathering, data processing, and data analysis to improve the efficiency of
    open and closed fields, reducing human interactions and rationalizing the use
    of water and other resources. In this section, we first describe the general scenario
    used in SAgric-IoT. Next, we provide a review of the logical architecture of SAgric-IoT.
    Then, we explain in detail the designed hardware for our platform. We describe
    the dissemination protocol used in SAgric-IoT. Finally, we describe the convolutional
    neural network model implemented for plant disease detection. 3.1. General Scenario
    Figure 1 shows the IoT on-site scenario for the SAgric-IoT platform. The architecture
    consists of four main nodes: the sensor nodes, the camera nodes, the gateway node,
    and the processing and storage node. Sensor nodes gather data from all sensors
    and periodically send it to the gateway node via other sensor nodes or directly,
    depending on the node’s distance from the gateway node. They are deployed on the
    greenhouses and establish a wireless network (based on 802.15.4) to communicate
    among themselves using radio-frequency links. The camera nodes send the images
    via Wi-Fi to the gateway node, where the trained CNN model for plant disease detection
    is stored. When the model identifies a possible disease situation in the crop
    area, a notification indicates the camera’s location and the detection image.
    A gateway node is also deployed along with the sensor nodes to enable a connection
    between the SAgric-IoT platform and the Internet (cloud server). The gateway node
    supports three communication interfaces: ZigBee to maintain communication with
    the sensor nodes, Wi-Fi to connect to the camera nodes, and a cellular interface
    to transmit data to the storage and processing node. A farmer has remote access
    to the gathering data to know the greenhouse conditions and control the different
    sensor and actuator devices and alert notifications when the CNN model detects
    a crop health problem situation. The gateway node includes a cellular network
    interface to transmit all gathered data to the cloud server. A web and mobile
    application were created as a cloud service to consult data information, receive
    alert notifications, and decide about control systems. Figure 1. General scenario
    for SAgric-IoT. 3.2. Layered IoT Architecture The SAgric-IoT design complies with
    the remote monitoring needs, contributing to reducing human resource investment.
    SAgric-IoT defines a five-layered model (as shown in Figure 2) with a transparent
    interconnection of all platform components and data dissemination in the agriculture
    precision area. The defined architecture covers all seven OSI model layers, as
    described in the following sentences. The gathering layer comprises the data link
    and physical layers. The communication layer is integrated with the data link
    and network layers. Finally, the processing and end-user layers are directly related
    to the four upper layers (transport, session, presentation, and application).
    The security layer is a transversal layer that interacts with the other layers
    of the architecture to obtain an end-to-end security level. Figure 2. SAgric-IoT
    five-layered architecture. 3.2.1. Gathering Layer The gathering layer collects
    data relevant to physical environmental parameters from a given area of interest
    from all the sources on farmland and sensor nodes on the fields (such as air temperature
    and humidity, soil temperature and moisture, and pH, among others). It also captures
    images through the cameras distributed in the monitoring region. In the last decade,
    several efforts have developed and defined low-power D2D standards and solutions
    [85,86,87], generating many promising radio technologies for D2D connectivity
    for local and wide area networks. One of the key challenges is determining the
    best data-transmission networking technology based on: transmission time, range,
    network size, and so on [88,89,90]. Table 1 summarizes some of the results of
    these past studies. Table 1. Comparison of wireless technologies for inter-node
    communication. 3.2.2. Communication Layer The communication layer transmits all
    data collected by sensor nodes to the gateway. This layer defines the communication
    protocol for data transmission. As sensors are stationary, the network topology
    does not change. Additionally, data transmission requires low latency, high reliability,
    and a high level of security to protect the collected data. The gateway node is
    powered by both ZigBee and Wi-Fi interfaces. This layer selects the best route
    to send the information by using several selection parameters, such as RSSI and
    the number of hops. 3.2.3. Processing Layer This layer processes large amounts
    of information using policy-based management to trigger alarms and improve production.
    Additionally, government agencies use processed results (such as SAGARPA in México)
    to develop production maps to help farmers define the best crops, the best fertilizers,
    and the quantity of water required for each season or production phase. Each crop
    type has its own value range for each physical parameter (such as soil temperature
    and humidity, pH level, environmental temperature, and moisture). These values
    are recorded on the platform. Table 2 shows an example of ideal physical parameters
    for tomatoes. Data are evaluated in real time to detect atypical values from the
    different physical parameters (values outside the defined range) that can represent
    abnormal conditions. Based on the data, the system can activate other systems
    (such as irrigation systems). Table 2. Physical parameters for tomatoes [89].
    The processing layer supports an extensive database that can accommodate massive
    amounts of data from the sensor nodes relayed through the communication layer.
    The database is interfaced with data analysis algorithms and real-time scripts
    for data visualization and evaluation (Figure 3). Figure 3. Block diagram of the
    cloud server in SAGric-IoT. The gateway node also implements the processing layer,
    where the CNN model is stored and processed to identify and classify diseases
    in the crop. 3.2.4. End User Layer This layer is responsible for facilitating
    the farmer’s access to the data through a web service and software tools using
    a web and mobile application. 3.2.5. Security Layer Security in the sensor nodes’
    communication is essential within the SAgric-IoT system. The nodes provide mechanisms
    for devices’ access control to the network, encryption (using symmetric key cryptography),
    and integrity to verify that the received frames were not altered, following the
    security schemes defined in the 802.15.4 standard. The data are encrypted before
    being sent (128-bit AES encryption) and then decrypted at the receiver for use.
    The following parameters were configured in each Xbee node: first, E.E. = 1: AES
    encryption enable, and the parameter KY: AES encryption key with a string of 32
    hexadecimal characters. Second, the camera nodes’ security with WPA2. The service
    provider controls the security of the processing and storage layers. Finally,
    the end-user accesses the system using a specific username and password and the
    secure HTTP protocol for connection to the system. 3.3. Electronical Board The
    main challenge of the design of the SAgric-IoT was to build low-cost and energy-efficient
    hardware capable of monitoring, gathering, and controlling physical parameters.
    The hardware board comprises four modules: microcontroller, sensors and actuators,
    energy, and a wireless communication module, as shown in Figure 4. Figure 4. Sensor
    node block diagram. The microcontroller module gathers information from the attached
    sensors and relays such data to the gateway node. Depending on the application,
    the microcontroller can be battery-powered, solar-powered, or backup battery-powered.
    We used the Microchip PIC18LF46K22 microcontroller that executes up to 16 MIPS
    (millions of instructions per second); an input voltage of 3.3 V is required,
    and its CPU max current is 9.0 mA due to its specifications and low cost. The
    microcontroller has 64 K bytes for program memory, 3896 bytes for RAM, and 1024
    bytes for EEPROM memory. An onboard 10-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with
    28 analog input channels and 35 I/O pins. Sensors and actuators are used in precision
    agriculture to measure different environmental parameters. We use the sensor shown
    in Table 3. Table 3. Used sensors in SAgric-IoT. AM2315 is an I2C-interface temperature
    and humidity sensor (Figure 5a). This sensor contains a DS18B20 temperature sensor
    and a capacitive humidity sensor. It has 3.5 to 5.5 V power and I/O and uses 10
    mA max current during conversion. On the other hand, the AM2302 is a basic, low-cost
    digital temperature and humidity sensor (Figure 5b). It uses a capacitive humidity
    sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air and outpost a digital signal
    on the data pin. The SHT-10 sensor includes a temperature/humidity sensor module
    (Figure 5c). The casing is weatherproof and will keep water from seeping into
    the sensor’s body and damaging it, but it allows air to pass through so it can
    measure the soil’s humidity (moisture). Humidity and temperature have 4.5% and
    0.5% precision readings, respectively. Figure 5. Sensors for SAgric-IoT (a) AM2315,
    (b) AM2302, and (c) SHT-10. We use XBee S2C radios connected to a microcontroller
    through a UART (universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter). This module operates
    on the 2.4 GHz ISM band, which significantly reduces the power consumption of
    our design. In addition, the module has a coverage area of up to 60 m in indoor
    spaces and 1200 m in outdoor locations with a line-of-sight range. It has a transmit
    power output of 3.1 mW. XBee modules provide wireless connectivity to end-point
    devices in ZigBee mesh networks. The gateway nodes use Raspberry Pi 3 Model B,
    which has a 1.2 GHz 64-bit quad-core ARMv8 CPU, an integrated 802.11n wireless
    LAN and Bluetooth 4.1, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), 4 USB ports, a display interface
    (DSI), and a micro-SD card slot. The camera nodes consist of an ESP32-CAM board
    with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and an OV2640 camera (Figure 6). This module contains
    a microSD card slot that serves as a support for the storage of images captured
    with the camera. Figure 6. ESP32-CAM module used for plant monitoring. 3.4. Proposed
    Dissemination Protocol For the design of the dissemination protocol, we considered
    two critical issues: energy and reliability. Energy is the most important issue
    when designing dissemination protocols for IoT, where the application demands
    continuous information from the network field. For the design of the dissemination
    protocol: (I) we defined a static network architecture based on clusters; (II)
    the gateway node has no energy constraints; (III) the gateway node is not within
    the range of each sensor node, so a multi-hop transmission is needed; and (IV)
    heterogeneous sensors are implemented in each node. Our protocol defines three
    types of nodes: end-node, routing, and gateway. End-node nodes gather data from
    the sensors but cannot retransmit data to other sensor nodes. Routing nodes are
    responsible for collecting and retransmitting data from different sensor nodes.
    They also maintain a routing table that allows nodes to choose the best route
    for data transmission. Finally, the gateway node is the central node that receives
    all the gathered data from different sensor nodes and sends it to the Internet.
    Figure 7 shows the state diagram for the protocol. Figure 7. States diagram for
    SAGric-IoT. Our protocol defines data and controls messages. The protocol starts
    when a sensor node switches on. Each sensor node starts in the gateway node and
    sends a control message (Register.request) requesting its inclusion on the IoT
    network. The gateway node registers the new node and sends it the response (Register.response),
    where indicated, the type of node in the network (sensor or routing node), according
    to the number of hops the message takes to reach the gateway node. If the sensor
    node is an end node, it gathers data from different sensors, sends them to the
    gateway node, and changes its status to sleep to save energy. If the sensor node
    is a routing node, the node is also responsible for retransmitting the data from
    other sensors, so the sensor nodes wake up using a timer or a routing transmission
    request. The sensor node changes its status from disconnected to setup status
    when it receives the response. Afterward, the sensor and gateway nodes exchange
    messages (setup.request, and setup.response) to establish the gathering time for
    each sensor. At that moment, a sensor node is ready to begin the data gathering,
    so its status changes to the gathering status. In this status, the sensor nodes
    get sensor values, structure them into frames, and send them to the gateway node.
    When a sensor node gathers data from the different sensors, it sends a new message
    to the gateway node. SAgric-IoT uses the MAC data frame defined by IEEE 802.15.4
    to build the message (Figure 8). Figure 8. Data message structure used in SAgric-IoT.
    The message contains frame control fields, destination address fields (in our
    case, we used 16-bit destination addresses), a data field where the data from
    the different sensors are included, and a checksum field to check that the message
    is not corrupted. This frame is sent to the gateway node through the data.transmit
    message. When the sensor node finishes sending data, it changes its status to
    Sleeping status (Sleep.on) to save energy for an established period. All sensors
    in the node and the microcontroller are off, and the node is considered a sleep
    node. When the sleeping time finishes, the sensor node wakes up and starts another
    data-gathering session from the sensors, or when the gateway node sends a request
    for information on data from the sensors. After the node gathers data and sends
    it to the gateway node, it goes to sleep again to save the battery (Sleep.on).
    3.5. Convolutional Neural Network Model The following paragraphs explain the proposed
    architecture for the plant leaf disease detection and classification model. The
    proposed model takes color images of plant leaves as input and displays the image
    with a series of labels representing the plant leaf health state (whether it is
    healthy or the name of the detected disease) and the prediction percentage value
    obtained by the model as output. 3.5.1. Dataset We used the public PlantVillage
    dataset of 20,600 images in 10 categories, available at [91]. Table 4 shows the
    categorized information contained in the dataset. Table 4. Categories of the PlantVillage
    dataset. For the project, only the tomato categories were used to test the model
    (a total of 16,012 images) [92]. The total dataset was divided into two parts,
    assigning 80% of the images for training (12,810 images) and the rest for validation
    (3202 images). The problem with the models is that during the training process,
    overfitting can occur (i.e., the model “memorizes” the dataset) [93]. Thus, we
    applied a method known as data augmentation [88] to increase the dataset. New
    images were created using transformation methods (rotation, brightness adjustment,
    and Gaussian noise) to complement the dataset. 3.5.2. Model Creation A model based
    on a convolutional neural network architecture was developed for the plant disease
    detection process. The model takes color 200 × 200 images normalized to (0,1)
    as input for training and validation. The neural network architecture consists
    of five convolutional layers using 256, 128, 64, 32, and 16 filters, respectively.
    The kernel size for the 2D convolution window was 3 × 3. Rectified linear unit
    (ReLU) was used as the activation model for each convolutional layer. MaxPooling
    layers were applied to each convolutional layer. In addition, a global average
    pooling layer was applied to convert the data to a column vector. This layer is
    connected to a dense layer of 10 output nodes (which represent the categories
    used in the model) that uses softmax as the activation model. 3.5.3. Model Training
    Table 5 shows the parameters for training the model and the Adam optimization
    algorithm. The model’s loss function was categorical_cross_entropy, one of the
    most widely used functions for multi-class classification. The number of epochs
    was 200. Table 5. Parameters for the training of the model. 4. Results 4.1. Prototype
    Evaluation We examined two scenarios to demonstrate the benefits of using SAgric-IoT.
    For the first scenario, we validate the performance of the sensor node and the
    data gathered from the different sensors by performing tests in a controlled environment
    (laboratory). Data measurements for the environmental parameters such as temperature
    and humidity were recorded every minute for three days using a set of sensor nodes
    separated by 10 m from the base station and connected directly in a star topology.
    The idea was to determine the node’s energy consumption and data transmission
    reliability in a situation of maximum sense frequency. For the second scenario,
    sensor nodes were deployed throughout the field to evaluate the dissemination
    protocol’s data-transmission performance. The environmental parameter data measurements
    were collected every 5 min for three days. The set of sensor nodes separated approximately
    50 m from each other, covering an area of 200 × 200 m, as shown in Figure 9. We
    defined levels to enable the multi-hop transmission model. Figure 9. Distribution
    of nodes for scenario 2. We evaluated SAgric-IoT performance by analyzing the
    nodes’ energy consumption and reliability. Moreover, we examined the performance
    of the SAgric-IoT protocol in comparison with an average transmission model without
    a sleep function into the node. For both scenarios, nine sensor nodes designed
    at the INNOVA THING® company (Colima, Mexico) and a gateway node were employed
    to interconnect a small-scale network. Two sensors per node gathered data from
    four physical variables (air temperature and humidity and soil humidity and temperature).
    For the cloud server, both Apache and MySQL were running on a computer with Ubuntu
    14.04. The gateway node uses a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B with a 1.2 GHz 64-bit quad-core
    ARMv8 CPU, an integrated 802.11n wireless LAN and Bluetooth 4.1, Bluetooth Low
    Energy (BLE), 4 USB ports, a display interface (DSI), and a micro-SD card slot.
    Each sensor node was set to sense each variable every five minutes. In the test,
    we gathered around five thousand values from the sensors and stored them in the
    cloud server database. Scenarios Results Figure 10a,b shows the energy consumption
    for scenario 1 with different nodes in a controlled environment. Results show
    the battery lifetime of a system by continually logging the measurement data.
    We observed that a node used in SAgric-IoT decreased around 11% of the battery
    life of its maximal level. However, a node with a standard transmission without
    sleep mode decreased 62% the battery life of its maximal level. These test results
    showed that high measurement frequency and data transmission should be avoided
    as the battery life would significantly decrease over a few days, resulting in
    lower quality of measured data and frequent battery exchange. As shown, SAgric-IoT
    reduces the average energy consumption by almost 44% compared to a standard transmission
    without sleep mode. Figure 10. Results for scenario 1. (a) Energy consumption
    per node; (b) received packets per node. Figure 10b shows the percentage of received
    packets per node for both types of transmission. The rate of received packets
    obtained by both transmission models, considering a directly connected scenario,
    is similar, with a percentage of successful transmissions at 99%. Figure 11 shows
    the results obtained for the second scenario, and Figure 11a illustrates the energy
    consumption for the different nodes in the field environment. The difference was
    significant in the energy consumption from the various nodes. Nodes 1 and 2 consumed
    only 13% of their energy; nodes 3 to 5 consumed 9%, while nodes 6 and 7 consumed
    5.6%, and nodes 8 and 9 consumed 3%. The main reason for that difference is the
    number of transmissions per node. As the nodes are nearer the gateway node, more
    communications are performed because they must transmit their data and data from
    other nodes. However, we observed that SAgric-IoT nodes saved around 26% more
    energy than nodes using transmission without our sleep mode, increasing the battery
    lifetime. Figure 11. Results for scenario 2. (a) Energy consumption per node;
    (b) received packets per node. The results show a significant difference between
    the two transmission modes, considering a multi-hop scenario. SAgric-IoT had a
    maximum loss of transmitted packets of 2%, while the other model had a total loss
    of 9%, as shown in Figure 11. In the initial conclusion, we can observe that the
    efficiency of SAgric-IoT is due to better control of the energy consumption for
    the sleep mode. If the energy consumption of the microcontroller and the sensors
    is regulated, the sensor nodes maximize their energetic benefits, increasing the
    node’s battery lifetime. 4.2. Model Evaluation The model was developed in Python
    with TensorFlow, Keras, and other libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and TensorBoard.
    Accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score were the evaluation metrics. The following
    equations represent how to calculate each. 𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦= 𝑇𝑃+𝑇𝑁 𝑇𝑃+𝑇𝑁+𝐹𝑃+𝐹𝑁 (1) 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛=
    𝑇𝑃 𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑃 (2) 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙= 𝑇𝑃 𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑁 (3) 𝐹1 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒=2× (𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛×𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙) (𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛+𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙)
    (4) TP represents the number of optimistic predictions, TN represents the number
    of negative projections, FP represents the number of false positives, and FN represents
    the number of false negatives. Results Obtained Figure 12 shows the model’s performance
    for leaf disease identification and classification during the training and validation
    phases. The results show an accuracy of 97.4% in the training phase and 92% in
    the validation phase, which are pretty good values and are within the range of
    values obtained in other published works in the literature. Figure 12. Model’s
    accuracy values during the training and validation processes. A confusion matrix
    was generated to analyze the results of how our supervised algorithm works [94,95].
    Figure 13 shows the confusion matrix. Figure 13. Confusion matrix of the proposed
    model, (0) tomato bacterial spot, (1) tomato late blight, (2) tomato yellow leaf
    curl virus, (3) tomato early blight, (4) tomato Septoria leaf spot, (5) tomato
    mosaic virus, (6) tomato target spot, (7) tomato leaf mold, (8) tomato spider
    mites two spotted, (9) tomato healthy. Results show that the proposed model predicted
    half of the classes with an accuracy equal to or greater than 98%. Only the class
    with the lowest number of images for training (Tomato_mosaic_virus) obtained a
    94% value. Table 6 concentrates on the proposed model’s results in the dataset’s
    disease classification process for each class. The recall metric is high in each
    category of the dataset, showing that the accuracy of the proposed model is high
    (>90%), correctly classifying the diseases. Table 6. Class-wise performance of
    the proposed model. The model was saved as a hierarchical data file and was used
    during the prediction process, with some results shown in Figure 14. Figure 14.
    Sample predicted images using the proposed model. Finally, a comparison was made
    with a work that analyzes different techniques for disease detection in tomato
    plants [96]. ResNet50, Xception, MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and DenseNet were compared
    with the five techniques used in this work. Our model was trained with the dataset
    used in that work (Plant Village), but with 13,112 images. The dataset was distributed
    80% for training and 20% for validation. The accuracy of the training process
    was compared. The results are shown in Figure 15. From these results, we can conclude
    two things. The first is that the proposed model only underperforms the VGG16
    model structure with a difference of about 1.2%. The second conclusion is that
    our model had a similar performance even when the training used a smaller number
    of images, which shows the stability of the proposed model. Figure 15. Performance
    comparison of the proposed model and existing models. 5. Conclusions In this paper,
    we evaluated SAgric-IoT, an IoT platform, in terms of packet delivery ratio and
    energy consumption in a small-scale network under a controlled environment (laboratory)
    and test bed conditions in a field, including its embedded system, the communication
    protocol, and its algorithms. SAgric-IoT reduces the intensive human involvement
    required in current agricultural information collection systems and provides information
    in a faster way. Results proved that SAgric-IoT is superior in energy saving and
    reliability of transmission. On the other hand, the CNN model for identifying
    diseases in the crop has high levels of accuracy, with average values greater
    than 95%. This value has an acceptable reliability level for detecting early disease
    problems affecting the yield. We conclude that SAgric-IoT is a viable solution
    to improve precision agriculture because it is a wireless platform that uses low-power
    algorithms for gathering data. Our future work focuses on the platform’s security
    to avoid integrity problems with the collected data that cause a reduction in
    the quality or quantity of production. Another significant challenge to solve
    in the next phase is to go from a model trained with images taken in the laboratory
    to images generated directly in the sowing field. Due to the lack of context and
    diversity in plant appearance, deep learning models trained on individual leaf
    photographs may need help identifying plant diseases in full plant images. However,
    several studies have shown that the use of a combination of leaf and full plant
    images, and the use of deep learning techniques, can improve the accuracy of plant
    disease detection. For example, a study [97] to detect tomato plant diseases used
    a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with laboratory-taken leaf images
    and real-world leaf images. The real-world leaf includes other elements, such
    as stems and other leaves. With this combination of training, they achieved an
    accuracy rate of 99.53%. Another recent study [98] used various images from a
    leaf dataset and manually taken photos, along with deep learning techniques, to
    detect diseases in grapevine plants and achieved over 80% accuracy in this mixed
    scenario. In summary, a deep learning model trained only with images of a single
    leaf may have difficulties recognizing diseases in plants in pictures of a whole
    plant. Still, the combination of leaf and entire plant images, as well as deep
    learning techniques, can significantly improve accuracy in disease detection in
    plants. In future work, the model will be trained with complete plant images and
    implemented in the real-time plant monitoring scenario. This way, it will be possible
    to check the crops’ conditions by leaf samples and directly monitor the plants
    from the images captured by the camera system, fully integrating it into the SAgric-IoT
    platform. Author Contributions Conceptualization, J.A.G.-I. and J.C.-C.; methodology,

  explanation: The study by Lopez-Riquelme et al. (2016) demonstrates the feasibility
    of using FIWARE, an open-source cloud computing platform, to design and implement
    a software architecture for precision agriculture. The architecture consists of
    a set of software components that allow for the storage and management of agronomical
    data in a normalized and standardized way. The components are designed to be reusable
    and scalable, and they are deployed on FIWARE's cloud infrastructure. The study
    presents the results of experiments that were conducted to validate the performance

    Keywords Precision AgricultureFIWARECloud ComputingWSN 1. Introduction Water and
    food are the main resources that meet the needs of human beings. Agriculture provides
    most of the food, but it also consumes most of the Earth’s available fresh water.
    Furthermore, agriculture is not only a food source, but the main income stream
    for more than 70% of population in certain regions of Earth, such as many areas
    in Africa with low-income economies (Chibuzor and Lionel, 2006). On the other
    hand, the food and agriculture sector represents 5.9% of world Gross Domestic
    Product (GDP), at least 35% of worldwide employment, and in the European context
    it is one of the largest manufacturing sectors (Brewster et al., 2012). In arid
    and semiarid regions, as Southern Spain, the water supply is an important factor
    that considerably affects agriculture. In fact, water optimization is a key requirement
    for sustainable and economically profitable crops in such areas (IDAE, 2005).
    Development of innovative irrigation systems that efficiently use water is a major
    priority. In these regions, farmers must irrigate their crops effectively; therefore,
    they must find new solutions and methods that improve the irrigation programming
    systems, taking into account not only the state of the soil and the plants, but
    also climate information. All these data should be properly interpreted to decide
    the most suitable actions to carry out. Precision Agriculture (PA) is a set of
    techniques that provide a suitable solution to these problems because it aims
    to optimize field-level management with regard to crop science by matching farming
    practices more closely to crop needs. Economic advantages are also obtained by
    boosting competitiveness through more efficient practices (e.g. better management
    of water usage and costs). On the other hand, Information and Communication Technologies
    (ICTs), such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS), and Geographic Information Systems
    (GIS), Remote Sensing and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), among others, are used
    to acquire information about the crop needs. PA techniques use this information
    to achieve the proposed objectives, in particular, intensive monitoring of crops,
    data analysis, decision making and application of control actions (López et al.,
    2015, Zhang et al., 2002). According to scientific literature, many ICT-based
    agricultural applications have been carried out during the last two decades (De
    la Rosa et al., 2016, García Morillo et al., 2015, López et al., 2015, Navarro-Hellín
    et al., 2015, Oates et al., 2015, Puerto et al., 2013). Most of these applications
    need to use a great amount of information that should be properly acquired or
    generated, processed and stored. Almost all of these solutions are based on proprietary
    systems or simply developed at research level, and both approaches are usually
    incompatible. Consequently, there is not currently (and it is probably hard to
    obtain), a common worldwide database with a normalized schema for freely sharing
    agricultural information between stakeholders in the context of PA. Having this
    database available would be very interesting for administrations and governments,
    since water resources distribution could be more efficiently planned. Moreover,
    appropriately processing the information by using novel statistical and Soft Computing-based
    approaches should be very useful for generating knowledge that enables taking
    decisions and predicting future undesirable happenings (or their consequences),
    such as droughts, plagues or climate events, among others. Given that building
    this kind of agricultural information storage should be enormously beneficial,
    new Cloud Computing-based techniques should be considered for meeting this goal.
    However, many of the existing PA-based systems are currently implemented by using
    traditional web hosting servers (Vyas et al., 2016). On the other hand, those
    that include Cloud Computing techniques often use general purpose cloud providers
    that do not offer agriculture-oriented specific services. Furthermore, most PA-based
    systems are usually designed ad-hoc with the purpose of solving a specific problem
    in a specific kind of crop; therefore, most solutions are not easily applicable
    in another context (Sales et al., 2013). Future Internet-based solutions could
    successfully address the problem. In particular, the Future Internet (FI) could
    be considered as a set of related emerging technologies and standards (Granell
    et al., 2016). Specifically, the pervasive connectivity promised by the Cloud
    Computing paradigm, the Internet of Things (IoT) phenomenon and Big Data innovations
    might lead to disruptive changes in the design and development of data-intensive
    applications as the required in PA. In particular, the EU’s Future Internet Public-Private
    Partnership (FI-PPP) is a program that aims to make service infrastructures and
    business processes more intelligent, more efficient and more sustainable through
    tighter integration with FI technologies (Brewster et al., 2012). The use of these
    technologies could allow researchers and developers to design and implement normalized
    storage systems for saving worldwide agronomical information that stakeholders
    could easily share and process with the aim of generating knowledge, useful for
    decision making in an agronomical context. In literature, works that analyse the
    possible benefits of applying Cloud Computing to Smart Farming can be found (Zhu
    et al., 2013, Choudhary et al., 2016); however, most of them do not address how
    to design software architectures in this context. The main objective of this work
    is focused on designing a cloud-based software architecture that enables the deployment
    of PA systems, based on the use of WSNs, capable of acquiring information of the
    crop, sending it to the cloud and transparently storing, managing and sharing
    such information. Such architecture consists of a set of software components that
    allow worldwide agronomical information to be warehoused in a common data warehouse
    that stores normalized information from the agronomical point of view. The Cloud
    Computing paradigm has been selected for designing and developing the mentioned
    architecture, since it exhibits interesting features, such as cost reduction,
    agility, scalability and elasticity, among others, when such paradigm is compared
    to other traditional web hosting services. In particular, the system has been
    deployed and proved in the FIWARE Cloud, since FIWARE is a part of the mentioned
    FI-PPP program and it provides certain advantages over other known cloud providers,
    mainly related to cost and the existence of specific products and services that
    could be used in the agricultural context. The tests have demonstrated that using
    such architecture, agronomical data registration is easy and transparent regardless
    of the used hardware architecture. The paper is organized as follows. Section
    2 describes the methodology, tools and software modules that have been used in
    this work, together with the hardware architecture that has allowed the Cloud-based
    software architecture to be properly validated. Section 3 shows the main obtained
    results. Such results have been appropriately discussed with the purpose of demonstrating
    that the proposed architecture (and, in general, the FI paradigm), provides interesting
    benefits and advantages in the agronomical context. Finally, main conclusions
    and future work are shown in Section 4. 2. Materials and methods In the PA context
    it is necessary to design systems capable of monitoring different variables that
    affect the crop growing process (soil, environment, water and plant), and to use
    appropriate techniques to analyse such information allowing stakeholders to take
    decisions related to production optimization. For this purpose, an autonomous,
    compact and wireless device, compatible with most agronomic sensors found in the
    market and which could be placed anywhere in the crop, has been developed. Specifically,
    the device is capable of sensing different parameters such as water content, temperature
    or electrical conductivity and matric potential in the soil, among others, at
    present. This allows the farmer to get information about the water needs of the
    crop in real time, and to take decisions about how to manage irrigation in an
    optimal manner. Such device is the essential component of a Wireless Sensor Network,
    that can be deployed with the aim of monitoring crops. The retrieved information
    should be properly stored and processed; consequently, an appropriate software
    architecture should be defined and implemented for this purpose. This software
    architecture should have a set of specific features and should meet some requirements.
    Particularly, it should allow the implementation of a distributed, reliable and
    secure collection of modules and components, which should be easily shared and
    reused. The mentioned architecture is also required to be scalable and elastic
    (from the hardware and software resources point of view). Finally, and not less
    important, such architecture should provide a set of rich, universal and easy
    to use Web Services, which enable the storage and management of information generated
    by most of devices and hardware architectures used in the context of agriculture.
    According to this purpose, a common worldwide database with a normalized schema
    for freely sharing agricultural information between stakeholders involved, in
    the context of PA, should be achieved. As it will be explained and justified below,
    the FIWARE platform has been selected for meeting the aforementioned features
    and requirements. The following subsections describe the farms where the sensor
    nodes have been deployed (with the purpose of validating the correct operation
    of the proposed software architecture). After this, the hardware architecture
    components and FIWARE modules that have been used will be described. Finally,
    the tests carried out for validating the cloud-based architecture will be also
    detailed. 2.1. Experimental plots/description of the farms Widhoc Smart Solutions
    S.L. is a Spin-Off of the Technical University of Cartagena, in Murcia (Spain)
    which provides products and services, mainly, for optimizing the irrigation water
    in the agricultural sector. This company, which has a lot of costumers of woody
    and horticultural crops, distributed in the southern of Spain (see Fig. 1), has
    allowed the proposed cloud PA-based system to be validated in a real environment
    with different kind of crops. This fact is relevant because most works in literature
    present ad-hoc case studies whose results are hardly applied to other environments
    and crops. However, in this work, the proposed software architecture has been
    validated in two of the Widhoc’s customers’ farms. Download : Download high-res

    crops, distributed in the southern of Spain where several WSNs have been deployed
    by the Widhoc company. Note that, since the Widhoc company has also deployed PA-based
    systems hosted by a traditional web hosting service, it has been possible to analyse
    and compare the results obtained with the new proposed system and the traditional
    web hosted system. The first experiment was carried out in a farm (FARM #1) of
    fino lemon trees (Citrus limon L. Burm.fil cv. 49.) on C. macrophylla Wester (Navarro-Hellín
    et al., 2015). The orchard consists of 10-year-old lemon trees, and it is located
    in Murcia (SE Spain), with GPS coordinates 38° 06’ 45.76” N, 1° 07’ 49.76” W and
    166 m of elevation. Tree spacing was 7.0 m × 5.5 m, with an average ground coverage
    of about 47%. Two drip irrigation lines (0.8 m apart) were used for each tree
    row. There were 4 emitters (4 L h−1) on both sides of each tree. The second experiment
    was carried out in a commercial plantation (FARM #2) of 12-years-old almond trees
    (Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A. Webb cv ‘Guara’), grafted on ‘GF 677’ rootstock, planted
    at a tree spacing 6 × 6 m, and located in Murcia SE Spain with coordinates 37°
    41’ 17.89” N, 0° 56’ 58.95” W and elevation of 33 m. The soil is characterized
    by a deep and homogeneous sandy – clay – loam with low organic matter (1.1%).
    The soil has a water-holding capacity of about 150 mm m−1 and bulk density varying
    within 1.3–1.59 Mg m−3. One drip irrigation line was used for each tree row with
    4 emitters (4 L h−1) for tree. The climate in the aforementioned farms is Mediterranean
    type. Average values of mean annual temperature and annual rainfall determined
    over 3 years of experiment (2013–2015), at a nearby automatic weather station
    were 18.1 ± 0.4 °C and 204.7 ± 18.7 mm, respectively. The corresponding value
    of reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) calculated by using the FAO–Penman–Monteith
    equation (Allen et al., 1998) was 1304.5 ± 30.4 mm. The information about soil
    characterization has been previously obtained from available data before installing
    the new system. 2.2. Hardware architecture The Widhoc GPRS Node, which is manufactured
    by the Widhoc Smart Solutions company, has been used with the purpose of validating
    the proposed software architecture. The electronic design of the node includes
    basic components plus several functionalities and characteristics described in
    this section. The modular design consists of several electronic boards: (1) A
    main board named MEWiN Mainboard (Multi-Environmental Wireless Node Mainboard),
    which includes the common components used in any WSN-based application. Some of
    these components are a microcontroller, a radio module, a real time clock and
    a microSD interface, among others. (2) A second board, named MEWiN GPRS-Board,
    which allows different types of commercial sensors to be connected. (3) Finally,
    a GPRS module is used with the aim of sending data from the sensors to the data
    server (Navarro-Hellín et al., 2015). The core of the MEWiN platform (see Fig.
    2a and b) is the low power microcontroller MSP430F2618 by Texas Instruments, in
    charge of managing the behaviour of the node. It includes a GPRS modem in the
    MEWiN GPRS-Board (see Fig. 2c), that is connected to the MEWiN Main-Board (see
    Fig. 2d), through expansion connectors, which are redirected to different analogue
    and digital I/O, to UART from microcontroller, to energy supply and to ground
    lines. The MEWIN GPRS-Board consists of several interfaces and voltage converters
    (two CC/CC converters of 12 V and 5 V; SDI-12, 0–3 V and 4–20 mA interfaces; and
    digital I/O), which allows the device to be connected with a large range of commercial
    sensors to use in several applications. One of the main characteristics of this
    interface board is the connection of a GSM modem in order to send information
    to the data server. In particular, the used modem is the SIM900 (SIMCom, Ida-Virumaa,
    Estonia), with the purpose of sending HTTP requests. Download : Download high-res

    2.3. The FIWARE platform Cloud Computing, also named on-demand computing, is defined
    as a kind of Internet-based computing that delivers on-demand shared data storage
    and processing resources to a wide range of devices. It is considered as a model
    that enables ubiquitous access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources,
    which are fast provided and released with minimal management effort, according
    to the existing demand (Kavis, 2014). Note that, Cloud Computing model goes beyond
    the concept of Internet hosting service. In fact, this paradigm offers different
    models of deployment, depending on the selected provider: private, public or hybrid
    clouds. In addition, the cloud model is designed by considering three connected
    layers: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software
    as a Service (SaaS), as shown in Fig. 3. SaaS layer enables final users to access
    Internet-based applications by using “thin” clients, such as those based on the
    use of browsers (HTTP/HTTPS clients), or apps executed in smart mobile devices.
    PaaS layer allows software developers to design and implement a wide range of
    applications delivered through the SaaS layer. Finally, IaaS layer could be considered
    as the most basic cloud-service model that provides physical machines and resources
    by using virtualization technologies (Voorsluys et al., 2011). Download : Download
    high-res image (259KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. A graphical
    representation of the three cloud layers available when a software architecture
    is implemented in a cloud provider. Nowadays, there are many providers that offer
    a wide variety of cloud-based services at the level of SaaS, PaaS and IaaS. In
    fact, many big companies, such as, Google, Microsoft or Amazon, among others,
    provide a great number of cloud services in the context of cloud storage, virtual
    servers, Business Intelligence (BI), Big Data management, Internet of Things (IoT),
    mobile applications, websites and web apps, financial services, genomics, retail
    and commerce, gaming or machine learning. There are even IoT platforms based on
    using services provided by such companies. For instance, the Kaa IoT platform
    offers services in a local virtual machine or in a virtual machine deployed by
    using an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. Most providers are oriented to supply
    a general framework that stakeholders can configure and customize according to
    the expected objectives; however, almost no provider provides specific services
    related to specific fields, such as, for example, agriculture. In addition, such
    providers often offer a very limited number of free resources, both at the level
    of PaaS and IaaS layers, by using a quotas-based system. One of the main problems
    in systems such as Google or Amazon is to easily estimate when free quotas will
    be exceeded. This problem could become serious since when an application exceeds
    the free quotas, the owner is charged for the additional usage up to a daily maximum
    amount that can be properly configured. Such configuration is not easy to define
    a priori. Consequently, the economic cost grows according to the usage. This paying-for-usage
    model could be a good strategy for many companies and developers that work in
    the field of ICT; however, it could also curb the intention of many non-ICT related
    users of using Cloud-based systems; in particular, in the context of Agriculture,
    where people could not become familiar with PA-based solutions. After considering
    the aforementioned benefits and drawbacks, the selected cloud framework for this
    work is FIWARE, which could be defined as a platform that “provides a rather simple
    yet powerful set of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that ease the development
    of smart applications in multiple vertical sectors”. Moreover, “the specifications
    of these APIs are public and royalty-free” and “an open-source reference implementation
    of each of the FIWARE components is publicly available, so that, multiple FIWARE
    providers can emerge faster in the market with a low-cost proposition” (Fiware
    Project, 2016). Furthermore, FIWARE community is committed to materialise the
    FIWARE mission, that is: “to build an open sustainable ecosystem around public,
    royalty-free and implementation-driven software platform standards that will ease
    the development of new smart applications in multiple sectors” (Fiware Project,
    2016). Particularly, FIWARE ecosystem provides both general and specific enablers
    for allowing developers to design, implement and deploy cloud-based solutions
    for many different problems that can be also delivered through the FIspace platform
    (an integrated collaboration system). More specifically, FIspace is a “Future-Internet-based
    extensible SaaS-platform fostering seamless, efficient, and effective business
    collaboration across organizational boundaries” (FIspace D200.1, 2013). This is
    another interesting feature that many cloud providers do not offer. One of the
    sectors considered by FIWARE is specifically the Agriculture field, throughout
    the SmartAgriFood Accelerator, which supports Small and Medium-sized Enterprises
    (SMEs) that develop smart services and apps to be addressed in the agri-food sector.
    In particular, the SME Widhoc, which has enabled the experiments of this work
    to be carried out, belongs to the set of companies that comprises such accelerator.
    In order to build a cloud software architecture deployed in FIWARE, it is necessary
    to know the set of components that the platform provides. In this work, the main
    goal of the proposed system is to allow agricultural information to be easily
    stored, shared and interchanged, in a reliable, secured, standardized and normalized
    way, by using a software architecture, whose modules are based on FIWARE components.
    In particular, in the experiments, such information is acquired by the WSN nodes
    described in Section 2.2, which have been specifically designed with the purpose
    of carrying out monitoring tasks in real agricultural environments. FIWARE provides
    a set of generic enablers (GE), that can be used as software components of different
    applications and/or architectures. Moreover, it includes security protocols, such
    as OAuth2, when the information is interchanged, since it is necessary to ensure
    the involved agents privacy. Table 1 shows a brief description of the main GEs
    that are available. Table 1. Set of main generic enablers provided by the FIWARE
    platform. Enabler Description Context Broker (CB) One of the main modules. It
    follows the Publish/Subscribe paradigm. It allows data communication to be conducted
    in an easy way by using a standard communication protocol based on Restful over
    HTTP. Main Context Broker (Orion CB) It is used at the SaaS level. Particular
    instance of CB GE It could be hosted by launching virtual machines in the context
    of IAAS. (More flexibility and privacy). Cosmos It is used with the aim of persisting
    such historical information coming from the CB (which is only capable of storing
    current data), achieving historical data storage and allowing the big data analysis,
    if required. Cygnus Injector It allows the CB GE to be connected to the Big Data
    Analysis GE. It is used for storing persistent data in Cosmos. Access control
    It is needed for authentication management. Wirecloud Application Mashup It is
    used with the aim of developing the apps user interfaces. Summarizing, in this
    work, a set of GEs, such as the CB GE, the Cosmos GE, the Cygnus Injector or the
    Wirecloud Application Mashup, are employed with the aim of easily making data
    flow between crops and users possible, in a standardized and normalized way, see
    Fig. 4. Once the necessary virtual machines (VM) have been created with the required
    resources, the CB instances are deployed on those servers that FIWARE makes available
    for developers on FI-Lab, defined as “a non-commercial sandbox environment where
    innovation and experimentation based on FIWARE technologies takes place” (Fiware
    Project, 2016). Download : Download high-res image (300KB) Download : Download

    components used in this work. 2.4. Description of the experiments Several experiments
    have been conducted with the aim of demonstrating the benefits of using the proposed
    FIWARE-based software architecture. First, a set of specific trials, at the laboratory,
    were designed in order to validate the performance of the GPRS node described
    in Section 2.2, when it exchanges information with the FIWARE cloud. Later, several
    nodes were deployed in the two farms described in Section 2.1, with the aim of
    ensuring that the system properly works in real scenarios. In this case, the farmers’
    feedback was also taken into account throughout a set of events organized by the
    Widhoc company, which allowed some selected customers to know the offered service.
    Such feedback has been especially useful to enhance the provided service. Specifically,
    three GPRS sensor nodes were deployed in FARM #1. On the other hand, four devices
    were deployed in FARM #2 for monitoring this crop. The selection of the number
    of nodes were made by several agronomists that works with the Widhoc company by
    considering several aspects, such as, economic cost of the components, suitability
    according to the parameters that should be measured and geographical and crop
    size issues. By taking into account all these features, only three and four nodes
    were needed, respectively. Particularly, four sensors were connected to all the
    GPRS nodes installed in both farms: (1) a MPS-6 (Decagon Devices, Pullman WA-USA)
    for measuring the soil matric potential and the temperature of the soil at a depth
    of 30 cm, and (2) three 10-HS (Decagon Devices, Pullman WA-USA) for measuring
    the volumetric water content at 20, 40 and 80 cm of depth, and located at 25 cm
    from a representative dripper and 2.25 m from the trunk. The mentioned sensors
    were used for measuring the matric potential (Ψm) and volumetric soil water content
    (θv) every 15 min. The data was sent to the platform every hour with the purpose
    of optimizing the power consumption. 3. Results and discussion This section details
    the main results obtained in this work and shows the main benefits of using the
    proposed FIWARE-based software architecture, whose working is fully described.
    3.1. Description of the proposed FIWARE software architecture As mentioned before,
    FIWARE could be defined as a Cloud Computing ecosystem that enables the design
    and development of applications in the Cloud, by using a set of free and open
    source generic and specific enablers. The software architecture proposed in this
    work has been developed by using the generic enablers previously described. The
    main objective is to provide an online, distributed, scalable, elastic, reliable
    and secured framework that allows stakeholders to store and process information
    and to generate valuable knowledge aimed to enable decision making in the PA context.
    In order to do this, a common worldwide database with a normalized schema, for
    freely sharing agricultural data, has been designed. Such database has been implemented
    by using the Cosmos and CB GEs. The global architecture of the system (see Fig.
    4), consists of the following modules: • A completely autonomous hardware device
    named “FIWARE Smart Agricultural Node”, that is in charge of reading the agricultural
    sensors connected to it and sending the information to the FIWARE server component.
    • A FIWARE software component capable of receiving all the information sent by
    the remote nodes, that is, a customized CB GE that runs in a private virtual machine.
    Later, such information is properly stored by using the Cosmos GE throughout the
    Cygnus connector. • A customizable graphic user interface that enables the visualization
    of the information. In particular, three interconnected widgets have been developed
    for this purpose in the FIspace platform. 3.1.1. The FIWARE server component The
    FIWARE server is in charge of receiving the information from the smart agricultural
    node, storing it and providing the suitable webservices that will be used by the
    graphical user interface to visualize the sensor information. It could be considered
    as a key element for the proposed software architecture, since it hosts the set
    of proposed software components that runs in the backend, since it runs in a virtual
    machine (VM), hosted in the FIWARE Lab (FILab), which allows developers to setup
    the basic virtual infrastructure needed to run applications that make use of the
    APIs provided by FIWARE GEs. As mentioned before, several FIWARE GEs have been
    used to implement the software architecture components (see Fig. 5), that runs
    in the FIWARE server: • The Context Broker GE (CB GE): It receives the data sent
    by the Smart Agricultural Node, throughout the Cygnus connector. A MySQL database
    (with one table) has been specifically designed for storing the sensor readings
    acquired by the GPRS nodes, see Fig. 6a; and the Cosmos GE (which uses four tables),
    see Fig. 6b, has been designed for storing information about how the nodes and
    sensors are organized. The tables of the Cosmos database are SystemAMS for saving
    the description of the installation; NodeAMS for storing the description of each
    deployed node in all the available installations; and SensorAMS and SensorTypeAMS
    for saving information about the type of sensors and the specific sensors connected
    to each node. Download : Download high-res image (380KB) Download : Download full-size

    Cosmos Server. • Tomcat Server: The Tomcat server communicates with both the Cosmos
    GE and the MySQL database, and provides the set of webservices that the frontend
    widgets use. • MySQL database: The purpose of the MySQL database (which stores
    the sensor readings with their timestamps), is to enable the development of those
    webservices that provide information to the frontend widgets with a very low latency.

    Fig. 5. Architecture of the FIWARE Server Component. The dataflow between the
    GPRS node and the Cosmos GE is shown in Fig. 7. The CB GE can be considered as
    the FIWARE entry point of the information generated by all the available sensors,
    and it stores the last received value from each one. The interaction between the
    sensors and the server is carried out by using properly configured Update Context
    and Subscribe Context operations. The connection between Cosmos and the CB is
    enabled by the Cygnus connector by using a subscribe operation. Thus, each sensor
    value (with its timestamp), is received by the CB entity and properly saved in
    the database. The persistence of data can be configured in two different ways:
    (1) Storing data according to specific time intervals (ONINTERVAL option); and
    (2) storing data when an attribute value changes (ONCHANGE option). In the proposed
    system, the ONINTERVAL option has been selected. Download : Download high-res

    of the data-flow between the GPRS node, the backend and the frontend. 3.1.2. Description
    of the graphical user interface The Application Mashup or Wirecloud GE (available
    in both FIWARE and FIspace), has been used during the graphical user interface
    design stage. In particular, if the user wants to access the information generated
    by the available sensors, he/she has to use the designed frontend. Only the Wirecloud
    API is needed if the frontend requests the last value of a specific sensor; however,
    it is necessary to implement other PHP and Javascript modules, if the historical
    information of an entity is required to be retrieved by using a frontend. The
    Wirecloud GE grants the ability of creating different applications that will be
    finally uploaded to the FIspace market place. Such applications can be developed
    using a wide range of different web programming languages, such as HTML, CSS,
    Javascript, PHP or XML, among others. In this work, different widgets are used
    as key elements of the user interface. One widget is the WIDHOC Field Status,
    which shows the location of the nodes and the graphical representation of the
    set of data retrieved from each sensor (see Fig. 8). Another one is the WIDHOC
    Multisensor Indicator, which displays the last data received by the node that
    is selected in the Google map (see Fig. 9). The WIDHOC Multisensor Monitor widget
    display the last 50 values received by the sensors connected to a specific node
    (see Fig. 10). Finally, Fig. 11 shows a picture of the whole system. Download

    3.2. Agronomical results generated by the FIWARE architecture Verifying that all
    the relevant information is suitably acquired, sent to and stored in the FIWARE
    cloud is required. Furthermore, it is also particularly important to analyse several
    performance parameters related to for instance, nodes’ electrical consumption,
    network latency, response delays, or number of loss messages and data, if it is
    desired to satisfy the expectations of users; since, if data are not properly
    sent, stored and retrieved, the crop monitoring process could lead to stakeholders
    to misunderstand the crop behaviour and, then, to take wrong decisions about the
    irrigation model that should be applied. In particular, several experiments (described
    in Section 2.4), have allowed the system to be properly analysed and validated,
    considering all the aforementioned issues. In this section, the obtained results
    after conducting such trials are detailed. First, data obtained from laboratory
    tests are shown and discussed. Then, the performance of the Cloud system is evaluated
    from the results obtained in the real crops described in Section 2.1. 3.2.1. Laboratory
    results Obtaining results from laboratory tests is necessary to validate the system
    before going to the deployment stage. Specifically, power consumption and autonomy
    tests in a controlled environment are particularly useful to ensure that the node
    is capable of carrying out its tasks in the real crop with a minimum (or even
    without), human intervention. Therefore, this section shows and discusses those
    results related to node autonomy from the power consumption point of view. As
    mentioned before, the designed node is capable of sending information to the Cloud
    by using a GPRS device, which implies variable throughput and latency that depend
    on the number of other users concurrently sharing the service. Furthermore, the
    speed of data transfer could vary depending on the technology. In addition, the
    behaviour of the Cloud backend is also relevant to estimate such communication
    parameters. Latency is an important feature because it has a certain influence
    in power consumption, since the longer the node takes to send a message and receive
    the response, the higher the node power consumption is, because the radio module
    has to be turned on during the whole process. With the purpose of testing that
    the GPRS node power consumption is within an appropriate range, several real power
    consumption values have been calculated both in a controlled laboratory environment
    and after deploying a set of nodes in real plots. As mentioned before, the GPRS
    node is equipped with a microSD card that locally stores information about the
    connected sensors, the sample period and the transmission rate or the GPRS and
    remote server configurations, among others. The installer could easily change
    the operation mode by simply rewriting some parameters in a few files. In addition,
    the device also implements an algorithm specifically designed for battery life
    optimization. In fact, the solar panel connection is only activated if the battery
    is outside a specified voltage range. According to the node state, that is: (1)
    initialization and configuration, (2) standby, (3) interface warm-up, (4) digital
    sensor data acquisition, (5) GPRS standby and (6) GPRS module transmission; node
    consumption and then node autonomy could vary. Fig. 12 shows the power consumption
    values of such states. They were measured with the YOKOGAWA WT210 wattmeter and
    the associated WTVIEWER software. Download : Download high-res image (147KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 12. Power consumption of the device in any state.
    As shown in the experiments, the node only reaches the state (1) when it is switched
    on or the reset button is pressed. The device worked in the state (2) during the
    most part of the time. In this case, the power consumption was kept below 600
    μA. The sequence of states (3) and (4) was repeated every 15 min (sample rate),
    first reading the digital sensors and later the analogue sensors. After 1 h (sending
    rate), all the collected data from sensors, which were available in the card,
    were sent to the server. Obviously, as this procedure requires the radio module
    to be turned on, the consumption could be affected by network latency. Finally,
    an average power consumption of the device of 4.29 mA was calculated. More information
    about this process could be found in (Navarro-Hellín et al., 2015). Results demonstrate
    that the consumption values are in the expected range. In fact, as the devices
    are equipped with a Li-Po of 2300mAh, 3.7 nominal voltage and an external solar
    panel of 0.8 W (5 V/160 mA), the estimated autonomy of the device is of approximately
    22 days without Sun and unlimited if the whole charging system is properly working.
    3.2.2. Results obtained from the experiments in real crops The experiments in
    real crops have been designed with the purpose of demonstrating that using a Cloud
    software architecture (particularly when the FIWARE platform is used), is very
    useful for farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food sector, since the proposed
    cloud system allows agricultural information to be monitored, properly retrieved
    and processed, in a standardized, normalized, reliable and safe way, with the
    aim of generating enough knowledge that enables decision making in the context
    of crop management, in an optimal manner. In particular, in the farms where the
    system has been tested, the main objective has been aimed to both minimize the
    water consumption and improve the crop production. In order to do this, the farms’
    owners hired the Widhoc SME’s services. Such company properly installed the proposed
    solution (including all the required sensors and nodes and deploying the FIWARE-cloud-based
    software architecture). All the information monitored by the system was at the
    disposal of not only the farmers, but a set of agronomist experts that collaborate
    with Widhoc, with the purpose of generating a suitable and optimized irrigation
    strategy (which should be applied by such farmers), according to the retrieved
    data and the expected goals. In this case, both farmers and agronomist experts
    can be considered as system’s stakeholders. In fact, they are specifically the
    final users of the proposed system. With the purpose of proving the proper operation
    of the full charging system and validating the autonomy results obtained at the
    laboratory, a real test was carried out over a period of two months. Fig. 13 shows
    the voltage recorded over the mentioned period (1st April to 28th May 2016), in
    detail. Note that, the battery voltage was kept between the desired values thanks
    to the solar panel and the charging algorithm. Download : Download high-res image

    and charge curve during 2 months period of NODE #2 and NODE #3 deployed in FARM
    #1 and FARM #2, respectively. On the other hand, it is necessary to ensure that
    the system is reliably working, in the sense that messages are properly sent and
    received by the cloud backend, and the stored information is consistent. Data
    provided by the nodes installed in the plots described in Section 2.1 have been
    properly analysed with the purpose of validating the performance of the system.
    A representative set of obtained results are shown in this section. Fig. 14, Fig.
    15 respectively show the soil matric potential and the soil volumetric water content
    acquired with the soil sensors MPS-6 and 10-HS, in both the fino lemon crop (FARM
    #1) and the almonds crop (FARM #2). Specifically, Fig. 14 represents the data
    acquired by the Node #1 of FARM #1 during May 2016. Such representation demonstrates
    that the water needs has been kept, since the Ψm values are greater than −20 kPa.
    Moreover, the variations in the θv values are related to the irrigations cycles
    applied to the crop during the aforementioned month. Finally, the θv values measured
    at 40 and 80 cm of depth reveal a correct drain and an appropriate selected irrigation
    frequency when the retentive soil characteristics are considered. On the other
    hand, a similar analysis for the Ψm and the θv values measured with Node #2 of
    FARM #2 could be determined in Fig. 15. Download : Download high-res image (351KB)

    proposed cloud-based system is properly working both at the laboratory and in
    real crops. One major advantage of the system is related to scalability from both
    hardware and software points of view. In fact, the node has been designed to enable
    the inclusion of new sensors frequently used in agriculture, thanks to the set
    of interfaces embedded in the GPRS board. In addition, reprogramming the firmware
    is also a relatively simple task. On the other hand, from the software developer
    point of view, the system maintenance is easy, since the software architecture
    is based on reusable components hosted in the FIWARE cloud. Moreover, the databases’
    schemas are generic enough for including information of new sensors that could
    be easily added, if required; consequently, the objective of designing a scalable,
    reusable and easy-of-sharing warehouse, in the context of PA, is met. On the other
    hand, it is not necessary to acquire and maintain expensive computing equipment,
    because FIWARE offers a set of virtual machines that can be properly configured
    and are automatically scaled according to the application requirements. When the
    FIWARE cloud provider is compared to other well-known public cloud providers,
    the first one offers an open source and free solution that supplies all the necessary
    modules for Cloud Computing (including Big Data), in a safe and reliable manner.
    Furthermore, FIspace and the SmartAgriFood project offer interesting modules focused
    on the design and development of solutions for the agri-food sector, including
    components that enable the business to business processes, as for example, the
    Business Collaboration Module (BCM) and the Event Processing Module (EPM), among
    others. Note that, other general providers such as Google or Amazon only allows
    some general services to be used free of charge, but subject to the conditions
    of a system based on quotas; therefore, FIWARE is cheaper and offers more services.
    4. Conclusions In this paper, a software architecture hosted in the FIWARE cloud
    has been presented. The designed software components allow worldwide agronomical
    information to be stored in a common data warehouse that saves normalized information
    from the agronomical point of view. Stakeholders and particularly agronomists
    can effortlessly analyse (by using an easy and usable user interface, see Fig.
    8), the monitored information that allow them to take decisions about irrigation
    control and other crop management procedures. In fact, agronomists that works
    with Widhoc make useful reports for customers by using the valuable knowledge
    that the proposed system provides. Such reports are helping farmers to improve
    their productivity and to minimize the water consumption. Experiments have demonstrated
    that using the proposed system easily and transparently enables agronomical data
    registration, regardless of the used hardware architecture, since all the software
    modules (firmware, backend and frontend), are highly uncoupled. From both the
    hardware and software developer points of view, the system is easily scalable.
    The FIWARE cloud provides a suitable hosting site for the software architecture,
    whose modules are reusable and can be easily maintained, without the need of acquiring
    expensive computing hardware equipment. The virtual machines provided by FIWARE
    are easily to configure and the system is automatically scaled according to the
    application requirements. Moreover, the FIWARE cloud offers a set of interesting
    benefits for the agri-food sector, since it provides a collection of specific
    enablers that allow stakeholders to share agricultural information in a normalized,
    reliable and secure manner. In fact, the proposed software architecture will be
    properly extended by including features supplied by FISpace, in the context of
    Agriculture, with the purpose of integrating modules that make the business to
    business procedures easier. Acknowledgments The development of this work was supported

  description: The agriculture sector has always been a crucial factor in India’s
    growth. It is utmost important to bring efficiency and precision in farming. This
    paper proposes the use of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) to develop an automated
    and intelligent irrigation system. The SENSEnuts embedded platform is used to
    create and maintain the WSN. The proposed system uses soil moisture data from
    different nodes which are deployed at various locations in the crop field. The
    nodes form a WSN. Each node (consisting of NXP JN5168, a 32-bit microcontroller)
    collects the data regarding the soil moisture and transmits it to the coordinating
    station (through Zigbee) which then takes the decision on whether or not to activate
    the sprinkler/motor pump. The decision is communicated to the corresponding node
    for further action. This enables precise watering only in the dry portion of the
    cultivation field and reduces the wastage of water or overwatering other moist
    areas. Apart from the soil moisture data, readings from the temperature, light,
    and humidity sensors are also transmitted to the coordinator. Such data is useful
    for indoor, underground or nursery crop monitoring. A working prototype of the
    proposed WSN is made and the functionality is verified. The data from various
    sensors is uploaded to the Thing Speak Internet of Things (IoT) platform for remote
    monitoring and further data analytics.

    Precision agriculture (PA) consists of managing crops by observing, measuring,
    and acting against the many variable factors that affect them. Systems for PA
    can be based on satellite navigation systems or terrestrial systems for geographic
    information and sensors located in the plot. These systems collect information
    to be used to make decisions with greater precision and to optimize crop yields.
    PA contributes to producing a more efficient and ecological agriculture. It allows
    saving on phytosanitary products, fertilizers, and reducing the amount of nitrogen
    used. PA reduces costs and optimizes agriculture. It also reduces the environmental
    impact by optimizing the use of water, pesticides, and machinery fuel; thus, greater
    production is obtained with fewer resources. In order to develop efficient PA
    systems, there is an increasing trend towards using smart decision systems (SDS).
    The acceptance of SDS solutions in many industrial sectors that specialize in
    agriculture is limited by the fact that building an SDS requires a significant
    investment of time and knowledge. If it is to benefit from technological advances,
    agricultural activity has therefore to absorb not only technical expertise, but
    also skilled knowledge of engineering. The Internet of Things (IoT) [1] can be
    used for that purpose, despite several immense challenges linked to big data analytics,
    cloud computing, and new business models in SDS. These features typically include
    intelligent assistance with the implementation of technology and its maintenance
    and use. The concept of smart farming is summarized in Figure 1, together with
    the management cycle as a cyber-physical system, leading eventually to smart online
    devices capable of controlling a range of farming systems. Figure 1. The cycle
    of smart farming data management. Sundmaeker [2] reported rapid developments in
    the IoT and cloud computing, applied in this paper to a field known as smart farming.
    Algorithmic training processes for decision-making support are highly complex
    tasks, with many problematic issues found in models that are automatically induced
    from data through big data applications [3]. Perhaps the most problematic is the
    value chain that refers to the sequence of activities from data capture to decision
    making, involving data marketing, decision trees, and rule injection procedures.
    The advantage of these models is that they consist of individual units of knowledge
    (rules) that can be separately viewed, evaluated, processed, deleted, and even
    edited. In a business process [4], for example, work laid out in a set of logically
    related tasks can be performed to achieve a defined business outcome. Big data
    represents the information assets that are characterized by high volumes, high-speed
    processing and a variety of inputs. Processing such information requires specific
    technology and analytical methods [5] for their transformation into a value chain.
    This paper presents a complete implementation of a smart decision support system
    prototype, which automatically learns decision rules from data, thereby permitting
    the domain expert to edit the resulting rule base, which can apply the rules to
    achieve incoming objects. As agriculture consumes about 70% of all fresh water
    resources, one important aspect of green farming is economical and efficient use
    of water [6]. Water consumption percentages can be decreased through efficient
    water management, where irrigation needs are adjusted to supply. Decision trees
    generate rules to enhance the use of irrigation water, fertilizers, pesticides,
    etc. A web platform can convert the results of data-based decision making into
    user-friendly public information that is only posted following a decision maker
    review process. The major advantage is integration into a unique platform to control
    farming decisions such as irrigation system control, fertilization, pesticides,
    and an open data network, all in one. In addition, our system includes rules based
    on variable-rate irrigation (VRI) [7]. VRI is a new technique that allows optimization
    of irrigation application, considering the status of field and weather. In most
    cases, these systems are implemented by using a center pivot irrigation system
    that can reduce the total irrigation water volume required to grow field crops.
    According to Reference [8], this kind of system is able to reduce irrigation water
    use by 8% compared to uniform irrigation application. Considering this idea, we
    designed [9], developed, and tested an intelligent system for irrigation control
    of urban lawns. The system is based on the use of a multisensor node composed
    by humidity and temperature for soil and air, as well as a rain sensor. The multisensor
    node is controlled by an intelligent algorithm that takes into account the real
    time values provided by the sensors and the stored data of previous measurements.
    The intelligent algorithm is responsible for analyzing the data and deciding on
    the amount of water to be used in a given area. Using actual annual meteorological
    values of a city with different water requirements, the system’s operation was
    simulated. The results showed that for a landscaped area of about 140 ha, we could
    save around 6% of the irrigation water, which would be equivalent to about 22
    million liters of water. Finally, the complete system behaves as a collaborative
    platform, taking into account the experience of other users and previous events
    introduced into the system. A system with these features can help farmers to enhance
    the activity sustainability, at the same time, that a more controlled use of chemical
    products and natural resources will protect our environment and groundwater resources.
    This study is organized as follows. Section 2 will present the reasoning behind
    the study and related works. Section 3 will describe the individual steps of the
    preparation process of a classification rule set. Section 4 will then detail the
    software components of the engine and, in Section 5, the web platform and the
    processing of open data will be outlined. Finally, in Section 6, the conclusions
    will present the advantages of the demonstrated model and future avenues of work
    will be suggested. 2. Related Works The generation of “business rules” from data-mining
    results is an emerging research area. To the best of our knowledge, the only publicly
    available software solution to business rule learning is Rule Learner, which forms
    part of the Open-Rules Decision Management System. According to the SOA paradigm,
    software should function as cooperating services, as described in a previous work
    [1]. However, there have been several experimental systems developed in the machine
    learning community with related functionality. The Drools system [3], used in
    our solution, is a business rules management system that combines user needs and
    constraints in the search space with interactive mining. The interactive nature
    of both systems, MIME and Drools, can help to address the excessive number of
    rules that typically form the output of rule learning. Additionally, in Reference
    [4], we showed that the database-pruning algorithm can significantly reduce the
    number of rules that Drools outputs, without adversely impacting on the quality
    of the classifier. The smart farming decision system proposed in this paper is
    called PLATEM. Drools is the core of this system, which is integrated in a single
    web application. The user can launch multiple farm functionalities, export the
    results that are selected, and apply the rules on test data in auto mode. The
    rule-learning algorithm used in Drools for building the classifier from association
    rules is evaluated and described in detail in the following sections. The software
    solution is presented and implemented in demo form. Its main contribution, with
    respect to the previous results in References [5,6], is in the integration of
    the periodically sampled indoor and outdoor irrigation system linked to a wireless
    sensor network, the SDS, and the web, which together form the complete PLATEM
    system. This pervasive paradigm [10] of the Internet of Things (IoT) is to increase
    the value of the information generated by the number of interconnections between
    people and gadgets, denoted by things, and to transform of the processed information
    into knowledge for the benefit of mankind and society. The architecture of the
    IoT unit [11] is built from a man-like neural network (MLN) model and its modified
    model. Ubiquitous IoT refers to the global IoT and its integration in multiple-unit
    IoTs. Its architecture employs a social organization framework (SOF) model. The
    models for future IoTs are not only helpful to interpret the relationship between
    IoT and the real world, but are also beneficial for the implementation of IoT
    in its current form. Vazquez et al. explored [12] the different criteria for designing
    IoT architectural solutions, together with illustrative examples of prototypes
    that have implemented these approaches. Likewise, Misra [13] proposed a community
    detection scheme in an integrated Internet of Things (IoT) and social network
    (SN) architecture. The paper follows a graph mining approach to solve the problem
    in a complex network of IoT and SN. There are a few studies in the literature
    on community detection in SNs; however, to the best of our knowledge, there are
    no specific studies that address the integration of IoT and SN architecture. Atzori
    [14] analyzed the major opportunities arising from the integration of social networking
    concepts in the Internet of Things, presenting the mainstream research activities
    and pointing to the most critical technical challenges. Smart farming technology
    is continuously reinventing new business models using real-time data with automated
    data-acquisition devices. The sector needs open infrastructure between technologies,
    because of a concern that key data processing techniques may become the exclusive
    domain of multinational AgTech corporations. In the current market, applications
    developed by AgTech corporations and AgBusiness companies, with patented specifications,
    are commonly found for machine manufacturing processes. There are also applications
    that function exclusively with irrigation. These underlying reasons prompt us
    to work towards integrated components in technology, both for device interaction,
    such as fertirrigation controllers, and for data processing, to produce information
    for greater agricultural efficiency. Basing our work on agricultural knowledge,
    and in consultation with individual farmers and agronomists, the focus of this
    work is on the development of a platform that integrates the core control operations
    and that monitors data on crop yields, in order to build on synergetic results
    from multidisciplinary expertise. PLATEM PA is a combination of a smart fertirrigation
    manager application that displays historical data, and social networking forums
    that share productive data. The main complexity of such applications is that they
    require collaboration between many different elements with different contributions
    to the data values and related decisions over the consequential actions. An overview
    of current European applications in PA is presented below, identifying the major
    functions of each one in comparison with PLATEM PA. Table 1 shows the aspects
    that PLATEM introduces in relation to the different elements of other smart farming
    platforms. The integration of several tools in the main user profile is central
    to PLATEM, enabling the development of a social network between professionals
    in different areas where they can discuss data acquisitions, notifications, and
    crops risks. The ultimate goal is an open communication protocol and open data
    platform between large precision agriculture technologies, oriented towards indoor
    and outdoor VRF and VRI. Table 1. Smart farming platforms comparison. Smart-Akis
    [15] represents the application of modern information and communication technologies
    (ICT) in agriculture, leading to what can be called a third Green Revolution.
    Agrivi [16] is a crop management software for crop planning, monitoring, and analysis.
    Advice and relevant data on tillage, sowing, fumigation, fertilization, irrigation,
    and harvesting, and almost all other activities, can be accessed with a few clicks.
    In addition, volumetric calculations, and costs and hours of work are suggested
    for each activity. The processes, based on best practices gathered in relation
    to over 100 crops, are designed to improve productivity. The main objective of
    the sigAGROasesor [17] project is the development of decision support tools for
    the agricultural sector, through a web platform for online services to farmers,
    assisting efficient, effective, and competitive farming activities, based on environmental
    and social sustainability. In relation to a smart water-saving irrigation system
    [18], X, Kehui et al. published a scientific paper based on an intelligent irrigation
    programmer with sensory connectivity and 433 MHz ISM communication. The research
    focused on applications in precision agriculture, using a wireless humidity sensor.
    A network of wireless sensors was configured to monitor the moisture content and
    the amount of water in the field soil samples. The architectures of both the wireless
    sensor network and the intelligent system were based on the network of sampled
    irrigation controllers. The irrigation test was performed with real-time humidity
    data and expert inputs. A feasible system was demonstrated in the rice cultivation
    process, and a good exploration in the field of precision agriculture and sustainable
    water resources. The APOLLO project [19] shares similarities with the PLATEM PA
    project proposal design. The technology was analyzed in depth for the consolidation
    of the PLATEM PA system, improving its potential for use with other innovative
    ultra-low power communications and dynamic routing protocols, and in the latest
    business rule engine models applied to the multimedia platform. APOLLO aims to
    bring the benefits of precision agriculture to farmers through affordable information
    services, making extensive use of free and open Earth observation data, such as
    those provided by the EU Copernicus program. These services are intended to assist
    agricultural decision making, while observing crop growth and conditions, providing
    advice on irrigation and tilling, and providing crop estimations. Ultimately,
    these interventions are designed to reduce agricultural inputs and increase competitive
    production levels and benefits. As Table 1 shows, the novelty of our platform
    is that PLATEM PA can be considered as a collaborative tool where farmers can
    post their experiences. It is able to monitor the different parameters of soil
    and environment to better growth of crops. In addition, PLATEM PA is able to improve
    their decision, regarding to actions to be performed over the field, taking into
    account previous stored information and farmers posts. Finally, its operation
    is based on the use of an intelligent Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) and
    Virtual Router Instances (VRI). PLATEM PA therefore represents a competitive sample
    of European supplier networks focused on Precision Agriculture management and
    a multimedia platform with basic group tools to control and monitor data and relations
    between all participants for sharing results. The PLATEM system presented in this
    paper can be used to accomplish the task through a chain of web-based graphical
    tools, running on standard BRMS software with open-source formats. Our technological
    solution is capable of adapting “high-tech tools” to be used by farmers, many
    of whom may have little or no technical hi-tech expertise. One problem is the
    necessary automatization of several systems (irrigation controller, fertirrigation
    pump, pH sensor node, …) from different manufacturers that need to be adapted
    to specific communication protocol. PLATEM PA combines several data integration
    processes in a single easy-to-use platform with a standard communication protocol.
    Although the final system will be composed by both hardware part (in charge of
    collecting data from the field) and software part (in charge of processing data),
    this paper is focused on data computation and not in the agronomic side and to
    perform the tests we will take a data base with the needs of fertilization, weekly
    irrigation liters and different Kc for corn varieties of alfalfa, barley and wheat.
    3. Rule-Based Preparation Work The first step to develop our management platform
    was to know the variable inputs the system has and how they have to be processed
    by using the rules. Taking into account that the final goal is to enhance the
    sustainability and competitiveness of the activity, the system also includes business
    process management (BPM) and business rules. It is also important to define the
    platform architecture. This section therefore presents the server-based decision-making
    structure for decision making on irrigation device settings, which processes data
    inputs on edaphic and environmental conditions, images of crop growth, and crop
    status. The objective of this server-based decision-making structure is the integration
    of a BPMS and a business rules management system. A middleware data-exchange system
    serves as a link between both. The middleware that serves to relay data from Bonita
    BPM and Drools includes the following developments: Performance of an integrated
    architecture for a business rules management system and a business rule management
    system (BRMS). Dialogue through the intermediate middleware component that is
    responsible for the data management model and the rule-based activities. Bonita
    Soft provides connectors to interact with the Drools manager that connect with
    the Drools API Engine to run the execution of a certain rule, in order to obtain
    results that conclude with the previously triggered decision-making process. The
    process of preparing a rule base in Drools can be divided into several consecutive
    steps that are presented in Figure 2, wherein several layers are created: data
    preparation, association rule learning, rule selection, classification model testing,
    rule set editing, and deployment of rules. Figure 2. Farming smart decision systems
    (SDS) flow diagram. These steps, which can be performed with a standard web browser,
    are described below in Figure 2: Data are collected for the smart decision system,
    (soil sensors, leaf sensor, etc.) weather and environmental conditions, and machinery
    (pivot irrigation, controllers, pumps, etc.) from a range of devices, and the
    information is then transmitted through the network coordinator to the middleware.
    These data, once pre-processed and formatted, are sent to the rule engine for
    rule-based processing to produce relevant results. Historical database information
    may be required for some rules. Having obtained the results, the coordinator module
    communicates with the appropriate services (e.g., pumps, irrigation controllers,
    etc.), sends their recommendations via virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) and
    virtual router instances (VRI), and reports either to the farmer profile or directly
    to systems installed on the farm for automated implementation, if the system device
    is configured to do so. The type of setting and the basic information for a range
    of settings—i.e., turn on, watering time, turn off—are configurable by the farmer
    with appropriate permissions for automatic SDS adjustment. 3.1. Data Preparation
    The user starts with a dataset for training the classification model. Typically,
    the dataset is divided into a training and a testing part. The design of data
    management and processing procedures, associated with a long-term wireless monitoring
    system, can join all these farming systems and data acquisition elements (see
    backend structure in Figure 2). The data from WSN is stored in a MySQL database
    via middleware through a management process and a communication socket. The user
    can, for instance, upload a profile of crops and fields that will be stored in
    the MySQL database. The weather forecast updates from a weather server can then
    be added, including field coordinates and responses with forecasts in XML, which
    will also be stored in MySQL as the weather profile. Data from aerial images (drone
    or satellite) may be manually uploaded for users via web view (Image and NDVI
    index file). The general structure of the system is shown in Figure 3, where the
    server layers are described: database, middleware, Server Web, BPM, and responsive
    web view. Figure 3. Farming SDS backend structure. The system supports several
    types of pre-processing. Middleware prepares information to store, and the user
    can do pre-processing using intervals of determinate values. The user can then
    merge values at different intervals. 3.2. Association Ruler Learner As a rule-learning
    algorithm, the current version uses a simple procedure implemented in the system.
    The user is required to input a defined rule pattern for the crop and field profile
    to commence the associative rule learning process in Drools. The user then selects
    the attributes from attributes and selects a list in a rule pattern container
    DB. By default, the attributes are connected with a conjunction, but the system
    also supports disjunction and negation connectives. New rules may be introduced
    for each attribute in the rule pattern as a set of its values considered during
    the matching process. 3.3. Rule Selection The user can then change the parameters
    of the rule-learning task, typically by introducing changes to the rule pattern,
    sometimes with a different location or season; some values will therefore need
    adjusting. The rules are saved, grouped by data mining tasks, and the rule container
    updates the attributes of each one. For classification, it is essential that the
    rules entered on the clipboard be chosen to maximize data accuracy. The accuracy
    is computed either on the training dataset or on a separate test dataset. The
    system exports the rule results saved in the Rule Clipboard to the MySQL, where
    middleware is then able, for example, to send reconfiguration instructions to
    the irrigation controller. The system can also be used to post user friendly data
    in web view, informing users of the results of certain rules. 3.4. Rule Editor
    The results can be suitably combined (association rules) for the construction
    of a classification model selected from multiple data-mining tasks. The user can
    export/import rules from the Rule section into the “business rules” base. For
    practical purposes, the rules are internally saved in a JSON format. The system
    then converts the rules into the Drools DRL format. The user can display the rules
    saved in the “business rules” knowledge base and edit them using a web interface.
    An irrigation schedule business process is displayed in Figure 4. Figure 4. Diagram
    of business process management (BMP) process. 4. Software Components Once the
    platform architecture and the rules association had been defined, it was required
    to develop the software part that would implement our web platform. To perform
    that, this section presents the implementation of server rules in the Drools engine.
    The server has three main components. The first one is an application that is
    able to register the external sensor data in the system. A device or application
    simply registers as a data source by sending information via socket communication
    to the middleware, which then prepares the data in a specified format, depending
    on the type of sensor. The system architecture is divided into the following layers:
    User interface: enables farmers, providers, and technics to interact with the
    system and execute computerized workflow activities. To do so, it invokes operations
    of the interfaces published by the business layer. It is a set of HTML and Php
    pages hosted on an Apache web server that are displayed in a web browser. Business
    layer: responsible for making calculations, queries, and invoking the execution
    of business rules. To do this, it accesses the data layer and the rules services
    layer. It is a set of PHP pages hosted on an Apache web server. Data layer: in
    charge of managing the system’s database, which contains information about all
    the data of the process and its stages for each field. It provides interfaces
    so that the business layer can access it. To implement this layer, the MySQL database
    management system was used. Service layer of business rules: exposes interfaces
    through web services to business rules. It is invoked from the business layer
    and executes the rules contained in the rules layer. It is made up of web services,
    programmed in Java, which run on a Tomcat web server. Rules layer: makes it possible
    to manage business rules, for which it provides interfaces to the rules services
    layer. To implement this layer, a free, open source, java-developed BRMS was used.
    The BRMS is deployed on a Tomcat web server. Figure 5 shows the architecture of
    BRMS used by our platform. As we can see, the main component of our BRMS is an
    Apache web server, which uses the data stored in our database (DB). In order to
    enhance our server, we used a Tomcat web server. Tomcat is an extension of Apache
    that works as a container of servlets, and can help us to include new functionalities
    to our server. Using the servlets, we can extend applications held in web servers
    to be seen as JAVA Applets. To generate and manage the different rules we need
    to enhance the system performance, we used Drools, a common tool used for managing
    business rules that we have adapted to our application. These rules are sent to
    the Tomcat web server through the API. These rules are sent to the Apache web
    server, which combines them with the data stored in the DB. Finally, the users
    can see the results of these decisions by using a web browser and surfing the
    different options the platform offers. Figure 5. System architecture that integrates
    Drools into the workflow. The following section introduces the Drools management
    based on the Rete pattern-matching algorithm [20]. It provides the basis for a
    more efficient implementation that can check each rule against facts in a knowledge
    base, firing the rule if necessary. Figure 6 shows the *.drl file where basic
    rules for operating with Drools are located. Figure 6. SDS verification rule definition.
    There are several benefits of this algorithm, such as reducing or removing redundancy
    and efficient memory erasure when the facts are retracted. The rule container
    refers to the part of the database where the rules of the system are saved. There
    are internal entities that contain the parameter rules of each individual rule
    set: system irrigation functionality, fertilization, pest control, agronomy parameter,
    and weather; there is a rule for each type only in the basic demo mode. The system
    needs to gain experiences and broker new rule-based relations. Each rule contains
    two main sections: the conditions section and the actions section. The next table,
    Table 2, is a resume of tools and related main features were used in the PLATEM
    development of its different levels. Table 2. SW technologies used in the PLATEM
    system. 5. Web Platform View The last step to make the web platform usable was
    to develop a graphic user interface (GUI) to facilitate its use by farmers. Additionally,
    PLATEM should be tested in terms of data collected and operation. In this section,
    the web view development is presented, with the aim of offering a high usability
    level for non-IT-experts. PLATEM incorporates a web-based data-mining system [21,22].
    The web provides an important interaction model for the smart farming IoT by letting
    users obtain device-related information and, in some cases, control their devices
    through the ubiquitous web browser. The conventional web is a convenience we enjoy
    as we search for information, irrigation Tele Management control, and post historical
    data in social networking. Users can refer to devices that are part of the IoT
    and that are directly accessed, monitored, and controlled by web technologies
    as the Physical Web: web technology + IoT. The web interface supports pre-processing
    definitions such as uploading data to DB, and post processing ones such as the
    data results viewer [23]. The backend is written in PHP; the frontend is based
    on PHP/HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript libraries. The PLATEM platform is a web view
    application written in PHP. The user module can share restricted postings and
    control security. Communication is performed through a MySQL extension. MySQL
    is great at performance database technology, but we see databases becoming more
    popular when they simply provide more and more features that are easily connectable
    and manageable with existing systems. The more features a database has, the easier
    it will be for users to develop their systems, thus making them better and raising
    the general level of the applications that are made through MySQL. Since MySQL
    is very popular, any major improvements or added features affect many people.
    The web view uses direct communication with Drools only in parts, with specific
    functionality where it is accessible through REST web services in JSON. The remaining
    fields interact, such as: make a post, likes, upload images, write commentaries
    to status or in images, search and list friends, friend request (send and accept),
    send messages to friends. They are all accessible through the web interface without
    setters to the rule engine. In addition, there is a settings view to update user
    profiles that is accessible to friends, which can be edited (clicking on Edit
    Information). The next important point is a notifications menu located on the
    top-right of the screen in main view, where the notification icons flash for alerts/notifications,
    friends, and messages. The user can search for other users in the database by
    writing the name in edit text “Search People,” and can view an open profile, send
    a message, and add a name to a list of friends. Figure 7 shows the My Friends
    list with a “View profile” button and “Send message” button. Figure 7. My Friends
    list. Testing Scenario In this section, the performance results will be explained
    at the level of erroneous data, in the sensor environments, and in the traffic
    generated for two different transmission scenarios. The network server analysis,
    another important aspect, shows the server bandwidth. A real scenario was simulated
    with virtual users where they pretended to be farmers in action, making queries
    and publications in their virtual profiles to check the server response capacity,
    in which a query was analyzed and the data were simultaneously fed into the database
    and the connections. The results were very positive, with low usage of system
    capacity. Figure 8 shows a sample of the server test. On the first graphs, the
    number of queries appear, and a login action test period with several database
    queries. Figure 8. Database access analysis of query actions. Figure 9 shows a
    sample of the server test. The graph shows that the number of connections to DB
    is in a period of login action. Figure 9. Connections to DB by processes. Network
    traffic can be displayed, as shown in Figure 10. The insert process starts when
    PLATEM adds the user as new friend, and a request can then be sent to the user.
    Figure 10. Network traffic in the test scenario. The capture generated by Wireshark
    of the server bandwidth and response time test during user posting of an uploaded
    image on the social network can be seen in Figure 11. This scenario implies the
    dedication of network server resources at a high level. Optimal performance of
    this task is the key to the proper functioning of the system. It is possible to
    analyze user queries and server data responses, where the length of each package
    is marked with the server response time. It may be the case that the data are
    images or big data sets. The server was capable of facilitating basic navigation
    for many users on the multimedia platform where many sender packets are ACKs,
    but server communications were congested when responding to big data, such as
    images, tables of historical data, and some user posts. The network analysis was
    based on uploaded messages with image posting, and the server network had to allocate
    additional resources for uploading and saving images. Figure 11. Network analysis,
    server traffic. Additionally, through the platform, we can collect data from sensors
    placed in the field, such as temperature (see Figure 12) or wind speed (see Figure
    13). Figure 12 and Figure 13 show the average temperature per day (in °C) and
    average wind speed per day (in m/s), respectively, measured over 10 months. These
    values are used to calculate the irrigation needs. Figure 12. Average temperature
    measured over 10 months. Figure 13. Average wind speed measured over 10 months.
    An example of the rules implementation on the server is given to solve a problem
    involving nitrogen application with an irrigation system. The dosages can be tuned
    with a nitrogen adjustment rule, e.g., as shown in Figure 14, in this case a PossibleFertiEvent
    rule that is capable of detecting the potentially low vegetation index in one
    part of a field, labelled area 1. The rule conditions determine when the action
    has to be implemented. In this example, two events must occur: manual user upload
    of the index calculation data of the field, with an NDVI level lower than 0.42,
    and pressure sensor detection of an operational irrigation system ready to begin
    fertilization. These real-life events are mapped to events in the system, dependent
    on LowNDVI and WaterPressureEvent. When all the conditions are fulfilled, the
    new event can be created. The last line of the actions section inserts this event
    in the rule engine. In this way, the new event can be used by other rules. Rules
    give great flexibility to the user to combine low level events and higher-level
    events, which should trigger proper services and generate user notifications.
    Drools Guvnor rule management tools provide a user-friendly interface for building
    rules so the user does not have to know all the language details, e.g., possible
    Low level on Vegetation Index detected in Aerial Mapping Data changes. Integration
    with service layers was also tested with sensor data and notification services.
    Complex events added several additional dimensions to the monitoring process.
    It was proven in the test scenario that the decisions based on extra assumptions
    were more accurate. Figure 14. Event triggered. Users have the option of sharing
    an NDVI index image in PLATEM view. The data is stored in numerical form in the
    DB, and as an image for visual display of the NDVI index. See Figure 15. Figure
    15. User post sharing NDVI results. PLATEM supports the auto notification mode
    when posting directly via JSON to the user web profile and when posting new alerts
    either for user friends or for the general public with the business rules engine.
    Figure 16 shows PLATEM predictions of the fungal mildew risk factor based on the
    historical weather DB, the forecast, and thermal integral. Figure 16. Auto post,
    rule triggered. The irrigation management application has a high usable visual
    functionality backed up by an intelligent system, which adjusts the irrigation
    schedules that are introduced on the basis of the variables acquired by the sensors.
    In this way, intelligent programming can be achieved for farmers with simple programming
    settings. Smart conditions come from weather environment data, plant growth status,
    edaphic data, and aerial data from NDVI images (UAV or Satellite). The irrigation
    manager needs a basic irrigation configuration that will eventually be capable
    of auto-tuning with sufficient inputs. Figure 17 shows the irrigation sectors
    of a single controller. Figure 17. Irrigation controller view. Each program can
    be modified by clicking on a program number that will launch the edit view. Basic
    parameters can be adjusted to start the work (see Figure 18). The system will
    adjust itself on the basis of information from sensors, images, and weather conditions.
    The type of start (weekdays or intervals), add restrictions, time start, and additional
    starts can all be added. Figure 18. Irrigation edition parameters view. A graphic
    view of the historical irrigation schedule was introduced to monitor total water
    consumption, and to establish water consumption levels in each irrigation sector,
    irrigation cycle, and fertirrigation event, all presented as basic visual data
    in a user-friendly way for farmers. When the crops are harvested, and at any other
    time, the irrigation records (see Figure 19) can be compared with past weather
    conditions to establish relationships between them. Figure 19. Historical water
    programs. Finally, PLATEM allows the farmers to graphically see the irrigation
    needs as a function of the measured values in the field and weather (see Figure
    20). Figure 20. View of irrigation needs of PLATEM. 6. Conclusions and Future
    Work In this work, we have presented the results of new decision rules to create
    variable rate irrigation parameters and variable rate fertirrigation rules for
    parametric optimization of agricultural inputs. In addition, we tested a new multimedia
    platform for user manager (farmer) profiles to notify events, to share postings
    and data with the community, and to interact with the irrigation–fertirrigation
    system controller. Comparing our study with other applications, we can highlight
    the potential of PLATEM: that integrates all the tools that a farmer may need
    on a day-to-day basis, so that many fertirrigation operations can bring in results
    with a rule engine and a list of rules or models based on historical data acquisition
    and user-inserted values. Another important function is information sharing through
    forums with input from agronomists, agricultural technicians, and other farmers
    on doses, plagues, water restrictions, etc. Work continues on expansions of the
    rules for the integration of the business engine system. The goal of this integration
    is to present the basic user-demanded rules defined in the system, enabling a
    simple and unique functional platform for smart farming in irrigation areas, both
    under cover and in the field, for fertilization and pest control. In future work,
    further development of smart system applications will be necessary, and is likely
    to produce two opposing supply chain scenarios: one with further integration of
    the supply chain, in which farmers have private data, and another in which farmers
    are empowered by big data and open collaboration and can easily switch between
    suppliers, sharing data with agricultural organizations and the Ministry of Agriculture,
    and participating in short supply chains rather than integrated long supply chains.
    Currently, PLATEM is working well for relatively small data sets. A further action
    required to process bigger amount of data is to apply different decision-making
    tools, since the rule engine and decision tree become inefficient because of the
    swapping of training tuples in and out of the main memory. The situation is likely
    to navigate a steady course between these two extremes differentiated by cropping
    methods, commodity, market structure, etc. In this work, the use of open data
    is fostered with the aim of promoting communication channels between farmer, researcher,
    commercial intermediary, and technological expert. Another focus is on the extension
    of the system that would allow mixing rules from multiple datasets in a single
    knowledge base and a common communication protocol through various sources, e.g.,
    manufacturers of irrigation controllers, real-time information from satellites,
    and weather forecasting servers. Finally, we have to consider supporting alternative
    backend rule learning adjusted to each user profile (horticulture, cereal, and
    fruit farmers, etc.) to classify the rules on use in the rule container. The promise
    of big data in agriculture is alluring, but the above challenges have to be addressed
    for increased uptake of big data applications. Although there are certainly technical
    issues to be resolved, we recommend focusing on the most significant obstacles
    above all, the initially identified governance issues, and the design of suitable
    business models. Author Contributions C.C.B. designed the platform. J.L. and S.S.

  description: Climate change, land degradation, and limited land and water resources
    have challenged our ability to meet the food demand of a rapidly growing population.
    To tackle this challenge, modern agricultural systems are relying on new technologies
    like the Internet of Things (IoT) to improve agricultural productivity and resource
    use efficiency. Although IoT has gained considerable attention in the last few
    years, the key concepts of IoT and their applicability across different domains
    of agriculture are still new to many researchers, practitioners, managers, and
    policymakers. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the use of different
    IoT platforms, wireless sensor networks, and other associated technologies like
    remote sensing, cloud computing, and big data analytics in digital agriculture.
    The review also explores the use of communication technologies, microcontrollers,
    and machine learning in smart irrigation and decision support systems. The necessity
    of interoperability (data transfer and communication without human interference)
    among devices is discussed in detail with regard to facilitating and exchanging
    agricultural data more effectively. The discussion also includes opportunities
    and challenges in standardizing IoT; developing energy-efficient and affordable
    technologies; and improving data collection, transfer, storage, processing, security,
    anonymity, and privacy. This paper further calls for collaborative research in
    sensor and communication technologies in the agricultural sector.

    Climate change, land degradation, and limited land and water resources have challenged
    our ability to meet the food demand of a rapidly growing population. To tackle
    this challenge, modern agricultural systems are relying on new technologies like
    the Internet of Things (IoT) to improve agricultural productivity and resource
    use efficiency. Although IoT has gained considerable attention in the last few
    years, the key concepts of IoT and their applicability across different domains
    of agriculture are still new to many researchers, practitioners, managers, and
    policymakers. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the use of different
    IoT platforms, wireless sensor networks, and other associated technologies like
    remote sensing, cloud computing, and big data analytics in digital agriculture.
    The review also explores the use of communication technologies, microcontrollers,
    and machine learning in smart irrigation and decision support systems. The necessity
    of interoperability (data transfer and communication without human interference)
    among devices is discussed in detail with regard to facilitating and exchanging
    agricultural data more effectively. The discussion also includes opportunities
    and challenges in standardizing IoT; developing energy-efficient and affordable
    technologies; and improving data collection, transfer, storage, processing, security,
    anonymity, and privacy. This paper further calls for collaborative research in
    sensor and communication technologies in the agricultural sector. Abbreviations

    The global food system is currently under pressure due to rising population, economic
    growth, land degradation, and increased demand for animal-based products (Keating
    et al., 2014; Lal, 2013). For example, global food production needs to be increased
    by about 70% to ensure food security for an estimated world population of more
    than 9.7 billion people in 2050 (Cole et al., 2018; FAO, 2017). Further, climate
    change is projected to affect global food production and efforts to increase food
    productivity. Notably, crop production across the globe has already experienced
    negative effects from warming temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns,
    and increased extreme weather events (IPCC, 2022; Paudel et al., 2014). This will
    likely be exacerbated by climate change in the future (Hasegawa et al., 2021;
    Lobell et al., 2008; Rosenzweig & Parry, 1994). As such, researchers, scientists,
    policymakers, and organizations like the Food and Agriculture Organization of
    the United Nations (FAO) call for a radical transformation in global agricultural
    and food systems. Therefore, improved technologies that aim at enhancing production
    and supply-chain efficiencies under a resource-constrained environment are crucial
    to ensuring food security in the face of climate change (FAO, 2017). One such
    technology is the Internet of Things (IoT), which has recently shown the potential
    to provide solutions to several challenges associated with increased agricultural
    productivity under climatic changes and variability (Figure 1). FIGURE 1 Open
    in figure viewer Uses of the Internet of Things (IoT) in agriculture (Source:
    Salam, 2022, used with permission). Although there is no single definition of
    IoT, it could be broadly described as a system of devices, software programs,
    sensors, and other technologies that are either connected or are able to become
    connected via the Internet to exchange information and data (Borgia, 2014). The
    first application of IoT is believed to be an information-sharing network used
    by US defense sectors in 1969, then called the Advanced Research Projects Agency
    Network. The chronological timeline detailing the evolution process of various
    technologies within IoT since 1969 is summarized in Table 1 (Balas et al., 2019).
    In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the number of common
    devices that might be considered to be a part of the IoT framework, including
    cell phones, televisions, thermostats, vehicles, refrigerators, home lighting
    systems, and smart watches among many others. Such IoT infrastructure is projected
    to substantially impact the global economy, with more than 100 billion connections
    (Huawei Technologies Co., 2015) and a financial impact of more than $11 trillion
    by 2025 (Manyika et al., 2015). Their impact is largely apparent in the agricultural
    sector, which currently contributes up to 60% of the national gross domestic product
    in many countries (The World Bank, 2019). TABLE 1. Chronological evolution of
    the technologies in Internet of Things (IoT) domain. Year Evolution Reference

    information among defense sectors Townsend (2001) 1973 Used in RFID tags to lock
    and unlock doors; barcode scanners Suresh et al. (2014) 1974 Embedded computer

    and transportation applications Jyothi and Vardhan (2016) 2015 IoT was used for
    locating people and objects Sharma and Lohan (2019) 2020 IoT was used for monitoring
    and controlling distant objects such as water levels in tanks in crop fields Rajalakshmi
    and Mahalakshmi (2016) The use of IoT in agriculture emerged due to advancements
    in data science, remote sensing, and computer technologies, and the need for optimizing
    decisions regarding agricultural management practices (King, 2017). Specifically,
    IoT use in precision and smart agriculture is notable with applications in data-informed,
    site-specific, and real-time management and decision-making. International Society
    of Precision Agriculture defines precision agriculture as “a management strategy
    that gathers, processes and analyzes temporal, spatial and individual data and
    combines it with other information to support management decisions according to
    estimated variability for improved resource use efficiency, productivity, quality,
    profitability and sustainability of agricultural production.” Smart agriculture
    refers to farming using softwares, sensors, automation, and data technologies.
    Digital agriculture seeks to utilize data from precision farming and the power
    of Artificial Intelligence. Digital agricultural technologies and the use of IoT
    are illustrated in Figure 1. Development of pilot research farms is already underway
    in several countries to determine the feasibility of IoT-informed decision-making
    for improving the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural production. Some
    examples include the Accelerating Precision Agriculture to Decision Agriculture
    (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang et al., 2017) and SmartAgriHubs (Chatzikostas
    et al., 2019) and SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos et al., 2012) in Europe. Yet, the adaptation
    of IoT technology in the agricultural sector is still in its infancy (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). IoT enables us to gather information from enclosed proximity to
    the physical location using fog computing, edge computing, communication protocols,
    and sensor technologies. They show potential in improving decision-making and
    productivity in various stages of agricultural production. Examples include the
    use of wireless in-field sensors in improving the measurement of soil moisture
    and permittivity (Salam, 2020; Bogena et al., 2010), autonomous precision irrigation
    systems (Dong et al., 2013), and identification and tracking of livestock animals
    (Trotter et al., 2010). Satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and new remote
    sensing approaches (e.g., PlanetLab) are increasingly used in IoT. For example,
    UAVs have been used for plant height estimation (Anthony et al., 2014; Herwitz
    et al., 2004), biomass estimation (Sinha et al., 2015), crop yield prediction
    (Ashapure et al., 2020; Panday et al., 2020), detection of weeds (De Castro et
    al., 2017), soil nitrogen management (Ballester et al., 2017), crop disease detection
    (Sugiura et al., 2016), and estimation of the leaf area index (LAI) (Hunt et al.,
    2008). Despite the growing interest of the agricultural research community in
    integrating IoT-enabled devices into production, to date, such technologies are
    not widely adopted by producers due to concerns associated with cost and return
    on investment (Narwane et al., 2022; Pillai & Sivathanu, 2020). More specifically,
    there is a need to understand the benefits and utilities of IoT from different
    perspectives (users, developers, and researchers) to fully utilize its potential
    to improve crop production under limited resources and climate change. Therefore,
    in this paper, we review existing literature and discuss the concepts, applications,
    potential challenges, and opportunities associated with IoT with a specific focus
    on its application in digital agriculture. First, we provide the concepts and
    technical details of different components of IoT, followed by its applications
    in digital agriculture, and associated challenges and opportunities. Overall,
    this review is expected to provide useful insights into how IoT could be integrated
    into the smart agriculture framework for improving crop productivity and food
    security in the face of climatic change and variability. Core Ideas Different
    platforms, sensors, and structures of IoT in digital agriculture were reviewed.
    The application of IoT in data management, interoperability, and precision farming
    was reviewed. Potential of IoT to improve agricultural quality and productivity
    was highlighted. Challenges and opportunities of IoT in digital agriculture were
    discussed. 2 COMPONENTS OF THE IOT The key components of the IoT include IoT platforms,
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and the IoT structure. An IoT platform can be
    defined as an on-premises software suite or a cloud service (IoT platform as a
    service [PaaS]) that monitors and may manage and control different kinds of endpoints,
    generally through apps installed on the platform. Similarly, WSN refers to an
    infrastructure-less wireless network that is installed ad hoc in a large number
    of wireless sensors to monitor system, physical, or environmental factors. The
    structure of IoT largely consists of devices, network structure, and cloud technology
    that allow IoT devices to communicate with each other. These components are discussed
    separately below. 2.1 IoT platforms IoT platforms provide proprietary or open-source
    suite for controlling devices and data in IoT system. Various IoT platforms, both
    proprietary and open source, are currently available to handle data from diverse
    sources using different devices. They serve functions like ingestion, filtering,
    aggregation, storing, and computation of data (Jayaraman et al., 2016). These
    platforms support specific microcontrollers, transceivers, data and extension
    memory, and programming. Some select platforms in agriculture are available from
    Tzounis et al. (2017) and are discussed in detail as follows. 2.1.1 FarmBot FarmBot
    is an open-source precision agricultural project platform that consists of a farming
    machine, software, and a repository for farming data. The three main components
    of FarmBot include mechanisms for seed planting, a nutrient delivery system, and
    a universal tool mounting system. FarmBot is generally used in urban farming for
    monitoring plant growth parameters and predicting a suitable harvest date at a
    future point in time (Nugraha et al., 2020). FarmBot can plant seeds with a regular
    watering schedule and can be remotely accessed with ease from Internet-connected
    devices (Murdyantoro et al., 2019). It takes the location of each plant into account
    to facilitate essential nutrients and water application for optimal plant growth
    based on feedback from the online database of records from various agricultural
    fields. The main purpose of FarmBot technology is to optimize the quality and
    quantity of agricultural produce and to enhance resource efficiency. Arduino,
    an open-source hardware and software company, which manufactures microcontrollers,
    is used to control the FarmBot and is connected to the Internet using a Raspberry
    Pi 3 board. A decision support system (DSS) has been implemented to help in data-driven
    design, access to the open repository, and real-time control of the parameters.
    An Android application can be designed to monitor the stepper motor location to
    carry out different farm operations, plant seeds using the vacuum pump in the
    field, and capture images. 2.1.2 Raspberry Pi Raspberry Pi is a small, low-cost
    computer chip capable of being used with a computer monitor, mouse, and keyboard.
    The basic structure of a Raspberry Pi includes random access memory (RAM), a processor,
    USB ports, general purpose input/output pins, an Ethernet port, a full HDMI port,
    a camera interface, a display interface, and a micro SD card slot (Balamurugan
    et al., 2017). The Raspberry Pi has been used in a wide variety of applications
    in agricultural systems. The growing availability of Raspberry Pi with high processing
    capacity has enabled many remote sensing tasks in agriculture, including crop
    imaging, determination of soil fertility, crop yield estimation, and spraying
    of fertilizers (Mathe et al., 2022). Flores et al. (2016) utilized a Raspberry
    Pi as a local server to display the relative humidity, air temperature, soil moisture,
    soil electrical conductivity, and soil pH through the use of a graphical user
    interface. Kamath et al. (2019) used a Raspberry Pi to monitor weeds in paddy
    crops and Bluetooth 4.0 to send data to remote base station using visual sensor
    nodes. These sensor readings were then processed using machine learning models
    (e.g., support vector machines and random forests) to distinguish weeds from paddy
    crops using shape features. 2.1.3 IRIS Mote An IRIS Mote (Crossbow) is a computing
    system consisting of a microcomputer plus one or more sensors that are connected
    wirelessly via a radio link. The IRIS Mote has one of the highest communication
    ranges (close to 500 m) using a 2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15.4 wireless module. It also
    includes an Intel XScale processor, 8 KB of RAM, 512 KB of flash memory, and a
    transmission rate of 250 kbps. The expansion connector has eight channel analog
    inputs. The IRIS Mote handles task scheduling and input/output processing (Liu
    et al., 2015) using an open-source TinyOS operating system based on an ATMega1281
    low-power microcontroller (Sivagami et al., 2010). The transmission current of
    IRIS Mote is 10–17 mA, whereas the receiver current is 16 mA. The indoor communication
    range of the device is greater than 300 m, and the outdoor communication range
    is greater than 50 m (Narayanan et al., 2016). The underground communication range
    is reduced to less than 30 m due to interference in radio frequency communication.
    The IRIS Mote is used in small agricultural fields to monitor climatic and hydrologic
    parameters like rain, sunlight, humidity, and temperature of a system. 2.1.4 Zolertia
    The Zolertia Z1 Mote (Zolertia S.L., Barcelona, Spain) is a platform designed
    for WSNs. It is compatible with TinyOS, OpenWSN, and RIOT OS. It supports analog
    and digital sensors and includes an MSP432 microcontroller, 8 KB of RAM, and 92
    KB of flash memory. It can operate in the temperature range of −25 to −85°C. It
    is designed to work in the range of 0.3–3.6 V, powered by two 1.5 V AA standard
    batteries (Zolertia, 2010). Agricultural use of Zolertia has previously been reported
    in greenhouse-based tomato farming, where the attenuation of radio waves in the
    2.4 GHz freeband was measured using a received signal strength indicator (Cama-Pinto
    et al., 2021). Zolertia Z1 Mote has also been used in determining agro-climatic
    variables like temperature and soil moisture in cassava (Manihot spp.) production
    (Caicedo-Ortiz et al., 2018). 2.1.5 Node MicroController Unit Node MicroController
    Unit (NodeMCU) is an open-source IoT platform with an ESP8266 microcontroller
    and Wi-Fi system on chip (SoC) from Expressif Systems, and hardware, which runs
    on an ESP-12 module. This firmware runs on Lua scripting language (Vanaja et al.,
    2018). It functions the same way as a Raspberry Pi in the case of agricultural
    applications and may be connected to various sensors for real-time monitoring
    of soil moisture, relative humidity, and air temperature. In one study, NodeMCU
    was used to monitor the environmental conditions of indoor greenhouses (Wan et
    al., 2019). A cloud-based platform has been used to store the environmental sensor
    readings and has been used for automatic irrigation systems for controlling agriculture
    pumps and remote monitoring systems resulting in increased economic benefits (Bentabet,
    2020). 2.1.6 Intel Galileo/Edison The Intel Galileo (Intel) board is based on
    Intel architecture (Intel Quark SoC X1000, 400 MHz processor) and is designed
    to have powerful functionalities with minimum power consumption. This allows users
    to apply shields compatible with Intel Galileo and extend the functionality of
    the board. It comprises two levels—legacy controlled blocks and microbuses. The
    legacy-controlled blocks are used for specific functions using dedicated channels.
    It has a dedicated point-to-point connection to connect to standard modules like
    Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and SIM card modules for cell phones. The issues of these boards
    within agriculture are similar to that of the Raspberry Pi (Silpa et al., 2018).
    These boards are used in a house environment monitoring system, which helps in
    producing high-quality crops with minimal labor costs (Ajith et al., 2020). Some
    other applications are observed in the monitoring of soil pH and nutrients of
    cultivated crops (Sakthisudhan et al., 2019). 2.2 Wireless sensor network WSN
    is an important component of IoT, and its use in the agricultural sector has been
    widely discussed (Mahbub, 2020; Sanjeevi et al., 2020). A WSN is a wireless network
    consisting of spatially distributed sensors and sensor nodes to monitor physical
    or environmental conditions and transfer data to a base station. These systems
    are often inexpensive, scalable, and consist of mobile nodes (Kiani & Seyyedabbasi,
    2018). Briefly, the WSN system consists of two major components, sensor nodes
    and sink nodes (base station) (Kocakulak & Butun, 2017). The sensor node consists
    of a power unit, a sensing unit, and a computing unit. These nodes may be placed
    inside or outside an agricultural field to continuously feed data to the base
    station. Depending on the ad hoc system configuration or network type, the sensor
    node could behave as a data originator or router. Sensor nodes can collect real-time
    physical or environmental conditions such as temperature, vibration, or motion
    time and produce sensory data (Pottie, 1998; Senouci & Mellouk, 2016). At the
    same time, the sink node collects sensor data and communicates with the end user
    via a direct connection. This connection between the sensor and sink nodes is
    established via the Internet, satellite, or any wireless link, and the data is
    accessed through an app or end-user interface. 2.3 IoT structure IoT structure
    is a system that helps in connecting objects to the Internet through information-sensing
    equipment to establish data exchange and communication and to monitor and manage
    digital systems (Ye et al., 2014). To achieve such functions, IoT uses the perception,
    network, and application layers, as well as the security strategy for each layer,
    as a part of its framework (Gou et al., 2013). The IoT structural hierarchy is
    shown in Figure 2 (Zhong et al., 2015), but more generalized structural components
    are discussed in sub-sections below. Different layers within the hierarchy are
    crucial to address issues like computational loss, poor access control, data leaks,
    malware risks, and cyberattacks (apriorit.com/dev-blog). FIGURE 2 Open in figure
    viewer Hierarchy of the Internet of Things (IoT) structure. 2.3.1 The perception
    layer The perception layer is the foundation of IoT and is the interface between
    the physical world and the digital world. This layer functions as “nerve endings”
    collecting measured signals and transporting those signals to the rest of the
    system (Yang et al., 2012). It uses radio frequency identification technology,
    barcode technology, sensor, and positioning technology to complete information
    collection and helps in controlling the perception by the actuators. The main
    security issues in a perception layer are related to information collection and
    transmission as most sensors have a simple structure and processor and do not
    have complex security protection capabilities (Zhao & Ge, 2013). 2.3.2 The network
    layer The network layer is generally composed of two layers—the network access
    layer and the network transmission layer. The access layer consists of a base
    station node and a gateway. Current methods of network access are Wi-Fi, Ad Hoc,
    Mesh, and Zigbee. The network transmission layer is responsible for the transmission
    and exchange of information, including satellite, mobile, and optical fiber communication
    networks. It is analogous to a person''s nervous system and brain, which are used
    to transmit and cope with the information from the perception layer. The most
    common security issues in a network layer occur when a number of malicious nodes
    send data at the same time, which may lead to a denial of service attack (Bello
    et al., 2017). 2.3.3 The application layer The application layer is generally
    composed of two layers—the application support layer and the application presentation
    layer. The support layer is responsible for data storage, information processing,
    and the exchange of information. The presentation layer is used for processing
    data from the application support layer. It uses technology with multimedia, virtual
    reality, and human–computer interfaces to connect the IoT and the user. The main
    security issues concerning the application layer may include data access permission,
    identity authentication, data protection and recovery, big data handling, and
    software vulnerabilities, among others (Karagiannis et al., 2015). 3 APPLICATIONS
    OF IOT IN DIGITAL AGRICULTURE Digital agriculture is directly linked with IoT.
    Indeed, IoT offers multiple applications in the production, circulation, and modernization
    of farming businesses (Chen & Jin, 2012; Ozdogan et al., 2017). The term “digital
    agriculture” refers to the on-farm and off-farm uses and applications of data
    based on location, weather, energy use, or other factor using sensors, machines,
    or satellites to monitor animals, plants, or soil (Klerkx et al., 2019). It integrates
    concepts from precision and smart farming. The basic framework (Tang et al., 2002)
    of digital agriculture includes: Agricultural databases that include information
    about farmlands, climatic conditions, and socioeconomic background that relates
    agricultural activities to the human society. Real-time monitoring and updating
    of information in the database about meteorology, vegetation, and soil information
    on and under the ground using in situ and satellite-based sensors. A network transmission
    and processing system to analyze collected information, make decisions, and transfer
    signals in controlling the functions of agricultural machinery. The actuation
    framework that includes digitized sowing and harvesting devices enabled with Geographic
    Information System and Global Position Satellite systems. Different crop, soil,
    and weather sensors are increasingly used in monitoring plant growth, diseases,
    pests, yield, weather variables (temperature, humidity, rain, air, etc.), and
    soil physical–chemical and hydraulic properties (Acharya et al., 2017; Sehgal
    et al., 2005). Sensors are used in real-time monitoring and reporting of agricultural
    parameters in the value chain, cloud computing, and integration of these processes
    with advanced technologies like UAVs and satellites to enable highly efficient,
    qualitative, profitable, and environmentally sound agricultural decision-making.
    Sensor-based data is also utilized in formulating predictive models to forecast
    crop yield (Supit et al., 2012). Some applications of IoT systems in digital agriculture
    are discussed as follows. 3.1 UAVs in digital agriculture Traditionally, satellites
    have been used to detect spectral responses from plants and soil (Dematte et al.,
    2018). However, satellite data is often of coarse resolution that is not applicable
    for canopy and plot scale applications and is not available regularly due to cloud
    cover and sensor property. UAVs provide a noninvasive and cost-effective approach
    to collect data at a much finer scale at the desired time scale. UAVs are defined
    as “a set of configurable elements consisting of a remotely piloted aircraft,
    its associated remote pilot station(s), the required command and control links,
    and any other system elements as may be required, at any point during flight operation”
    (International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO). UAV-derived images can be processed
    to monitor and predict plant growth parameters, disease and pest incidence, yield,
    and different soil physical and hydraulic properties. Nowadays, smart technologies
    have been built into UAVs by integrating open-source technology, autonomous programs,
    smart sensors, and payloads (Puri et al., 2017). Different hyperspectral, multispectral,
    and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors can be mounted to the UAVs for
    near real-time monitoring of vegetation conditions, extraction of soil and vegetation
    indices (Ni et al., 2018), and predicting LAI. For example, multispectral sensors
    are increasingly used to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index,
    normalized difference red-edge index, leaf water content index, soil-adjusted
    vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, tile drainage, and plant water status
    by capturing the reflectance including those in visible, near-infrared, and shortwave
    regions of the electromagnetic radiation (Tables 2 and 3). TABLE 2. Different
    sensors used in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their advantages and disadvantages
    (Modified from Acharya et al., 2021). Sensors Advantages Disadvantages Red/green/blue
    (RGB) Portable, common, relatively inexpensive, provide high-quality RGB images
    for ortho-imagery and digital surface model, easy to integrate with different
    platforms Wider bandwidth and lower spectral resolution lack geometric and radiometric
    calibration Multispectral Multiple wavelengths allow geometric reconstruction

    measurements Higher cost, limited compatibility with UAVs, requires ground filtering

    applications (Table 4; Acharya et al., 2021). Two widely used UAVs include fixed-wing
    and rotary-wing UAVs (Dileep et al., 2020). Fixed-wing UAVs use airplane-like
    wings to generate lift and to move forward. Some of their properties include lower
    cost, higher endurance, and greater flight speed as compared to rotary-wing UAVs.
    Contrastingly, rotary-wing UAVs use rotor blades and are characterized by vertical
    takeoff and landing capacity, lower flight altitude, and lower flight speed. UAVs
    may be used for mid-season crop health monitoring of vegetative indices using
    near-infrared and other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum that cannot be
    sensed by the human eye (Table 3; Cancela et al., 2019; Ren et al., 2020; Veroustraete,
    2015). Pathak et al. (2020) reported the use of UAVs in spraying herbicides on
    up to 20–40 ha per day and to further eradicate farmers’ direct contact with poisonous
    chemicals and hazardous operational conditions. UAVs can be used to generate variable-rate
    application maps from the images to determine the strength of nutrient uptake
    in a single field. This has the potential to further minimize fertilizer costs
    and optimize crop yield (Kulbacki et al., 2018). UAV-based LiDAR systems and software
    have shown potential in stitching together thousands of high-quality aerial photographs
    to develop 3D maps for monitoring soil erosion and developing conservation strategies
    (Acharya et al., 2021). More recently, new types of aerial imagery and satellite
    (e.g., PlanetLab) have shown tremendous potential in monitoring crops, making
    informed decisions, and increasing yield (Cai et al., 2019). TABLE 4. Applications

    aerial imaging and field and crop monitoring 3.2 Cloud-based information communication
    technology (ICT) systems The main purpose of cloud-based information communication
    technology (ICT) systems is to provide tools to software developers to develop
    a variety of cloud-based services to monitor plant growth parameters and predict
    crop yield (Kaloxylos et al., 2012). This infrastructure consists of data collection,
    statistical analysis, and the creation of commands to control farming equipment.
    In a practical setup, data is generally transferred from a local farm management
    system to the cloud repository associated with the monitoring service in order
    to keep track of the farm activities. The data is subsequently analyzed by an
    expert online system such as an e-agriculturist, and outputs are made directly
    available to the farmers. An ICT system has three major components (Patil et al.,
    2012). The first is an information collection layer, which consists of a sensor-based
    climatic and agricultural dataset. Data may include but is not limited to air
    temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, atmospheric gas concentrations;
    names, models, and prices of agricultural products; operating status of agricultural
    equipment, and locations of agricultural products. The second layer is the transport
    or network layer, which is responsible for transmitting and processing data received
    from the sensor layer above. Finally, the application layer analyzes and processes
    information to cultivate digital awareness. One of the leading examples of a cloud-based
    ICT system is GeoFarmer (Eitzinger et al., 2019). GeoFarmer consists of a modular
    design, which is interoperable through an application programming interface. It
    follows open access standards regarding existing tools and technologies and the
    system is designed and developed in accordance with user needs. Further, the entire
    process and lessons learned in the development process are documented. Similar
    software architecture has been defined in FIWARE, an open-source platform for
    a smart digital future, which focuses on agricultural sensors with reprogrammable
    firmware and a set of interfaces already embedded in the General Packet Radio
    Service board. Cloud-based systems have been applied to monitor pesticide use
    and safety in vegetable crops (Qian et al., 2018). Interfaces of such systems
    consist of guidelines for pesticide purchasing and application, optimal harvest
    time estimation, and a feedback system formulation to monitor the health of vegetables.
    A mobile-based cloud architecture was implemented through AgroMobile (Prasad et
    al., 2013), which enhances smart agricultural practices with the help of image
    processing techniques, image visualization, and cloud-based data processing. A
    similar precision agriculture technique using cloud computing has been proposed
    in enhancing the capacity for special education leadership for aggregate farming
    in the cloud (Castillejo et al., 2020) to increase efficiency and productivity
    and reduce labor costs. Other applications include quality control in greenhouse
    production, and monitoring soil moisture levels, humidity, and temperature in
    agricultural plots. 3.3 Big data in agriculture Big data refers to datasets that
    are too large to be analyzed by traditional data processing software and applications.
    The integration of big data technologies and best farming practices has the potential
    to facilitate improved crop production, plant protection, postharvest analysis,
    and environmental conservation. The major applications of big data in different
    topologies of digital agriculture are available from Sarker et al. (2019) and
    are briefly discussed here. The first application of big data is in precision
    agriculture. Thus, data collected using sensor-enabled hardware and software tools
    is used for assessing, controlling, and improving crop management, crop performance,
    and environmental quality. The second application is prescription agriculture,
    where big data is used to prescribe agronomic practices for optimizing yield.
    The third application is in enterprise agriculture, which includes the agribusiness
    platform and links field data to inventory, logistics, machinery, and profit.
    Finally, the fourth application is in automated agriculture, where farm data and
    environmental data are used to automate agriculture through robotic technologies.
    The data lifecycle in agriculture consists of data generation, warehousing, cleaning,
    annotation, and processing to optimize or improve agricultural production while
    maintaining the quality of the environment (Chaterji et al., 2020). In the following
    section, we briefly describe each of these steps. Data generation may involve
    the use of site-specific or public data. Site-specific datasets, such as soil
    nutrient composition and fertilizer usage, are generally privately held. Examples
    of public data may include topographic or soil textural information of a location.
    Data warehousing allows the data to be integrated from multiple sources and then
    restructured for improved performance. Data annotation is a data labeling technique
    that translates an encoded value to raw data. Because classical WSNs have limitations
    in interpreting and understanding the context of raw sensor data, annotation is
    highly recommended for end-user applications (Khan et al., 2015). On the other
    hand, getting rid of the corrupt or inaccurate values from the tables is a very
    important step in processing and helps to eradicate outliers from the dataset.
    Finally, processing imagery data results in more useful formats, which is largely
    accomplished by using a variety of analysis techniques such as Artificial Intelligence.
    Despite the considerable importance of big data in modernizing agriculture, a
    dearth of publicly available, high-quality datasets remains a formidable challenge
    to farming using alternate techniques. A combination of machine learning and IoT
    may be crucial in filling those gaps and in designing interactive wireless sensor–actuator
    networks for the commercial application of alternative farming systems (e.g.,
    Aquaponics) (Dhal et al., 2022a, 2022b; Dhal, Jungbluth, et al., 2022). 3.4 Digital
    twins in agriculture Digital twins generally refer to a digital replica of real-world
    entities mirroring their behavior and states over the entire lifetime in a virtual
    world. It is generally a standardization of real-world variables and can be used
    irrespective of place, time, and human observation (Botín-Sanabria et al., 2022).
    A digital twin in agriculture has been described as a multi-physical, multi-scale,
    and probabilistic simulation model of complex production. It uses a combination
    of in situ sensors and physical models to mirror physical life. Information from
    sensors and satellite data is taken as input to design digital twins (Verdouw
    et al., 2021) and is utilized in reproducing historical statistics and predicting
    future values. The process involves data integration, Artificial Intelligence,
    and machine learning. Digital twins show potential for aiding in planning and
    managing soil operations, irrigation, robotics, and farm machineries (Nasirahmadi
    & Hensel, 2022). WSNs in farmlands and cloud servers that run machine learning
    algorithms can detect plant diseases, weed clusters, and nutrient deficiencies
    (Angin et al., 2020). Indeed, significant progress has been made in using digital
    twins in the field of arable farming, dairy farming, greenhouse horticulture,
    and livestock rearing (Howard et al., 2020; Verdouw et al., 2017). For example,
    digital twins have been designed to monitor the health of cows (Bos taurus) and
    pigs (Sus domesticus), model firmness and loss of vitamin content in mango (Mangifera
    indica), identify diseases and pests in olives (Olea europaea) and other crops,
    assist in fleet management and tracking machinery, and identify pesticide exposure
    in bees (Apis mellifera) (Pylianidis et al., 2021). These applications of the
    digital twins within the agricultural sector have been observed in seven major
    fields: real-time monitoring of data, energy consumption analysis, system failure
    analysis and prediction, optimization of resources, behavioral analysis, technological
    integration, and virtual maintenance (Angin et al., 2020). More recently, the
    concept of digital twins has been applied in postharvest management by categorizing
    simulations into three stages: input, throughput, and output (Dyck et al., 2022).
    This enables monitoring of moisture and temperature of grain to ensure safe storage
    and movement within the elevator. Further, a sensor network could be used in storage
    to ensure the optimal quality of grains. 4 ADVANTAGES OF USING IOT IN AGRICULTURE
    The demand for agricultural products will increase as the global population grows
    and as climate change occurs (Bradshaw & Brook, 2014). IoT shows the potential
    to lower the impact of these challenges while meeting this demand for agricultural
    products. Indeed, IoT offers a potential solution to increase agricultural efficiency
    and productivity while saving time, labor, and money. Because of the cost and
    time effectiveness of IoT systems, the use and installation of IoT devices in
    the agricultural industry are increasing by nearly 20% annually and are expected
    to reach 225 million devices by 2024 (Elijah et al., 2018). In addition, the expansion
    of cellular service and 5G connectivity introduced by satellite and cellular network
    companies in rural areas have boosted the use of IoT in recent years (Di et al.,
    2019; Chen et al., 2022). The advancement of IoT connectivity to personal and
    portable electronic items, such as cell phones, iPads, and tablets, along with
    the introduction of advanced WSNs and machine learning facilitates real-time data
    retrieval, processing, and decision-making. The advantages of IoT in agriculture
    include interoperability, wide advantages of WSN, and data management using cloud
    and fog computing. In the following section, we discuss these advantages in detail.
    4.1 Interoperability The data collected through WSNs and sensor nodes is made
    available using apps, equipment, and products to communicate and process them
    in a way that does not require any involvement from end users, which is called
    interoperability (Tzounis et al., 2017). In other words, interoperability is the
    data communication approach that allows using different information systems to
    transfer and comprehend information. The interoperability process consists of
    two methods. The first method makes the data available through a local area network
    or a wide area network. The second method shares the data via software or hardware
    between different systems and machines. In the utilization of IoT, interoperability
    plays a vital role in facilitating and exchanging effectively organized data between
    information systems. Interoperability provides multiple benefits, such as system
    adaptability, better productivity, data unity, improved data protection, fewer
    errors, and lower data acquisition costs. The interoperability functionality includes
    three approaches, which include syntactical, structural, and semantical approaches
    (Aydin & Aydin, 2020). Syntactic interoperability allows the use of two or more
    systems simultaneously to communicate and share data even if the interface or
    language is not the same. Structural interoperability defines the standard data
    exchange format from one system to another to understand the information clearly.
    Moreover, semantic interoperability allows connecting two or more systems and
    sharing data between them in a meaningful way. 4.2 Smart irrigation and decision
    support The use of sensors and communication technologies, microcontrollers, and
    actuators has the potential to improve water use efficiency, reduce the cost of
    irrigation, and increase crop productivity (Abbasi et al., 2019). For example,
    UAVs are increasingly used in monitoring plant water use efficiency, which provides
    a base to select plant varieties for breeding and crop improvement, particularly
    in water-limited systems. Soil moisture sensors using capacitance or frequency
    domain technology are able to continuously monitor soil moisture in determining
    irrigation rate and time. Farmers may use mobile phones or wireless personal digital
    assistants to remotely control data loggers and monitor and analyze moisture for
    irrigation scheduling and automation. The applications of different machine learning
    algorithms in developing irrigation support systems are shown in Table 5. The
    irrigation DSS allows a weekly schedule to meet the irrigation water needs of
    a plantation based on inputs to a data-driven model. Some automated and smart
    irrigation systems using WSN, the Internet, cloud computing, and optimization
    tools are discussed in Krishnan et al. (2020) and Ramachandran et al. (2018),
    among others. TABLE 5. Application of machine learning techniques as decision
    support systems in Internet of Things (IoT)-based agricultural applications. Application
    of IoT in irrigation decision support, input, and salient features Reference Input
    variables: Temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, rainfall, dew point, vapor

    future irrigation schedules formulated Li et al. (2018) Input variables: Forecasted

    (decision support system [DSS]-based and soil-moisture based) have been proposed
    to improve cotton yield and water productivity Chen et al. (2020) Irrigation scheduling
    has been formulated using Fuzzy logic methods Giusti and Marsili-Libelli (2015)
    Output variable: Irrigation schedules Machine learning model: Linear regression,
    random forest regression and support vector regression Torres-Sanchez et al. (2020)
    4.3 Smart greenhouse One application of WSNs includes the conversion of a traditional
    greenhouse into a “smart greenhouse” (Kodali et al., 2016). The sensors automatically
    adjust the greenhouse climatic conditions, such as air pressure, relative humidity,
    air temperature, and light conditions, according to a particular set of instructions.
    The real-time greenhouse environment may be monitored via email and SMS alerts
    on mobile phones. For example, the installation of soil moisture sensors in the
    greenhouse activates an irrigation system only when the soil is dry. Recently,
    the use of solar-powered IoT sensors (Hou & Gao, 2010) has made building smart
    greenhouses an inexpensive and popular choice. 4.4 Data management With an increase
    in the application of IoT in multiple sectors and high-performance computing trends,
    the conventional database system has failed to meet the need and demand for massive
    sensor-derived data storage. In this regard, cloud base and fogging data storage
    in IoT platforms play a vital role in managing, transferring, and analyzing data
    into meaningful information using analytical tools. Cloud and fog computing have
    their characteristics to process data burdens and preferences, but they supplement
    each other. Using predictive analytics, a farmer could better predict weather
    conditions, maintain crop quality, and enhance soil fertility to formulate better
    plans and decisions related to crop harvesting and enhance crop quality and productivity.
    4.4.1 Cloud computing Cloud-based data management provides an option for computing
    resources on a pay-per-use basis. It is an extension of cluster and grid computing
    that collects resources at one central place and utilizes them for high-performance
    computing employing wireless connections (Qian et al., 2009; Armburst et al.,
    2020; Dillon et al., 2010). Such a computing system could be divided into two
    parts: front end and backend. The front end consists of client devices, such as
    computers, cell phones, tablets, and iPads, whereas the backend consists of data
    storage and processing located far away from the client. Cloud computing architecture
    provides three types of services, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),
    PaaS, and Software as a Service (SaaS) (Dempsey & Kelliher, 2018; Jagli et al.,
    2018; Laghari et al., 2016). IaaS platform is a remote data center that provides
    the right to change or configure storage capacity, processing power, and networking
    to their needs. PaaS provides a development platform for an application developer
    to create, test, and launch an application. SaaS deals with ready-made software
    tailored to various business needs and customer services. Cloud technology is
    also used to deliver mobile applications and is called mobile cloud computing
    (MCC). This method handles the information and relocates the storage from mobile
    devices to intense and centralized computing platforms situated in the cloud (Huang,
    2011). MCC takes the pressure off mobile devices by harnessing the power of cloud
    infrastructure. Many cloud service providers are compatible with Windows or Linux
    operating systems, such as Amazon Web Service, Server Space (ITGLOBAL), Microsoft
    Azure (Microsoft Corporation), Google Cloud Platform (Google LLC), IBM Cloud Services
    (International Business Machines Corporation), Adobe Creative Cloud (Adobe Inc),
    and Dropbox (Dropbox Inc). 4.4.2 Fog computing The motivation behind fog computing
    is the need for real-time computing. It is an extension of cloud computing that
    consists of multiple edge nodes directly connected to the physical device. As
    the nodes are physically much closer to the device, it seems more advanced and
    provides better performance than cloud computing for handling user requests and
    emerging standards (Atlam et al., 2018; Khan et al., 2017). Fog computing can
    include cloudlets, a small-scale and robust data center located at the edge of
    the network system to perform computation without sending it to a distant server.
    Thus, fog computing acts as an intermediary between computing hardware and a remote
    server, controls the information being sent to the server, and processes it locally.
    It supports heterogeneous devices to provide greater interoperability than cloud
    computing. However, the security and privacy concerns in Fog computing are big
    issues due to the prevalence of wireless networks from a business point of view
    compared to cloud computing and deserve further research (Khan et al., 2017).
    Because of attacks, such as jamming attacks, and sniffer attacks, numerous organizations
    are focusing on considerable research on the security issue of Fog computing,
    including Cisco, Microsoft Corporation, ARM Holding Plc, and Dell Inc. Farmers
    benefit from cloud and fog data management by registering into the system application.
    The application is often designed to store farmers’ details, agronomic marketing
    details, agronomic vendors, and agricultural service providers, such as fertilizer,
    pesticides, seed, and equipment, and information on the government''s scheme.
    Indeed, cloud and fog data management systems have both advantages and disadvantages
    (Table 6), which largely determine the choice of using one over another. TABLE
    6. Pros and cons of cloud and fog computing in Internet of Things (IoT). Cloud
    for IoT Fog for IoT Pros Cons Pros Cons Improved performance between IoT sensors
    and data processing system High latency because of the distance between client
    devices and data processing centers Low latency because users are geographically
    closer to Fog to get an instant response A more complicated system in data processing
    and storage/decentralized computing Storage capacity can be scalable to store
    and share enormous amounts of data Downtime due to interruption in network and
    multiple connected channels No issues with bandwidth and connection because multiple
    interconnected channels are involved in sending the data Additional expense requires
    routers, hubs, and gateways Virtual processing capabilities on demand via remote
    data center Security and privacy could be limited because thousands of gigabytes
    of data are being transferred simultaneously High security because numerous nodes
    are involved in the complex distribution system Potential for cyberattacks, such
    as jamming and sniffer due to the extension of network''s edge Reduced cost because
    of lower licensing fees than the cost of equipment and maintenance Rescheduling
    of failure management is slow Power efficiency and improved user experiences because
    each node runs efficiently and provides instant response to the users Limited
    scalability—because it cannot be scalable as the cloud 5 CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES
    OF USING IOT IN AGRICULTURE Data-driven agricultural practices are largely focused
    on precision, predictive, smarter, and efficient farming practices with minimal
    use of resources and enhanced agricultural automation (Ayaz et al., 2019; Patil
    et al., 2012). Therefore, the usage of IoT in agriculture is inevitable with the
    increasing demand for food, land, and changes in climatic conditions. However,
    IoT in agriculture presents several challenges. These challenges and opportunities
    are observed at different levels of data handling and analysis: Collection, data
    transmission, processing and storage, and the application of the data inferred
    (i.e., inference drawn from available data without much expense of resources;
    Tzounis et al., 2017) and are discussed in detail as follows. 5.1 Data collection
    Different IoT sensors are typically designed for a particular agriculture practice
    (Dholu & Ghodinde, 2018). The use of such sensors in different locations and climates
    is often challenging and may require either modification in design or further
    calibration. An ideal sensor should be user-friendly, efficient, robust, and able
    to withstand variable weather conditions. Although experts in the field can set
    up, install, and connect equipment, the application of data by farmers on day-to-day
    basis demands skills and training. The collection of real-time data is increasingly
    important in precision farming and requires an active Internet connection, which
    further presents a major challenge in IoT applications in underdeveloped countries
    and rural areas in the United States (Federal Communications Commission, 2020).
    Although IoT has been widely used in the field of precision agriculture, only
    proprietary solutions are currently being implemented, which creates difficulties
    with device compatibility and connectivity. There is a pressing need to discover
    other approaches that employ interoperable hardware built on open standards and
    platforms. Lower priced alternatives to expensive proprietary solutions can be
    found in the form of many already available products that are built on open hardware,
    at least in part (Stočes et al., 2016). Scaling up the use of integrated IoT technologies
    beyond early adopters is important, especially by making existing solutions easier
    to use and more affordable, thereby improving their selection and use by farmers
    and food companies. Therefore, business models that work for small companies and
    systematic analysis of associated costs and benefits may be necessary. More effort
    is necessary in improving the utilization of IoT technologies in a wide range
    of climates, crops, and soils. Efforts could be centered on the development of
    IoT devices for harsh environments (open air, dirt, dust, moisture, animal manure,
    cold storage, hot cleaning treatments, etc.) and for natural objects (plants,
    animals, square meters of soil, perishable food products), which have limited
    ways to embed IoT devices in the objects themselves. This is especially true for
    devices that use new technologies because there has already been a lot of progress
    in adapting more mature technologies (Verdouw et al., 2017). Indeed, IoT includes
    a large variety of heterogeneous devices; therefore, it is challenging to achieve
    high levels of compatibility among devices if they employ dissimilar standards
    and protocols. In order to overcome such obstacles, standard IoT protocols ought
    to be designed (Abbasi et al., 2019). There are several challenges associated
    with UAV deployments in the agricultural sector, including limited flight durations
    (<1 h), small coverage area, high costs, large amounts of imagery data resulting
    from flights, and geometric and radiometric correction issues. Further, UAVs could
    interfere with civilian aircraft and generate safety issues. There are often stringent
    national laws issued by aviation authorities in each country regarding flying
    UAVs. Typically, the only permission granted is for educational or experimental
    purposes. In the United States, the maximum flight altitude is 120 m above ground
    level, and UAVs are not permitted to fly at night. Finally, processing large volumes
    of imagery data requires special skills, time, and software, often demanding the
    use of machine learning, communication technologies, and data repositories. 5.2
    Data transmission, storage, and processing IoT systems must communicate, store,
    and process the data they have acquired. Data transmission is made feasible with
    adequate connectivity. Many parts of the world, including the United States, have
    poor or no broadband and Internet connection. A significant obstacle to IoT applications
    is the access to internet. Presence of agricultural fields in distinct locations
    limits Internet use and other connectivity (Antony et al., 2020). The data collected
    from one agricultural landscape is often not applicable in other areas. Although
    proper storage and security of the collected data are important, the cost of storage
    and further analysis and processing of stored data to develop an inference for
    its application in the fields remains challenging. New technologies, such as Starlink
    (https://www.starlink.com), free TV band/channels, and other communication channels,
    could be exploited to substitute Internet at remote locations. Further, it is
    important to consider human factors when sharing and communicating information
    between farms, regions, and enterprises. 5.3 Data security Security of routing
    protocols is a major challenge in WSNs. Privacy issues in WSNs are either data-oriented
    or context-oriented. The former is largely associated with handling, preserving,
    and integrity of datasets. The latter deals with contextual information like location
    and time (Abbasi et al., 2019). Indeed, data security, anonymity, and privacy
    present both formidable challenges and opportunities to coordinate data transfer,
    availability, and usability securely for both small and large stakeholders. Agricultural
    data can be difficult to mine because of its volume, noise, gaps, and heterogeneity.
    This, however, provides opportunities for data imputation, standardization of
    IoT, integration of multiple domains, and collaborative research in sensor and
    communication technologies (Abbasi et al., 2019; Verdouw et al., 2017). There
    are opportunities for developing high-throughput phenotypic platforms through
    new sensors or improvements in existing sensors, robotics, remotely sensing vehicles,
    communication technologies, and deep learning methods. 5.4 Application of the
    inferred data IoT provides a foundation for smart logistics, intelligent transportation,
    and affordable agricultural application to address climatic challenges, improve
    resource utilization and efficiency, and increased productivity (Chen & Jin, 2012).
    However, challenges remain in efficient data transmission systems and adaptation
    of outputs by farmers. Indeed, farmers must be technology savvy to understand
    and utilize information. Certain changes may be necessary at farmers’ fields,
    which may incur additional expenses for data collection or processing. Rural farmers
    are often hesitant to adopt new technology. The use of IoT in agriculture is challenging
    due to the complexity of agricultural fields and farming operations. Research
    in IoT is often constrained by short-term funding; thus, limiting data collection
    processes. Antony et al. (2020) reported that 2 to 3 years of funding in the agriculture
    sector is relatively ineffective as plants’ cropping cycle may vary with weather
    conditions. However, the need to feed the growing population has bestowed opportunities
    in utilizing recent advances in IoT (Mahanta et al., 2022) in greenhouse farming,
    vertical farming, hydroponic, and plant phenotyping. Nevertheless, we see a plethora
    of opportunities to utilize WSNs, digital twins, machine learning, and cloud computing
    in soil and crop monitoring, irrigation scheduling, water quality analysis, plant
    breeding, weed control, disease, and pest identification, pesticide spray, reuse
    and recycling of wastes, and livestock management. 6 CONCLUSION This paper reviewed
    the application of different IoT platforms, WSNs, and technologies like UAVs,
    cloud computing, and big data analytics in agricultural production systems and
    value chains, such as crop monitoring, irrigation support, weed and pest control,
    fertilizer application, and soil health assessment. The literature, in general,
    indicates the use of sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and machine learning
    in automated and smart irrigation systems and agricultural decision support. Different
    red, green, and blue, hyperspectral, multispectral, and LiDAR sensors could be
    mounted on UAVs for improved agricultural monitoring and forecasting to enable
    highly efficient, qualitative, and profitable farm products. Big data, data mining,
    and real-time analysis show promise to support and improve precision, prescription,
    enterprise, and automated agriculture. Cloud and fog data storage in IoT platforms,
    however, appear to be crucial in managing, transferring, and analyzing big agricultural
    data. This review also reveals opportunities in improving data security, anonymity,
    and usability, and developing high-throughput phenotypic platforms through new
    sensors or improvements in existing sensors, robotics, remote vehicles, communication
    technologies, and deep learning methods. Overall, IoT can improve production levels,
    cost-effectiveness, product quality, safety, and traceability through innovation,
    automation, and control while advancing the much-needed digital transformation
    of the agricultural sector in the face of climate change. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS

  description: The global increase in population necessitates enhanced food security,
    yet current agricultural practices are inadequate in feeding everyone and are
    detrimental to the environment. Consequently, agriculture faces the task of increasing
    production while minimizing resource usage and prioritizing sustainability. To
    assist farmers, new technological tools using AI, Robotics and IoT have been developed
    in a new field called Smart Farming. Unfortunately, these tools are primarily
    employed in unsustainable farming practices, such as mono-cropping. However, sustainable
    methods like Agroecology exist, which involve observing how plants interact with
    their environment to devise crop management strategies that work harmoniously
    with nature, requiring minimal resources and ensuring sustainability. In this
    paper, we propose an Internet of Things (IoT) platform that utilizes an ontology
    and a set of rules to provide farmers with recommendations for optimizing crop
    development while adhering to agroecology principles. This platform employs Knowledge-based
    reasoning to correlate crop requirements with local environmental data obtained
    through a wireless sensor network deployed on the farm. It can suggest crop layouts,
    crop calendars, detect relevant events, and manage irrigation. Our system has
    been tested in a simulated environment and yielded promising results, leaving
    ample room for future improvements and developments.

  description: 'Precision Agriculture (PA) promises to meet the future demands for
    food, feed, fiber, and fuel while keeping their production sustainable and environmentally
    friendly. PA relies heavily on sensing technologies to inform site-specific decision
    supports for planting, irrigation, fertilization, spraying, and harvesting. Traditional
    point-based sensors enjoy small data sizes but are limited in their capacity to
    measure plant and canopy parameters. On the other hand, imaging sensors can be
    powerful in measuring a wide range of these parameters, especially when coupled
    with Artificial Intelligence. The challenge, however, is the lack of computing,
    electric power, and connectivity infrastructure in agricultural fields, preventing
    the full utilization of imaging sensors. This paper reported AICropCAM, a field-deployable
    imaging framework that integrated edge image processing, Internet of Things (IoT),
    and LoRaWAN for low-power, long-range communication. The core component of AICropCAM
    is a stack of four Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) models running sequentially:
    CropClassiNet for crop type classification, CanopySegNet for canopy cover quantification,
    PlantCountNet for plant and weed counting, and InsectNet for insect identification.
    These DCNN models were trained and tested with >43,000 field crop images collected
    offline. AICropCAM was embodied on a distributed wireless sensor network with
    its sensor node consisting of an RGB camera for image acquisition, a Raspberry
    Pi 4B single-board computer for edge image processing, and an Arduino MKR1310
    for LoRa communication and power management. Our testing showed that the time
    to run the DCNN models ranged from 0.20 s for InsectNet to 20.20 s for CanopySegNet,
    and power consumption ranged from 3.68 W for InsectNet to 5.83 W for CanopySegNet.
    The classification model CropClassiNet reported 94.5 % accuracy, and the segmentation
    model CanopySegNet reported 92.83 % accuracy. The two object detection models
    PlantCountNet and InsectNet reported mean average precision of 0.69 and 0.02 for
    the test images. Predictions from the DCNN models were transmitted to the ThingSpeak
    IoT platform for visualization and analytics. We concluded that AICropCAM successfully
    implemented image processing on the edge, drastically reduced the amount of data
    being transmitted, and could satisfy the real-time need for decision-making in

    The demands for food, feed, fiber, and fuel increase rapidly due to the fast expansion
    of the global population, income growth, technological advancement, and transport
    and logistics improvements (van Dijk et al., 2021). Precision agriculture (PA),
    which seeks to apply the right amount of inputs (fertilizers, irrigation water,
    pesticides, and other chemicals) in the right location at the right time, is essential
    to meet the requirements of future global food production, as well as environmental
    sustainability and climate resilience. PA is predicated on accurate sensor measurements,
    timely and sound decision-making, and automated actuators. The backbone of PA
    is the Internet of Things (IoT) technology that automates data collection, data
    analytics, data presentation, control, and efficient data communication (Chamara
    et al., 2022). Imaging sensors or digital cameras are essential for PA as they
    can capture more information than traditional scalar or vector sensors. Images
    can capture crop phenology for precise decision-making (Taylor and Browning, 2022,
    Tian et al., 2020). Cyclic events such as vegetative growth, flowering, leaf count
    and color change, maturation, and senescence are studied in crop phenology, which
    is essential to PA as it determines the management inputs required by crops. Moreover,
    images have rich information on the scene that allows for pest pressure evaluation.
    At present, a limited number of sensors are available for pest identification
    and pest pressure estimation. Among them, imaging sensors provide the most promising
    solution. Conventional (handcrafted feature extraction) and Artificial Intelligence
    (AI)-based image processing are the two branches of image processing. Traditional
    approaches extract image features defined by shape, texture, and color (Anubha
    et al., 2019, Yuan et al., 2019). The AI-based methods use Convolutional Neural
    Networks (CNN) to extract features from images (Luis et al., 2020). CNN models
    with multiple hidden layers for feature extraction and learning are considered
    Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) (LeCun et al., 1998). Conventional imaging
    platforms in PA store images locally using onboard storage memories. Post processing
    refers to the processing of images stored at the central data storage in batches
    at a later time to extract useful information (Aasen et al., 2020). Imaging platforms
    that can access the internet through a stable connection with high bandwidth can
    automatically upload images to Cloud data storage. The vast majority of farmlands
    worldwide are in rural and remote areas with poor access to electric power and
    internet connectivity. This represents a big challenge for camera systems deployed
    in rural farmlands for high-speed image processing, data transmission, and low-latency
    decision-making (Richardson, 2019). Post-processing of crop images has been used
    for the estimation of leaf area index (Aasen et al., 2020), growth rate (Sakamoto
    et al., 2012), leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen content (Wang et al., 2014), fruit
    counts (Wang et al., 2014), and plant height (Sritarapipat et al., 2014). Further
    post-image processing allows for the assessment of biotic stress, such as pest
    density (Barbedo, 2014; Park et al., 2007) and weed pressure (Wang et al., 2019),
    as well as abiotic stress, such as nutrient deficiency (Ghorai et al., 2021).
    Richardson (2019) suggested that deep learning-based methods have the potential
    to facilitate the extraction of more sophisticated phenological data from both
    new and previously archived camera imagery compared to conventional image processing.
    Semantic segmentation-based canopy coverage (CC) estimation (Chamara et al., 2021;
    Liang et al., 2023), image classification-based crop identification (Anubha et
    al., 2019), disease identification (Sharma et al., 2020), growth stage prediction
    (Yasrab et al., 2021) and object detection-based plant feature identification
    (A. Wang et al., 2019) are examples of DCNN applications in agriculture. Conventional
    image processing requires less computational power and less energy, but they are
    limited in adaption to new scenarios, while deep learning requires high computational
    power and consumes more energy. DCNN models require large memory due to the large
    number of parameters these models hold. Therefore, it is not easy to implement
    these models practically in embedded systems that have less memory and computation
    power. These models also require a large amount of data to train to predict with
    high accuracy. Therefore, it is resource intensive. Edge image processing is the
    image processing done on image-capturing devices. The main advantage of edge image
    computing is that it lowers the high throughput data transmission requirement
    over a wireless IoT-enabled imaging network (Cao et al., 2020). Wang et al. (2022a)
    demonstrated the capability of identifying potted flowers with precision above
    89 % in real-time in a Jetson TX 2 computing module based on a DCNN algorithm.
    These authors suggested that a cloud-edge collaborative framework could achieve
    real-time and automatic learning for the DCNN model they have developed. Wang
    et al. (2022b) proposed a real-time weed detection model run on Jetson AGX Xavier
    for field robots. The authors proved it was possible to do real-time weed detection
    with a precision above 90 % yet required expensive hardware. Wang et al. (2022a)
    reviewed Raspberry Pi single-board computer-based real-time image processing applications.
    They concluded that Raspberry Pi (Datasheet Raspberry Pi Model B, 2019) is a cost-effective
    edge computing unit that could potentially be used as an edge image processing
    unit, and the capability of integrating it with IoT was also discussed. Zualkernan
    et al. (2022) demonstrated an edge image processing platform for the classification
    of animals and transmitting the identified animal and time of identification via
    LoRa for a camera trap. Past literature on IoT and image processing applications
    in agriculture has highlighted a research gap in edge image processing with IoT-enabled
    crop monitoring cameras. In-field crop cameras are expected to make real-time
    crop management decisions based on real-time image processing; however, poor internet
    connectivity in agricultural fields severely limits their capability. To address
    this gap, we have developed a novel imaging platform named AICropCAM that extracts
    plant and crop canopy level parameters through DCNN and uploads them to the Cloud
    via low-power, low-throughput communication protocols. We also demonstrated AICropCAM
    on an IoT-enable wireless sensor network in corn and soybean fields. A technology
    that addresses image processing at the lowest level (edge) and transmits only
    useful information can revolutionize real-time decision-making in PA. Therefore,
    the main objective of this paper is to demonstrate AICropCAM to perform edge image
    processing and low-throughput, low-power, and long-range data transmission through
    IoT technology. In this novel AICropCAM platform, multiple DCNN image processing
    algorithms run in series to extract plant-level and canopy-level features in an
    embedded system. Image classification, object detection with classification, and
    image segmentation are the three major applications of DCNN image processing,
    and all three are included in AICropCAM to demonstrate the capabilities of DCNN
    for image processing in PA. AICropCAM has trained models for canopy segmentation,
    crop classification, plant growth stage identification, plant counting, weed counting,
    and plant type identification. All the protocols that transmit data from AICropCAM
    to the Cloud were custom designed. AICropCAM sends the generated data to a cloud
    platform for logging, visualization, and analysis. Furthermore, this paper explains
    the DCNN model training process, model performance, and test results. We reported
    the model training comprehensively because it was essential for AICropCAM development.
    2. Materials and methods Essential activities in this research were data/image
    collection and preprocessing, hardware design for AICropCAM, software design for
    data transmission between the edge and the Cloud, deep learning model design,
    and model training and optimization (Fig. 1). AICropCAM was implemented in a corn
    and soybean field at the field phenotyping facility in Mead, Nebraska, USA (Bai
    et al., 2019). We demonstrated the training of the following DCNNs: CropClassiNet
    for classifying images based on image quality and crop type, CanopySegNet for
    segmenting crop canopy from the background, PlantCountNet for classifying and
    counting soybean and weed plants, and InsectNet for identifying insects and counting
    them. Download : Download high-res image (412KB) Download : Download full-size

    system (edge devices). 2.1. Image collection, annotation, preprocessing, and augmentation
    Image collection for DCNN model training occurred in four growing seasons using
    three different types of cameras: (i) commercially available Meidas SL122 trail
    cameras in 2019 (Meidas Trail Cameras, 2022), (ii) OV5642 imaging sensors with
    ArduCAM camera shields in 2020, and (iii) Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 with Raspberry
    Pi Zero in 2021 and 2022 (Chamara, 2021). All the cameras were mounted on the
    bars horizontally extended and fixed on stationary poles erected vertically in
    the fields, as shown in Fig. 2A. The distance between the crop canopy and the
    cameras was maintained between 0.5 and 1.5 m throughout the growing seasons. Images
    used for training the InsectNet were also captured with smartphones as we could
    not collect enough images with insects from the three types of cameras mentioned
    above. Download : Download high-res image (338KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Left: An Illustration of how AICropCAM was set up in the field for
    image collection. In addition to the camera, other components such as the solar
    panel and data logger were also shown. Right: A close-up view of AICropCAM and
    its hardware components. All three standard image annotation techniques in deep
    learning model training were utilized: (1) folder labeling for the image classification
    models, (2) pixel-level annotation for the semantic segmentation model, and (3)
    bounding boxes for object detection models. Images belonging to the same class
    were grouped into a single folder, and five distinct classes (or folders) were
    created: rejected, corn, soybean, grass, and night. Separating the crop canopy
    from the soil was done with pixel-level annotation and semantic segmentation.
    Bounding boxes, the smallest rectangle around an object, were drawn for corn plants,
    soybean plants, weed plants, and insects. Table 1 explains each type of annotation
    used in the model training. Table 1. Annotation criteria used to generate labels
    from the images to train and test the four deep convolutional neural network models
    in AICropCAM. Labeling Type Class Description Image classification (CropClassiNet)
    Rejected Images were labeled as rejected due to multiple reasons: blurred images
    caused by water droplets on the lens; the cameras turned away from the targeted
    crop; crops growing up to the camera blocking the view or capturing only a few
    leaves; people present in the images; lens covered with different stuff; and the
    camera was not installed in the field. Corn Images entirely covered by corn plants
    at different growth stages. Soybean Images entirely covered by soybean plants
    at different growth stages. Grass/Weed Images only comprise grass/weed plants
    at different growth stages. Night Images captured under low lighting conditions.
    Most of the cameras were not programmed to stop collecting images under low light.
    Crop canopy and background (CanopySegNet) Canopy Pixel labeling was done on the
    crop canopy. We used assisted freehand tool and the superpixel option in the MATLAB
    image labeler. Background Pixel labeling was done on the crop canopy. We used
    assisted freehand tool and the superpixel option in the MATLAB image labeler.
    Plant-type (PlantCountNet) Weed Weed present in the image was labeled using bounding
    boxes. It was challenging to locate the weed after the corn or soybean canopy
    was closed. Soybean Soybean plants present in the image were labeled using bounding
    boxes. Insects (InsectNet) Insects During the labeling process, without distinguishing
    insects based on their type, all the insects present in the images were labeled
    using bounding boxes. Image preprocessing is necessary for DCNN model training
    and real-time edge image processing. Differences in the input layer size in different
    DCNN models demand that images be resized before passing through the model for
    training or prediction purposes. High-resolution images improve accuracy but require
    more computational power. For specific applications, labeled datasets were only
    limitedly available. Therefore, image augmentation techniques were used to increase
    the number of image data sets, including scaling, flipping, cropping, rotation,
    color transformation, PCA color augmentation, and noise rejection (Paymode and
    Malode, 2022). Multiple augmentation techniques were used for each model, as detailed
    in Table 2. Additionally, Table 2 provides the numbers of images in training,
    validation, and testing for the four DCNN models. Table 2. DCNN model image allocation
    and image augmentation. Model Number of images Data Augmentation Techniques Total

    for the DCNN models but to demonstrate the concept of implementing edge image
    processing and transmitting the results to the Cloud for decision-making. Therefore,
    we selected a limited number of images for CanopySegNet, PlantCountNet, and InsectNet,
    which were sufficient to train models with a reasonable degree of accuracy. 2.2.
    DCNN model architecture selection, training, evaluation, and deployment on the
    edge device The steps to select model architecture/model backbone weights and
    image input sizes to train the best model for CropClassiNet, CanopySegNet, PlantCountNet,
    and InsectNet are summarized in Fig. 3. Unlike many DCNN applications that prioritize
    higher accuracy, our application focused on finding the balance between accuracy
    and model deployability on the edge device. Download : Download high-res image

    during the training and testing by attempting different model architectures, model
    backdone weights, and input image sizes. For example, in the development of CropSegNet
    (Segmentation), we selected DeepLabv3+ (Firdaus-Nawi et al., 2018) with weights
    initialized from pre-trained networks of ResNet18 (He et al., 2016), ResNet50,
    Xception, InceptionresnetV2, and MobileNetV2. The input image sizes tested were
    512 × 512 × 3 and 256 × 256 × 3, and training options were kept constant to find
    the best-performing networks, which should also be deployable to Raspberry Pi
    4B. This process identified DeepLabv3 + with ResNet50 as the most suitable model
    for CropSegNet, with an input image size of 512 × 512 × 3. Table 3 summarizes
    the hyperparameter values and training options for the final DCNN models deployed
    to the edge device. (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) Table 3. Hyperparameter values

    used for the classification models CropClassiNet and CropSegNet, whereas IoU and
    mAP (Mean Average Precision) were used for PlantCountNet and InsectNet. Jaccard
    index gives the proportion of correctly predicted labels to the total number of
    labels. Model training was performed on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti Mobile processor,
    a dedicated mid-range graphics card with 4 GB GDDR6 memory on a Dell XPS 15 9500
    Laptop. The laptop had an Intel Core i7-10750H 10th Gen processor,16 GB DDR4 RAM,
    and 1 TB SSD hard disk. 2.3. Hardware and software of AICropCAM The IoT data transmission
    and edge image processing hardware comprised the following major components: a
    Raspberry Pi 4B single-board computer, an Arduino MKR1310 development board, an
    Arduino MKR Relay Proto Shield, and a Dragino OLG02 outdoor dual channels LoRa
    Gateway (Fig. 4). The 12 V 8Ah battery powered the Raspberry Pi 4B, controlled
    through the relay shield managed by the Arduino MKR1310. A 3.7 V lithium polymer
    battery powered the Arduino MKR1310 board. There are two advantages of having
    a separate Arduino board. First, the Arduino board consumes less power than the
    Raspberry Pi 4B module. It can be switched on and off according to user requirements.
    Second, it allows uninterrupted communication between the edge node and the Cloud
    with low power. Download : Download high-res image (303KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Hardware overview of AICropCAM and data flow. AICropCAM
    required programming on two hardware platforms. Arduino was programmed using C++
    in Arduino’s Integrated Development Environment. Raspberry Pi imaging and image
    processing program was developed in MATLAB and deployed onto the Raspberry Pi
    4B using the MATLAB Coder and MATLAB Compiler. A python program was designed to
    read the saved data in the Raspberry Pi 4B and serially communicate to the Arduino
    MKR1310. The primary functions of the MRK1310 program were to (1) turn on the
    Raspberry Pi 4B module based on the user-defined time intervals, (2) get the processed
    data, including the results of DCNN model predictions, through serial communication
    from the Raspberry Pi 4B, and (3) transmit the data to the ThingSpeak Cloud channel
    through the LoRa gateway. All the DCNN models were trained using the MATLAB deep
    learning toolbox. In the edge deployment, a MATLAB program runs multiple models
    logically depending on the prediction result of the previous model estimation,
    as shown in Fig. 5. MATLAB coder generated the C and C++ code derived from the
    program we developed to run on the Raspberry Pi. MATLAB Compiler generated the
    standalone application on the Raspberry Pi (The MathWorks, 2022). Download : Download

    image processing and data generation flow chart. Table 4 lists the parameters
    generated by the models in AICropCAM. The abbreviations in Table 4 are fields
    holding data in the program to reduce the complexity of system development and
    maintain a common standard among different platforms. Fig. 6 shows the data generation
    from images. According to Fig. 6, the size of the images were around 2 MB before
    being fed into the image processing pipeline. The output message contains the
    crop type (CT), plant count (PC), weed count (WC), canopy coverage (CC), and pest
    count (PstC). The resulting message is typically less than 100 bytes. This represents
    a substantial reduction of memory size with the output being 0.00005 times the
    size of the original image. Consequently, this message can be transmitted in a
    single message via LoRa as the maximum LoRa packet size is around 256 bytes. Table

    full-size image Fig. 6. Examples of message generation and data size reduction
    for LoRa transmission. 2.4. Data transmission, visualization, and storage The
    data generated after image processing were saved on the Raspberry Pi 4B SD card,
    allowing access to the data remotely or through manual retrieval during field
    visits. Two options for transmitting the collected data to the ThingSpeak IoT
    platform are available. Firstly, the data can be uploaded directly from the Raspberry
    Pi 4B if internet connectivity is available for growers with Wi-Fi access. Secondly,
    the Raspberry Pi 4B transmits the recently acquired data to the Arduino MKR1310.
    The Arduino MKR1310 decodes the data received from the Raspberry Pi 4B and forwards
    it to the ThingSpeak. The second method is for low-rate, long-range communication
    beyond the limit of Wi-Fi. A single message receivable to the ThingSpeak server
    includes data for eight fields. In our demonstration, a single message was enough
    to transmit the data generated. Fields 1 and 2 are reserved for geographic coordinates
    (namely, latitude and longitude) to represent the device''s location. The third
    field was for camera orientation. Image quality/crop type, plant count, weed count,
    insect count, and crop canopy coverage were allocated from fields four to eight.
    ThingSpeak supports eight channels per gateway. If additional data is generated
    in the future, we have to create new channels to accommodate them. However, only
    data in a single channel can be passed through a single message. The Arduino-LoRa
    library was used to prepare the LoRa messages forwarded to the gateway (Mistry,
    2016). The message generated from the Arduino MKR1310 includes the device identification
    number and the data with the field number. Once the gateway receives this message,
    it adds the target client ID (generated by ThingSpeak when defining a device),
    host address (mqtt://mqtt3.thingspeak.com), server port number, username and password,
    channel ID, and the data in each field according to the Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT) protocol. Username and password ensure that only authorized devices
    can transmit data to the ThingSpeak platform. ThingSpeak provides two ways to
    interact with its platform, REST (Representative State Transfer) and MQTT protocols.
    The advantages of using MQTT over REST protocol are that it supports ThingSpeak
    data publishing, including immediate and minimum power consumption and data transmission
    over limited bandwidth, which encouraged us to select the MQTT protocol in our
    demonstration. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. DCNN model performance CropClassiNet
    had a test accuracy of 91.26 %, a Jaccard Index of 0.77, and an F1-score of 0.91;
    the confusion matrix is given in Fig. 7. The highest precision is for the “grass”
    class (100 %), and the lowest is for “soybean” (92.0 %). The highest recall is
    for the “corn” class (99.9 %), and the lowest is for “grass” (67.1 %). The primary
    goal of CropClassiNet is to determine the quality of new images and direct them
    for subsequent processing (Fig. 5). This step has never been executed in an image-based
    crop monitoring platform before. Further, CropClassiNet can eliminate erroneous
    images when humans are present in the camera’s field of view or when the camera
    is misaligned due to external factors. AICropCAM can send maintenance requests
    through IoT analytics if rejected images are continuously generated. Download

    achieved a global accuracy of 0.93, a weighted IoU of 0.87, and a mean BF score
    of 0.73. Fig. 8 shows an example of an original soybean image and the corresponding
    segmentation result by CanopySegNet, which estimated CC to be 18.72 %. Season-long,
    time-series images can be fed into CanopySegNet to generate diurnal and seasonal

    and seasonal variations of canopy coverage as computed by CropSegNet. According
    to Fig. 9, canopy coverage percentage variation is low during the daytime and
    reaches zero at night. This verifies the need to eliminate low-light images before
    segmenting. As shown in Fig. 5, it is possible to eliminate the generation of
    false values when the camera captures images under low light conditions by halting
    the process of running CanopySegNet. There are three diurnal variation series
    on 6/8/2021, 6/26/2021, and 7/12/2021 in Fig. 9. The CC increased from 8 % to
    95 % between 6/8/2021 to 7/12/2021. The seasonal trend showed that the CC reached
    a maximum around 7/8/2021. These results suggest that the proposed stacked models
    can track the daily and seasonal CC variation and eliminate the effect of lighting
    conditions on false value generation. Table 5. Performance of PlantCountNet and
    InsectNet on the test image set (Root mean square error (RMSE)/Final validation

    of the PlantCountNet and InsectNet is given in Table 5. Fig. 10(A) and 10(B) show
    the result obtained by PlantCountNet for a soybean image at an early vegetative
    stage (V3). Meanwhile Fig. 10(C) and 10(D) shows the result at a reproductive
    stage (R1). It can be seen that, at V3 stage, the model outputs matched the labels
    of soybean and weed plants well, indicating a level of high accuracy. Download

    result of PlantCountNet for soybean and weed counting: Manually annotated vs.
    model-predicted bounding boxes at V3 growth stage (A and B); manually annotated
    vs. model-predicted bounding boxes at R1 growth stage (C and D). The size of insects
    is very small compared to the size of images (Fig. 11), which is the main reason
    for the low mAP for InsectNet (Table 5). Increasing input image resolution beyond
    480 × 480 × 3 is impractical as it exceeds the memory limitation to load models
    into Raspberry Pi 4B. A potential solution could be to increase the resolution
    of the region of interest by splitting the original image while keeping the resolution
    the same. Also, we suggest using the approach recommended by Tetila et al., 2020a,
    Tetila et al., 2020b in the future on Raspberry Pi model 4B. As technology advances,
    we expect the memory capacities will increase for edge computing units. At the
    same time, the state-of-the-art object detection algorithms will improve the accuracy
    for small object detection. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    labels. 3.2. Power consumption for Raspberry Pi 4B Since edge cameras in farmlands
    have limited access to electric power, information on their power consumption
    is essential for designing IoT devices and systems. AICropCAM is designed to be
    energized by solar power. It runs on a rechargeable battery when there is no solar
    power. We monitored the maximum energy consumption of each task performed by AICropCAM,
    and the result is presented in Table 6. Four main strategies are available for
    the power management of IoT edge devices: Selecting power-efficient hardware,
    maintaining low power modes, dynamic power management, and cloud-based management.
    Raspberry Pi 4B is an affordable power-efficient single-board computer suitable
    for our application, but it does not naturally support low-power modes. Therefore,
    we introduced the Arduino MKR1310 LoRa module for the Raspberry Pi 4B dynamic
    power management. Furthermore, this Arduino module allows us to perform cloud-based
    central management independently. Table 6. Electrical power consumption of the
    Raspberry Pi 4B and the Arduino MKR1310 during edge image processing. Device Activity

    <0.01A LoRa transmission <0.01A For our measurements, we used a Raspberry Pi 4B
    with 8 GB of RAM, connected to an HDMI monitor, a USB keyboard, and a USB mouse,
    and ran a MathWorks® Raspbian image (file used to boot the Raspberry Pi 4B). The
    Raspberry Pi 4B was operated at room temperature and connected to a wireless LAN
    access point and a laptop via an Ethernet cable. The electric current consumption
    for running each DCNN model was recorded during the test. CropClassiNet had the
    highest current consumption, while the PlantCountNet and InsectNet models had
    the lowest. As for LoRa transmission, we could not measure its current consumption
    because the lowest value our instrument could measure was 0.01A. Based on the
    manufacturer''s specifications, the Arduino MKR1310 consumes 104 uA at 5 V. The
    average time to run the DCNN models is essential to estimate the energy consumed
    for each prediction. These parameters listed in Table 7 provide essential guidelines
    for designing IoT sensor nodes with suitable batteries and power sources. We also
    noticed that typically the first prediction of a model took the longest time,
    but the rest take a considerably shorter time to predict. Table 7. Time duration

    320 × 320 × 3 0.20 3.68 Semantic segmentation was the most power-demanding activity,
    while insect detection was the least. Changing the order of the image processing
    models and adding new models or dropping existing models is possible during regular
    operation. It enables dynamic power management within the Raspberry Pi module.
    The main advantage of AICropCAM is that it implements a stack of four DCNN-based
    image processing models with multiple objectives. To the best of our knowledge,
    this is the first time such a system has been developed for a field crop monitoring
    camera. AICropCAM has applications such as setting up smart in-field or greenhouse
    IoT camera networks with edge computing capability, monitoring crops by attaching
    them to sprinkler irrigation systems (pivots and linear moves), or collecting
    crop information through ground or aerial mobile robots. The relatively short
    time to run each DCNN model makes the system suitable for real-time applications,
    including variable rate irrigation, fertilization, and spraying. For example,
    a pivot irrigated multi-cropping system with AICropCAM can automate irrigation
    or fertigation transition between different crops or crops at different growth
    stages by automatically providing the crop type or growth stage information to
    the irrigation controller. Additionally, existing herbicide or pesticide sprayers
    can get the feedback of the PlantCountNet and InsectNet in the AICropCAM for precision
    spraying. 4. Conclusion and future perspectives This paper outlines the essential
    components of constructing a functional edge image processing framework for real-time
    crop monitoring. From a software standpoint, CropClassiNet can categorize captured
    images according to image quality and detect the presence of specific crop types
    for further processing. CanopySegNet can further quantify the degree of canopy
    coverage; PlantCountNet can count the number of plants and weeds in the image;
    and finally, InsectNet can count the number of insects in the image. These four
    DCNN models, when implemented on edge devices, can extract an array of important
    crop and canopy parameters from field images and enable real-time, low-latency
    decision making and applications. Deep learning-based image processing on the
    edge has excellent potential in PA. Applications of AICropCAM are not limited
    to image classification, segmentation, plant counting, or weed counting. Potential
    future applications include insect classification and crop damage estimation,
    weed classification and pressure estimation, fruit identification and yield estimation,
    decision on replanting (Whigham et al., 2000), and disease identification and
    disease damage estimation in real time using actual field images collected by
    AICropCAM. AICropCAM shows excellent potential in enhancing crop management through
    crop monitoring. However, the current demonstration requires significant improvements
    on both hardware and software fronts. Customized circuitry and modular design
    are required to put AICropCAM in commercial farm applications. The full potential
    of the AICropCAM can be achieved by putting this camera on a moving platform like
    a center pivot with a GPS receiver to generate spatiotemporal data. Crop classification
    must include more crop types, and segmentation models need training data from
    other crop types. The DCNN models for weed and insect identification require the
    capability to identify different weed types, their growth stage, different insect
    types, and their growth stages to generate effective pest control decisions. Additionally,
    improving the models’ accuracy in image classification, segmentation, and object
    detection is crucial. It can be achieved by increasing the number of training
    image data sets. We also planned to expand the research for multiple edge architecture
    evaluation. Architectures such as a high-performance edge computer that accepts
    images from multiple edge devices through short-range, high-speed communication
    (e.g., Wi-Fi) and can run more accurate deep learning models with higher numbers
    of parameters, might be a better solution for the primary objectives addressed
    in this paper. We aim to expand the AICropCAM applications to other crops beyond
    corn and soybean. By making these improvements, AICropCAM will become a more effective
    tool for crop management, potentially revolutionizing how we grow and manage crops.

  description: This paper presents a novel application of cloud computing enabled
    by Internet of Things (IoT) in monitoring parameters affecting cerebral blood
    flow (CBF) which is the movement of blood through the network of cerebral arteries
    and veins supplying the brain. The example design implemented in this proposal
    can be easily replaced with similar applications to generalize the concept offered
    by our work. This enables healthcare professionals have ubiquitous access to the
    processed medical data (in this case cerebral blood flow) of patients during their
    treatment process. Using cloud computing, accessing data from multiple locations
    has become easier. Big Data analytic frameworks enabled by IoT and cloud computing
    methods present new opportunities to extract new knowledge and create novel applications
    in health care domain. This paper shows one of the novel methods to improve the
    quality of health care data processing inside the cloud. Our scheme proposes a
    design in which the cerebral circulation data is captured using sensors connected
    to Raspberry Pi and then pushed to the cloud, stored in database, processed, and
    analyzed. Results then will be retrieved and distributed to medical professionals
    via Android mobile application. This application is designed to keep track of
    cerebral circulation and process the data obtained through the sensors. Anomalies,
    such as oxygen imbalance, internal bleeding, swelling due to an increase of water,
    and disturbance in blood flow that can lead to serious health issues can be detected.
    We have used Amazon web services (AWS) cloud platform to perform cloud services.
    Our approach is inspired by Amazon Simple Beer Service (SBS) [10]; a cloud-connected
    kegerator; that sends sensor data (beer flow and in our case cerebral circulation
    data flow) to AWS [5]. SBS publishes sensor data collected by an IoT enabled device
    (Raspberry Pi) to an AWS application program interface (API) gateway over Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). To the best of our knowledge this is the first
    scheme offered to replace the manual process of monitoring CBF using biomedical
    electronic devices.

  explanation: The paper discusses an innovative method for monitoring cerebral blood
    flow (CBF) using cloud computing and IoT devices. The proposed system involves
    collecting medical data, such as blood pressure and intracranial pressure, through
    sensors connected to the patient's body. This data is then transmitted to a cloud
    platform using Raspberry Pi, where it is stored in a database and processed using
    advanced analytical algorithms. The results of the analysis, including calculated
    cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), are made available to medical professionals
    through an Android mobile application. This system enables remote monitoring of
    CBF and early detection of abnormalities, allowing for timely intervention and
    improved patient care.

    for Patient Monitoring Chapter © 2022 1 Introduction In a few years, cloud computing
    would become the core of the internet. Presently, there are cost constraints stemming
    from the need to do higher quality work with fewer and more costly resources.
    Expectations for higher quality treatment from the healthcare services increase
    the need for point-of-care access to medical data and adoption of mobile devices;
    both for medical staff and patients; are forcing the need for internet technology
    (IT) systems to adapt [1]. Furthermore, the significant increase in digitization
    of medical records and the increasing prevalence of digital outputs from scanning
    and monitoring devices, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed
    axial tomography scan (CT-SCAN) maximize the potential benefit of cloud solutions.
    In this paper, attention is given to possible implementation of cloud computing
    technology in the medical field. The following is the contribution of this paper:
    Replacing traditional healthcare mechanisms with digital options by leveraging
    cloud computing technology. Exploiting Cloud Computing and IoT technologies to
    accelerate the accrual of real time medical knowledge and data to healthcare professionals

    Presenting a new productive and cost effective business model, and more efficient
    healthcare systems. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents
    the background to our implementation that includes an introduction to cerebral
    circulation and the parameters of interests. Furthermore, it covers the basics
    of cloud computing, its general architecture, and cloud computing web services
    and tools. Section 3 expounds the design flow and development of the cloud application.
    Section 4 discusses the user interface application development. Finally, we will
    conclude the paper in Section 5 and elaborate on future work. 2 Background 2.1
    Cerebral Circulation and Related Work Brain is a unique organ of the body that
    totally depends on the blood supply for its survival. Cerebral circulation is
    the movement of blood through the network of cerebral arteries and veins supplying
    the brain as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Cerebral blood flow. Full size image Alterations
    in cerebral blood flow (CBF) can lead to several neurological disorders including
    stroke. Hence it is vital to monitor the CBF for the diagnostic and therapeutic
    purposes. Human skull can be considered as a bony box of fixed volume that contains
    brain, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Unlike other body parts, brain can
    withstand very short periods of lack of blood supply for about 3 to 8 min [2].
    Therefore, CBF must be maintained to ensure a constant delivery of oxygen and
    substrates and to remove the waste products of metabolism. Consequently, there
    is considerable interest in monitoring CBF in patients with different brain diseases
    such as traumatic brain injury (TBI). CBF is dependent on several factors that
    can be broadly divided into two categories: (a) Those affecting cerebral perfusion
    pressure (b) Those affecting the radius of cerebral blood vessels This relationship
    can be described by the Hagen-Poiseuille law [3] which describes the streamlined
    flow of a uniformly viscous fluid through a cylindrical tube: $$ Q = \\frac{\\text{dV}}{\\rm{dt}}
    = \\frac{{\\Delta {\\text{P}} \\pi {\\text{R}}^{4} }}{{8 \\eta {\\text{L}}}} $$
    (1) In our case, Q is the CBF, ΔP is the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) or
    pressure drop along the vessel, R is the radius of the blood vessel, η is the
    viscosity of the blood, and L is the length of the blood vessel. CBF ranges from
    20 ml/100 g/min to 70 ml/100 g/min for human brain [2]. CPP is dependent on the
    pressure gradient between the arteries and the veins where arteries carry oxygenated
    blood and veins carry deoxygenated blood. This is the difference between the mean
    arterial blood pressure (MAP) and the mean cerebral venous pressure. The latter
    is difficult to measure and approximates to the more easily measured intracranial
    pressure (ICP) [2]. $$ {\\text{CPP}} = {\\text{MAP}} - {\\text{ICP}} $$ (2) CPP
    can be affected by anything that changes the MAP or ICP. The effect of decrease
    in MAP and increase in ICP simultaneously can be catastrophic with the risk of
    brain ischemia. For instance, blood loss causes reduction in MAP while an intracerebral
    hematoma will increase ICP which can result in losing consciousness. In a normal
    brain, despite the potential for changes in MAP, CBF remains constant over a wide
    range of CPPs achieved by a process called auto-regulation. CPP is related to
    CBF and is modifiable through its relationship with MAP and ICP [4]. As a result,
    CPP has been the subject of significant research efforts as a factor influencing
    outcomes in several brain pathologies, most notably TBI. Numerous retrospective
    series and data bank studies have favored the invasive ICP monitoring technique
    [6, 7]. Wilson et al. [8] illustrate how different types of ICP sensors can be
    inserted into brain in an invasive procedure. Kang et al. [9] report materials,
    device architectures, integration strategies, and in vivo demonstrations in rats
    of implantable, multifunctional silicon sensors for the brain, for which all the
    constituent materials naturally resorb via hydrolysis and/or metabolic action,
    eliminating the need for extraction. In their experiments, insulated percutaneous
    wires connect to an externally mounted, miniaturized wireless potentiostat for
    data transmission where continuous monitoring of ICP and temperature illustrates
    functionality essential to the treatment of TBI. This paper presents a method
    based on cloud computing to capture medical data from the sensor using Raspberry
    Pi and push data to the cloud to perform analysis and finally broadcast the result
    to medical professionals via an Android application in real time. There are several
    methods to determine the cerebral circulation. Doppler’s principle is the most
    common principle applied by the existing biometric sensors [12]. They have an
    advantage of generating high frequency signal; however, the signal is easily used
    and can be used for flow velocity assessment only. Yet another commonly used technology
    is measurement of absorbance of oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin. The only
    drawback in this method would be uncertain intracranial contribution to signal.
    For more precise measurements, thermal diffusion principle is used. A Doppler
    sensor can be integrated to a wireless communication protocol such as XBEE or
    NFC (Near Field Communication). These modules can be configured to determine the
    MAP and ICP algorithm. 2.2 Cloud Computing Basics Cloud Computing is a model of
    accessing a shared pool of computing resources such as storage, services, networks,
    and applications on demand, without worrying about how these resources are made
    available. These resources can be dynamically configured depending on the need
    or the rate of consumption and released when not needed. This allows organizations
    to avoid up-front infrastructure costs. Furthermore, it enables firms to focus
    on their core businesses. Figure 2 shows a typical cloud architecture. The cloud
    architecture typically consists of a front end platform or client such as mobile
    devices or internet browsers, back end platforms such as servers, a cloud based
    delivery, and a network such as internet. Fig. 2. A typical cloud computing architecture.
    Full size image Cloud client can be a computer hardware or software. Users can
    access the data stored in cloud using network enabled devices such as tablets
    or smart phones. These cloud clients rely on cloud computing for all or majority
    of their applications. Cerebral circulation data is pushed to the cloud using
    Raspberry Pi microcontroller and is stored in a cloud database to be processed
    and analyzed. The result of the analysis is available to medical professionals
    via mobile application. Typical stages of high level data flow are shown in Fig.
    3. Initially we push the raw medical data to cloud. Data will be analyzed and
    processed afterwards and results will be available to medical personnel and the
    patient. Several medical algorithms can be incorporated in the cloud to monitor
    the pattern of circulation. These algorithms can be used to determine the risk
    involved in the patient developing neurological disorders. If the risk is above
    a certain threshold, the doctor is immediately notified by the cloud service by
    sending text messages or invoking SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to generate
    a customized e-mail with vital medical information. Fig. 3. High level data flow
    push, process and pull with cloud. Full size image Data at first stage is raw
    meaning it needs further processing to transform into information, knowledge and
    later wisdom. Figure 4 demonstrates Ackoff’s DIKW [13] (Data/Information/Knowledge/Wisdom)
    pyramid. This figure describes the process required till raw data transforms to
    some meaningful and applicable wisdom. Fig. 4. Ackoff’s DIKW pyramid. Full size
    image In earlier schemes of IoT systems, processing data was performed after collecting
    data by the sensors and the result was sent to the cloud. Advanced analytical
    algorithms were applied on raw data to extract meaning and context out of raw
    data. However due to advancement in cloud computing technology in modern systems
    and high level of integration of processing units into sensors, these steps can
    vary in order, offering more system performance and flexibility. This will let
    the developers perform some of the data processing at later stages in the cloud
    after data is transmitted to the higher levels of network. Using this method,
    a higher level of knowledge can be transmitted to the hub for post-processing.
    Figure 5 compares these two schemes. While in central scheme data interpretation
    is done in the last level; e.g. cloud; distributed scheme tends to refine data
    before transmitting it to the cloud. This would offer higher flexibility and simpler
    hardware within sensor nodes or hubs. Fig. 5. Central (top) vs. distributed (bottom)
    interpretation. Full size image 2.3 Big Data Frameworks and Processing Medical
    institutions, scientific research labs and hospitals are moving to big data analytics
    to alleviate healthcare costs, predicting epidemics and enhancing the quality
    of human life by altering the models of treatment delivery. With the increase
    in the number of health records of millions of people to tens of billions, computing
    technology and infrastructure need to render a cost efficient implementation of
    data processing model. The new model has to provide storage for billions and trillions
    of unstructured data sets, fault tolerance along with high availability of the
    system. Hadoop technology [14] is successful meeting these challenges by offering
    the capability to process thousands of terabytes of data. By the end of 2017 in
    collaboration with the American Biotechnology firm Illumina and Genomics England
    targets to map 100,000 human genomes to develop personalized medication for cancer
    patients [14]. In our development, continuous monitor, store and analyses of blood
    flow in veins and arteries of brain is achieved by collecting the data from sensors
    and pushing them to the cloud via Raspberry Pi using Wi-Fi. Rapid alerts can be
    sent to medical professionals was successfully achieved by using Hadoop ecosystem
    components, Apache Spark, Apache Hive and Storage Tools S3, DynamoDB, EMR and
    EC2. Section D elaborates how these tools and web services are used in our implementation.
    2.4 Web Services and Tools It is critical to understand the design flow in this
    section before elaborating the tools used in our implementation. Our approach
    is inspired by Amazon SBS [10]; a cloud-connected kegerator; that sends sensor
    data (beer flow and in our case cerebral circulation data flow) to AWS [5]. SBS
    publishes sensor data collected by an IoT enabled device (Raspberry Pi) to an
    AWS application program interface (API) gateway over HTTPS. For our project, we
    propose the Raspberry Pi model B+ developed by Raspberry Pi Foundation [11] for
    interfacing with the cerebral data collection sensors. It leverages an ARM processor,
    provides an SD card for storage, and exposes several dozen GPIO pins to interface
    with sensors as well as Ethernet port. Figure 6 shows the high level design flow
    incorporated into our proposed scheme using AWS and tools for cloud computing
    applications. The Python code running on the Pi polls the sensors and collects
    the result into a JSON (Javascript Object Notation); a minimal readable format
    used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application. It is then
    transmitted to Amazon API Gateway by using EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute) instance.
    EC2 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
    By associating the created EC2 instance to a static IP address we are going to
    enable communication with the internet. API gateway is used to create, publish,
    maintain, monitor, and secure APIs and fits perfectly with IoT cases such as our
    experiment. Fig. 6. CBF monitoring IoT enabled cloud architecture. Full size image
    From API Gateway, the payload can take two different paths: intermittent and speed.
    Since this is critical data we choose speed path. AWS Lambda function [5] facilitates
    the speed path and pushes and stores data into a table hosted by Amazon DynamoDB.
    DynamoDB is a low latency non SQL (noSQL) based cloud database that provides a
    mechanism for storage and retrieval of data modeled in means other than the tabular
    relations used by relational SQL based databases. In order to prepare the data
    for further processing, data from DynamoDB tables should be exported to Simple
    Storage Service (S3) bucket. S3 [7] is used for object storage with a basic web
    service interface to store and retrieve any quantity of data from anywhere on
    the internet. Detail of this process will be elaborated in Section III. During
    this process, Amazon Elastic Map Reducer (EMR) [6] is used which manages the cluster
    platform by running big data frameworks such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark
    on AWS to process and analyze vast amount of data. Amazon EMR maintains Apache
    Hadoop which is an open source; Java based programming framework that supports
    processing and storage of large data sets in a distributed computing environment.
    Using EMR, we can also run the distributed framework such as Apache Spark and
    interact with data storages such as S3 and DynamoDB. Apache Spark is an open-source,
    distributed processing platform used for big data workloads that supports general
    batch processing proper for operations such as streaming analytics and graph databases
    used in our experiment. Finally, in order to perform mathematical calculations
    on data, we need to send the data to Apache Zeppelin notebook, a web based notebook
    that enables interactive analytics with using languages such as Scala, SQL, or
    IPython. The latter was used in our application. 3 Design Flow Figure 7 shows
    the detail of our design flow with a summary of the tasks to be implemented at
    each step. Initially medical data (i.e. medical data such as MAP and ICP collected
    by the sensors connected to patient) will be pushed from Raspberry Pi via WiFi
    to the cloud by creating Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) [5] instance that
    provides a scalable computing capacity associated to our application. This connects
    our instance from Raspberry Pi and stores the data to the database table hosted
    by Amazon DynamoDB database. In order to process the data in the cloud including
    mathematical calculations, we need to send the data to Apache Zeppelin notebook
    to perform interactive analytics. We can transfer the data from DynamoDB to Apache
    Zeppelin via Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). At first, we will migrate data
    from DynamoDB database to S3 and store the input data into a S3 bucket. To be
    able to perform this process, Amazon DynamoDB integrates Amazon EMR. Amazon EMR
    lets us create tables that can store data natively in an EMR cluster or they can
    be mapped to data stored externally such as in DynamoDB and S3. Using EMR, we
    can export DynamoDB table data into S3 bucket or load data from S3 bucket to a
    DynamoDB table. This can be advantageous as complex queries and data mining can
    be efficiently implemented on the native data. Fig. 7. CBF monitoring cloud computing
    design flowchart. Full size image The process of exporting data from DynamoDB
    table to S3 bucket starts by creating two external hive tables as shown in Fig.
    8. Fig. 8. Export/import process to/from Dynamo DB/S3. Full size image One of
    the external hive tables maps to the DynamoDB table and the other will map to
    S3 bucket where data is stored. We use Apache Hive to process data stored in a
    DynamoDB table, S3 table, etc. Hive is a data warehouse application for Hadoop
    that allows processing and analyzing data from multiple sources. Hive provides
    a SQL like language; HiveQL; that allows working with data stored locally in the
    Amazon EMR cluster or in an external data source such as DynamoDB or S3. Data
    is first delivered from DynamoDB to external hive table and then it will be sent
    to native hive table and from there to another external hive table and finally
    gets stored in S3 bucket. After copying the data to S3, we will create another
    cluster known as Apache Spark. With this cluster, we can use Apache Zeppelin to
    create a notebook. We used IPython in Zeppelin notebook to transfer the data from
    the S3 bucket to notebook. Now data processing including mathematical calculations
    can be performed and the results can be transferred back to DynamoDB through S3
    bucket and hives using Zeppelin notebook again. Using this scheme, data can be
    exported/imported to/from S3/DynamoDB frequently. Furthermore, uploading periodic
    bulk of data from another application can be done this way using scripts and schedules.
    In our proposed scheme, constraints can be added to DynamoDB tables to check if
    there are any changes in the patterns of CBF over a period of time or if a specific
    threshold limit has been crossed. In that case, proper alert messages can be sent
    to medical professionals via Android mobile application which is also developed
    by the authors. Graph charts of corresponding parameters such as CBF, MAP, and
    ICP can be displayed on mobile screens for better clarity. 4 Android Application
    Development The user interface for the proposed design would be an application
    running on Android platform. The application was developed using Android Studio
    integrated development environment (IDE). To integrate AWS with Android Studio,
    we used AWS software development kit (SDK) for Android. We used ProGuard that
    has built-in support for cloud platforms, enabling the user with Firebase Cloud
    Messaging (FCM). The processed medical data in the cloud can be pulled by the
    Android application by creating an API. Developing a mobile based platform application
    would not just allow users to easily access the medical information but also cuts
    down the expense involved in manufacturing the biometric device. The primary functionality
    of the mobile application is to establish a secure connection with the cloud and
    obtain the transmitted sensor values. The application takes advantage of the GSM
    (Global System for Mobile) communication module present in the mobile device to
    send messages and make phone calls directly from the application itself. The developed
    user interface (UI) is shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9. Android emulator developed to
    display CPP data. Full size image As it can be seen in the application screenshot,
    the MAP and ICP values are captured by the sensors and pushed to the cloud using
    Raspberry Pi. CPP value can be calculated using our cloud computing algorithm
    and the results can be displayed on Android mobile device. Anomalies can be detected
    by checking constraints deployed in the algorithm in the cloud. Once detected,
    the alert notification can be sent to medical professionals by forwarding the
    values through text messages or phone calls. The developed code running on smart
    device can establish the connection with the cloud to read the data (result of
    the analysis) from the network and route it to the target device/s. Figure 10
    shows the detailed of the application developed. Fig. 10. Android application
    flowchart. Full size image 5 Future Work and Conclusion This paper presented a
    novel application for cloud computing enabled by IoT through innovative schemes
    to monitor CBF which is critical in monitoring patients with serious brain damage.
    The proposed scheme in this paper covers the cloud computing implementation as
    well as Android application development as UI while the front end of the design
    (interface with sensor using Raspberry Pi) remains as future work. The cloud computing
    and application components were verified with test data. The cerebral circulation
    data has been stored in the cloud without any errors and the cloud computing algorithm
    running in the cloud was implemented. Furthermore, the developed UI found to send
    messages effectively and immediately to the medical professionals using smart
    devices when an anomaly is detected. Throughout this implementation, various parameters
    of cerebral circulation such as MAP, ICP, and CPP have been monitored and measured.

  description: Today, the world is rising in the field of technology and the basic
    need of human being is food, home, and cloths, which are directly or indirectly
    fulfilled by agriculture. Incorporation of technology with agriculture will increase
    the production and automation of process and reduce human intervention and efforts.
    There are lots of technologies that are helping us to improve the methods of agriculture
    such as intelligent system for weather forecasting and microcontroller-based equipment
    for automation of process and many more. These technologies have their advantages
    and also improving the production.Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging technology
    that incorporates intelligent system, cloud computing, and microcontroller itself.
    In this chapter, we will go through a deep drive about the things (sensors and
    actuators) that are connected with cloud system and the cloud computing platforms
    that are suitable to use for IoT projects with their features. In agricultural
    revolution, information technologies such as IoT, cloud computing, big data, and
    machine learning are playing a vital role. Different sensor modules such as soil
    sensor, moisture sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor, and many other sensors
    are useful for agri-culture science that measures the environment variables and
    water pump, pesticide sprinkler, cold/hot air blower, and temperature control
    units are the actuators for different types of indoor and outdoor crops. Microcontroller
    selection is the main challenge for implementation of IoT-based system. In this
    chapter, we will also cover different micro-controller and there uses as per application
    scope, power consumption, storage, and network connectivity and will implement
    IoT module on basil plant and collect the threshold data. There are different
    levels of IoT appli-cations and development methodology and IoT project design
    reference model. Depending on the levels of IoT application, we decide the location
    for storage unit and computational unit, and the design reference model is used
    make plan and prepare resources before developing and deploying an IoT system.
    Sensors and actuators are connected with microcontroller, sensor collects the
    environment data and sends to microcontroller that uses the network routers to
    transmit the data to the cloud through gateway nodes and then computational unit
    is responsible for triggering the action using actuator devices. Communication
    between microcontroller to storage and computational unit can be wired or wireless.
    There are a number of cloud platforms developed for IoT-based systems. Using cloud
    we connect the end user via mobile application, web application, or hardware controller.
    These applications provide user interface for monitoring the sensor data and also
    can trigger the actuators to perform action.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Greater Noida, India SECTION I. Introduction
    Food production takes up almost half of the planets land surface. About 40% of
    the earths land is now given over to agriculture, and it consumes 85% of available
    fresh water. Due to globalization and population growth this figure of water conservation
    has been increasing every year. So it became a major challenge to every nation
    for reducing the farm water consumption. For better irrigation system, it is very
    crucial to measure the soil moisture for agriculture application, so that it will
    help farmers to manage their farm land more effectively. IOT is the technology
    that enhance the Internet connectivity from digital devices to physical objects
    and establishes communication between them. The data collected are stored and
    managed at the cloud as well as shared between person to person, machine to machine,
    or person to machine. The invent of loT would discover the new ways that put full
    potential of agriculture yield and mitigate the challenges that hinders the growth
    of crops. With the lOT, the monitoring of weather forecast, soil temperature and
    humidity, soil moisture level, remote water valves, pest control could be connected
    and information gathered from the sensors is exchanged to the farmers via mobile
    phones. Soil moisture is an important component on a small agriculture scale as
    well as large agriculture scale modeling. Vegetation and crops mainly depends
    on the root level of moisture present in the soil. Knowledge of degree of soil
    wetness helps farmers to understand the condition of field and accordingly they
    react on it. Soil moisture determines the measure of soil water content which
    defines its expression in terms of mass or volume of water content of the soil.
    On the basis of mass, soil water content is expressed in the gravimetric soil
    moisture content θ g [9] is given by: θg=Mwater/Msoil, (1) View Source where Mwater
    is the mass of the water in the soil, and Msoil is the mass of the dry soil present
    in the field. The volumetric soil moisture content of a soil θv , is defined by:
    θv=Vwater/Vsample (2) View Source where Vwater is the volume of water content
    in the soil and Vsample is the total volume of dry soil +water+ air present in
    the sample of field. Both the values θg and θv are usually expressed in percent.
    The relationship between the gravimetric soil moisture content and volumetric
    soil moisture content is: θv=θg(ρb/ρw) (3) View Source where ρb is the dry soil
    bulk density and ρw is the soil water density. Over irrigation of the plants may
    perish the plants roots of oxygen and causes them to putrefy and it leads to soil
    fungal diseases [3]. Research has been done that about 80% of the crop is destroyed
    due to over irrigation, which reduces the growth of crops yield. On the other
    hand, sometimes due to scarcity of water, field become dry and the plants will
    not receive enough nutrients for the growth of crops. To satisfy the increasing
    demand for determining the soil moisture status, lOT and use cases play a vital
    role in the field of agriculture industry. One of use case we implemented and
    tested by deploying moisture sensor in the sample of pot. The sensor data feeds
    to the Losant cloud platform interface to help the intended persons make timely
    decisions. Data is available instantly in the App to view the moisture level anytime
    or anywhere in the world. SECTION II. Literature Survey Monitoring of volumetric
    soil moisture content of the field is a significant factor for the pavement performance.
    Understanding the effects of the soil moisture on performance is crucial. This
    paper [1] proposed a system for monitoring the soil moisture using homemade soil
    moisture sensor and Arduino Uno board. The eminent feature of this system is to
    measure the soil moisture along the depth which can determine the time of water
    supply to reach the crop roots. This improves the cost efficiency and water resources
    management. This paper[2] shows the analysis of different types of moisture sensor
    compared to the different types of soil. It includes sensors like commercialized
    soil moisture sensor, galvanized steel nails and gypsum block and soils taken
    in experimentation were silt oil, clay soil, sandy soil. After analysis it describes
    that for real or actual implementations the combination of these three types of
    soil with different proportion ratio of each soil is best soil for plant growth.
    Nowadays, many garden centres uses a timer-controlled sprinkler which automatically
    supply the water to the plants irrespective of the content of moisture present
    in the soil that leads to over irrigation of plants. This paper[3] present a system
    that is capable of measuring the soil moisture of the soil. It uses a Teensy 2.0
    micro-controller with a dual output tap timer. Thus the plant will supply water
    whenever the content of moisture in the soil becomes low. Watering is the most
    important aspect in the growth of plants. Thus water should be supply at the right
    time whenever required by the plants. This paper[4] proposed an automatic plant
    watering system by using sprinkler systems, pipes and a nozzle. For the control
    of the whole system an ATmega328 micro-controller is used and it programmed in
    such a way that it sense the moisture level and water according to them. So conservation
    of water is possible by this approach. This approach[5], [6] design a wireless
    sensor network using an arduino with a grove moisture sensor and water flow sensor.
    It uses a zigbee protocol for the communication among them and the status of the
    system will be displayed on web portal. The intimation about the water flow will
    also sent to the users phone using GSM. The approach given in this paper[7] is
    to developed a system for monitoring the soil moisture content of soil by using
    lOT, mobile computing technology and cloud computing. CC3200 launch pad is interfaced
    with a soil moisture sensor and data is stored in the AT&T M2X cloud technology
    and blynk application is used in android phone by the user to check the status
    anywhere and make timely decision. SECTION III. Design and Implementation The
    overview architecture of the proposed system is shown in Fig. 3. In this system
    nodemcu board which acts like a client publishes the sensor data into the Losant
    Message Broker using the MQTT protocol on to the topic losant/DEVICE_ID/state.
    In order to understand the messages of losant, a defined json-based payload must
    be followed. The published data will automatically store in the losant and make
    it available in visualization tool of losant platform. In order to subscribe the
    stored data from the losant MQTT broker the client must subscribe to the commands
    that are initiated using losant workflow on to the topic Losant/DEVICE_ID/commands.
    Fig. 1. Block diagram of soil monitoring system Show All A. NodeMCU V1.0 NodeMCU
    V1.0 is an open source loT platform with ESP8266-12E chips. It is low-cost, breadboard
    friendly, integrate a USB to serial chip, and a simple USB to micro USB cable
    can be used to powered this board. This modules aimed for developing ESP8266 based
    Lua loT applications and it includes firmware that runs on the ESP8266 wifi SoC
    from Espressif system. This development board provides access to the GPIO(General
    purpose Input/Output) subsystem. Based on ESP8266 there are jungle of available
    modules and every module has certain advantages and disadvantages, depending on
    the targeted application. The following table gives the comparison of some of
    the ESP8266 modules: Fig. 2. NodeMCU board Show All B. Moisture Sensor Soil moisture
    sensor is used for measuring the volumetric water content of the soil and loss
    of moisture which occurs due to evaporation and plant uptake. For survival of
    all plants, water is the most important factor. This soil moisture sensor determines
    the amount of water required for irrigation of plants. This module consists of
    LM393 comparator with a potentiometer included in it for adjusting the soil wet/dry
    detection sensitivity according to the requirements of plants. There are two types
    of soil moisture sensor: Frequency domain sensor and neutron moisture gauze. Frequency
    domain sensor has an oscillating circuit which measures the soil water content.
    The basic principle is that it measures the soils dielectric constant which determines
    the velocity of electromagnetic wave through the soil. When the soils water content
    increases, the dielectric of soil also increases which can be used to estimate
    how much amount of water the soil holds. Other one is neutron moisture gauze,
    that works on the moderator properties of water for neutrons. The basic principle
    is that fast neutrons are emitted from the decaying radioactive source, and when
    the collision occurs between neutrons and protons, they slow down dramatically.
    By measuring the density of slowed-down neutrons around the probes of moisture
    sensor can estimate the volumetric content of water the soil holds. Fig. 3. Moisture
    sensor Show All Table I Technical specification of wemos 1) LM393 Driver LM393
    comparator is used to compare the soil moisture level with the preset threshold
    value. This device consists of two independent low voltage comparators which is
    designed specifically to operate over a wide range of voltages from a single power
    supply. The unique characteristics of these comparators is that the input common
    mode voltage range includes ground even though operation is done from the single
    power supply voltage. It is available in DIP8, SO-8, TSSOP8, miniSO-8, and DFNB
    2*2mm packages. Some features of this device is given in Table III: Table II Pin
    definition Table III Technical specification SECTION IV. Losant Losant is a simple
    and powerful IOT cloud platform that makes building real-time connected solutions
    a breeze. It provides connectivity from one to billions of devices by using open
    communication standard like MQTT and REST and help in turn raw data into insight.
    The data are fully encrypted using the industry standard TLS(Transport Layer Security)
    encryption protocol. Losant provides robust data collection, aggregation, visualization
    and graph our path with real time device states and sensors data. Losants drag
    and drop workflow editor allows us to trigger actions, notification and M2M communication
    without using programming. MQTT is a lightweight preferred communication protocol
    that easily wrap up the communication between our devices and the Losant platform.
    The core concept of MQTT protocol is publishing and subscribing to topics by the
    clients via the central service called message broker. Clients can publish any
    data they prefer to any topics they select. Others clients then subscribe to those
    topics to retrieve that data. In order to support existing MQTT implementations,
    Losant provides an MQTT message broker that will be open for all the clients and
    it is responsible for properly routing messages to the subscribers. Losant message
    broker can be reached using several transport protocol like TCP, TLS, Websockets,
    Secure Websockets. Losant provides an opinionated MQTT implementation for further
    features of Losant like data collection, visualization, and workflow. Connecting
    with Losant platform is very easy and it took 4 simple steps which are as follows:
    Create an Application: An application is created by some meaningful name which
    contains all the devices and workflow that makes us convenient to connect us with
    the real world. Add a Device: In Losant a device is a single thing or widget.
    It could be anything from a simple car, smart devices, thermostat to any kind
    of custom gadgets. Create a Workflow: Complex interactions between our devices
    and 3rd party system can be easily build by simply using drag and drop workflow
    editor. Its output can also be used to track data by storing it in virtual device.
    Create a Dashboard: Losant platform provide a flexible and powerful way to visualize
    and analyze the data we stored in our device. This dashboard generator is used
    to display the information relevant to our specific connected solutions. Fig.
    4. Creating application Show All Fig. 5. Adding device Show All SECTION V. Hardware
    Realization Moisture Sensor Kit is realized using NodeMCU development board having
    an ESP8266 WiFi module mounted on it and a pre-wired soil moisture sensor module.
    The soil moisture sensor module connected with LM393 comparator, gives an active-high(H)
    level output when the soil is dry. This digital output (dry soil-H / wet soil-L)
    is routed to one of the I/O terminal (AO) of the nodeMCU micro-controller. Based
    on this input (at AO) nodeMCU gives an active-low output through D1 when the soil
    is wet, and an active-high input when the soil is dry. Using male-to-female jumper
    wires connections can be established. Wiring diagram is shown in the fig: 8. A
    micro USB cable is used in nodeMCU board for power supply. In Losant platform
    while creating a new device, the device ID is generated. This ID is required in
    software part. For the authentication of our device against the Losant platform
    some security keys need to generate that provides access to all the devices in
    our application. This keys are also required in programming. Fig. 6. Creating
    workflow Show All Fig. 7. Creating dashboard Show All Table IV Soil condition
    with its LED status SECTION VI. Software Realization For all Losant IoT developer
    kits an environmental setup must be done before flashing the firmware into the
    device. An USB drivers is installed in the Arduino IDE. For this workshop a few
    libraries require to be installed. The required libraries are PubSubClient, ArduinoJson
    and Losant Arduino MQTT Client. After the environmental setup a Moisture Sensor
    firmware will be flashing to the device. In the kit source code few things need
    to be modified such as WIFI_SSID, wifi_pass, Losant_Device_ID, Losant_access_Key,
    Losant access secret. Now upload the firmware to the device and after every 60
    seconds the firmware is publishing the state of moisture value to the losant.
    The moisture values varies between 0-1024 that the micro-controller ADC is providing.
    Higher values means less moisture and lower values means more moisture. Fig. 8.
    Circuit connection. Show All SECTION VII. Testing and Results The complete hardware
    and software setup have been done to monitor the soil moisture of the field. We
    have tested in a small scale by inserting a moisture sensor and visualize the
    readings. In order to view the results in Losant platform, a dashboard is created
    named desk plant. A gauze block and a time series graph is being customized to
    view the moisture level over time as shown in fig:. We have import workflow in
    Losant platform to setup an alerts via SMS or an email to the intended person.
    This alerts will be active whenever the moisture level of the plants will be less
    and we are being notified by SMS or email as shown in fig: 10 as well as the board
    will subscribe to the commands back from the losant to turn on the LED if the
    percentage of moisture in the soil is below the threshold value. Fig. 9. Screenshot

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Gharuan, India SECTION I. Introduction Hydroponics
    is a type of cultivation in which plants were grown on nutrient solution also
    known as organic solution thus use of soil can be eliminated. Plants will be cultivated
    in a vertically shaped pipe utilising hydroponics and also aquaponics technologies
    in the system, which is a smart vertical farm. Throughout the system, IoT enabled
    sensors are used to continuously monitor the temperature and humidity of the plants.
    Plants will be cultivated utilizing hydroponics in vertical pipe arrangement.
    Using a DHT11 sensor, the temperature and moisture content in the setup are regularly
    monitored and fed to the NodeMCU microcontroller. The quantity of nutrients present
    in the container is measured using ultrasonic sensors. A fertilizer dosing system
    is also developed, LED and photodiode are used to detect the presence of algae.
    The coming generations can make use of hydroponics techniques with the use of
    nutrients and water by eliminating the presence of the soil. No harm is done to
    the environment or crop quality by this system. The main objective is growing
    crops to protect land, improve crop quality also eliminate the overuse of pesticides
    and boost crop efficiency. SECTION II Related Works The most cutting-edge agriculture
    practices in the industry are hydroponic and aquaponic farming. No soil generated
    infection, reduced insect disease and pathogens use in the monitoring system lower
    the toxicity, and hydroponically produced crops are grown in less time than conventionally
    grown crops. Finally, only plants get access to the nutrients [1]. An Internet
    of Things (IoT) link was created to enhance dependability. Remote sensing and
    control are made possible. Data analysis was done using the Domoitcz tool. A system
    can be used to monitor the water and greenhouse environments as well as the outdoor
    environment for breeding purposes using wireless sensor networking and distributed
    sensor monitoring [3]. A smart hydroponic system has been made intelligent by
    using the Random Forest algorithm to assist in identifying the environmental parameter
    that should be controlled depending on priority. One crucial aspect of the suggested
    system is its capacity to control nutrient content [4]. Big data analytics, determine
    which plants, vegetables, and fruits will be grown based on the climate. [5].
    An automated IoT-based soilless plant system is created using deep neural networking.
    5000 real-time data sets were gathered from the system about the acidity, temperature,
    moisture, intensities, and level of water in the hydroponic container where the
    crop is grown [6]. Bayesian network model used to automate the crop-growing process
    in hydroponic farms enhance the farm’s characteristics, including intensity of
    light, acidity, electrical conductivity, temperature, and moisture, which are
    monitored and controlled by sensors and actuators [7]. An innovative, bilingual,
    fuzzy logic-controlled, Internet of Things based software application for plant
    production in hydroponics system deals with the issue of global warming. As a
    result, growing crops in a greenhouse while managing numerous crucial elements
    with handheld IoT devices will result in higher yields at lower costs [8]. Various
    barley genotypes were grown in hydroponic chamber to assess impact of Endophytic
    T Harzanium. Air circulation was employed to maintain the ideal temperature and
    humidity for the purpose of barley grain sprouting. Fluorescent lighting tubes
    were also a part of the lighting system, and they were positioned both vertically
    and horizontally [9]. A versatile platform capable of handling the requirements
    of cultivation within greenhouses with complete recirculation and controlled saltiness
    developed with ultraviolet therapy of disinfection mechanism to remove microbial
    content and hence minimize the appearance of diseases [10]. SECTION III. Proposed
    Hydroponic Methodology A. Block Diagram Figure 1. Schematic diagram for hydroponic
    system using IoT Show All The flow of data in the hydroponics hardware system
    is shown in the schematic diagram of hydroponic system. (figure 1). Node MCU controls
    all components in hydroponic system. The temperature and moisture content (humidity)
    is measured via DHT11 sensors. Ultrasonic sensors were used for evaluating the
    level of nutrient solution in the container. The presence of algae in the hydroponic
    solution was detected using LDR by passing light from coloured LEDs (red, blue,
    green, amber) through the solution. The data collected from ultrasonic sensor
    determines when to switch on the motor pump that supplies nutrient solution into
    the container. When the presence of algae is detected, another motor pump is used
    to spill out the solution from the container and supply it with fresh nutrient
    rich solution automatically in the absence of a farmer. The data assembled from
    the sensors are sent to the ThingSpeak server application for remote analysis
    of the condition of the crops by the farmers. This helps in the effective surveillance
    and yield enhancement of plants. B. Flow Chart Figure 2: Flow chart of the hydroponic
    system Show All Figure 2 illustrates the entire system flowchart. Firstly, the
    system gathers the data from sensors (DHT11, Ultrasonic, LDR) into Node MCU. The
    data collected by the microcontroller is sent to the ThingSpeak server application.
    The ideal level of nutrient solution was set as 3 cm as per the experimental requirement.
    The microcontroller activates the motor pump to work in order to refill the container
    with nutrient solution to the appropriate levels if the level of the solution
    falls below the set-point. When algae are identified in the solution, the pump
    activates to clear out the present solution and refill it with new nutrient compound.
    A. Experimental Setup for a spinach hydroponic system The experimental setup is
    illustrated in figure 3. A hydroponic setup was created using a plastic bottle
    with one cup holder with holes at bottom layer inserted within. Sponge and straw
    were used to form a base layer inside the cup. Nutrient compound was filled such
    that it touches the sponge layer. In this study, spinach was cultivated in the
    hydroponic setup. The sample of the solution was pumped into a test tube placed
    inside a cardboard box. LDR and LED were attached on opposite sides of the box
    to find the presence of cyanobacteria. Figure 3: Hydroponic prototype for Spinach
    Show All SECTION IV. Results and Discussion The ideal values of parameters needed
    for healthy growth of plants in a hydroponic setup is tabulated as above in table
    1. Feasible temperature range is found out to be 28 to 30-degree Celsius. Similarly,
    the humidity necessary for efficient plant growth obtained was around 40 to 60
    percentage. Table 1 Data Aggregation From Iot Enabled Sensors In this study, the
    exact nutrient level required is 3cm. The voltage level of different LEDs (Green,
    Blue, Red) detected by the light dependent resistor was acquired between 4 to
    4.8V indicating the absence of algae in the solution. The hydroponic farming technique
    adopted in this activity was able to strengthen the sprout within a period of
    1 week in which the experiment was carried out. Figure 4: Observed temperature
    variation in cloud platform Show All Figure 5: Observed humidity variation in
    cloud platform Show All Figure 4 and 5 show the temperature and humidity values
    recorded in real time in ThingSpeak server. The experiment was carried out for
    a week and the data was uploaded to the server. Figure 6: Real-time sensor values
    from the hydroponic setup Show All Arduino IDE was used as a compiler tool for
    integrating all the sensors with Node MCU, thus enabling to monitor the data acquired
    from sensors in real time. SECTION V. Conclusion The concept of hydroponic farming
    is well-established nowadays. Large-scale development and results from numerous
    nations across the world have demonstrated the feasibility and significant advantages
    this technology has over traditional crop growing techniques. In locations where
    gardening is not viable, soilless culture and vertical hydroponics can be used.
    Thus, it is not just a sound strategy, but also one that has greatly benefited
    humanity. People without a plot of land can indeed develop a tiny garden kitchen
    indoors using hydroponics. However, there are situations when the conditions required
    for growth may not be adequate, in which case it is necessary to inform users
    of the requirements. Additionally, due to their busy schedules, they won’t be
    available at home, therefore automatically providing the solution will be more
    practical for them. Particularly, we can observe that due to nutrient deficiency
    in the soil, not all crops will thrive everywhere. In these situations, hydroponics
    ought to be a preferable choice to provide the plant with the necessary minerals.
    Thus, people can consume fresh fruits and vegetables. SECTION VI. Future Work
    By including various nutrients and pH levels, more diverse varieties of vegetables
    can be cultivated in addition to green leafy ones. As a future work, the functionality
    of the system can be enhanced by creating a mobile application using which the
    farmers can schedule the supply of nutrients, detection of algae (once or twice
    a week) etc. The application can also include the general maintenance characteristics
    and safety measures of well-known plants that will be recommended in comparison
    to specific parametric values. ACKNOWLEDGMENT Any accomplishment, whether academic

    IEEE Conference Location: Lombok, Indonesia SECTION I. Introduction Internet of
    Things (IoT) is a concept where a number of devices are able to communicate among
    each other with various protocol [6]. The growth of Internet of Things constantly
    supported by a concept of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). WSN is a type of network
    which consists of smart sensor nodes that connected to each other by wireless
    network [8]. One of the services that can be developed with technology based on
    IoT and WSN is a smart aquaculture [13]. In this type of service, sensor nodes
    are equipped with some sort of sensors to observe a number of parameters which
    can affect the successful rate in aquaculture, such as water quality and physical
    air condition. The result of observation will be processed so that the system
    can recommend the best treatment to breeders, as well as doing an automatic treatment
    to the pond itself. In order to establish the smart aquaculture service, previous
    research have developed a sensor node to observe physical parameter of the water
    in an aquaculture pond [1]. The sensor node device was packed with three primary
    components, which are microprocessor, sensor, and communication module. A sensor
    node periodically takes observation data of physical condition of water such as
    acidity level (pH), dissolved oxygen, temperature, and water brightness with the
    attached sensors. As a result of testing, it has been discovered that the devices
    capable to do an acquisition to physical water parameter accurately. But over
    time, sensor data that have to be stored and processed by sink node are increased
    beyond the capacity and capability of device. Because both sensor node and sink
    node devices have limited computation resource, a cloud-based system is needed
    to do a large-scale data management [3], [7]. To realize the integration between
    IoT and cloud system, there are some challenges that have to be solved [11]. In
    communication aspect, besides having some advantages such as low power consumption
    and wide-area coverage, LoRa technology still has limitation so that it still
    can''t send data directly to cloud devices. Communication protocol that were being
    used by LoRa is radio, so the system should have a device that act as a connector
    to send data to data center. That way, data acquisition result from sensor node
    can be managed and processed in cloud device. Because of that, intermediary system
    to integrate LoRa communication to cloud is needed, and later the system is referred
    as a gateway. Previous research that have been done by Chang-le Zhong [4] in the
    publication titled “Study on IoT Architecture and Gateway Technology”, stated
    that in general, gateway can connect different communication protocol. In other
    words, gateway can be used as a protocol converter. To connect gateway and data
    center, a communication protocol that is used to exchange information is needed.
    One of available protocol options to manage messages is MQTT. MQTT protocol is
    used because of reliability in terms of data sending and characteristics to support
    IoT such as low power consumption and minimum bandwidth used. This protocol works
    above TCP protocol and use publish-subscribe model. Publish-subscribe model was
    designed to be easy to implement, and qualified as open-source [12], [2]. Fig.
    1: General system architecture. Show All In this paper, researchers develop a
    gateway as an intermediary node to send data from sensor node to server in cloud
    platform. Sensor node will send data to gateway by utilizing a LoRa communication
    module. Then, gateway will receive data from sensor node and forward it to server
    by using MQTT with publish-subscribe model. Gateway and sensor node will utilize
    microcomputer called Raspberry Pi because it has better computation among other
    microcontrollers. Testing parameter which will be conducted is gateway successful
    rate in terms of receiving and forwarding data to data center with distance, packet
    size, and time interval as variables. SECTION II. Design of Proposed LoRa-MQTT
    Gateway A. General System Architecture Fig. 1 shows the general architecture considered
    in the system with four main actors: sensor node acting as data producer which
    transmit the aquaculture related sensor data to gateway device using LoRa protocol.
    sensor-to-cloud gateway acting as intermediary node that relay message from LoRa
    based sensor node to the cloud entity. In the MQTT perspective, this actor is
    acting as message publisher. cloud based broker. data storage server which receive
    published sensor data and store it to the database. In the MQTT perspective, this
    actor is acting as message subscriber. The data flow considered in the system
    is illustrated in Fig. 2. At first, sensor node equipped with embedded computing
    device, various water monitoring sensors and LoRa communication module periodically
    collect several water physical information including pH, temperature, and dissolved
    oxygen. Upon collection, the sensor node sends those data to the gateway through
    LoRa protocol. In the other side, while receiving those sensor data, the gateway
    extract its structural data and build a JSON based message and send them to the
    broker. At the final step, broker relay those messages to all subscriber based
    on the topic similarity. B. Sensor Node The design of sensor node has some components
    that are used such as the LoRa communication module, sensor, and Raspberry Pi
    microcomputer. The design as illustrated in Fig. 3 that describes the system architecture
    on the sensor node side. There is a Arduino microcontroller acting as the brain
    of the system that used to run logic code of sensor node. The other is a component
    of the LoRa communication module that is used as a transceiver module between
    sensor node and gateway as well as several sensors which is employed to measure
    several water physical parameters including: dissolved oxygen sensor to measure
    dissolved oxygen level. Number Function Result 1 Sensor node can retrieve sensor
    data Succeed 2 Sensor node can send the data to gateway Succeed 3 Gateway can
    receive data from sensor node Succeed 4 Gateway can forward data from sensor node
    to server Succeed 5 Server can receive data from sensor node Succeed water temperature
    sensor to measure water temperature. pH sensor to measure water acidity level.
    turbidity sensor to measure water clearness. C. Gateway Device Gateway has the
    main role in this research, which is as an intermediary for communication with
    sensor node and forwarding to the server. Therefore, it needs good design as the
    sensor node design can be seen in Fig. 4 that describes the system architectures
    on the gateway. There is a Raspberry Pi microcomputer as the brain of the system
    that used to run program code in python language in this architecture. Then, there
    is LoRa communication module that is used by gateway to be able to receiver data
    from then sensor node. 802.11 communication protocol is a network that used to
    send data to a server. SECTION III. System Testing A. Functional Testing Functional
    testing was carried out to confirm the accuracy between functions created and
    system goals. The result of functional testing is shown in Table 1 below. B. Performance
    Testing Testing was carried out in an area that could support the system, such
    as a field with minimum population and houses. In that area, sensor node and gateway
    have been placed at a height of 1.5 meters above earth surface, so that it could
    be easier to receive or send the data. Performance testing focused on the successful
    rate of the gateway to forward received data from node sensor to destination.
    This parameter tested with 200 meters and 400 meters as distance variants; 44
    Bytes, 56 Bytes, 80 Bytes and 128 Fig. 2: Data flow of the system. Show All Fig.
    3: Schematic of sensor node. Show All Fig. 4: Design of gateway device. Show All
    Fig. 5: Successful transmission rate for time interval of 0.5 seconds. Show All
    Bytes as packet size variants; also 0.5 seconds, 1 second, and 5 seconds as time
    interval variants. Testing conducted by sending 100 packets to each of distance
    variants, packet size variants, and time interval variants. Fig. 5 is a testing
    result graphic that shows performance in time interval of 0.5 seconds in successful
    rate parameter. Difference in successful rate parameter of gateway to receive
    and forward packets to server in time interval 0.5 seconds at distance of 200
    meters is 72% with packet size as long as 44 Bytes and 56 Bytes. In case of the
    packet size is 80 Bytes, successful rate decreased as much as 12% and when packet
    size is 128 Bytes, successful rate is 49%. Tests in distance of 400 meters show
    that successful rate is 38% with packet size of 44 Bytes and increased to 90%
    when packet size is 56 Bytes. But if packet size becomes 80 Bytes, successful
    rate decreased significantly to 0% and back up to 45% when packet size is 128
    Bytes. Fig. 6 is a testing result graphic that shows performance in time interval
    of 1 second in successful rate parameter. The difference that shown in Figure
    6 is a representation of variations in packet size, distance, and result of successful
    rate. At the distance of 200 meters and packet size of 44 Bytes, there were 72%
    of packets received and forwarded successfully to server by gateway. Successful
    rate increased to 89% if packet size of 56 Bytes were sent by sensor node. After
    that, the successful rate stayed in 33% for packet size of 80 Bytes and 128 Bytes.
    At the distance of 400 meters, result of successful rate is fairly stable at 100%
    to 99% when packet size of 44 Bytes, 56 Bytes, and 80 Bytes were sent. However
    successful rate decreased as much as 23% when packet size is 128 Bytes. Fig. 6:
    Successful transmission rate for time interval of 1 second. Show All Fig. 7: Successful
    transmission rate for time interval of 1 second. Show All Fig. 7 shows a graphic
    that represent the result of testing in successful rate parameter at time interval
    of 5 seconds. The successful rate of gateway to receive and forward packets to
    server at distance of 200 meters is 37% when 44 Bytes packets were sent. If packet
    size changed to 56 Bytes, successful rate advanced as much as 15%, so it is become
    52%. But the successful rate go down to 8% when packet size is 80 Bytes and 6%
    when packet size is 128 Bytes. Next, the result is improved at distance of 400
    meters. Successful rate reached 94% with packet size of 44 Bytes and 78% when
    packet size of 80 Bytes were sent. However, when packet size is 56 Bytes, successful
    rate achieved 100%, as well as when packet size of 128 Bytes were sent. SECTION
    IV. Conclusion This research proposed the design of LoRa-MQTT gateway device for
    supporting the sensor-to-cloud data transmission in smart aquaculture IoT application.
    In its main functionality, the gateway device receives collected sensor from sensor
    device using LoRa communication module, build a message and transmit them to the
    cloud based data storage server using MQTT protocol. From the functional and performance
    testing, the gateway can perform as a communication connector between sensor nodes
    and cloud based entity using both LoRa and MQTT protocols with reasonable performance.

    1 Introduction Agricultural practices are rapidly changing in the face of the
    increasing demand for food and water resources. Traditional methods of irrigation
    have proven to be inefficient, causing water scarcity and soil degradation. The
    concept of aquaponics, a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics, offers an
    alternative solution to sustainable agriculture. It utilizes a closed-loop system
    where fish and plants are grown in the same environment, creating a symbiotic
    relationship where the waste from fish is utilized as nutrients for plants, and
    the plants clean the water for the fish. Fish waste is converted into nitrates
    by bacteria present in the soil, which can be readily absorbed by the plants.
    This system also provides the plants with a much more consistent nutrient supply
    as compared to traditional irrigation systems. Experts say that the aquaponic
    way of irrigation conserves as much as 90% of the water that is wasted in traditional
    irrigation systems. It is also observed that plants grow faster in this system
    because nutrients are readily available to them and they do not have to expend
    energy searching for them. Overall, the nutrient-rich, controlled environment
    of an aquaponics system provides the ideal conditions for plant growth, making
    it a superior option for growing plants. The proposed system takes various samples
    of tap water as well as Potheri Lake water with varying differences in pH, turbidity,
    and water temperature. The pH level of lake water can vary widely depending on
    various factors such as the surrounding environment, the presence of aquatic life,
    and the weather conditions. In general, lake water can have a lower or higher
    pH level than tap water, depending on the lake''s distinctive characteristics
    and the way the local area''s tap water is treated. For instance, tap water is
    usually treated to have a pH level between 6.5 and 8.5, which is considered safe
    for human consumption and does not cause corrosion in pipes. The naturally occurring
    presence of suspended particles like silt, sand, and algae in lake water can cause
    it to have a greater turbidity level than tap water. 2 Literature Review The hardware
    design of one system [1] includes various components such as sensors, actuators,
    relays, an Ethernet shield, Arduino, and routers. The monitoring of temperature
    and humidity is accomplished using an Arduino microcontroller, an Ethernet Shield,
    an FC-28 humidity sensor, and a DHT11 temperature sensor. A router is utilized
    to connect the Arduino Ethernet to a server. The relay module functions as a control
    switch for various actuators, which respond to the sensor output. The aquaponic
    box contains several actuators, such as two 12V DC exhaust fans, a mist maker,
    a 5V DC fan, two LED Grow Light lamps, and a 12V DC pump [2]. Another system kept
    track of numerous environmental factors, and over time it would be able to control
    how the farm operated and create a fully automated system. Publishers (nodes),
    brokers (local servers), and subscribers (local servers) all communicated via
    the MQTT protocol, which allows for the use of any data type. Monitoring can also
    be done with the help of a GUI program, a communication network, and [3] wireless
    sensors. A graphical user interface is provided by AWSM to address the aforementioned
    issues. Farmers can get real-time notifications and advice about water quality
    even when they are not there by using AWSM''s mobile applications built on IoT
    technology. When compared to the conventional approach, the introduction of the
    AWSM-based IoT application in the Aquaponics system has shown substantial gains.
    Additionally, it is feasible to [4] investigate many characteristics observed
    by smart systems, IoT technologies, and aquaponics. A ZigBee module [5] can be
    used in place of the Wi-Fi module to broadcast the data gathered by the Arduino
    while also displaying the values on the LCD without performing any control actions.
    A fish tank, a grow bed, and a light panel that simulates the sun''s rays for
    plant growth make up the aquaponics system described in [6]. The fish waste provides
    nutrients to the plants, which in turn receive water from the fish tank as a filter.
    The system makes use of actuators to operate the water pump, light panel, heater,
    and oxygen provider as well as sensors to monitor and control pH levels, temperature,
    and humidity. To direct the actual citrus production process, nutrient monitoring
    [7] in citrus plants can also be done in real time according to the soil situation.
    Another method that primarily focuses on finding magnesium and nitrogen deficiencies
    in image processing [8] in MATLAB for the detection of rice illnesses and nutritional
    deficiencies. A Raspberry Pi, a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, and solenoid
    valves make up the hardware employed in this technique. A deep learning method
    can help in the detection of diseases and the prediction of crop growth by utilizing
    many sensors that measure the pH value, temperature, humidity, and water level
    [9]. Astute farming is described by the author of reference [10] as the integration
    of a wireless sensor and irrigation system that keeps track of factors including
    soil moisture, nutritional content, and pH levels. A GSM module is used to manage
    the system via wireless communication. 3 Architecture Diagram The proposed system
    shown in Fig 1 comprises two sets of sensors—one for the fish tank and the other
    for the crop soil. The data from these sensors are sent to the Arduino board.
    The Arduino board processes the data and sends it to the NodeMCU Wi-Fi module
    which sends it to the Adafruit cloud platform for visualization and analytics
    [11,12,13,14,15]. The system gathers real-time sensor data from the fish tank
    and crop soil using a variety of sensors, including a soil moisture sensor, temperature
    and humidity sensor, pH sensor, turbidity sensor, and water temperature sensor.
    The physical layer or sensor is made up of this. The data is gathered and transferred
    to the Arduino board regularly. Fig. 1 Architecture diagram of proposed system
    Full size image 4 Methodology The construction of an aquaponics monitoring system
    for effective irrigation is the main goal of the suggested system. The system
    uses a variety of sensors, including a soil moisture sensor placed in a tomato
    plant, pH, water temperature, and turbidity sensors. The irrigation process is
    controlled by the readings from these sensors. Hardware Setup: The hardware setup
    consists of an Arduino board that, via Arduino programming in the Arduino IDE,
    receives data from the sensors. The NodeMCU Wi-Fi module, which is set up to work
    on any internet network, receives the data after that. A personal hotspot or local
    Wi-Fi network was used for this project. The data is sent from the NodeMCU to
    Adafruit.io, a cloud-based platform for IoT data analytics and visualization.
    On this platform, real-time data changes can be tracked and examined. Every 30–45
    s, the sensors update their readings. A CSV file containing the data gathered
    from the Adafruit.io platform can be downloaded. Then, using the downloaded data,
    three classification algorithms—KNN, ANN, and Naive Bayes—are trained and tested.
    To forecast the soil''s irrigation needs, data is analyzed. Jupyter Notebook is
    used to analyze and visualize machine learning. Utilizing visualization techniques,
    the three classification systems are compared for accuracy. The system’s overall
    goal is to create an aquaponics monitoring system that controls irrigation by
    using a variety of sensors. Machine learning algorithms are used to analyze the
    sensor data and estimate the need for irrigation, which can result in more effective
    irrigation and higher agricultural yields. 4.1 Machine Learning Algorithms Used
    KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor). To use KNN, we must first select a value for k, which
    specifies the number of neighbors to take into account. Then, when we have a fresh
    batch of data to categorize, we determine how far away each point in the training
    set is from the fresh data and select the k-nearest points. Finally, we designate
    the class for the new data point as being the one that is most prevalent among
    those k points. Naïve Bayes’ classifier. Based on the Bayes theorem, which quantifies
    the likelihood of a hypothesis given evidence, it is a probabilistic categorization
    model. The term “naive” refers to the assumption made in Naive Bayes that the
    features are conditionally independent of the class. ANN (Artificial Neural Network).
    It is a machine learning model that takes its cues from how the human brain is
    organized and works. It is made up of many interconnected layers of neurons that
    analyze data and produce predictions. The features of the instance to be classified
    are sent to the input layer of an ANN classification model, and the predicted
    class is generated by the output layer. There are one or more hidden layers in
    between that process the input and transmit data to the output layer. The weighted
    total of the inputs is applied by each neuron in the hidden layers using a nonlinear
    activation function. 5 Components Used 5.1 Hardware The proposed irrigation system
    based on aquaponics uses various components to measure and transmit real-time
    data to the cloud platform for visualization and analytics. The sensors used in
    the system are summarized below. Soil moisture sensor (LM393). An electrical tool
    called the soil moisture sensor (LM393) measures the amount of water in the soil.
    It measures the soil moisture using the LM393 comparator integrated circuit and
    outputs a digital signal based on the predetermined moisture threshold. This sensor
    comprises two probes that are put into the soil; as a function of the moisture
    content of the soil, the resistance between the probe changes. Temperature and
    humidity sensor (DHT11). A widely used electrical device that can detect both
    temperature and humidity levels in the environment is the DHT11 temperature and
    humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor to monitor humidity levels
    and a Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistor to measure temperature.
    The sensor sends digital outputs of temperature and humidity data to an 8-bit
    microcontroller through a one-wire protocol. pH sensor and turbidity sensor: A
    pH sensor is an electronic device that determines whether a solution is acidic
    or alkaline. The pH scale, which has a range of 0–14 with 0 being the most acidic,
    14 being the most alkaline, and 7 being neutral, serves as the basis for how it
    functions. The fish tank’s water clarity, which is crucial for fish health, is
    measured by the turbidity sensor. Water temperature sensor. A common sensor for
    measuring the temperature of liquids, including water, is the DS18B20. This sensor
    is a digital thermometer that communicates with other devices via a 1-Wire interface.
    With an accuracy of 0.5 °C in the range of − 10 to + 85 °C, the DS18B20 can measure
    temperatures from − 55 to + 125 °C. Arduino board. Arduino Uno is based on the
    ATmega328P microcontroller. It is an open-source hardware board created for people
    of all skill levels who want to develop a variety of electronic projects. The
    board contains a USB port, a power jack, six analog inputs, an ICSP header, and
    14 digital input/output pins. The Arduino programming language, which is based
    on C/C++, can be used to program the board. NodeMCU Wi-Fi module. The board is
    a great option for IoT applications because it combines the capabilities of a
    microcontroller and a Wi-Fi module. The Arduino IDE or the Lua programming language
    is used to creating programs for the NodeMCU ESP8266 device. Various sensors,
    actuators, and other electronic devices can be connected to the board''s GPIO
    pins. Additionally, it has Wi-Fi connectivity functionality built-in, enabling
    it to connect to the internet and communicate with other devices. A USB cable
    or an external power source can be used to power the board. 6 Implementation The
    sensor data was collected for over a month on an hourly basis. Visualizations
    were created based on the data. The data was also collected in the form of CSV,
    and three different binary classification algorithms were applied to it, namely
    KNN, ANN, and Naive Bayes. The working model of the aquaponic system is shown
    in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Turbidity, water temperature, and pH sensor along with connections
    Full size image 7 Results The suggested technique gives a thorough strategy for
    effective aquaponic irrigation management. Real-time sensor data visualization
    and analytics offer insightful information on fish and agricultural growth conditions.
    The three machine learning methods’ comparison offers useful insights into effective
    irrigation prediction in aquaponics. For visualization and analysis, the Adafruit
    platform can be accessed on a smartphone, laptop, tablet, or any other electronic
    device that can be connected to the internet. Visualization on Adafruit.io is
    shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Fig. 3 Real-time values of data acquired from sensors

    7.1 Comparing the Accuracy of Various Classification Models The selection of a
    classification algorithm for agricultural data is influenced by the details of
    the data, the resources at hand, and the objectives of the classification activity.
    A standard criterion for assessing a classification model''s performance is accuracy.
    It calculates the percentage of cases in the dataset that were correctly categorized.
    To put it another way, accuracy is the proportion of true positives and true negatives
    in all instances. The model is operating effectively and properly predicting the
    class labels of the instances in the dataset when the accuracy value is high.
    A classification model could be taught to determine whether or not a certain soil
    sample needs irrigation based on its characteristics, such as its temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture content. In this situation, a classification model
    with high accuracy might be helpful since it can make precise predictions about
    the soil samples’ irrigation requirements. As a result, farmers may be better
    able to decide when and how much to irrigate their crops, which may result in
    the more effective use of water resources and higher crop yields. On comparing
    the accuracy of all three algorithms as in Fig. 5, Naive Bayes was observed to
    have the highest accuracy of 94.12%. This is followed by ANN with an accuracy
    of 91.18% and then by KNN having an accuracy of 88.24. Fig. 5 Grouped bar chart
    for comparison of the accuracy of different models used Full size image 8 Conclusion
    In conclusion, we have presented an irrigation system based on aquaponics that
    utilizes real-time sensor data to monitor and irrigate crops efficiently. The
    system gathers information from a variety of sensors, including soil moisture
    sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, pH sensors, turbidity sensors, and
    water temperature sensors. This information is then processed and instantly displayed
    on the Adafruit platform. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of three classification
    algorithms, namely KNN, Naive Bayes’, and ANN, for deciding when to irrigate the
    soil. We discovered that ANN had the maximum accuracy, making it the best algorithm
    for our system''s irrigation timing prediction. As a future scope, we plan to
    further enhance our system by incorporating features that will enable the user
    to receive alerts on their mobile device, indicating when the crop needs water.
    We also plan to compare our results with additional classification algorithms
    to identify the best-performing algorithm for our system. Overall, this system
    provides a significant advancement in the automation of aquaponics-based irrigation,
    offering a more efficient, accurate, and sustainable way of managing crops. References

  description: The demand for food is increasing every day because of the growing
    population. However, the proportional growth in the production of crops is not
    happening. This problem can be addressed using information technology in the agricultural
    process. In this paper, an Internet of Things-based (IoT) system has been designed
    and developed to monitor soil health. The chemical and physical properties of
    the soil can be evaluated by measuring different parameters contained in the soil
    such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, moisture, and
    salinity as well as electrical conductivity. Three sensor nodes are developed
    using NodeMCU ESP8266, NPK sensor, EC sensor, soil moisture, and temperature sensor.
    First, the data obtained from the procured sensors have been tested and validated
    in the laboratory by adding different amounts of urea and water. These sensor
    nodes, which are powered by solar, are placed at some desired location in the
    agricultural fields to collect the soil data. All the sensor data are then sent
    to the cloud over a Wi-Fi network using Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)
    protocol for monitoring, further analysis, and decision-making. The data of the
    soil parameters are stored in a cloud platform, which will allow monitoring of
    the data in graphical and numerical formats. An android application is developed
    for real-time monitoring of the data.

    Quality Chapter © 2022 1 Introduction Agricultural practices are closely associated
    with the production of essential crops and are the main source of income for most
    developing countries. Agriculture plays a major role in the economic growth of
    developing countries like India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. A nation’s food
    security is ensured by the agricultural sector. Agriculture is the backbone of
    the country''s economic system, about 70% of the people rely on it. There is a
    high demand for food, but a low supply. In comparison to population growth, agricultural
    production is insufficient. A primary cause of this decrease in agricultural production
    is the use of old conventional methods by farmers. Due to continuous changes in
    the weather, soil conditions, and climatic conditions, and a lack of knowledge
    and technology, it is very difficult for farmers to keep track of all these records,
    analyze, and harvest crops appropriately. To address this problem, an IoT-based
    (Internet of Things) soil health monitoring system is proposed; this will enable
    users to determine the health of the soil to maximize crop productivity. A brief
    background study on sensor-based soil monitoring systems is discussed below. The
    paper [1] presented a system where the data from the soil sensors are delivered
    to the MCP3204 ADC (Analog-to-digital converter), which then sends it to the cloud
    through Raspberry Pi, and the information may be accessed via mobile phones and
    personal computers (PCs). The study in [2] consists of an electronic device that
    can detect macronutrients using three light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as a light
    source and one light-dependent resistor (LDR) as a light detector. Light converts
    the remaining light reflected by the reflector into an electric current. The system
    uses a microcontroller to collect the data, so the output of the converter is
    converted to reading on a digital display. The research in paper [3] helps farmers
    to receive suggestions for sulfur and lime based on the pH value of the soil.
    A t-test showed that there was no significant difference between the calculated
    data and the recorded data in the laboratory, confirming the proposed approach,
    and from the proposed system agriculture scientists, farmers, IoT experts and
    agriculture professionals, will be benefited. The proposed system in [4], the
    soil health monitoring unit (SHMU), is photovoltaic and can be installed in the
    field for long periods. Using LoRaWAN wireless technology, each SHMU wirelessly
    sends soil temperature, humidity, conductivity, CO, and geographic location data
    and uses a dashboard to analyze soil health measurements for soil. The research
    in [5] describes a soil sensing methodology that uses a nitrogen phosphorus potassium
    (NPK) testing kit and other traditional methods to measure digitally using a cloud-based
    prognostic technique that helps increase crop output with minimal water and fertilizer
    use. The author of the paper [6] used IoT technology to detect and control devices
    remotely via an access network, allowing numerous physical objects to be directly
    connected to a computer system. They use temperature sensors, pressure sensors,
    and humidity sensors, and Lora is used as a wireless communication system, which
    is a low-power wide area network (LPWAN) technology. The paper [7] attempts to
    introduce an embedded soil monitoring system that measures soil moisture and performs
    automatic irrigation, ambient temperature, and humidity. Use the PHP (Hypertext
    preprocessor) Web site to change the configuration data for watering timing and
    soil water content lower and upper limits, and monitor real-time soil water changes
    in charts. The paper [8] describes a low-cost system that can obtain up-to-date
    information on crop surroundings and farm issues and proposes the best crop needs
    based on data from sensors. The proposed system is an IoT-based crop monitoring
    system using Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) technology. The paper
    [9] presents an overview of various soil sensors used to measure temperature,
    moisture, and humidity. Information from the sensors on the ground is displayed
    in the android app which is very helpful in making cultivation recommendations
    to farmers for better agriculture. The proposed IoT-based soil health monitoring
    system helps to monitor real-time soil moisture content and electrical conductivity
    of the soil water. It detects the nutrient values of the soil like phosphorus,
    nitrogen, and potassium. It is low cost and powered by solar systems. The data
    can be monitored using a smartphone or laptop/desktop. 2 IoT-Based Soil Health
    Monitoring An IoT-based soil health monitoring system has been proposed. This
    helps to monitor various soil parameters and to make appropriate decisions regarding
    the use of the right amount of water and fertilizer. This monitoring system will
    also help to maintain all these soil parameters at their desired level. Some soil
    physicochemical properties, such as water content, temperature, soil nitrogen,
    phosphorus, and potassium levels, have a significant impact on crop yields. The
    proposed system consists primarily of various sensors for monitoring soil conditions
    and NodeMCU ESP8266 for data acquisition and sending it to the cloud for monitoring
    and further analysis. The solar power bank has been used to power the sensor nodes.
    Three sensors track and monitor soil moisture, soil nutrient levels, and soil
    electrical conductivity. The sensors detect the soil parameters data and send
    it to the Thingspeak cloud platform using the MQTT communication protocol. 3 Hardware
    Used It is an IoT-based soil health monitoring system that monitors various soil
    parameters to improve crop yields. Various sensors are used to determine soil
    parameters and monitor soil health. Three sensors are used here: EC sensor, soil
    moisture sensor, and NPK sensor. These sensors are attached to a microcontroller
    NodeMCU ESP8266, and data are sent from the microcontroller to the cloud server
    using the MQTT communication protocol. 3.1 NPK Sensor The soil NPK sensor can
    detect the levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the soil. It aids
    in examining soil health quality, enabling a much more systematic assessment of
    soil condition. A Modbus module is required to read the NPK data. The Modbus module
    communicates with the microcontroller and the sensor. 3.2 Electric Conductivity
    Sensor (EC) EC sensor measures the electrical conductivity of a solution. It is
    a low-cost system having a satisfactory high accuracy rate of conductivity of
    electricity. Direct measurement of soil water can be captured in the field using
    EC water conductivity test equipment. A voltage is applied between the electrodes
    by the sensor placed into the soil water sample. The resistance of water is calculated
    from the voltage drop, which is converted to conductivity. Conductivity is inversely
    proportional to resistance and is expressed as the amount of conductance over
    a given area. If the EC value is too low, it indicates that the soil is deficient
    in nutrients, and if the EC value is too high, it indicates that the soil is rich
    in nutrients. 3.3 Soil Moisture Sensor It is normally used to estimate the soil
    water content. This sensor is made up of 2 probes that measure the content of
    the water. If there is more water, it conducts more electricity, resulting in
    much less resistance; as a result, the moisture content is higher and vice-versa.
    Less than 500 is too wet, 500–750 is the target range, and greater than 750 are
    dry enough to be watered. 3.4 Microcontroller (NodeMCU ESP8266) NodeMCU ESP8266
    is an open-source platform that connects devices and enables transferring of data
    using Wi-Fi protocol. It is compatible with Arduino IDE and is very easy to use.
    Multiple sensors are directly connected to it for measuring and monitoring the
    soil health parameters. NodeMCU along with smart sensors measures the quality
    (moisture, nutrition, conductivity) and effectiveness of soil. The controller
    uses sensors to access the monitored information. The measured data will be sent
    and displayed on the cloud platform. This experimental result monitors the soil
    quality in real time. 4 System Architecture The structure, behavior, and viewpoints
    of a system are defined by the system architecture, which is a conceptual model.
    An architecture description is a formal specification and representation of a
    system that is organized in a way that makes thinking about the system''s structures
    and behaviors easier. The block diagrammatic representation of the proposed system
    is given (Fig. 1). The electronics circuit diagram of a sample sensor node is
    given in Fig. 2. The three solar-powered sensor nodes installed in agricultural
    fields are given in Fig. 3. Fig. 1 System block diagram Full size image Fig. 2
    Circuit diagram of the sensor node system Full size image Fig. 3 Connections of
    the three different solar-powered sensor nodes installed at the agricultural field
    Full size image 4.1 Communication Protocol (MQTT) The proposed model uses the
    Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol to connect various IoT remote
    devices with the server with minimal network bandwidth. MQTT (in Fig. 4) is an
    Internet of Things communication protocol that has been certified by Organization
    for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS). It is designed
    as a very lightweight subscribe/publish messaging transport which is ideal for
    connecting remote devices. Although MQTT is most commonly used with transmission
    control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP), it is used with any network protocol
    that enables lossless, ordered, bidirectional communications. A message broker
    and clients are the two sorts of network entities defined by the MQTT protocol.
    The MQTT broker is a server that accepts all messages from clients and forward
    them to the target client. The MQTT client is a device that runs the MQTT library
    and connects to the MQTT broker over the network. MQTT clients use the “Topic”
    subject line instead of the intended recipient''s direct connection address. Anyone
    who subscribes to a topic receives a copy of all messages related to that topic.
    Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is used by MQTT, and connections are
    protected. The data are collected using sensors connected to a microcontroller
    and transferred to the cloud using the MQTT communication protocol, which will
    be routed through an MQTT broker in real time. The information will be sent to
    a cloud server (ThingSpeak) and can view it all on the PC or mobile device. It
    is important to note that the sensor will continue to communicate new data to
    the cloud server without waiting for a response. The Web server will issue a request
    to retrieve messages/data sent by the sensors. MQTT is ideal in the field of IoT
    since the entire message sending process is an example of asynchronous communication.
    Fig. 4 MQTT protocol Full size image 4.2 Client and Server Interaction The user
    initiates a request, which is then accepted by the cloud server. The server acts
    as a channel between the user''s request and the server''s response. The request
    is then accepted by the server, and the user is given access to the account. The
    user may observe, monitor, and analyze the soil''s many parameters. A block diagram
    representation of the client and server interaction is shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5
    Client and server interaction diagram Full size image 5 Monitoring of Data The
    user can remotely monitor the various soil parameters from any remote place by
    using our application “Farmdoc.” It is an android application that is used to
    monitor soil data in real time. This application is built using MIT app inventor.
    The application consists of a splash screen that displays the app name, and a
    homepage where the soil data will be displayed in the form of graphs. The soil
    data are fetched from the cloud server, i.e., the ThingSpeak server, and the application
    shows all the relevant data. It displays various soil parameters like potassium
    content, moisture content, phosphorus content, electrical conductivity, nitrogen
    content, and salinity level of soil in graphical format (in Fig. 7). The flowchart
    of the proposed system is given (Fig. 6). Fig. 6 Flowchart of the health monitoring
    system Full size image Fig. 7 Various soil property data displayed in the developed
    application Full size image 6 Results and Discussion In this paper, a soil health
    monitoring system is developed that is used to monitor electrical conductivity,
    nitrogen content, phosphorus content, potassium content, and soil moisture content
    of the soil in the agricultural field. Three different sensors are used to monitor
    these parameters. At first, these sensors are calibrated and validated in a laboratory
    setup to test the variation in the sensor’s reading with changes in soil condition.
    One of the most important parameters in determining soil health is NPK values.
    When the NPK values are low, then urea is added to the soil. If the NPK values
    are very high, then any particular type of crop may not be cultivated there. The
    reading obtained from the NPK sensor has been tested by adding varying amounts
    of urea to a soil sample. 1 kg of a soil sample is taken and divided into two
    parts—Soil Sample-1 and Soil Sample-2. The nitrogen content of Soil Sample-1,
    i.e., plain soil without urea using an NPK sensor is measured. Then, 5 pieces
    of diluted urea are added to Soil Sample-1, and then again, the nitrogen content
    is measured using the NPK sensor. There is a very slight increase in NPK level.
    After taking the NPK reading, the percentage difference of the Soil Sample-1 without
    (n1) and with (n2) urea using the formula ((n1 − n2)/n1) *100 is calculated. The
    percentage difference ranges from 2 to 5%. The nitrogen content of Soil Sample-2,
    i.e., plain soil without urea (n3) is measured using an NPK sensor. Then, 10 pieces
    of diluted urea are added to Soil Sample-2 (n4), and then again, the nitrogen
    content is measured using the NPK sensor. There is a large increase in NPK levels.
    After taking the NPK reading, the percentage difference of the Soil Sample-2 without
    and with urea ((n3 − n4)/n3) *100 is calculated. The percentage difference ranges
    from 38 to 41%. This test can provide an idea of how much urea should be added
    to the field for a particular type of crop in presence of reference data. The
    NPK values are recorded and monitored through the mobile application as shown
    in Fig. 8. Fig. 8 NPK sensor data displayed on the cloud Full size image When
    EC exceeds the desired level, soil fertility decreases. To test the EC and salt
    content of the soil, a 1 kg soil sample is taken. Electrical conductivity and
    salinity of soil sample without water are measured using an EC sensor. It is observed
    that the values for EC and salinity are the same. When 100 ml of water is added
    to the soil, there is a slight change in the values of EC and salinity. First,
    the values increase then decrease, and finally, they become equal when the water
    dries up. Then, 200 ml of water is added to the soil; there is a large change
    in the values of EC and salinity. First, the values increase then decrease, and
    finally, they become equal when the water dries up. When the value of electrical
    conductivity is high, it needs to be reduced, and this can be done with the process
    of leaching where water needs to be added to the soil so that the amount of salt
    can be reduced from the soil. It is observed that if less amount of water is added,
    then the values of EC and salinity are less. If more amount of water is added,
    then the value will be more. The data of EC and salinity of soil can be monitored
    from the user device as shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9 EC sensor data displayed on the
    cloud Full size image To test the moisture of the soil, a 1 kg soil sample is
    taken. The soil moisture sensor data are recorded by gradually increasing the
    amount of added water in the soil sample. It is observed that moisture content
    increases as the water content of the soil increases. First, adding 50 ml of water
    will increase the moisture content of the soil, which will become constant after
    a while. Then, 100 ml of water is added; there is a slight increase in the moisture
    content of the soil, and after some time, moisture content becomes constant. The
    moisture sensor data as displayed in the user device are shown in Fig. 10. Initial
    obstacles faced are the issue of power supply in the field which is solved using
    the solar power. Fig. 10 Soil moisture sensor data displayed on the cloud Full
    size image 7 Conclusion The proposed solar-powered soil health monitoring system
    is a cost-effective solution to the problem of the farmers. They can access and
    monitor the soil parameters from anywhere in the world at any time; it makes their
    lives easier. The data collected by the sensors are continuously sent by NodeMCU
    microcontroller using MQTT to the cloud server wirelessly in real time so that
    the farmers can take necessary steps according to the change of soil parameters
    for better crop yield. It would help the farmer to use the right amount of fertilizer
    and water depending on the requirement of any particular type of crop. The future
    scope of this proposed system is to monitor soil parameters in a more detailed
    way with utmost precision and to provide accurate suggestions after analyzing
    the soil health report of the particular field. The suggestion would help the
    farmer to take the necessary steps for better growth of crops at all times irrespective
    of their knowledge about the agricultural sector. References Manickam S (2020)

    need for food production is estimated to enhance by approximately 70% by 2050.1,
    2 The rapidly rising world population will thus cause an equivalent rise in food
    demand. Thus, to have an optimal farm system that uses optimal water and energy,
    the sights specific farming with the precision of water and energy used is provided
    to the farmers, which helps them to take better decisions and improve the quality,
    and quantity, in turn increasing productivity. The advancement in technology with
    the modernization of farming through automation is important for the efficient
    use of water, which supports plant growth and the monitoring of environmental
    data and also reduces the need for manual (conventional) irrigation.3, 4 Therefore,
    smart farming will be performed effectively using an automatic irrigation system,
    which can reduce the cost of irrigation and crop cultivation. This can also handle
    optimal usage of water and electrical energy, which can emphasize long-term sustainable
    solutions through automation of the agricultural irrigation process. The process
    of automatic irrigation can be executed using the acquired data through sensors
    which can be integrated through a sensor network system. These sensors can automatically
    evaluate environmental conditions such as air humidity, soil moisture, and air
    temperature for effective utilization of irrigation systems. To build a sustainable
    soil monitoring system using wireless sensor network (WSN), the Internet of Things
    (IoT) can also play an essential role in automating the watering process and collecting
    information from the environment. Nowadays, saving water is also a top priority
    because optimal utilization of water will save water resources effectively for
    reducing drought. The challenges are addressed during the implementation of WSN
    for monitoring the field and estimating irrigation requirements with the help
    of gathered data as reported by Garcia et al.5 Further, a review has been reported
    by Akhtar et al6 on how edge computing techniques can help to store and process
    the data in the cloud. To cover large areas and optimize the soil moisture conditions,
    Liang et al7 have applied an adaptive Cauchy variant butterfly optimization algorithm
    in a WSN. Further, Chai et al8 have proposed strategies for soil moisture sensor
    deployment using a data-driven method which can help in the estimation of evapotranspiration
    of environment. IoT cloud platform can also help in analytics where a lot of data
    can be stored and analyzed for the futuristic requirement to manage the plants
    so that automated irrigation systems will effectively solve the problem of water
    crisis based on said sensor values. The data are represented to the users in a
    user-friendly manner. Considering these aspects, the objective of this paper is
    to design and develop a soil monitoring system using a WSN for an automatic irrigation
    system where IoT technique is applied to monitor and control the soil condition
    so that the appropriate amount of water can be given to the crop during cultivation,
    which can save water, time, and money for the cultivation of the crop. The aim
    of this paper is envisaged in the following points: A soil monitoring system using
    WSN is built where the IoT technique is applied for communication between different
    nodes. The different protocols, such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and
    message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocols, are attempted to obtain
    faster communication as compared to HTTP protocol. Remote monitoring and controlling
    capabilities using WSN have been demonstrated where a mobile app is also developed.
    This sends the different sensor data such as soil moisture, humidity, and temperature
    conditions. The different conditions are analyzed so that the farmers can take
    the decision for the automatic irrigation system. The different experimental trials
    are conducted, and data are stored in the cloud using a mobile app that can help
    in crop cultivation, especially lemongrass crops. This paper is structured as
    follows: A brief state-of-the-art report on a different irrigation system and
    its applications is presented in Section 2. A novel IoT-based smart soil monitoring
    system using WSN with the application of MQTT protocol for automatic drip irrigation
    where soil conditions are monitored using a WSN is proposed in Section 6. The
    system architecture is discussed in Section 12. An experimental testing setup
    is also built for implementing and monitoring the soil conditions, which is discussed
    in Section 16. The summary is concluded in Section 17. 2 BRIEF STATE-OF-ART REPORT

    (ML) algorithms are applied for the prediction of irrigation patterns toward different
    crops along with weather conditions. Debauched et al33 have optimized the usage
    of water quality for irrigation and the data are sent using edge cloud computing

    Manimegalai et al34 have attempted to monitor and control irrigation systems using
    IoT whereby designing the variable rate irrigation, the controlling of an irrigation
    system is done using WSN and implemented in real time. Tripathi et al35 have applied

    a drip irrigation system for a particular application and an area in the soil
    profile representative in the root zone. Gayathri et al40 have attempted to develop
    smart drip irrigation using IoT where the water is allowed to drip gradually to
    the roots of plants so that the water can reach directly into the root zones and
    reduce evaporation in the environment. Pradeep et al41 have attempted sensor-based
    IoT technology for smart irrigation which gathers the humidity, soil moisture,

    systems. Karar et al42 have attempted a system for monitoring the farmer''s crop
    conditions through an Android mobile application remotely and to provide a solution
    to the farmers using unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). The developed system demonstrated
    that IoT-based embedded systems can be effectively utilized to avoid unnecessary
    wastage of water for irrigation applications. Oukaira et al43 have evaluated the
    different technologies for estimating soil moisture to support a variety of applications
    and to aid the usage of drip irrigation. Badrun et al44 have attempted a smart
    irrigation system with the help of IoT, cloud computing, AI, and big data toward
    innovative simple semantic solutions for users or farmers to evaluate rainfall,

    the task of automatic drip irrigation using IoT where the ML method is applied
    for crop prediction which will increase the productivity of the field for the
    benefit of farmers. Bhoi et al46 have proposed a trained system for resourceful
    water usage with the minimum intervention of the users/farmers in irrigation systems
    where IoT devices are utilized for collecting the environmentally trained data
    (like soil moisture, humidity, etc.) of the crop fields. Tace et al47 have focused
    on a smart and flexible irrigation system with low consumption and cost which
    can be used in different crop fields. During the development of the system, different
    ML approaches are applied and data are collected with the help of an acquisition
    map using the Node-RED platform. Wang et al48 have applied AI along with IoT technologies
    for better yielding crops, analyzing the soil, cultivation growing conditions,
    and coordination between the farmers for advancing agricultural aspects across
    the total food supply chain management at the worldwide level. Abioye et al49
    have developed an ML model for a predictive control strategy that can save water
    during drip irrigation. This can also adjust the soil moisture content and the
    scheduling of irrigation can be analyzed due to losses of water from the soil
    and plant due to environmental conditions. Aziz et al50 have focused on IoT cloud-based
    wireless communication systems where through cloud water requirement for paddy
    (rice) is estimated for a particular location. The optimality test is also carried
    out. Some of the relevant researchers'' works are summarized along with merits

    reservoir is directly connected to a pump unit. The processing time is a little
    bit more. Patel et al24 A technical review on automated sensors and cloud-based
    smart irrigation systems has been discussed. In a particular instance, a sensor
    can help in obtaining the appropriate amount of water and also helps in reduction
    of the water wastage. Only communication methods are discussed. Hardware is not
    developed. Jena et al28 An Arduino-based integrated irrigation system has been
    discussed. Optimum water usage in a particular irrigation field is carried out.
    Time-dependent input data are not discussed. Thakur et al31 A prototype for smart
    irrigation and detecting intrusion in an agriculture field is developed with the
    help of various sensors integration. Smart irrigation and detecting intrusion
    are discussed. The intrusion detection can be done up to 3 to 5 m. Manimegalai
    et al34 A monitoring and controlling of irrigation systems has been carried out
    where the controlling of an irrigation system is done using WSN. Water is supplied
    at a variable rate. A different wireless node system is not applied. Pradeep et
    al41 A sensor-based smart irrigation has been focused on where the humidity, soil
    moisture, and temperature data are transmitted to the farmers of irrigation systems.
    The farmers can monitor the crop condition. HTTP protocol is applied only. Oukaira
    et al43 Estimations of the soil moisture condition have been carried out. This
    can help in the distribution of water usage through drip irrigation. Theoretical
    analysis is carried out only. Bhoi et al46 An ML model is trained for utilizing
    resourceful water usage with the minimum intervention of the users/farmers. This
    can help in the collection of trained data from sensors (like soil moisture and
    humidity) of the crop fields The predication results are deliberated only. Wang
    et al48 IoT technologies have been applied for advancing agricultural aspects
    in supply food chain management This provides better yielding crops, analyzation
    of the soil, cultivation of growing conditions, and coordination between the farmers.
    Theoretical analysis has been carried out only. Aziz et al.50 An IoT cloud-based
    wireless communication system has been discussed where through cloud water requirement
    for paddy (rice) is estimated for a particular location. The optimality test is
    also carried out. The system is not applied to the different crops. Based on the
    brief state-of-art report, it is found that the research work on monitoring and
    control of soil conditions for automatic drip irrigation systems using multiple
    node systems with MQTT communication protocol and IoT technique is not carried
    out especially for lemongrass plantations. Therefore, the proposed research work
    is related to the design and development of an IoT-based soil monitoring system
    using multiple wireless sensor node systems with MQTT protocol which is a novelty
    of this work. The different conditions of plants are examined for monitoring the
    crops. 3 IOT-ENABLED COMMUNICATION METHODOLOGY OF SMART SOIL MONITORING SYSTEM
    DESIGN To design an IoT-based smart soil monitoring system, a sensor network system
    is designed as shown in Figure 1. The following subsections are considered. FIGURE
    1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Schematic diagram of the automatic irrigation
    system using WSN and IoT. 3.1 Sensors node The four sensor nodes are taken where
    the system consists of one node microcontrol unit (MCU) controller as a master
    node and the other three sensor nodes act as slave nodes. Each sensor node has
    one soil moisture sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor, and one node MCU
    microcontroller. The node MCU is supported with ESP8266 for Wi-Fi communication,
    integrated general purpose input/output (GPIO), pulse width modulation (PWM),
    inter-integrated circuit (I2C), and analog–digital card (ADC) all within one board
    for faster communications. A USB-TTL cable is included and open-source programming
    is written using an integrated development environment (IDE) for integrating the
    entire hardware. 3.2 Sensors Each node consists of the soil moisture sensor, humidity
    sensor, and temperature sensor. The soil moisture sensor (Model: Robotbana) is
    used with digital output and soil hygrometer. The output of moisture can be measured
    in terms of volumetric content. Humidity and temperature sensor (DHT22) is used,
    which is a polymer capacitor type sensor. The operating range is 0%–100% RH, temperature
    measuring range is 0°C–80°C, accuracy is ±2%RH and a maximum of up to ±5%RH and
    temperature accuracy is ±0.5°C, resolution or sensitivity of humidity is 0.1%RH
    and temperature sensitivity is 0.1°C, repeatability of humidity is ±1%RH and repeatability
    of temperature is 0.2°C, and sensing period average is 2 s. 3.3 Actuators AC water
    pump (0.5 hp) is used for supplying the water to the plantations from water resources.
    For regulating the flow of water, a solenoid valve (operated through 24 voltage
    direct current [VDC]) is utilized so that the pump can be automatically ON/OFF.
    3.4 Communication routers The router is used for a wide area network (WAN) for
    wireless communications so that sensor data can be sent in the pocket. This can
    be forwarded to the internet by assigning an internet protocol (IP) address. 3.5
    Protocols The two protocols (HTTP and MQTT) are applied for analyzing the proper
    communications in the IoT cloud. A Thingspeak IoT platform is used, which has
    Android application open-source programming capabilities. As per the requirement
    of soil condition, the water pump is operated automatically by activating each
    sensor node. In this system, data are collected from all the sensor nodes at the
    same time, and data are sent to the cloud. NodeMCU microcontroller controls the
    entire setup where an ESP8266 Wi-Fi inbuilt module is used for transmitting and
    receiving data wirelessly. To assemble the data simultaneously from more than
    one node, the MQTT protocol is applied. Different environmental sensors are used
    to collect the soil moisture, soil temperature, and humidity information of the
    environment. A water pump is connected to the controller node for supplying water
    in the field. The data sent by the sensor nodes are analyzed in the cloud and
    a decision is taken in the cloud on whether the soil needs water or not. Therefore,
    the command is sent to the master for further action. The master turns the ON
    or OFF pump according to the command. It is helpful for farmers since the water
    requirement of the soil can be monitored worldwide. The sensor nodes are powered
    with the help of a solar panel. This system is designed for wireless monitoring
    and control of agricultural land from anywhere using a mobile Android device.
    The application user can monitor and control the irrigation process, cultivate
    crop performance, collect soil data and send alerts to the user, and store them
    for analytics. Therefore, the WSN system is applied for irrigation operations
    on the entire field and IoT-enabled communication methodology is shown in Figure
    2. This system can allow the farmers to monitor and control the fields 24/7 throughout
    the whole year. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Communication methodology
    for IoT-based automatic irrigation system. For developing the system architecture
    for the soil monitoring system using WSN, the major hardware materials are utilized
    as listed in Table 2. TABLE 2. List of materials for hardware development. S.
    no. Materials Purpose I. Soil moisture sensor51 The soil moisture sensors are
    used for observing the water content, which can be inserted in the soil. This
    provides an output level of moisture in terms of volumetric content. II. Temperature
    and humidity sensors52 The sensors are deployed for measuring temperature and
    humidity in terms of temperature in degree centigrade and relative humidity (%).
    III. AC water pump53 AC water pump (0.5 hp) is used for supplying the water to
    the plantations from water resources. IV. NodeMCU54 NodeMCU is intended to have
    an inbuilt Wi-Fi chip (ESP8266) for interacting with an open-source platform during
    the designing of the hardware system. V. Solenoid valve55 A solenoid valve is
    utilized for regulating the flow of water so that the pump can be automatically
    ON/OFF. VI. DC power supply56 A DC power supply is also used for giving the DC
    electrical power to sensor nodes, which can drive the sensors, microcontrollers,
    and so forth. VII. Router57 The router is utilized for WAN connections, which
    can send data in small pockets, properly. By connecting to the internet, data
    can be forwarded using the IoT method. VIII. Relay (double channel)58 The relay
    (double channel) is used for switching the appropriate action during the ON/OFF
    operation of the automatic irrigation system. IX Android studio59 Android Studio
    is used which has the inbuilt capability for an integrated development environment
    (IDE). The code can be written in Java developer tools. X. ThingSpeak IoT cloud
    platform60 The ThingSpeak IoT cloud platform is utilized for storing and processing
    data. This can be shown in a massively scalable real-time event processing engine.
    The user can register in the ThingSpeak cloud by creating a login user account.
    Further, new channels can be created for visualization of sensor data of the particular
    field where two types of application programming interface (API) keys such as
    READ API keys and WRITE API keys are used for read and write purposes so that
    the thing speaks IoT cloud platform is used operation of automatic irrigation
    systems. 4 FLOW PROCESS OF MQTT PROTOCOL FOR IOT-ENABLED COMMUNICATION METHODOLOGY
    The soil monitoring system for smart irrigation is designed using a water pump,
    soil moisture, humidity and temperature, and MQTT communication protocol along
    with NodeMCU. This microcontroller has a Wi-Fi facility, and MQTT protocol is
    used for receiving the signal and transmitting the message from sensors. This
    provides the information on soil and NodeMCU allows to operate the water pump
    accordingly through a web page where the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module is integrated. The
    major advantages of the MQTT protocol are that it is cost-effective and provides
    communication in a faster manner. The flow process of the MQTT protocol for IoT-enabled
    communication methodology is shown in Figure 3. The soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity sensors are connected to the NodeMCU microcontroller, which sends
    data to the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. The Tx and Rx pin of ESP8266 is connected to
    data respective transmitting and receiving pins in NodeMCU. It should be ensured
    that the input voltage of ESP8266 must be 3.0 VDC. Further, Afterward, the data
    are massaged to MQTT again through the ThingSpeak IoT platform for visualization
    and storage of data for analytics. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Flow
    process for MQTT protocol for IoT-enabled communication methodology. During the
    development of the testing setup, there are four NodeMCU devices acting as slaves,
    and each slave is connected to a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, as well
    as a moisture sensor. The circuit diagram is shown in Figure 4. Additionally,
    there is one master NodeMCU connected to a relay and a pump. The master and slave
    devices are connected to the cloud. Here is a description of the connection. FIGURE
    4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Circuit diagram of the proposed system. 4.1
    Slave NodeMCUs There are four NodeMCU devices acting as slaves in the system.
    Each slave NodeMCU is connected to a DHT11 sensor and a moisture sensor. The DHT11
    sensor measures temperature and humidity, while the moisture sensor detects the
    moisture level in a particular area. Each slave NodeMCU is responsible for reading
    the data from its respective sensors and sending that data to the master NodeMCU.
    The slaves can communicate with the master NodeMCU over the network, typically
    using protocols like MQTT and HTTP. 4.2 Master NodeMCU There is one NodeMCU device
    acting as the master in the system. The master NodeMCU is connected to a relay
    and a pump. It receives data from the slave NodeMCUs, which includes temperature,
    humidity, and moisture readings from the sensors. Based on the received data,
    the master NodeMCU can make decisions and control the relay and pump accordingly.
    For example, if the moisture level is low, indicating a need for watering, the
    master NodeMCU can activate the relay to turn on the pump and water the plants.
    4.3 Cloud connection Both the master and slave NodeMCUs are connected to the cloud.
    Cloud connectivity allows the devices to communicate with each other over the
    internet, even if they are physically located in different places. The connection
    to the cloud can be established using various protocols like MQTT and HTTP and
    other IoT-specific protocols. 5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS To develop a smart IoT-enabled
    drip irrigation system, a small pilot project plant for the cultivation of lemongrass
    is being developed as shown in Figure 5. The environmental sensors like soil,
    humidity, and temperatures are installed as per requirement. These sensors are
    integrated with a NodeMCU microcontroller and support items in a control box unit,
    which send the signal by operating voltage of 5 VDC. A 0.5 hp AC pump is also
    installed for supplying the water as per requirement from the storage water source.
    The water supply to cultivated land through the drip pipe system. During the operation
    of the pump, the sensors acquire the soil, temperature, and humidity data, which
    are processed to the IoT cloud using the ThingSpeak platform via a web server.
    A web application is also intended to use an Android application for monitoring
    and controlling the smart automatic drip irrigation system especially lemongrass
    so that all data can be monitored and control processes can also be done accordingly.
    AC pump is attached to a water pond arrangement for supplying the appropriate
    amount of water from the natural pond. The water pump will automatically begin
    and start to send water to the agricultural estate as per the soil conditions.
    The soil condition is identified using the different sensors which are inserted
    in soil closer to lemongrass plants where the threshold value of soil condition
    according to the environment is adjusted in NodeMCU microcontroller through programming.
    Therefore, the water pump operates as per necessity from time to time automatically.
    The information about the soil and environmental conditions is collected from
    different sensors like soil moisture, humidity, and temperature in the cloud.
    The information is processed and accordingly, the microcontroller, via the IoT
    cloud operates the water pump through a relay. The soil moisture sensors sense
    the soil condition using two coated metal rods that can be inserted into the grassland.
    Further, the web application is linked with the NodeMCU microcontroller for obtaining
    the soil and other parameters. These signals are identified using the Android
    application which supports the computer user interface. This IoT-enabled automatic
    drip irrigation system is developed by combining the hardware and software linked
    together with serial communication ports via the NodeMCU microcontrollers to transmit
    data from one device to another wirelessly and monitoring can be done. For operating
    the system, a program is written in Arduino Software (IDE) and the flow chart
    is shown in Figure 6. At first, all nodes are physically connected to the hardware.
    An internet connection is also provided. For connecting in an IoT environment,
    the MQTT protocol is applied. The sensor soil moisture, humidity, and temperature
    sensors read the soil conditions and humidity and temperature at all four node
    points then it is sent to the IoT cloud through MQTT protocols. Here, the threshold
    value for each sensor case is set at 1024 m3 m−3. This process will be continued
    until the whole crop land gets enough water. Further, these data will be uploaded
    to the IoT cloud using the ThingSpeak platform, which is stored for establishing
    the analytics. FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Testing setup for automatic
    irrigation system using IoT technique. FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Flowchart of the automatic irrigation system. For building the web application
    app, an Android/web page is deliberated using a ThingSpeak IoT cloud platform
    as shown in Figure 7. The ThingSpeak is a viable IoT cloud platform that can be
    utilized for the progression of the data, visualization, storage, and analysis
    of real-time data. This can also provide messages to user mobile via web server
    management. During operation, the data are sent using NodeMCU in the web server.
    A login page is also designed within the web page, which is integrated with the
    Uniform Resource Locator (URL), and it opens by providing the appropriate credentials.
    After identifying the credentials, the operation of the smart drip irrigation
    page is opened, and sensor data can be visualized after proper activation via
    NodeMCU and gateways. As per the user instructions, an Android app is handled
    where the user/client can operate and control the water pump operation and handle
    the smart automatic drip irrigation system as per the requirement remotely. The
    data can be visualized accordingly. As a result, smart automatic drip irrigation
    systems can remotely be handled through an Android phone from anywhere. FIGURE

    IoT cloud platform. After monitoring the crop condition in real-time using the
    IoT cloud platform, the experimental data of each sensor is also collected as
    given in Table 3. The experimental performance of the soil moisture conditions
    of each sensor node is analyzed as shown in Figure 8. It shows that the pump supplies
    the water automatically when each soil sensor node value is less than the threshold
    values. TABLE 3. The experimental data of each soil moisture sensor. Time (min)

    Experimental performance of each soil moisture sensor. Further, the experimental
    performance of each soil moisture sensor node is also analyzed as shown in Figures
    9-11–12. From this analysis, it is found that each soil moisture sensor covers
    wetness in said respective marked area as green color by soil moisture sensor
    1 (as Figure 9), yellow color by soil moisture sensor 2 (as Figure 10), blue color
    by soil moisture sensor 3 (as Figure 11) and magenta color by soil moisture sensor
    4 (as Figure 12) after the operating the pump automatically. FIGURE 9 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Soil moisture sensor 1 covers wetness in the said green
    color marked area. FIGURE 10 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Soil moisture sensor
    2 covers wetness in the said yellow color marked area. FIGURE 11 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Soil moisture sensor 3 covers wetness in the said blue color
    marked area. FIGURE 12 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Soil moisture sensor 4
    covers wetness in the said purple color marked area. Testing has been done for
    8 h, and data are added and graphs are plotted again from Figures 8–12. From Figure
    8, it is envisaged that the behavior for soil condition shows repeated behavior
    after 4 h because the moisture content is less as compared to the required condition.
    Therefore, the pump will be “on.” Further, after 4 h, the pump will be again “on.”
    This behavior will repeat as per requirement. Figures 9-12 show that soil content
    is present for 8 h (which means a full day) so that the lemongrass crop acquires
    sufficient water for growth in the field. In Figure 10, the temperature behavior
    is plotted for 8 h, which shows the temperature rises from 27°C to 41°C up to
    the afternoon. At the end of the day, the temperature is around 31°C. During the
    operation of the water pump, the temperatures are also recorded as shown in Figure
    13. The temperature of the environments shows that it is also increased range
    from 27°C to 40°C because this is recorded in the month of April in the afternoon.
    FIGURE 13 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Temperature of the environments during
    pump operations. The experimental data for IoT-based network signal is obtained
    from Master NodeMCU and plotted as shown in Figure 14. This shows that the master
    NodeMCU continuously monitors the network signal in dBm where the network signal
    is measured in terms of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value in
    dBm from each slave node to assess the quality of their signal connections. This
    RSSI is a parameter used to measure the signal strength between devices in a wireless
    network. This value also represents the strength of the Wi-Fi signal it receives
    from the access point and each slave NodeMCU device. FIGURE 14 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Performance of IoT-based network signal for soil monitoring
    toward automatic drip irrigation. Further, a comparison between MQTT and HTTP
    protocol while sending the data is carried out as given in Table 4. The performance
    shows that the MQTT protocol sends data within 48 s to the IoT cloud so that the
    data can be acquired in a faster manner. TABLE 4. Comparison between MQTT and
    HTTP protocols. S. no. Protocol Processing time (s) Node 1 Node 2 Node 3 Node
    4 1. MQTT 15 16 31 48 2. HTTP 20 241 363 495 From these experimental performances,
    it is envisaged that a WSN using NodeMCU is developed where NodeMCU can help in
    establishing wireless communications by creating different nodes. By applying
    different protocols (MQTT and HTTP), it is observed that each node can acquire
    a communication range between 15 and 48 s, which is faster as compared to the
    HTTP protocol. Therefore, the soil moisture sensor, humidity sensor, and temperature
    sensor are easily transmitted in the cloud using the ThingSpeak IoT platform where
    the experimental data are stored. The automation of irrigation is done using a
    user-friendly mobile app for monitoring and controlling crop fields from anywhere.
    The novelty of this paper is highlighted point-wise. A soil monitoring system
    using WSN is developed where the different protocols such as HTTP and MQTT protocols
    are applied with the application of IoT technique where MQTT protocol provides
    the faster response as compared to HTTP protocol. Remote monitoring and controlling
    capabilities using WSN have been demonstrated where the soil moisture, humidity,
    and temperature conditions are obtained at different conditions, which can help
    the farmers with automatic irrigation systems. By conducting different experimental
    trials, the soil conditions are analyzed at different conditions which can help
    in crop cultivation, especially lemongrass crops. For comparison with currently
    published works, Pereira et al61 have reported on IoT-enabled smart drip irrigation
    systems using the ESP32 Wi-Fi communication module, whereas our work is carried
    out using the ESP8266 Wi-Fi communication module. The major advantages of our
    work are that the ESP8266 Wi-Fi communication module can communicate in a faster
    manner, with low cost and less energy consumption as compared to the ESP32 Wi-Fi
    communication module. As well, my previous work focused only on the HTTP protocol
    for sending the data through the data fusion method.62 During sending data, the
    time was taken more, whereas this paper is attempted on different protocols such
    as HTTP and MQTT protocols with multiple nodes through WSN. The major advantages
    of the proposed method are that faster communication can be obtained and data
    are also stored in the IoT cloud easily for data analytics. This is also part
    of the novelty of this paper. 6 CONCLUSIONS In this paper, a novel soil monitoring
    system using a WSN for automatic irrigation systems is designed where an IoT technique
    is applied for sending and storing data in the IoT cloud. The node MCU microcontroller
    is used for wireless cloud network systems where communications have been done
    wirelessly using the MQTT protocol. This provides a faster response while uploading
    the data. During experimentation, the soil sensor data are successfully uploaded
    to the IoT cloud which is remotely accessed using a mobile phone. An appropriate
    quantity of water is supplied to the lemongrass plants of the agricultural field
    using a pump automation process. The health of lemongrass plants is observed from
    anywhere using an Android mobile phone. This offers an affordable solution for
    supplying a sufficient amount of water to manage agricultural cultivation land
    effectively. By developing the testing prototype, it is demonstrated that the
    use of such network systems/applications can facilitate a variety of plant harvesting
    processes. This kind of system can be employed in a variety of small land, open
    space cultivation, different plantations, crop cultivation, and so forth. Hence,
    it is concluded that soil monitoring using WSNs and IoT techniques can be effectively
    used for automatic irrigation systems which is a promising technique in the precision
    agriculture field. The futuristic work will be focused on the measurement of the
    pH value of soil and the measurement of soil nutrition condition using NPK sensors
    so that fertilization of soil can be done to enhance crop health. The mapping
    can be done for the uniform growth of plants in the field. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The

  description: Now-a-days, the natural irrigation system is under pressure due to
    the growing water shortages, which are mainly caused by population growth and
    climate change. Therefore, the control of water resources to increase the allocation
    of retained water is very important. It has been observed in the last two decades,
    especially in the Indian sub-continent, the change of climate affects the agricultural
    crops production significantly. However, the prediction of good harvests before
    harvesting, enables the farmers as well as the government officials to take appropriate
    measures of marketing and storage of crops. Some strategies for predicting and
    modelling crop yields have been developed, although they do not take into account
    the characteristics of climate, and they are empirical in nature. In the proposed
    system, a Cuckoo Search Algorithm has been developed, allowing the allocation
    of water for farming under any conditions. The various parameters such as temperature,
    turbidity, pH., moisture have been collected by using Internet of Things (IoT)
    platform, equipped with related sensors and wireless communication systems. In
    this IoT platform the sensor data have been displayed in the cloud environment
    by using ThingSpeak. The data received in the ThingSpeak used in the proposed
    Cuckoo Search Algorithm, allowing the selection of appropriate crops for particular
    soil.

    the natural irrigation system is under pressure due to the growing water shortages,
    which are mainly caused by population growth and climate change. Therefore, the
    control of water resources to increase the allocation of retained water is very
    important. It has been observed in the last two decades, especially in the Indian
    sub-continent, the change of climate affects the agricultural crops production
    significantly. However, the prediction of good harvests before harvesting, enables
    the farmers as well as the government officials to take appropriate measures of
    marketing and storage of crops. Some strategies for predicting and modelling crop
    yields have been developed, although they do not take into account the characteristics
    of climate, and they are empirical in nature. In the proposed system, a Cuckoo
    Search Algorithm has been developed, allowing the allocation of water for farming
    under any conditions. The various parameters such as temperature, turbidity, pH.,
    moisture have been collected by using Internet of Things (IoT) platform, equipped
    with related sensors and wireless communication systems. In this IoT platform
    the sensor data have been displayed in the cloud environment by using ThingSpeak.
    The data received in the ThingSpeak used in the proposed Cuckoo Search Algorithm,

    Agriculture Monitoring System Using IoT Chapter © 2024 23.1 Introduction Internet
    of Things (IoT) is a system of heterogeneous things such as mechanical and electrical
    computing devices, objects, animals and people. These things are used to connect
    each other to collect, send and act on to acquire data without human intervention.
    IoT architecture consists of four stages as shown in Fig. 23.1. In the first stage,
    sensor and actuators are used to collect the information from the environment.
    These can be wired or wireless devices. Second stage consists of gateways and
    data acquisition systems which are used to collect data from multiple sensor and
    control of devices. The third stage consists of an edge IoT which is used to pre-process
    the data received from second stage to analyze it. The fourth stage deals with
    storage of data received from the third stage in cloud. Further, the data analytics
    at cloud is used by various applications like smart grid, business intelligence,
    etc. Many researchers have been used IoT-based monitoring system in various applications
    as shown in Fig. 23.2. IoT-based smart city was developed to monitor water pollution,
    street lighting, video surveillance and electricity management [1]. Fig. 23.1
    IoT architecture Full size image Fig. 23.2 IoT applications Full size image Slope
    stability monitoring was done using zigbee-based wireless data acquisition system
    in opencast coal mine in south India [2]. IoT-based smart medical service system
    was developed to improve the efficiency of diagnosis process and resources utilization
    in medical field [3]. IoT-based smart energy-efficient home automation system
    was developed to control the home appliances [4]. Intrusion detection system was
    developed to monitor malicious activities based on IoT and genetic algorithm [5].
    Dummy projects have demonstrated in IoT [6]. A detailed survey has provided on
    architecture, protocols and the enabling technologies for an urban IoT [7]. IoT
    application are not limited to one particular field. It has shown the significant
    contribution from small-scale applications to the large-scale applications such
    as e-commerce [8], coal mine [9], wearable device [10] and smart grid [11]. Agriculture
    is one of the most important sectors which occupies major share in Indian economy
    growth. Its 80% population depends on agriculture as their source of livelihood.
    The global population is going to reach around 9 billion mark by 2050, and traditional
    farming methods will not be sufficient to feed the fast growth of population throughout
    the world [12]. To meet the requirements of such a large population, countries
    throughout the world must adopt smart farming [13]. Smart farming is IoT-based
    modern agriculture concept to increase the production and improve the farming
    conditions. In this paper, an investigation has taken up to reduce the usage of
    water in traditional method of farming with the concept of smart farming based
    on IoT. A prototype of smart water management system is developed to reduce the
    usage of water in the crop field. 23.2 Proposed System In this study, a prototype
    of irrigation system based on IoT is developed. It consists of three units such
    as sensing unit, controller unit and data processing unit as shown in Fig. 23.3.
    Fig. 23.3 IoT-based water management system in agriculture Full size image Sensing
    unit consists of soil moisture and DHT11 sensors which are used to sense the crop
    environmental data such as soil moisture, temperature and humidity. Soil moisture
    sensor is a device which senses the moisture content in soil in the crop field
    and sends to the microcontroller unit which is shown in Fig. 23.4. The moisture
    data is used to control the water pump ON/OFF. DHT11 sensor is used to monitor
    the humidity and temperature and send the data to the controller unit which is
    shown in Fig. 23.5. Fig. 23.4 Soil moisture sensor Full size image Fig. 23.5 Temperature
    and humidity (DHT11) sensor Full size image Microcontroller unit is heart of the
    system and used to act as bridge between sensing unit and processing unit. ESP8266E
    module is an integrated with low-power microcontroller unit with inbuilt Wi-Fi
    support as shown in Fig. 23.6. It consists of a 10-bit A/D converter and TCP/IP
    protocol stack. It is used for the integration of sensing unit and read the sensors
    data and convert the data to the required format using analog-to-digital (A/D)
    converter. The data is sent to cloud for further analysis. Relay and water motor
    are connected to microcontroller. Relay is used to control water pump. Fig. 23.6
    Block diagram of ESP8266 Full size image ThingSpeak is an open-source IoT platform
    which is used to visualize, process and analyses the live data received from microcontroller
    unit and sensing unit. 23.3 Experimental Work A prototype of smart water management
    is developed as shown in Fig. 23.7. Soil moisture is installed to find moisture
    quantity in soil and send to the ESP8266NodeMCU. It is an analog sensor, and an
    ADC is used to convert its values into digital form. Fig. 23.7 Deployment of prototype
    of smart water management Full size image Moisture data is visualized, processed
    and analyzed in ThingSpeak cloud platform. If moisture value is above threshold
    level, relay is used to switch OFF the water motor. If moisture value is below
    the threshold level, then water motor automatically switched ON by relay. DHT11
    is a digital sensor which is connected to ESP8266. It is used to sense the temperature
    and humidity of field area and send to the cloud for further processing. The graphical
    representation of collected temperature data by DT11 sensor on daily basis can
    be visualized using ThingSpeak platform which is shown in Fig. 23.8. Fig. 23.8
    DHT11 sensor data in ThingSpeak Full size image 23.4 Conclusion In this paper,
    an IoT-based smart water management system is developed to sense the soil moisture,
    temperature and humidity level to utilize the resources such as water and human
    intervention in the crop field effectively. All these sensor values are sent to
    the ThingSpeak cloud platform using Wi-Fi. This system is used to save the water
    by controlling the water motor. The sensor values can be seen from anywhere from
    the world using ThingSpeak IoT cloud platform. Declaration We have taken permission

    The water pump on the receiver end irrigates the plant according to its requirements.
    The high-power LEDs in the grow lights simulate the process of photosynthesis,
    which helps to improve plant growth efficiency. The sensor data can also be transferred

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Salem, India SECTION I. Introduction Farming
    is the largest consumer of water resources globally, accounting for a significant
    portion of total freshwater usage. Unfortunately, the traditional approach to
    irrigation is often inefficient, low-value, and heavily subsidized by governments
    and donors. This has led to a reevaluation of the economic, social, and environmental
    impacts of publicly funded irrigation projects. In the past, domestic irrigation
    dominated agricultural budgets worldwide, but in today''s world, farming faces
    stiff competition for limited water resources. As such, the future of irrigation
    and agriculture lies in finding innovative ways to use water more efficiently
    and sustainably. Such practices will not only benefit the farmers but also help
    to reduce the economic, social, and environmental impact of agriculture on the
    world. Smart irrigation or automated irrigation systems have gained popularity
    recently. Smart irrigation is a technique for conserving water in irrigation by
    utilizing science and technology. It has multiple controls, soil sensors, and
    weather sensors. The sensor keeps track of the real ground humidity and the current
    weather conditions, and the controller decides whether to open or shut the water
    valve. Scientific assessment is used in automated irrigation to determine the
    amount, timing, and need of water. It is appropriate for managing water-saving
    practices in lawns, agricultural land, landscapes, and other regions. These kinds
    of works contribute towards saving water resources. Considering the rise in global
    temperatures over the last decade, water has become a particularly valuable resource
    for the industry of farming. In addition to that, the unfavorable weather conditions
    tend to affect plants and crops in agricultural fields. Even, smart irrigation
    systems do not protect the plants and crops from harsh weather conditions. The
    conventional periodic watering methods still dominate the farming landscape, leading
    to wastage of the valuable resource like water and exposing plants to harsh weather
    conditions. To address this problem, this proposed method aims to implement an
    analysis of the field based on factors such as temperature, humidity, and soil
    moisture content. The proposed work also follows Precision Irrigation system where
    plants are grown only under monitored conditions with grow lights. The grow lights
    are high power LEDs which produces light with appropriate wavelength which is
    suitable for plant''s growth. This work aims to address the challenges facing
    modern agriculture by utilizing smart technologies to optimize water usage and
    improve crop yields. By monitoring key environmental factors like temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture content, the system ensures that plants receive the
    right amount of water and nutrients to thrive. Additionally, plants are protected
    even in harsh weather conditions due to artificial farming. Additionally, by using
    high-power LED grow lights that mimic natural sunlight, can provide plants with
    the ideal spectrum and intensity of light for their growth and development. By
    combining these innovative technologies, this work contributes to the ongoing
    efforts to make agriculture more sustainable and efficient for farmers and communities
    around the world. The ease of use of the technique proposed by this study is followed:
    Automated process: The system follows automated process for farming ranging from
    measuring the necessary parameters to irrigation of the plants. It allows users
    to easily interact with the system, view the parameters of the plants, and irrigation
    is done as and when required. This can help reduce the manual intervention and
    automate the irrigation process. Real-time performance: The system should be designed
    to achieve real-time performance, so that it can irrigate the plants as when needed
    in real time. This can help farmers to grow crops efficiently without the wastage
    of resources and also improves the efficiency of the plant''s growth. High accuracy:
    The system should be designed to achieve high accuracy and robustness under varying
    conditions, so that users can rely on the system to make accurate farming and
    monitoring. This can help to reduce the wastage of resources like water and improve
    the growth process of plants. LoRa Integration with artificial farming: The Precision
    Irrigation is designed to integrate with LoRa based farming system, so that the
    farming process is not only automated but also increases its efficiency through
    artificial grow lights. This can help to improve the method of farming, its monitoring
    and plant''s growth. By considering these factors, a system for LoRa based Precision
    Irrigation and monitoring can be designed to be easy to use, efficient, and effective
    for improving the farming method as well as the growth of the plants. This introduction
    briefly describes the research question and its importance. To further contextualize
    the topic, let us turn to a literature review, followed by methodology and system
    architecture, experimental design, experimental results, conclusions, future improvements,
    and references. SECTION II. Literature Survey The LoRa-based wireless smart irrigation
    system that aims to improve water usage efficiency in agriculture. The system
    utilizes LoRa technology for communication between the nodes, which provides a
    long-range, low-power, and low-cost communication solution. The authors developed
    a prototype that integrates sensors for measuring soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity, and a water pump for irrigation. The system is designed to operate
    autonomously and allows for remote monitoring and control through a web interface.
    The proposed system is an improvement on traditional irrigation systems that are
    often inefficient and consume large amounts of water. By using sensor data to
    provide precise and targeted irrigation, the system reduces water consumption
    while maintaining plant health. The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of
    their system through experimental testing and reported significant water savings.
    Although the system provides an efficient solution for irrigation, it lacks the
    ability to control other environmental factors that affect plant growth, such
    as light. In contrast, this study incorporates the use of grow lights that can
    be controlled to provide artificial light conditions to plants, enabling year-round
    indoor farming and increased crop yield. Additionally, the system includes precision
    irrigation that not only saves water but also provides targeted fertilization
    to optimize plant growth. These unique features make this study a valuable contribution
    to the field of precision agriculture. [1] The study presents the design and development
    of a low-cost smart irrigation system using an Arduino microcontroller and a soil
    moisture sensor. The system is equipped with a water pump that is controlled by
    the microcontroller based on the readings from the soil moisture sensor. The authors
    also developed a mobile application that allows farmers to remotely monitor and
    control the irrigation process. The study highlights the advantages of using IoT-based
    smart irrigation systems, such as the ability to reduce water wastage, increase
    crop yield, and reduce labor costs. The authors conducted experiments to evaluate
    the system''s performance in terms of water consumption and crop yield. The results
    showed that the system was effective in reducing water consumption and improving
    crop yield. Overall, the study provides an insightful overview of the development
    and implementation of a smart irrigation system for precision farming. However,
    the study does not discuss any specific features that supports or protects the
    growth of plants which was implemented in the proposed system. [2] The research
    study titled “A Feasible IoT-Based System for Precision Agriculture” presents
    a feasible IoT-based system for precision agriculture. The authors discuss the
    current challenges in precision agriculture such as the lack of real-time monitoring
    and decision-making systems. The proposed system uses various sensors to monitor
    environmental parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. The
    data is then transmitted to a cloud-based platform for storage and analysis. The
    system also includes a mobile application for farmers to access real-time information
    and make informed decisions. The authors provide experimental results that demonstrate
    the effectiveness of the proposed system. The study contributes to the field of
    precision agriculture by providing a feasible IoT-based solution that can help
    farmers improve crop yield and reduce resource usage. [3] The proposed study “Sensors
    and Communication Protocols for Precision Agriculture” by Nelson José Chapungo
    and Octavian Postolache presents an overview of the state-of-the-art in sensors
    and communication protocols used in precision agriculture. The authors begin by
    describing the main challenges faced in modern agriculture, including the need
    to increase productivity while minimizing the impact on the environment. The authors
    then present a comprehensive review of the different types of sensors used in
    precision agriculture, including soil moisture, temperature, and pH sensors, as
    well as crop growth and health sensors. The authors also discuss different wireless
    communication protocols, such as ZigBee and LoRa, that can be used to transmit
    sensor data in real-time. [4] In this study, the authors present a study on IoT-enabled
    intelligent irrigation systems for precision agriculture using deep learning neural
    networks. The proposed system is designed to monitor and control the irrigation
    process based on the soil moisture level and weather conditions. The authors propose
    a two-layer neural network model for predicting the optimal irrigation time and
    duration. The system includes various sensors for monitoring the soil moisture
    level, temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors. The authors also
    propose a cloud-based IoT platform for real-time data processing and analysis.
    The proposed system is expected to reduce water consumption and increase crop
    yield, making it an efficient and cost-effective solution for precision agriculture.
    The study demonstrates the potential of deep learning neural networks in improving
    the accuracy and efficiency of precision agriculture systems. [5] This research
    study presents a wireless sensor network (WSN) architecture that uses low-power
    wide area network technology for high-tech agriculture. By leveraging this WSN,
    farmers can collect essential data related to soil moisture, air temperature,
    and humidity. The WSN comprises two wireless sensor nodes, a gateway, a cloud
    server, and a smartphone app. The researchers evaluated data transmission in two
    different zones, namely zone 1 at a distance of 500m and zone 2 (urban environments
    with fewer barriers) at a distance of 1,500m and 1,700m. The system collects and
    updates the data every 15 minutes, providing farmers with real-time information
    throughout the day. According to the findings, the LoRa server received data updates
    continuously, and no data packet loss was observed in the WSN system. Moreover,
    the researchers examined the power consumption of sensor nodes and gateways in
    transmitting, receiving, and turning off modes, showcasing the benefits of LoRa
    technology in creating wireless sensor networks. The long transmission range and
    low power requirements of LoRa technology make it a promising solution for the
    agriculture industry. [6] In this study, the system is built on a LoRaWAn network,
    which enables long-distance and low-power data transfer from sensor nodes to cloud
    services. The cloud service system uses data streams for analytics, making it
    extremely scalable. The proposed system has been demonstrated in a case study
    involving a grape farm, where early findings were presented. By using this system,
    farmers can easily monitor environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity,
    and soil moisture to ensure optimal crop growth. This allows them to make informed
    decisions and adjustments, leading to higher crop yields and reduced resource
    waste. Furthermore, the scalability and flexibility of the proposed system make
    it suitable for implementation in various agricultural settings, paving the way
    for more efficient and sustainable agriculture practices in the future. [7] This
    study proposed an intelligent agriculture service platform using LoRa-based wireless
    sensor networks (WSNs). The proposed platform aims to provide real-time monitoring
    of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light
    intensity to help farmers make informed decisions for crop management. The system
    is composed of two main components: the wireless sensor nodes and the server.
    The wireless sensor nodes use LoRaWAn technology to transmit data to the server,
    where the data is processed and analyzed. The proposed platform also includes
    a mobile application that allows farmers to remotely access and monitor the data
    collected by the sensors. The authors conducted experiments to evaluate the performance
    of the proposed system and showed that it provides accurate and timely information
    to farmers, thus enabling them to take proactive measures for crop management.
    [8] This study proposes an automatic plant irrigation system using the Arduino
    microcontroller. The system comprises a soil moisture sensor that detects the
    moisture level in the soil and triggers the irrigation process accordingly. The
    Arduino microcontroller receives data from the sensor and activates the water
    pump to irrigate the plants. The system is designed to operate at specific time
    intervals, allowing for controlled irrigation of the plants. The authors conducted
    experiments to test the system''s performance under different soil moisture conditions
    and evaluated the system''s effectiveness in maintaining appropriate moisture
    levels in the soil. The findings demonstrated that the proposed system is efficient,
    cost-effective, and can be easily implemented to automate plant irrigation processes.
    The system is particularly useful in areas where water is scarce or expensive,
    enabling farmers to use water resources more efficiently and increase crop yield.
    This study highlights the potential of using low-cost microcontrollers, such as
    the Arduino, in developing automated plant irrigation systems for precision agriculture.
    [9] In this study, the system is designed to monitor the moisture level of the
    soil and activate the irrigation process when the moisture level falls below a
    certain threshold. The system is composed of a moisture sensor, a microcontroller,
    a motor pump, and a water tank. The moisture sensor is used to measure the moisture
    level of the soil, and the microcontroller is used to control the irrigation process
    based on the moisture level readings. The motor pump is used to draw water from
    the water tank and irrigate the plants. This system is highly efficient and it
    eliminates the need for manual irrigation. The authors have tested the system
    and demonstrated its effectiveness in ensuring proper plant growth and development.
    Overall, this proposed study provides a valuable contribution to the field of
    automatic plant irrigation systems and presents a practical solution for efficient
    plant irrigation. [10] As part of the precision farming movement, the usage of
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs)in farming has gained prominence. Every farm in
    the future will have many WSN systems installed. For farming to be more efficient
    and sustainable, accurate and timely analysis of the data provided by these technologies
    will become essential. Analyzing monitoring data is typically done remotely since
    it is seen to be outside the scope of WSNs. However, the complexity of the activities
    carried out by WSNs has been steadily rising in recent years. Modern wireless
    sensors have enough processing power to provide some data analytics functions.
    The authors of this study examine the difficulties and possible advantages of
    WSN-based analytics in the context of precision farming while providing an overview
    of contemporary WSN functionality that includes a certain amount of intelligence.
    [11] This study describes about the active process of smart agriculture aids farmers
    in obtaining an overall yield. The yield depends on a variety of conditions, including
    soil moisture and humidity, temperature, and carbon monoxide in the top layer
    of the soil. This initiative is being carried out to assist farmers in boosting
    the output and profit. The node where the LoRa module and Arduino are located
    receives the measured values from the sensors, such as temperature, moisture,
    carbon, and others, and passes them on. These data are used whenever necessary
    and saved in the cloud. A water pump is simultaneously linked, and depending on
    the crop, the water is pushed using monitored values. The amount of CO in the
    soil''s top layer is the key determinant of how much water can be pumped. If there
    is an excess, the water overflows and removes the CO that is unnecessary on the
    soil''s top layer. In parallel, soil testing facilities use the measured data
    that are saved in the cloud to help farmers with their problems. This helps farmers
    achieve high yields and profits by reducing water consumption by around 50%. [12]
    This study presents the impact of climate change on the irrigation. The earth''s
    resources, particularly water, which is essential to life as it is known, are
    seriously impacted by climate change. Natural resource depletion, biodiversity
    loss, and biosphere changes are all detrimental to human health and quality of
    life. India will likely suffer warming that is greater than the world average
    during the twenty-first century. A greater seasonal variance in temperature will
    also start to affect, with winters warming up more than summers. With rising nighttime
    temperatures and hotter days in recent years, heat waves have lasted longer, and
    this tendency is predicted to continue. These heat waves will cause the summer
    monsoon precipitation to be more variable, which will have a significant impact
    on India''s agriculture industry. Global temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2)
    concentration are expected to gradually increase, according to climate models.
    However, these models struggle to accurately anticipate how the local weather
    will evolve in the future. As long as plant diseases can be managed, local meteorological
    factors like rain, temperature, sunlight, and wind, along with regionally appropriate
    plant types, cropping patterns, and soil conditions, can enhance food production.
    [13] This study proposes a wireless drip irrigation system that is based on linear
    programming to determine the optimal water quantity to be supplied to the plants.
    The system is equipped with sensors that measure the soil moisture content and
    temperature, which are then used to determine the water requirement of the plants.
    The system is designed to provide the required amount of water to the plants while
    minimizing water waste. The authors have used linear programming to optimize the
    irrigation process, which ensures that the plants receive the required amount
    of water while reducing water usage. The proposed system is an improvement over
    the traditional drip irrigation systems, which require manual intervention and
    do not provide real-time feedback. The authors have also tested the system in
    a real-world scenario and have reported positive results. However, this system
    does not have the capability of adjusting the light intensity for the plants,
    which is a unique feature of the proposed smart irrigation system. [14] The research
    study presents an innovative wireless sensor network (WSN) based irrigation system.
    The authors address the issues with traditional irrigation methods such as overwatering,
    underwatering, and uneven distribution of water to crops. The researchers propose
    a closed-loop automatic irrigation system that is controlled by a microcontroller.
    The system uses soil moisture sensors to collect data on soil moisture levels
    and determines when to irrigate crops based on these readings. The authors also
    discuss the communication protocol used in the WSN, which enables the system to
    send data to a central control unit for monitoring and control. The system''s
    design is optimized for power consumption, and the authors present experimental
    results showing that the system reduces water consumption while increasing crop
    yield. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the development of WSN-based
    irrigation systems and highlights their potential for improving agricultural practices.
    [15] SECTION III. Methodology and System Architecture LoRa based Precision Irrigation
    and monitoring system involves the use of several components. Here are some brief
    descriptions about them and the system architecture: A. Lora (long Range Radio
    technology) LoRa is a wireless communication protocol that operates in the sub-gigahertz
    frequency range (169 MHz, 433 MHz, 868 MHz, or 915 MHz), offering long-range,
    low-power communication suitable for IoT applications. It operates in the unlicensed
    radio frequency bands and offers a long-range of communication up to several kilometers,
    making it ideal for IoT applications. LoRa technology provides a highly reliable
    and secure communication network that can be used for remote monitoring and control
    of various devices, including sensors, actuators, and other IoT devices. It uses
    a spread spectrum modulation technique to enable low-power, long-range communication,
    making it an ideal choice for low-power IoT devices. LoRa uses a star topology
    network architecture, where one central device (gateway) communicates with multiple
    end devices (nodes) over the air. LoRa devices can transmit data at various data
    rates ranging from 0.3 kbps to 50 kbps, depending on the range and data payload
    requirements. LoRaWAN, which is a protocol built on top of LoRa, provides additional
    features such as encryption, authentication, and network management, making it
    suitable for large-scale IoT deployments. B. Nodemcu The NodeMCU is a powerful
    and versatile microcontroller board that is designed for Internet of Things (IoT)
    applications. It is based on the ESP8266 system-on-a-chip (SoC) and comes with
    built-in Wi-Fi connectivity, making it an ideal choice for IoT applications that
    require wireless connectivity. The NodeMCU board features a 32-bit RISC processor,
    which runs at speeds of up to 80 MHz, and is capable of handling complex tasks
    such as networking and data processing. It also comes with a variety of input/output
    (I/O) pins, including digital input/output (GPIO) pins, analog-to-digital converter
    (ADC) pins, and pulse-width modulation (PWM) pins, making it easy to interface
    with various sensors and actuators. The NodeMCU board can be programmed using
    the Arduino IDE, which provides an easy-to-use development environment for building
    IoT applications. Additionally, the NodeMCU board supports Lua scripting language,
    which allows for easy integration with cloud-based services and platforms. Overall,
    the NodeMCU board is a powerful and versatile platform that is well-suited for
    a wide range of IoT applications. C. Moisture Sensor A moisture sensor, also known
    as a soil moisture sensor, is an electronic device that measures the amount of
    water content in the soil. It is a crucial component of many agricultural and
    horticultural applications, including irrigation systems, plant growth monitoring
    systems, and hydroponics setups. The sensor works by measuring the electrical
    conductivity between two or more probes inserted into the soil. When the soil
    is dry, it has a high resistance to electrical current, whereas when it is wet,
    the resistance decreases. The sensor provides an analog or digital output that
    can be used to determine the soil moisture level and control the irrigation system
    or other related devices. The accuracy and reliability of the sensor are essential
    for proper plant growth and water management. Proper calibration and maintenance
    of the sensor are also necessary to ensure accurate and consistent readings over
    time. D. DHT11 (Digital Humidity and Temperature) Sensor The DHT11 sensor is a
    low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor that is widely used in various
    applications, including Internet of Things (IoT) applications. It is a single-wire
    sensor that communicates through a digital signal and provides accurate temperature
    and humidity measurements. The sensor has a range of -20 to 60°C for temperature
    measurement with an accuracy of ±2°C, and a humidity range of 20% to 90% with
    an accuracy of ±5%. It operates at a voltage of 3-5V DC and consumes very low
    power, making it ideal for battery-powered applications. The DHT11 sensor is widely
    available and easy to use, making it a popular choice for DIY electronics projects
    and IoT applications. E. Water Pump A water pump is an electronic device that
    is commonly used in IoT projects for transferring water from one place to another.
    The 5V DC water pump is a type of water pump that is designed to be compatible
    with low voltage systems such as those used in IoT projects. This type of pump
    typically operates at a low voltage and consumes minimal power, making it an ideal
    choice for use in low-power applications. The water pump typically contains a
    small motor that rotates an impeller, which creates a flow of water through the
    pump. The flow rate and pressure of the water can be adjusted based on the specific
    requirements of the application. The 5V DC water pump is commonly used in smart
    irrigation systems, aquaponics, and hydroponics projects to circulate water and
    deliver nutrients to plants. F. Grow Lights Grow lights, also known as high power
    LEDs, are a critical component for indoor plant growth in controlled environments.
    These lights emit a spectrum of light that is tailored to support plant growth,
    making them an essential tool for indoor gardening, hydroponic systems, and other
    applications where natural light is not available or inadequate. High power LEDs
    are known for their efficiency and low energy consumption, making them an ideal
    choice for use in IoT projects. These lights are available in a range of sizes
    and colors, including red, green, blue, and pink, which can be mixed to create
    a custom spectrum of light. Grow lights are typically used in conjunction with
    other sensors and devices to create a complete indoor plant growth system. In
    addition to supporting plant growth, these systems can also be used to control
    the timing and intensity of light exposure, allowing for precise control over
    plant growth cycles. G. Thingspeak ThingSpeak is an open-source IoT analytics
    platform that allows users to collect, store, analyze, visualize, and act on data
    from various IoT devices. It offers a highly scalable and flexible cloud infrastructure
    for IoT data management, making it an ideal choice for IoT applications. With
    ThingSpeak, users can easily create IoT applications and dashboards to monitor
    and control various IoT devices. It supports various communication protocols,
    including HTTP, HTTPS, MQTT, and TCP, making it compatible with a wide range of
    IoT devices. ThingSpeak also provides various APIs and tools for data analysis
    and visualization, allowing users to gain insights from their IoT data. The system
    architecture for LoRa based Precision Irrigation and Monitoring system can be
    divided into two nodes and several phases The LoRa based Precision Irrigation
    and monitoring system makes use of the sensors such as the soil moisture sensor,
    DHT11 sensor for measuring the necessary parameters for irrigating plants. The
    LoRa is responsible for the transmission of data from one node to another. The
    NodeMCU processes the parameters and decides if the condition is suitable for
    irrigation. So, when plants need water the NodeMCU on the sprinkler node sprinkles
    the water and it turns on the grow light when needed. Therefore, the farming system
    is fully automated and improves the growth efficiency of the plants. Fig 1: Transmitter
    node Show All Fig 2: Receiver node Show All The explanation of block diagram is
    followed Monitoring phase: The first phase involves monitoring the plant parameters
    such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, etc. Various sensors are used such
    as the Moisture sensor for measuring the effective moisture present in the soil.
    The DHT11 sensor measures the humidity and temperature. So, the sensor node takes
    care of the monitoring phase where are the necessary plant parameters are measured
    for accurate monitoring and farming. Transmission phase: In this phase, the parameters
    that are measured in the sensor node are processed on the NodeMCU and are transmitted
    using LoRa module present in the sensor node. The LoRa module which present in
    the sprinkler node receives these measurements and parameters of plants. The NodeMCU
    in the sprinkler node is now responsible for sprinkling water and lighting based
    on the received parameters of the plant. Irrigation phase: In this phase, the
    NodeMCU present in the sprinkler node looks into the parameters of the plant and
    it decides whether the condition to water the plants is attained or not. Therefore,
    based on the program, the NodeMCU checks on to the parameters and it waters the
    plants using the sprinkler and turns on the grow light as and when required. This
    automates the process of irrigation and also leads to artificial farming. Analyzing
    phase: In this phase, the growth progress of the plants is noted. Based on the
    measurements such plant''s height, enlargement of plant leaves, the plant''s growth
    is measured using various sensors. All the parameters, measurements, growth progress
    are displayed into the system through which the growth progress of the plants
    can be monitored. The experimental setup of LoRa based Precision Irrigation and
    Monitoring system consists of two nodes. These nodes are: SECTION IV. Experimental
    Setup Transmitter node Receiver node The software setup involves the usage of
    following setup: PushingBox PushBullet ThingSpeak First, the range of plants are
    selected for irrigation. Different plants grow on different kind of soil. Therefore,
    a particular type of soil is selected based on the type of plant that is selected.
    Mostly floral crops or plants are used for artificial farming. Therefore, plants
    like Hibiscus, Peace lily, Rose can be grown artificially under grow lights. Then,
    sensors are positioned in the appropriate manner to monitor the plant parameters.
    The soil moisture sensor is dipped in over the soil in order to monitor the effective
    moisture present in the soil. The DHT11 sensor is held in the atmosphere near
    the plant in order to measure the humidity and temperature. The IR sensor is held
    close to the plant which can be used to detect any changes in the plant such as
    plant height or growth, etc. Once the transmitter node is connected and compiled
    in Arduino IDE. It starts detecting the plant parameters and it waits for the
    receiving end to transmit the collected data. When receiver end is connected and
    compiled to the Arduino IDE, the LoRa on the transmitter side transmits the data
    that is stored in the NodeMCU to the LoRa on the receiver side. NodeMCU 8266 was
    used for its built-in Wi-Fi module and GPIO pins that can be programmed for input/output
    operations and other functionalities. It acts as a receiver module to control
    the sensors, water pump, and grow lights in the LoRa-based farming system project.
    The received data is processed and analyzed to determine the optimal time to water
    the field and the NodeMCU board controls the water pump and artificial grow lights
    accordingly. The sensor data is transferred to ThingSpeak IoT Cloud platform for
    remote monitoring and analysis. When the data is received in the NodeMCU of the
    receiver side, the controller looks into the parameters and check the condition
    for irrigation and artificial lights. The Artificial grow lights are held facing
    the plants. And water pipe is held near the surface of the soil. When the condition
    is very dry, the pump is turned on and the grow lights are turned on with maximum
    intensity. The process is continued based on the plant''s requirements. And the
    water pump and lights are turned off when the plant is sufficiently irrigated.
    The NodeMCU on the receiver end reads the sensor data and sends it to the LoRa
    transceiver. The LoRa transceiver transmits the data wirelessly to the LoRa transceiver
    on the transmitter end. The NodeMCU on the transmitter end receives the sensor
    data and sends it to the ThingSpeak IoT Cloud platform using the ThingSpeak library
    in Arduino IDE. The ThingSpeak platform receives the data and stores it in a channel,
    which is essentially a TSDB database called Time-Series Database. Each channel
    has a unique ID and can store up to 8 fields of data. The stored data can be accessed
    through the ThingSpeak website or mobile app, where it is displayed in a graphical
    format. Users can view real-time and historical data and set up alerts based on
    specific conditions. The PushingBox API is used to enable push notifications for
    the ThingSpeak channel. Pushbullet app is used in both PC and mobile to get desktop
    and mobile notification about the plant''s growth or changes. This allows users
    to receive alerts on their desktop or mobile devices when specific conditions
    are met, such as when the soil moisture drops below a certain threshold. In summary,
    the sensor data is transmitted wirelessly from the field to the ThingSpeak IoT
    Cloud platform, where it is stored and displayed in a graphical format. Push notifications
    can be set up to alert users when specific conditions are met, allowing for remote
    monitoring of the field in real-time. Therefore, this experimental setup helps
    to automate the irrigation process, improves plant''s growth through artificial
    grow lights and monitors the plant parameters in real-time. SECTION V. Experimental
    Result In this proposed study, the measurement of plant parameters and changes
    in the plant''s growth are shown. In this, an IoT Cloud platform called ThingSpeak
    is used for storing and analysis of plant data. These are real-time data which
    helps to monitor the plant in live and the user can keep track of the plant''s
    growth and parameters. The below-mentioned picture shows the sample output of
    the real-time parameters. Fig 3: Measurement of plant parameters Show All Fig

    are ThingSpeak output shown in graphical representation of the data collected
    from the moisture sensor, temperature sensor, humidity sensor, and growth changes
    of plants. The x-axis of each graph shows the timestamp when the data was recorded,
    and the y-axis shows the corresponding values of the sensors. The graphs provide
    an easy-to-understand visualization of the data, making it simple to track the
    plant''s growth and environmental conditions over time. The first graph shows
    the moisture level of the soil in which the plant is growing. It shows how the
    moisture level changes with time, which can help to determine whether the plant
    is receiving adequate water or not. If the moisture level is consistently low,
    it may indicate that the plant is not receiving enough water. The second graph
    shows the temperature readings from the temperature sensor. This can help to monitor
    the temperature conditions of the plant''s surroundings. If the temperature is
    consistently too high or too low, it may indicate that the plant is not in an
    ideal environment for growth. The third graph shows the humidity levels of the
    plant''s surroundings. This is important to monitor as it can affect the growth
    of the plant. If the humidity is consistently too low or too high, it may indicate
    that the plant is not in an optimal environment. Finally, the last graph shows
    the growth changes of the plant. This can provide insight into how the plant is
    responding to the conditions in which it is growing. By monitoring the growth
    of the plant over time, it can help to determine whether the environmental conditions
    are ideal or need to be adjusted. Overall, the ThingSpeak output in graphical
    format is an important tool to monitor the environmental conditions of the plant
    and track its growth progress over time. Some advantages are. Effective irrigation:
    The whole process of farming in the LoRa based Precision Irrigation and monitoring
    system is automated with the usage of sensors where plant''s parameters such as
    moisture, temperature, humidity, etc. are monitored. And based on the needs of
    the plants the resources like water and light are provided by the sprinkler node.
    This leads to effective irrigation because, there is no need for any manual intervention
    for the irrigation process and the plant is grown under favorable conditions artificially.
    Reduces the wastage of resources: Since, all the necessary parameters of the plants
    are measured, the lora system provides adequate amount of water and light as needed
    by the plants. This saves the water for future which can be used for further irrigation
    as needed by the plant. Automated system: System uses sensors for measuring the
    plant parameters and there is a separate sprinkler node which waters and light
    the plants based on the measured parameters. Therefore, there is no manual intervention
    needed for monitoring and farming the plants. The whole system is automated through
    sensors, sprinklers and grow lights. Therefore, this reduces the labour cost which
    is cost effective. Accuracy: The sensors such as the soil moisture sensor, DHT11
    sensor gives the accurate measurements of effective moisture present in the soil,
    humidity, and the temperature of the plants. This helps to properly irrigate plants
    based on the measured parameters which leads to efficient farming method. Also,
    this helps to monitor the growth progress of the plants. Wide range and coverage:
    Since, LoRa is a long-range radio communication technology. Thus, the system can
    work over wide range such as over 10 Km of distance and provides a seamless connectivity.
    Therefore, the system could work automatically for large scale farming without
    manual intervention. Increased efficiency through grow lights: The grow lights
    are the artificial electric lights which resembles the light spectrum of sunlight.
    But it is more effective than the natural sunlight for the photosynthesis process.
    The photoperiod necessary for the plant''s growth cycle is regulated. Depending
    on the type of plant, different spectrum ranges, luminous efficacy, and color
    temperatures are preferred to achieve optimal growth and yield. Using the LoRa
    based Precision Irrigation and monitoring system the user or farmer can easily
    do farming without any manual intervention, because the whole system is automated
    from monitoring to Precision Irrigation of plants. Therefore, the system doesn''t
    only focus on irrigation but also increases the growth efficiency of the plants
    SECTION VI. Conclusion and Future Enhancement The LoRa based Precision Irrigation
    and monitoring system have two significant applications of technology in the field
    of farming and agriculture. The LoRa based farming system is used to monitor the
    parameters of the plants such as soil moisture, humidity, temperature, etc. using
    various sensors. The LoRa module is used to transmit the monitored data or parameters
    to the sprinkler nodes. The ESP8266 NodeMCU microcontroller guides the sensor
    and sprinkler node. When NodeMCU monitors the parameters and determines whether
    the plant needs water or not. When there is a need the NodeMCU on the sprinkler
    node turns on the water grow light as needed by the plants. This automates the
    process of irrigation and also monitors the growth of the plant. The Precision
    Irrigation system makes sure grow lights which are artificial electric lights
    that is comparable to the natural sunlight. However, the light from the grow light
    is more efficient in inducing the photosynthesis process faster than natural sunlight.
    This is because, the photoperiod necessary for the plant''s growth cycle is regulated.
    Depending on the type of plant, different spectrum ranges, luminous efficacy,
    and color temperatures are preferred to achieve optimal growth and yield. Therefore,
    the system not only automates the irrigation process but also improves the growth
    efficiency of the plants. Therefore, the proposed IoT-based smart grow light irrigation
    system provides an efficient solution to indoor gardening, ensuring healthy plant
    growth by providing optimal lighting conditions. The system incorporates NodeMCU
    that integrates with various sensors and a cloud platform to monitor and control
    the lighting and environmental parameters of the plants. The system has been tested
    and evaluated, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in
    providing optimal growth conditions for the plants. Thus, the LoRa based Precision
    Irrigation and monitoring system are significant technological advancements in
    the field of farming that could greatly enhance the quality of life. The future
    enhancements are as follow: Increased accuracy: This systems'' accuracy is a major
    area for development. Additional sensors can be used to monitor the external factors
    for the agricultural fields in order to avoid any discrepancy or deterioration
    in the measurement of parameters. This will improve the reading and measurement
    of plant parameters which can result in accurate data that can be used for proper
    irrigation of the plants. Increased compatibility: The proposed system can be
    extended to support more plant species and optimized lighting conditions for each
    plant type. The integration of more advanced sensors and algorithms can improve
    the efficiency of the system and further automate the process of plant growth
    monitoring and control. The system can also be integrated with other smart home
    devices, providing a complete smart home gardening solution. Additionally, the
    system''s cloud platform can be enhanced to provide more comprehensive data analytics
    and insights for better decision-making in indoor gardening. Integration with
    Agri-bots: Agri-bots are IoT robots that are used for agriculture. The whole process
    of agriculture can be automated, ranging from seeding the plants, weeding unwanted
    pests from the plants, irrigating, watering, harvesting, and monitoring the crops,
    etc. This might make the project expensive but it will be helpful for the large-scale
    farming where the process must be fully automated. Anomaly detection: This feature
    will be helpful when there occurs any anomaly in the agricultural fields. Such
    as sometimes the crops might be destroyed by animals such as cattle, and insects
    like bees, wasps might affect the plant''s growth. Therefore, any anomaly in the
    process of the agriculture is intimated to the farmers so that they can investigate
    it. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like This Gsm based solar

    I. Introduction According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
    Nations, “the world’s population is expected to grow to almost ten billion by
    2050, which requires a 60% increase in global food production” [1]. Meanwhile,
    food security is threatened by the increase in pests and diseases, lack of qualified
    labor, and climate changes [2], [3]. The rise in food demand and the challenges
    faced on the production side motivated the shift from traditional agriculture
    to smart farming (SF). SF refers to incorporating technologies in the field to
    either decrease human involvement or increase the quality and quantity of production
    yield [4]. SF and its literature have experienced an explosion in development
    that includes integrating cutting-edge technologies, such as Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) devices, advanced actuation systems, and data analytics techniques. The
    increased volume of research literature has made it difficult for individuals
    to assess the vast quantity of work to identify suitable technologies and best
    practices for a particular technology. To this extent, there have been previous
    efforts to provide an overview of different technologies in SF, such as IoT [5],
    [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19],
    data analysis and machine learning (ML) techniques [14], [18], [20], [21], [22],
    [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], sensor networks [12],
    [17], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], and intelligent actuation systems [39],
    [40], [41], [42], [43], [44]. As those papers are technology-oriented, they focus
    exclusively on providing a technical overview of the domain and/or tracking the
    most recent advancements in a field, giving little to no awareness to nonspecialists
    on technology integration guidelines. Other general survey papers focused on identifying
    trends and patterns of research on SF [45], [46], [47] or highlighting the role
    of different technologies in the agricultural industry in a particular region
    [48], [49]. A limitation of previous literature reviews is that they target researchers
    and technology developers rather than farmers and practitioners. The contribution
    of this article is to provide guidance to SF practitioners by surveying the most
    recent scientific literature and analyzing the technology integrated into SF.
    This article examines various integration options for each technology and highlights
    the key challenges faced during technology integration and the proposed solutions.
    The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section II presents the
    procedure followed to collect, organize, and analyze the literature. Section III
    shows an in-depth analysis of all technology integrated into SF literature, along
    with their key challenges and solutions. Section IV provide a discussion of systems
    that integrate multiple technologies. SECTION II. Methods This study was designed
    in accordance with the Cochrane reporting methodology for systematic review guidelines.
    The Cochrane protocol was adopted as it guarantees highly structured and transparent
    research outcomes [50]. The methodology entailed identifying the research papers
    included in the survey, preparing the documents for in- depth analysis through
    an initial assessment, and then evaluating and analyzing the literature. A search
    statement that fits a prespecified eligibility/inclusion criterion was applied
    to the IEEE database to find all relevant research papers. The inclusion criteria
    attempt to collate all documents that contribute to studying or applying new technology
    in the field of SF. To meet this criterion, a two-word search statement was used.
    The search statement comprised one word from each of the following sets: [smart,
    precession, intelligent, advanced] and [greenhouse, farming, agriculture]. Truncation
    symbols were used to ensure that plural forms and variant spellings were included
    in the results. The “all fields” option was selected in the search engine to ensure
    inclusiveness. In addition, the publication years were specified to be between
    2015 and 2021. The choice of this particular period is justified by considering
    that SF is a new phenomenon, and the older literature could be misleading in describing
    the current state of the art and research. The search statement was applied to
    the IEEE database to collect papers to be surveyed. The IEEE database was chosen
    for the quality and credibility of its scientific publications, as reflected by
    the 2020 Journal Citation Report [51]. In addition, the IEEE database provides
    access to a comprehensive source of bibliographic citations covering the scope
    of technologies in different fields, including smart agriculture. At this stage,
    2300 papers were obtained. The selection of the IEEE as the only database was
    to balance time restraints and thoroughness. Using IEEE solely is justifiable
    as it is the most extensive database for advancing technologies that guarantee
    to identify sufficient eligible studies and ensure that there is no bias. After
    an initial data set had been collected, a primary analysis has been performed
    to: 1) exclude irrelevant papers based on an exclusion criterion and 2) identify
    research themes. The exclusion criterion was set to ensure that any out-of-scope
    paper should be eliminated. The exclusion criterion was based on papers’ contributions,
    and it included papers that are not related to farming and papers that tackle
    SF from a nontechnology perspective. Papers that are not related to farming included,
    but were not limited to, documents about wind and solar farms, smart cities, animal
    welfare monitoring, and greenhouse gas emissions. Other papers that tackle SF
    from an out-of-scope perspective discuss issues such as designing platforms that
    provide advice to farmers, connecting farmers with other food industry stakeholders
    (customers and retailers), and performing social studies related to SF. The exclusion
    criteria were manually applied to filter papers out. The irrelevant papers were
    filtered manually as adding the “NOT” option in the search criteria would have
    eliminated relevant papers. After filtering the irrelevant papers, the team was
    left with 588 papers. To provide an integral view of the research activity in
    the field of SF, the primary analysis included assessing the papers to identify
    the technology they incorporate. After reviewing all documents, the most analyzed
    SF literature has provided research insight into one of the following themes:
    sensors, big data, communication, actuators and machines, and data analysis. Big
    data refer to techniques adopted to handle issues arising from the difficulties
    in storing, processing, and analyzing the enormous volume of data. After papers
    have been reviewed and tagged with them based on the technology that they incorporate,
    an exhaustive analysis was performed. All included studies were analyzed to draw
    a conclusion on all identified research themes in an impartial and objective way.
    Fig. 1 provides an insight into the structure of each of the themes found that
    will be analyzed holistically in this study. Fig. 1. Taxonomy of the SF literature.
    Show All While some of the literature researches implanting a single technology
    in the field, others show to integrate more than one technology to form a system.
    Fig. 2 shows the breakdown of literature in SF and their contribution to different
    themes and systems. Remote monitoring, automation, and decision support are examples
    of systems present in SF. Any of those systems would include at least two technologies.
    As seen in Fig. 2, the most dominant technology is sensors since they are the
    basis of any SF system. The numbers in Fig. 2 show that some papers do not fit
    in any of the identified themes, while others fall into two or more categories.
    Fig. 2. Heatmap of the SF literature. Show All SECTION III. Analysis: Enabling
    Technologies A. Sensors Sensors are integrated into SF to gather data for various
    reasons, including, but not limited to, environmental monitoring, crop quality
    monitoring, and fertilizers’ control. The deployment of sensors typically takes
    the form of sensor nodes and groups of synchronized sensors that collect data
    and send it to a destination through wireless communication. A sensor node typically
    consists of sensors, a battery, a controller, and a transceiver. A group of connected
    sensor nodes is referred to as a wireless sensor network (WSN). This section focuses
    on sensors and sensor node topologies, including key challenges and solutions
    related to deploying sensors in SF. 1) Sensor Modules: Few papers discuss novel
    sensing techniques [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59] or sensors’
    fabrication [60], [61]. The majority of literature uses commercial off-the-shelf
    sensor modules. Table I lists examples of sensors for environmental and soil-related
    measurements. The sensors listed in Table I have different measuring ranges, accuracies,
    and prices. Practitioners need to choose sensors that work best for their applications.
    An algorithm that optimizes sensor selection for a given application has been
    proposed [62]. TABLE I Commercial of the Shelf Sensor Modules Used in the SF Literature
    2) Sensor Nodes’ Placement and Interconnection in a WSN: Sensors placed in an
    agricultural field can be either stationary or remote. Remote sensors can be accomplished
    in the air through the use of a flying drone [63], [64], [65], [67] or on the
    ground via a patrolled vehicle [68], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73],
    [74], [75], [76], [77], [78], [79], [80], [81], [82], [83]. The choice between
    stationary and remote sensor networks comes with a tradeoff between flexibility
    and cost as stationary uses a fixed sensing grid, which limits reconfigurability
    but lower implementation and use cost. A mobile system can adapt to changing uses
    but has higher implementation and use costs. To guarantee the best coverage area
    for stationary sensors, a design process, which ensures that sensors are optimally
    placed, has been utilized. Typical design considerations for static sensors include
    choosing the sensor locations infield and setting a sensor network architecture.
    The two approaches for placing sensors are equal-distanced sensor placement [84],
    [85], [86], [87] and the trial-and-error method [84]. While the former is more
    common, the latter results in more accurate measurements but a longer design process
    [84]. A computational model that ensures strategic deployment of the equal-distanced
    sensor was developed in [55]. Compared to stationary sensors, remote sensors can
    provide a more accurate representation of the field conditions—i.e., better ability
    to detect microclimates—with fewer sensors. However, battery life is an important
    issue that limits the flight time of drones and other mobile platforms. Also,
    remote sensing needs a navigation system. This can be autonomous, such as unmanned
    aerial vehicles (UAVs) [68], or may require an operator [88]. Autonomous navigation
    systems are computationally extensive and would require additional spatial measurements.
    Sensor network architecture is concerned with connections between sensors and
    other components to ensure optimal network configuration. Plane and hierarchal
    architecture are two common architectures implemented in the SF literature. A
    plane architecture is where all nodes have the same status, abilities, and roles.
    On the other hand, a hierarchal structure involves having more superior nodes
    responsible for collecting and forwarding data. A plane structure is more straightforward
    and less affected by an individual node’s failure. However, it is impractical
    in a larger network as it will demand extensive energy [104]. A two-level node
    hierarchal structure is more common [85], [105], [106] where the first level (slave
    nodes) senses and sends the data to a more advanced node (referred to as a sink
    or a master node) that sends data to an external source and coordinates the slave
    nodes. A group of slave nodes managed by a master is referred to as a cluster,
    and the master is the cluster head. Clustering sensors to form nodes can be done
    by grouping like sensors together and powering them with different sources according
    to their different needs [107] or making each node heterogeneous to ensure similar
    power demand among nodes [108]. The first is easier to design and requires less
    human work for battery replacements; however, it might be more expensive. Methods
    for calculating the sensor nodes’ energy demand are presented in [108] and [109].
    3) Challenges: A technical concern when deploying a WSN is energy. In a WSN, the
    energy is constrained to the capacity of the battery powering them. The entire
    sensor node fails once the battery is depleted and not recharged or replaced [110],
    [111]. Hence, minimizing the power consumption of the sensor nodes is critical.
    It is also possible to harvest ambient energy to power the sensor node. To reduce
    the power consumption of the sensor node, research utilizes methods that switch
    the nodes [107], [112], [113] or their transceivers (most power-hungry block)
    [85], [114] OFF when not used. This is also known as putting nodes in the sleep
    mode. The sleep time can occur at prescheduled fixed intervals [107] or event-based
    such as to report changing weather conditions [85] (i.e., a rainy, cloudy day
    would require more awake time than a typical summer day). The fixed-interval sleep
    mode saves energy but risks missing data instances when the node is OFF. Also,
    the setup time taken by the transceiver once it wakes up leaves the node more
    vulnerable to transition delays. Another power-saving method is to continuously
    reconfigure the data routing paths (reassigning master and slave nodes) [108],
    [115], [116]. The operating principle of those methods is to develop an algorithm
    that keeps changing the master node, since it is the most energy-intensive, to
    give all nodes a longer lifetime and guarantee that all nodes will be depleted
    together. Reducing the quantity of data that need to be transmitted is important
    for minimizing power [117]. Spatial data compression (nearby nodes talk to check
    repeated patterns in the data) has been used to lower the amount of transmitted
    data [117]. Although data compression requires some additional computations at
    the node level, it was shown that the computation power is much less than the
    power for long-distance communication [117]. Power saving has also been achieved
    using a low-power microcontroller (e.g., MSP430FR5969 and ESP8266EX) that offers
    increased performance at a lower energy budget [102], [118], [119]. Power consumption
    and battery life shape a burden in remote sensing platforms. That is, since using
    the traditional battery charging stations has an impact on mobility, alternatively,
    replacing the battery when depleted requires additional manual work and higher
    initial investment as one would need spare batteries. To this extent, wireless
    power transfer has been investigated to overcome this burden [73], [120], [121].
    Solar energy harvesting has also been deployed in the literature to solve the
    limited power available to sensor nodes [102], [118], [122], [123]. An additional
    power converter accompanies the integration of solar energy to regulate the power
    supply and the battery charging. BQ25570 IC is an example of a commercialized
    power regulator used [102], [124]. Another energy harvesting technique that overcomes
    the limitations of solar, being weather dependent, is using the radio frequency
    (RF) signal to provide energy to the sensor node [125]. A second challenge faced
    is the risk of losing data due to power loss or failure of components. To mitigate
    this risk, IdealVolting, a technique used to explore the possibility of operating
    below the minimum power specifications without compromising the measurement [126],
    has been studied. Moreover, the literature investigates using ML to predict the
    data to interpolate missing points [98], [127], [128] B. Communication The advances
    in the communication field and the IoT architectures have resulted in many protocols
    that can be utilized in SF, leaving flexibility for users’ selections depending
    on their needs and constraints. Generally, the pattern followed is using two communication
    pathways. Machine-to- Gateway (M2G): Communication back and forth between sensors
    or actuators nodes and microcontrollers. Machine-to- Cloud Communication (M2C):
    Passing data through the transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP)
    network to a final destination. The choice of data transmission platform is subject
    to many constraints, including available bandwidth, the required transmission
    rate, latency, data volume, and reliability. This section discusses the used protocols
    and challenges faced when designing a communication network. 1) M2G Communication
    Protocols: Various protocols have been utilized to establish M2G communication,
    including: 1) standard protocols, such as Zigbee [77], [129], [130], [131], [132],
    [133], [134], [135], Bluetooth [136], [137], [138], Wi-Fi [89], [90], [139], [140],
    [141], cellular networks [110], [129], [130], [131], [133], [142], and RF identification
    (RFID) [95], [121], [143], [144], [145], [146] and 2) low-power wide area networks
    (LPWANs), such as LORA [147], [148], [149], [150], [151], [152], [153], [154],
    [155], NB-IoT [156], [157], and Sigfox [99], [158], [159]. RFID is an energy-efficient
    communication technique, but it has a limited coverage area. Zigbee is based on
    an IEEE standard and can be connected easily through an Xbee module. The advantage
    of Zigbee is its low cost and low power consumption. However, Zigbee is limited
    in terms of data rate and coverage area. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are alternatives
    that offer improved data rates. Bluetooth connection can be established by attaching
    the HC-05 module to the Arduino [128], [130], while Wi-Fi can be through the ESP8266
    [132], [133], [134] module or directly through the Raspberry Pi with a built-in
    Wi-Fi module. The main limitation of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is their narrow coverage
    area, which is overcome in cellular networks that offer high-speed communication
    and a wide coverage range. The SF literature has captured the most recent advancements
    in the cellular network to increase the transmission data rate as in [110], which
    utilizes the critical techniques in 5G to accommodate more sensor nodes and prolong
    the lifetime of the WSNs. However, the use of cellular networks consumes more
    energy. LPWAN is a set of emerging network protocols capable of transmitting data
    over a long distance (couple of kilometers) with relatively lower power to overcome
    standard network limitations. The most common LPWAN protocol, in SF, is LoRaWan,
    an open-access protocol that uses LoRa technology. To set up an LoRaWan network,
    one can use a microcontroller that supports an LoRa module, such as Arduino Uno
    that works with the LoRa/GPS shield [160] or the STM32F103 that is compatible
    with the Lora module Ra01 [161]. Setting up the LoRa network requires calibration
    of the sender and receiver antenna gain [160]. NB-IoT is another LPWAN technology
    that offers more coverage area than LoRa [156], and it can be integrated through
    the SIM7020, which can be connected to a Raspberry Pi [157]. Sigfox has also been
    utilized in SF through the Sigfox ship, SFM11R2D [158], or the Sigfox Shield for
    Arduino (UNASHIELD-V2S) [159]. The main drawback of LPWAN is that it has a relatively
    low data rate in comparison to other traditional protocols. The low data rate
    makes utilizing LPWAN impractical for high density of sensors. A solution to mitigate
    this drawback is to utilize a multichannel gateway [152]. Another drawback of
    LPWAN is the risk of data collision when two nodes are sending data simultaneously.
    This challenge has been addressed in [161] by allocating independent time slots
    for transmission for each node. The solutions proposed to overcome LPWAN limitations
    increase power consumption; hence, optimization is needed between power consumption,
    coverage area, and data rate. 2) M2C Communication Protocols: On the other hand,
    the most common method to establish M2C communication in SF is to connect the
    microcontroller to the local wireless network connected to the Internet. Alternatively,
    some papers use the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) [89], [162], the message
    queue telemetry transport (MQTT) [97], [163], [164], or the constrained application
    protocol (CoAP) [165], TCP/IP protocols that are used to establish M2C communication,
    known as IoT protocols. 3) Challenges: The limited resources assigned to the devices’
    communication create challenges in deploying communication networks. In other
    words, the challenge associated with designing a communication network is the
    desire to achieve a firm, reliable, and fast data delivery while optimizing factors
    such as power consumption, cost, and coverage area. Unfortunately, the literature
    did not state one solution that fits all. Hence, SF integrators should explore
    existing solutions and choose according to their application requirements. This
    section demonstrates an overview of the commonly used communication protocols,
    there are many other factors to be considered. For instance, the performance can
    drastically if deployed indoor or outdoor, urban, or rural, and many other factors.
    Detailed comparisons are available in [158], [166], [167], [168], and [169]. C.
    Actuators and Machines In agriculture, robotics has been applied to various fields
    of agriculture. The SF literature that focuses on robotics revolves around two
    issues. The first is designing new robots that perform tasks in the field. The
    second is to improve the performance of existing irrigation machines. 1) Robots:
    The literature used robots for multiple purposes, including spraying or removing
    pesticides [170], [171], [172], [173], irrigation [174], [175], picking crops
    [171], [176], [177], sewing seeds [178], [179], [180], plowing soil [181], [182],
    and harvesting [162], [183]. Robots’ design and development considerations include
    controlling robots, and their parts’ movement [162], [184], [185], selecting and
    integrating motors [180], [186], and the mechanical design of the body/chaise
    [174], [181], [186], [187] are discussed design issues. The most common method
    to track the movement’s motion is utilizing an ultrasonic sensor [171], [174],
    [181], [182]. As for the motors, dc [175], [176], [181], [188] and servo [172],
    [181], [182], [189] motors are the most common motors used. In addition to the
    robots’ design considerations, achieving long-term autonomy is a significant challenge.
    Although advanced control methods exist in different applications, the nature
    of agricultural fields (vast and numerous arrangements of crops) makes it challenging.
    To address the challenge of robots’ motion, adaptive motion control strategies
    have been proposed [73], [190]. Those strategies showed significant improvement
    over methods that require detailed field information. 2) Irrigation System: As
    irrigation is the basis of agriculture, the literature has explored methods to
    achieve efficient automatic irrigation. The most straightforward practice for
    automating the irrigation system is using pipes controlled via a solenoid valve
    [103], [191], [192], [193]. A solenoid valve is an electromechanical device that
    can be switched by a relay placed on solenoid power cables. Using a solenoid valve
    solely might not be adequate for applications that need applied pressure for water
    transfer. Hence, water pumps have been used for irrigation in SF [119], [194],
    [195]. Pumps allow more flexibility in the system design; however, they demand
    more energy. To overcome limited energy, solar-powered irrigation systems [196],
    [197], [198], [199], [200] or passive irrigation systems have been studied. Passive
    systems use pressure-generated columns derived from the water potential to actuate
    the valve [201] or utilize the siphon concept [202]. While those systems do not
    demand any power, they are adequate for limited-field architectures. Hence, there
    is a tradeoff between design flexibility and power consumption. 3) Challenges:
    The challenge faced while designing an SF irrigation system is the limited amount
    of water available in some fields. The research explored methods to minimize water
    consumption, including reusing wastewater (recycling) [196], [202], [203] to overcome
    this challenge. Another water conservation approach is to adopt water management
    schemes to minimize unnecessary watering of the crops [101], [200]. Also, using
    drip irrigation reduces the amount of water used as it is proven to be the most
    water-efficient irrigation method [168], [196], [199], [200]. D. Managing Big
    Data The enormous volumes of data captured by sensors in SF motivate addressing
    big data management in the literature. Managing big data is a discipline concerned
    with using techniques, tools, and platforms to address storage, preprocessing,
    processing, and security challenges. This section discusses the challenge of handling
    big data and presents the techniques adopted to mitigate those challenges. The
    most significant challenge when dealing with big data is the extensive processing
    power and memory needed for its storage and processing. To deal with the limited
    processing and storing capabilities, most literature chooses to send data to a
    central cloud designed to manage a huge amount of data. Thing speak [89], [134],
    [137], [203], [204], [205], [206], Ubidots [94], Blynk [207], [208], OneNet [209],
    Amazon web services [100], and GoogleColab [210], [211] are examples of free IoT
    cloud services. The advantage of using those cloud services is the ease of integration.
    In addition, most clouds are accompanied by a dashboard that provides real-time
    data visualization and can easily be configured to user interfaces (web services
    or mobile applications). However, sending data to the cloud is accompanied by
    costs inherited from the data transfer and latency due to the time taken to send
    signals. To reduce the cost inherited with the transfer, Gia et al. [155], Alonso
    et al. [212], and Ribeiro et al. [213] proposed methods of filtering data at the
    edge, sending only useful data to the cloud. Alternatively, computational and
    data storage procedures can be brought closer to the sensor or actuator node by
    utilizing existing devices’ capacity (known as edge or fog computing) [206], [214],
    [215], [216], [217]. Unlike cloud computing, a single node having infinite capabilities,
    edge and fog computing deploy multiple distributed nodes with limited computational
    abilities and require resource management to ensure proper deployment. To address
    this issue, resource management techniques optimize the use of resources at the
    edge and guarantee fulfilling the application needs [212], [215]. Another challenge
    faced is the deterioration of data quality due to their exposure to cybersecurity
    attacks or accusation and transmission faults, leaving missing and inconsistent
    data. To handle this problem, papers implemented blockchain technology to ensure
    data privacy and authenticity [218], [219], [220]. Darkweb technology has also
    been used to boost the performance of blockchains as it avoids exposure to malicious
    denial of service attacks [221]. Another method used to enhance the security of
    the data is implementing access control systems to ensure that only authorized
    users can control the data [222], [223]. The later problem has been solved by
    utilizing techniques to identify uncertainties or noise in the data and mitigate
    them. Algorithms based on the Boltzmann ML [224], the Kalman filter [225], and
    the longest common subsequence (LCSS) [226] have been utilized for data processing.
    Enhancing the quality of data has also been achieved through interpolation models
    based on fuzzy and neural network (NN) technology [128] and the anomaly detection
    algorithm based on matching old and new data [227]. E. Data Analysis 1) Machine
    Learning Techniques: As SF advances, ML techniques are widely adopted due to their
    potential to achieve reliable solutions to complex problems. Those techniques
    provide useful insight into the massive data generated by sensors through analyzing
    patterns and identifying trends. This section presents applications of data-driven
    decision-making in SF. ML is the process of using data to acquire a model that
    represents the SF system and predicts its outcome. Broadly, ML in SF can be classified
    into regression and classification. Regression algorithms are used to find the
    relationship between continuous variables, while classification algorithms are
    concerned with determining class membership. The functionality, complexity, and
    data required for those algorithms vary significantly. Simple regression algorithms—including
    linear, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and stacked regressors—have been
    utilized to estimate the crop yield [228], [229], [230]. Decision tree, K-nearest
    neighbors (KNNs), random forest, naïve Bayes classifier, and support vector machine
    (SVM) are simple classifiers used to predict the most suitable crop for a region
    [210], [231], [232], [233], [234], [235], [236]. The simplicity of those algorithms
    enables presenting the relationship between data without demanding extensive computation
    power and, hence, can be employed at the edge. On the other hand, those models
    are incapable of doing more complex functions; hence, they have limited applications.
    With the development of more advanced computing approaches, deep learning (DL)
    became the mainstream approach. DL utilizes NN models, the network of simple information
    processing units (known as neurons), to model complex relationships and extract
    features from huge datasets. The connection between neurons has a weight associated
    with them, which assigns a weighted sum to inputs of the neuron, and then, the
    resulted sum is passed through an activation function that determines the neuron’s
    final output value. NN has been used in SF for different purposes including soil
    or atmospheric parameter forecasting [98], [237], [238], optimal Environmental
    Conditions prediction [239], and artificial neural networks (ANN) based controller
    to optimize irrigation [240]. The desire of achieving tasks is to produce accurate
    results using NN, while minimizing the training time made the literature use tailored
    architectures, such as recurrent NNs (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks
    (CNNs). RNN has a memory buffer that stores the output of hidden layers and feeds
    it back to itself along with the upcoming input. This buffer makes RNN more suitable
    for processing sequential data. The ability to take the sequential information
    into consideration made RNN suitable for forecasting crop yield [241]. CNNs are
    tailored for image recognition tasks as neurons in an early layer of the network
    would extract local visual features, and neurons in later layers would combine
    these features to form higher order features. CNNs proved high accuracy in feature
    extraction in different SF applications, including detecting and diagnosing diseases,
    and weed-infected areas [242], [243], [244], [245], [246], [247], [248], [249],
    [250], determining the plants’ quantity [92], [234], and detecting animals’ intrusion
    [251]. 2) Challenges: One of the challenges faced when applying ML in SF is the
    ability to find sufficient data to train the model. Finding a large data set that
    contains all possible usual conditions (anomalies) is a prerequisite for the success
    of the ML. To overcome this limitation, the literature utilized different sources,
    including weather repositories [217], [252] and image databases [246], [253],
    besides data collected in the field to train the ML model. However, an online
    task-oriented dataset might not be available. Another approach is to use data
    augmentation techniques to create new instances of data from the existing ones
    [248]. Another challenge faced is the noise in datasets, which might be misleading
    if used to train the ML model. Noisy data have been removed by experts in [254].
    Alternatively, Kalman filtering to smooth the data [255] has been used. The high
    computation power and long training time of NNs shape a burden. To overcome this,
    papers integrate transfer learning, a technique that adjusts a model trained for
    a different task instead of training from scratch [211], [244], [253], [256],
    [257]. Transfer learning proved to obtain effective results at reduced cost using
    the pretrained model. SECTION IV. Technology Integration Into Systems Numerous
    papers focused on integrating two or more of the aforementioned technologies to
    create an independent system. Among those systems, remote monitoring and autonomous,
    and discoing-making are the most common. Fig. 3 shows the enabling technologies
    used in forming each system. Fig. 3. Breakdown of SF systems. Show All A. Remote
    Monitoring Systems Remote monitoring systems (RMSs) collect data from the physical
    layer (sensors and actuators) and send it to users through a visualization service
    (e.g., mobile app) and/or store data on a database server for further analysis.
    RMS provides the opportunity for farmers to observe the state of their farm, while
    he is away at any moment. Setting up an RMS requires the interconnection of a
    sensor network, a communication network, and a monitoring platform. Due to the
    varying farmers’ capabilities and demands, the RMS architecture did not converge.
    Its complexity ranges from a single sensing node that delivers data locally to
    multiple node systems that include an Internet connection to send data to a back-end
    IoT system. The former system operates on an internal application running on the
    same server, which has been achieved through deploying the global system for mobile
    communications (GSM) network and sending short message/messaging service (SMS)
    to users [189], [258], [259] or through a mobile application that receives data
    via Bluetooth [136]. The advantage of a local system is that it does it require
    an Internet connection from the farmer. This is vital in the case of an emergent
    message being delivered, such as fire. Having no Internet connection is also preferred
    in some developing countries where Internet availability is not guaranteed. However,
    the GSM network that can send a limited amount of data makes it impractical for
    applications requiring the exchange of huge data amounts. The latter system, which
    is more common, utilizes the IoT concept (exchanging data through the Internet),
    which can be done by directly connecting the sensors to the TCP/IP network or
    through a middle layer, as shown in the communication techniques in Section III-A.
    The gateway can be any device composed of a CPU and equipped with a transceiver
    compatible with the used communication protocol. Raspberry Pi is the most common
    gateway. A sample of different IoT solutions is shown in Table II. TABLE II Different
    Arrangements for RMS B. Autonomous Systems Autonomous systems have recently drawn
    researchers’ attention because of the advantages that it brings to the farm, including
    eliminating the need for manual work and saving a significant amount of water
    [94], [261]. The most common autonomous system discussed in the SF literature
    is the irrigation system. Other autonomous systems include controlling the temperature
    using cooling fans [135], [194], [262], heating fans [135], skylight opening [263],
    wet curtains [264], or bare tube heating systems [265], controlling light intensity
    using shutters [194] or artificial lights [135], [262], [266], [267], [268], and
    controlling humidity using water fans [269] or fogging system [268]. Also, systems
    that automate additives such as adding nutrient solutions [270], [271] or pesticides
    [272] in water or injecting carbon dioxide in the air [273] have been considered
    in the literature. The design process of the above autonomous systems involves
    developing control logic and hardware to operate the actuators along with elements
    discussed in Sections III-A–III-C: connectivity of sensors, local data transmission,
    and actuators. The link between the system components requires synchronization
    to ensure flawless operation. Control logic is an algorithm that generates instructions
    to switch actuators, usually through acquiring and analyzing sensors’ data. Time-based
    [274], [275], farmer-based [91], [270], [276], limit-based, and model-based are
    the classes of control logic implemented in the SF literature. Time- and farmer-based
    methods do not use sensors’ readings as they control the actuators according to
    scheduled time slots or instructions from farmers. Limit-based is the most common
    with a predefined threshold. The output of the limit-based can either be binary
    (ON/OFF) [204], [226], [277], [278], [279], [280], [281] or, more flexibly, fuzzy
    [194], [266], [282], [283], [284], [285], [286], [287], [288], [289], [290], [291].
    Model-based algorithms take actions in accordance with a reference model, which
    can be based on scientific equations [101], [292], [293] or on previous data (i.e.,
    ML models) [163], [239], [268], [294], [295], [296]. The fuzzy-based algorithm
    is preferred over other control algorithms as it enables multiple control variables
    without using more complicated mathematical or database models. Achieving the
    desired status of the actuators generated by the control logic has been done in
    the SF literature through two different hardware arrangements. One is by adding
    a hardware interface between the microcontroller and actuators. The second is
    using designated controllers that directly connect to the actuators. Relays [96],
    [142], [207], [233], [267], [271], [279], [292], [297], [298], [299], [300], [301],
    [302], transistors [303], and motor drivers [205], [261] are examples of blocks
    that operate in conjunction with the microcontroller. An alternative arrangement
    is replacing the microcontroller and the additional hardware with a programmable
    logic controller (PLC) [272], [286], [304]. PLCs can be programed to complete
    the entire automation process as their input can be connected to sensors, and
    their output can be connected to the actuators. PLCs are simpler to set up and
    program than combining a microcontroller with a hardware interface. However, they
    are more expensive and enable less freedom for the onboard control logic. C. Intelligent
    Decision-Making Systems Making decisions through sensors embedded in the field,
    data analysis techniques, and methods of handling big data has reshaped agricultural
    practices. Intelligent decision-making systems are included in all SF stages,
    starting from preplantation to postplantation activities. Predicting which crop
    suits the given environmental conditions and estimating expected crop yield are
    examples of preplantation decision-making. Decision-making during the plantation
    process includes identifying plant diseases, recognizing pests, and providing
    optimal nutrients and irrigation needs. Postplantation decision-making is concerned
    with counting and classifying crops. The high computation power and long training
    time of NNs shape a burden. To overcome this, papers integrate transfer learning,
    a technique that adjusts a model trained for a different task instead of training
    from scratch [211], [244], [253], [256], [257]. Transfer learning proved to obtain
    effective results at reduced cost using the pretrained model. Table III summarizes
    all decision-making systems utilized in the literature. Table III shows that the
    most common decision-making system is the disease detection systems. Intelligent
    disease detection systems also provide the benefit of early detection and diagnosis,
    which can minimize losses. Weed detection and finding plants’ needs are the literature’s
    second and third most common decision-making systems. All those systems rely on
    plant pictures to extract features (e.g., color, size, morphology, and texture)
    and then classify them. The most common ML technique used is CNNs, as it has proved
    to produce accurate results for feature extraction and object classification.
    The high accuracy of CNN comes at the cost of demanding higher processing power
    and more extensive data volumes that are not always affordable. To overcome the
    limitations of CNN, many papers integrate transfer learning, a technique that
    adjusts a model trained for a different task instead of training a model from
    scratch or other ML techniques with CNN. TABLE III Intelligent Decision-Making
    Systems in SF The high computation power and long training time of NNs shape a
    burden. To overcome this, papers integrate transfer learning, a technique that
    adjusts a model trained for a different task instead of training from scratch
    [211], [244], [253], [256], [257]. Transfer learning proved to obtain effective
    results at reduced cost using the pretrained model. Table III also lists various
    sources of data in SF. The selection of the data source is a significant concern
    as it is a prerequisite for the success of the ML approach. Finding the appropriate
    data source is challenging because most ML algorithms need to be trained on a
    large dataset to optimize many parameters. In addition, supervised ML methods
    require the labeling of the data set, which requires a large amount of the experts’
    work. Given those challenges, four sources of data were used in SF literature:
    1) installed sensors; 2) weather stations collecting meteorological data; 3) online
    databases; and 4) agricultural reference material. SECTION V. Discussion The main
    observation of surveying papers on SF is that none of the solutions is satisfactory
    for all SF applications. Hence, practitioners need to choose the one that fits
    their needs and obliges them to their constraints. For instance, sensor integrators
    need to consider the cost, power consumption, and design complexity while choosing
    the sensor types, quantity, and placement methods. As for the communication network,
    there is a tradeoff between power consumption, coverage area, and data rate. On
    the actuation side, having flexibility in designing the irrigation system comes
    at the cost of demanding high power to operate. Finally, on the data side, there
    is a tradeoff between the functionalities provided by the data analysis technique,
    the computation power, and the amount of data demanded. To this end, although
    many papers discuss using commercial off-the-shelf software and hardware platforms
    to provide the needed functionality, none of them performs a technoeconomic analysis.
    The SF literature lacks an analysis of technology integration’s effect on crop
    yield and returns on investment. In addition, the SF literature should have more
    discussion on the scalability and robustness of the proposed technologies. This
    can be done by expanding this work from a theoretical/experimental concept to
    an applicable industrial model and evaluating its effectiveness. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    The field of agriculture is heavily shifting toward utilizing technological solutions
    to enhance agriculture productivity, SF. This article presented a comprehensive
    survey of the state-of-the-art research performed in the field of SF. To this
    end, this article identified the most influential technologies affecting farming
    practices and structures. Analysis of technology integration is presented highlighting
    their advancements, challenges, and solutions. The discussion in this article

    is in constantly renewing, continuously demanding new systems that facilitate
    farmers´ work. Efficient agricultural practices are essential to increasing farm
    profitability, and reducing water consumption can be achieved by real-time monitoring
    of water needs. However, the prices of automatic systems for collecting data from

    This paper presents a low-consumption solution using the Internet of Things (IoT)
    based on wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and long-range wide-area network (LoRaWAN)
    technologies. By means of low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) communication, a
    farmer can monitor the state of crops in real time thanks to a large number of
    sensors connected wirelessly and distributed across the farm. The wireless sensor
    node developed, called BoXmote, exhibits very low power, since it has been optimized

    information necessary to achieve an efficient irrigation management of his crops
    with full autonomy. Keywords: LoraWAN; Internet of Things (IoT); agriculture 4.0;

    that the world population faces today, and on which researchers from all over
    the world are working, are globalization, global warming, and the supply of food.
    In order to address the latter, it is necessary to develop modern solutions that
    allow the optimization of costs and increased yields, such as the smart management
    of water for precision irrigation in agriculture [1,2]. In recent years, many
    researchers have been integrating the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT)
    into the field of agriculture, thus helping the development of what is known as
    precision agriculture. Precision agriculture aims to provide a decision support
    system that helps farmers to implement efficient agricultural practices, with
    the aim of increasing profitability, reducing environmental risks, and preserving
    natural resources [3,4]. So-called smart agriculture or digital agriculture uses
    intelligent networks and data management tools to employ all of the information
    and experience available in order to enable the automation of sustainable processes
    in agriculture. This agriculture is based on connected and knowledge-based agricultural
    production systems and makes great use of information and communication technologies
    (ICT), both for data collection and for subsequent processing. For this reason,
    the design and implementation of efficient and economic devices in agriculture
    are currently an important line of research [5]. Due to the characteristics of
    the agricultural sector, the use of wired systems for the collection of information
    is practically unfeasible, which is why work is currently underway to develop
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in order to minimize the economic cost and impact
    of installation in agricultural environments, thus avoiding hindering the work
    of the farmer [5,6]. WSN solutions for establishing different parameters in agriculture
    should include certain requirements for smaller farmers to implement this type
    of system on their farms, such as inexpensive devices (i.e., the cost of a radio
    chipset being less than 2€ and an operating cost of 1€ per device per year), low
    energy consumption (i.e., 10+ years of battery lifetime), and a long range of
    communication (i.e., up to 10-40 km in rural zones)—three areas in which we must
    work in the future [2,7,8]. Currently, there are some challenges to be overcome
    that still prevent the use of IoT for irrigation. Firstly, there are still many
    rural areas that do not have Internet connectivity. Secondly, they do not have
    electricity either. Thirdly, monitoring with soil sensors requires scalability,
    but this comes at a price. Finally, the integration of different and advanced
    sensors requires adequate standards. In order to solve the aforementioned problems,
    this paper develops and assesses an inexpensive WSN solution based on long-range
    (LoRa) technology with very low power consumption and high autonomy to control
    water needs for precision irrigation in agriculture. Many additional mechanisms
    have been proposed to increase the battery life of WSN end-devices and to accomplish
    energy saving, irrespective of whether the devices are already of low consumption.
    However, we found it difficult to compare them due to the diversity of the methodologies,
    end-device components, sensors used, and types of experiment. Therefore, the main
    contribution is that due to the fact that existing WSN systems for precision irrigation
    are mostly theoretical with limited proof of concept experiences in practice,
    providing details of devices and equipment as well as irrigation techniques [2,4],
    this work compares consumption to show a more energy-efficient end-device configuration.
    2. Wireless Sensor Networks in the Context of Smart Agriculture We can see different
    solutions for monitoring crops using WSNs. Many of these proposals have only been
    tested in the laboratory and still have to be developed and implemented on real
    crops. A low-cost, small-scale system to remotely monitor and control a greenhouse
    was created in [9]. In this study, the information was collected by an Arduino
    Mega and sent to a web page through ethernet communication. In [10], a system
    based on short message service (SMS) communication using a global system for mobile
    (GSM) module was developed to measure parameters such as soil moisture, pH, and
    atmospheric pressure. With these data, irrigation could be controlled and the
    farmer informed of the state of his crops. Similarly, the authors of [11] developed
    a WSN system with a soil moisture sensor and a temperature and humidity sensor.
    One of the most widely used technologies for creating wireless sensor networks
    in agriculture is the ZigBee technology. In [5,12,13], a WSN was presented for
    monitoring crops by measuring parameters such as soil moisture, pH, conductivity,
    salinity, and ambient light. General packet radio service (GPRS) technology can
    also be used in agriculture to create WSNs [6]. In [14], the authors developed
    an automated irrigation system to optimize the use of water in crops by combining
    the ZigBee and GPRS technologies. By means of this system, the humidity and temperature
    of the land can be measured. Furthermore, in [15], an IoT-based irrigation system
    was presented using soil moisture sensors controlled by ATMEGA 328P on an Arduino
    UNO board, along with a GPRS module. NarrowBand IoT (NB-IoT) is an LPWAN technology
    based on narrow band radio technology that can coexist with GSM and long-term
    evolution (LTE) under licensed frequency bands. NB-IoT is standardized by the
    3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and its specifications were released
    in June 2016; thus, additional time is needed before its network is established
    [16]. SigFox is a new technology used in IoT applications. In [17], a geolocation
    system was developed to locate herds of cattle. As advantages of the SigFox technology,
    we can highlight its wide range of coverage and low consumption, which makes it
    very appropriate for IoT solutions. With SigFox, LoRa technology has started to
    be used in precision agriculture in recent years as an alternative to previous
    protocols [18,19]. It is a long-range and low-power wireless communication system
    whose objective is to be used in long-term devices [20]. Based on the LoRaWAN
    technology, the MoniSen end-device [1] used the ATMEGA324P processor and the RN2473
    chip to establish LoRa communication, to measure parameters such as ambient temperature
    and humidity, soil temperature and humidity, and light intensity received by the
    plant. In a smart irrigation system [19], the end-device achieved a distance of
    7 km in the field tests. Table 1 shows a comparison of the different communication
    technologies discussed above for the creation of WSNs [8,16,21,22]. Table 1. Comparison
    between the different communication technologies for end-devices. If we analyze
    the data shown in the table above, we can see that GPRS technology, apart from
    its high cost, is not entirely suitable for the communication of wireless sensors
    due to its high energy consumption, which means it is little used in the creation
    of high autonomy nodes. Currently, the ZigBee wireless communication protocol
    is considered one of the best technologies in precision agriculture, given its
    low consumption. If we compare it with the LoRa and Sigfox technologies, we can
    see that all three have low consumption and low cost, making them ideal for the
    creation of WSNs. However, one of its main disadvantages is its short reach between
    nodes—100 m in open spaces, as shown in Table 1—which is both lower than the other
    wireless communication protocols and a great limitation for agriculture. NB-IoT
    is preferred for applications that require guaranteed quality of service, whereas
    applications that do not have this constraint could choose both LoRa or Sigfox.
    Furthermore, the additional energy consumption because of synchronous communication
    reduces NB-IoT’s end-device lifetime as compared to them. In addition, NB-IoT
    is not suitable for rural areas that do not benefit from LTE coverage. Thus, for
    applications that do not have large amount of data to send, Sigfox and Lora are
    the best options [8,16]. In the field of agriculture, a long battery lifetime
    of sensor devices is required. Using temperature, humidity, and electrical conductivity
    (EC), sensors could significantly reduce water consumption and improve yield,
    as discussed in [23]. Devices update sensed data a few times per hour, as the
    environment conditions do not radically change in this time period. Thus, Sigfox
    and LoRaWAN are ideal for this application. Moreover, various farms do not have
    LTE cellular coverage, thus NB-IoT is not a solution for agriculture in the near
    future. Although the LoRa and SigFox technologies have a great technical similarity,
    LoRa technology was used in this work for two reasons: Firstly, because we wanted
    to build a WSN that avoided dependence on third parties. One of the main features
    of this technology is that any user can build their own network, thus avoiding
    having to subscribe in order to use an external network. Secondly, because with
    LoRa, we can support coverage in remote rural areas. Finally, commercial wireless
    detection modules such as eKo Pro [24], MicaZ [25], TelosB [26], Zolertia [27],
    Adcon Telemetry GmbH [28], AquacomSensor Hub Aquaflex [29], Enviroscan [30], or
    Waspmote [31] for agriculture and its irrigation are still very expensive—usually
    exceeding 1000.00€—making it impossible for smaller farms to implement this type
    of system, as well as for smart farms, which require a large number of wireless
    end-devices for data collection that support reliable decision making. 3. Materials
    and Methods In the first instance, we installed the LoRa gateway in an elevated
    position [32], in the headquarters of an agricultural cooperative from which coverage
    of nearby crops could be given. Thanks to the LoRa technology, we could easily
    cover an area of about 5 km around this cooperative; this is less than other studies,
    but we did not modify the LoRaWAN PHY layer and did not point the antenna toward
    the test area [32,33]. Then, end-devices (BoXmotes, Bo True Activities SL, Huelva,
    Spain) were installed in the crop, which were equipped with the most suitable
    sensors, depending on the parameters that were to be measured. In this way, the
    BoXmote took measurements at regular intervals and sent them to the gateway through
    the LoRa technology. Once the gateway received the data, they were sent to a server
    via the ethernet connection. When the data reached the server, the farmer could
    consult them through a mobile application. 3.1. Hardware Description In this section,
    a complete description of the hardware that makes up our end-device is given.
    When choosing the hardware that forms our end-device, it should be noted that
    all of the components were selected with low consumption in mind, thus increasing
    battery life to the maximum. Each end-device comprised a radio transceiver, a
    micro-controller, sensors, and an antenna, along with other circuitry that would
    enable it to communicate with the gateway to transmit information collected by
    the sensors [34]. 3.1.1. Monitored Parameters and Sensors According to [4], the
    majority of papers monitored between three and four parameters with soil moisture
    being the most used in soil sensors, and air temperature and humidity as atmospheric
    parameters. Soil temperature, electrical conductivity (EC), and luminosity are
    other parameters that are measured regularly [5]. In relation to the measurement
    of soil moisture, most studies use the conductivity between two electrodes that
    are inserted into the soil by measuring the constant dielectric of the soil. Most
    published works use the low-cost sensors YL69 (Sparkfun Electronics, Niwot, CO,
    USA) and VH400 (Vegetronix, Inc., Riverton, UT, USA) that operate with Arduino.
    However, we both tested and discarded them because they did not behave stably
    under real conditions. Thus, to measure the soil parameters, we used well-known
    commercial sensors [35] (see Table 2) as the capacitive sensor of the frequency
    domain reflectrometry (FDR) type ECH2O 10HS (Meter Group, Inc, Pullman, WA, USA)
    to measure soil moisture, and ECH2O 5TE to measure soil moisture and temperature,
    as well as EC. These sensors were not specifically created to be integrated in
    an Arduino measuring system, but we developed our own code written in the open
    source Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) software and uploaded
    it to the board to be able to work with it. Table 2. Popular wireless nodes used
    in the agriculture domain. The low-cost DHT11/DHT22 sensors (Adafruit Industries,
    New York, NY, USA), which provide temperature and relative humidity readings,
    as well as light-dependent resistance (LDR), are the most commonly used sensors
    for smart irrigation monitoring [4]. Just as we did to test low-cost soil sensors,
    we tested these sensors for a year in real conditions and they worked well, and
    since IoT irrigation systems generally do not need the highest level of accuracy,
    we decided to use them for our work. 3.1.2. LoRa Technology LoRa, whose meaning
    is “long range”, is a long-range communications system promoted by the LoRa Alliance
    [36]. This system is aimed to be used in devices where energy consumption is of
    the utmost importance. LoRa can commonly refer to two distinct layers [20]: 1.
    A physical (PHY) layer, the so-called LoRa, that uses the radio modulation technique
    chirp spread spectrum (CSS). 2. A medium access protocol (MAC) layer in which
    LoRaWAN defines the communication protocol and the specific access network architecture.
    The LoRa modulation physical layer (Semtech Camarillo, CA, USA) allows a wide
    range at low power. We used the RN2483 transceiver module for Lora Class A, which
    operates in the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency band of 868
    MHz. The payload of each transmission can vary from 2 to 255 octets and the data
    rate can reach 50 Kbps [1]. LoRaWAN provides a MAC mechanism, which allows many
    end-devices (end-nodes) to communicate with a single gateway using LoRa modulation.
    A typical LoRa network shows a star-of-stars topology, which includes three different
    types of devices—the end-devices, the LoRaWAN gateways, and the network service
    [20,32]. In the basic architecture of a LoRaWAN network (Figure 1), the end-nodes
    communicate with the corresponding gateway using LoRa with a LoRaWAN link, and
    the gateways send LoRaWAN frames to a network server via a broadband link (i.e.,
    Ethernet or GPRS) [20]. Figure 1. Photograph of the wireless sensor node. 3.1.3.
    Sensor Node The node is the device in charge of collecting the necessary data
    in the field to later transmit to the gateway. Its two main characteristics must
    be low consumption and being able to establish communication at the greatest possible
    distance. Arduino boards (Smart Projects Srl, Scarmegno, Italy), such as Arduino
    UNO and Arduino Mega, are the most utilized nodes for the implementation of irrigation
    systems, and the most utilized controller is the ATmega328 (Atmel, San José, CA,
    USA) [4]. The selection of the best node for an IoT irrigation system depends
    on the necessities and the characteristics. We opted for developing our own design
    for the nodes, with the aim of addressing our own particular requirements of low
    power consumption and autonomy. Our end-node includes a processor fully compatible
    with Arduino IDE. Moteino (LowPowerLab, LLC, Michigan, MI, USA) is ideal for IoT
    applications because of its very small size (1.3 × 0.9 inch). The moteino used
    is a versatile low-cost and low-power Arduino based on the Atmel ATMega328P microcontroller.
    Moteino gives years of run time at a low transmission rate, with a 2000–2600 mAh
    battery. During sleep mode the radio power consumption is about 0.1 uA; during
    receive mode around 15mA; and in transmit mode the power consumption is up to
    130 mA. On the other hand, to establish LoRa communication with the gateway, the
    node has the RN2483 chip. This chip was also optimized to obtain the lowest possible
    consumption, in addition to being certified by the LoRa alliance. As small farmers
    cannot afford commercial solutions, we designed a shield for implementing the
    low-cost IoT irrigation system. This system can integrate numerous sensors that
    measure a large number of agricultural parameters, both soil and atmospheric (See
    Figure 1). A lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery with a nominal voltage of 3.7
    V and a capacity of 2000 mAh, equipped with a protection circuit that prevents
    overcharging as well as deep discharging, was used to power the node. As an alternative,
    Li-Ion batteries with 3.7 V nominal voltage and a capacity of 2600 mAh can also
    be used, obtaining greater autonomy. LiPo batteries were chosen as they can achieve
    a high load density with a very small weight and size. Additionally, with the
    implementation of a small solar panel and the TP4056 module, the battery could
    be recharged continuously, increasing the device´s autonomy and providing the
    discharge effect. In order to guarantee correct communication, the node was equipped
    with an omnidirectional antenna with SubMiniature version A (SMA) connector with
    an operating frequency of 868 MHz. Finally, all of the components were placed
    in a polyester enclosure (IP66) with a silicone lid seal, in which all of the
    necessary holes were drilled to mount the connections of the antenna and the sensors.
    To connect the (external) sensors to the (internal) electronics, we used cable
    glands (IP68) (Bopla Gehäuse Systeme GmbH, Bünde, Germany) for the BoXmote placed
    in the field test. In the following image (Figure 2), the completely assembled
    node (end-device for the lab test) is shown. Figure 2. Node sensor (end-device
    for the lab test). 3.1.4. Gateway The Gateway is the element in charge of receiving
    the information from the nodes and taking it to the network. It consists of a
    microprocessor, a concentrator, and an antenna. First, the antenna receives the
    information sent by the node and communicates it to a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
    (Sony, Pencoed, Wales) microprocessor through the IC880a concentrator, which includes
    a Semtech SX1301 chip. The base-station placements were at the edge of the rooftop
    on a building in the University of Huelva for the laboratory test, and on the
    rooftop of a cooperative for the field test. The base-stations employed in our
    experiments were ISM-868MHz outdoor omnidirectional antennas (SIRIO GP 868 C and
    GP901C models). Then, the Raspberry Pi is responsible for processing all of the
    information necessary to upload the information to the network through the previously
    installed software. In this work, we estimated the consumption in a rural scenario
    using fixed positions from the end-device to the gateway, not under mobility conditions
    [32]. 3.2. Software Description Since the Moteino driver is fully compatible with
    Arduino, it was programmed using the Arduino IDE software with the C++ programming
    language. The software operation of the node is shown in the flow diagram (Figure
    3). When the device is activated, the different outputs and inputs of the processor
    are configured. Next, the RN2483 chip is initialized, through which the information
    is later transmitted. Then, the necessary data are collected from the different
    sensors that are connected to the node at that moment. Since the sensors deliver
    a specific voltage depending on the physical parameter we wish to measure, it
    is necessary to transform this reading into specific physical units. To this end,
    data processing is carried out following the guidelines set by the manufacturers.
    To save battery, only the necessary data are processed (fog computing). The rest
    is processed in the cloud. Once the desired data are obtained, these are sent
    through the RN2483 module to the nearest gateway. Figure 3. Flow chart of the
    node sensors. After having sent the information, the LoRa module enters a “sleep”
    mode, through which it is possible to lower its consumption drastically. Then,
    the same is done with the Moteino microcontroller. In this way, the device has
    minimum consumption during the time between measurements, preserving the battery
    life well. The time between measurements must be programmed to extend the battery
    life, but also, in turn, to have sufficient precision to quickly detect changes
    in soil moisture or weather conditions, and it is not necessary to monitor the
    parameters in real-time [4]. In our experience, for the cultivation of berries
    in hydroponics, taking measurements every 30 min is sufficient. In irrigated systems
    with trees, they tend to be taken with less frequency, as well as in outdoor irrigated
    crops too. Thus, we used the most extreme case. 4. Results As already mentioned,
    one of the main characteristics that an IoT device must have is low consumption.
    Specifically, in the agriculture sector, it is essential to design a very low
    consumption device with which a great autonomy is achieved [37]. In this way,
    the farmer does not have to worry about the maintenance of the device during the
    months of maximum work, being able to devote his time to other tasks. Given the
    importance of a high autonomy of the device in agriculture, in this study we focused
    on quantifying the consumption of our BoXmote, performing a consumption test in
    the laboratory. Then, from the data obtained in the said test, the life of the
    battery in a real crop was estimated. Finally, a comparison of the results obtained
    with other existing devices was made. For the experiments, we followed the methodology
    used in [1,6,13,38]. The node used to perform the experiment consisted of a Moteino
    microcontroller and a LoRa module with the RN2483 chip. To measure volumetric
    water content, soil temperature, and bulk electrical conductivity data, it was
    decided to use ECHOH2O 5TE and ECHOH2O 10HS sensors, which are widely used in
    agriculture. As regards the battery, a lithium battery with a nominal voltage
    of 3.7 V and a capacity of 2000 mAh was available. To perform the experiment,
    the node was configured to take measurements every 93 s. It was decided to perform
    the test with such a short interval between measurements in order to decrease
    the total duration of the experiment. In order to save the battery as much as
    possible in the intervals in which the node is not working, the different components
    go to sleep mode, drastically lowering the consumption and preserving even more
    the battery charge. The node was located in the laboratory at a temperature of
    approximately 20 °C with the meter sensors in the air, and at an approximate distance
    between the node and the Gateway of 600 m. In order to correctly evaluate the
    consumption of the device, its process was divided into three states: Active mode:
    in this mode, the node configures the microcontroller and initializes the RN2483
    chip. Once these actions have been carried out, it proceeds to read the data provided
    by the sensors and performs the subsequent processing of the information. Send
    mode: this mode of operation is the one that consumes the most energy, since it
    is the moment in which the information is sent to the nearest gateway. “Sleep”
    mode: Unlike in the previous case, this mode saves the maximum battery charge
    as it is not necessary to take or transmit measurements. To do this, both the
    microcontroller and the RN2483 chip “fall asleep.” Figure 4 shows the BoXmote
    with which the battery consumption test was carried out. As previously mentioned,
    the 5TE and 10HS sensors were incorporated, since they are currently the most
    widely used in agriculture. Figure 4. Node with ECH2O soil moisture sensors. 4.1.
    Experimental Laboratory Setup In the first experiment, real measurements of consumption
    were taken in the different modes of operation, as well as the time that each
    one remains active. We used a Digital Multimeter JHS MY-64 [39] to realize the
    current measurement. To ascertain the state of the end-device, we added a light-emitting
    diode (LED, sleep mode indicator) to monitor it. The consumption shown takes all
    the parts of the node (antenna, all sensors, processing, etc.) into consideration.
    The measurements were performed by averaging. The statistical procedure of one
    sample t-test was used to determine if the sample of observations could have been
    generated by a process with the experimental average value. The results obtained
    are summarized in the table below. In Table 3, we can see how the node spends
    most of the time in \"sleep,\" mode with a consumption of 0.036 mA. This consumption
    increases up to 9.4 mA while the microcontroller is in active mode, acquiring
    data through the sensors. Finally, while the information is sent through the LoRa
    module, the consumption is 22 mA for approximately one second. Table 3. Average
    power consumption (mA) for the different modes. From the data shown in Table 3,
    we can calculate the average device consumption for this time interval between
    data collection as follows: 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛= 9.4 mA×4 s+22 mA×1 s+0.036 mA×88 s 93
    s =0.674 mA Once the average consumption of the node is obtained, and knowing
    the capacity of the battery, we can calculate its theoretical duration: 𝐷𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛=
    2000 mAh 0.674 mA =2967 h=123 days As will be seen later, this theoretical duration
    is only useful for performing a first estimate. Normally, the actual duration
    of the battery is well below the theoretically calculated value. The second test
    had as its objectives obtaining the discharge curve of the battery and its real
    duration. Thus, measurements of the voltage supplied by the battery were taken
    periodically during the operation of the device. In this way, we were able to
    estimate its state of charge, as well as the time for which the device can operate
    without needing maintenance or battery change. Next, the voltage values measured
    against the number of days that it was in operation were plotted on a graph. As
    can be seen in Figure 5, the voltage supplied by the battery starts at 4.1 V and
    decreases rapidly during the first few days. Meanwhile, as we get closer to the
    nominal voltage of the battery (3.7 V), the curve decreases more slowly toward
    this value. Once the voltage drops below the nominal value of the battery, it
    drops drastically. This behavior is typical of lithium batteries, as is the case
    here. Figure 5. Node battery voltage. During the experiment, the node ran for
    a total of 72 days, during which it took measurements every 93 s. In this time
    period, more than 49,000 measurements were taken. If we compare the battery life
    obtained in the real experiment with the theoretically calculated one, we can
    verify that its real life is approximately 60% of the theoretical one. These data
    may vary depending on the characteristics or battery and environmental conditions.
    For example, in [1], a value of 70% is taken to estimate the duration of the battery.
    In contrast, [6,13,38] did not use any correction factor to calculate battery
    life. 4.2. Field Test The farm selected as a case study is a berry farm located
    in Huelva (Andalusia, Spain), one of the most important berry producing areas
    in Europe and where 100% of the crop is irrigated under plastic (Figure 6). In
    climatic terms, this is a semi-arid zone with an annual rainfall of approximately
    630 mm. The validation tests were carried out on a blueberry crop that covers
    two plots of approximately 4 hectares each. Figure 6. Experimental site for the
    field test. The devices were installed in this crop for 6 months (January–June,
    2018) (Figure 7). Figure 8 shows the snapshots of real data from the sensors.
    Figure 7. Installed device taking measurements every 30 min. Figure 8. User interface
    of the application web. Because the parameters that are be measured in the crop
    do not show large variations in short time intervals, it was decided that if measurements
    are taken every 30 min, a correct balance between battery life and adequate precision
    would be obtained, allowing us to evaluate the state of the crop in real time.
    Thus, if we use the data previously measured in the different operating modes,
    we can calculate the average of the device for a time between measures of 30 min
    in the following way: 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛= 9.4 mA×4 s+22 mA×1 s+0.036 mA×1795 s 1800 s
    =0.069 mA Taking into account the calculations performed previously, and assuming
    that the actual duration is 60% of the theoretical calculation, the estimated
    duration of the battery for a time between data collection of 30 min would be
    the following: 𝐷𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛= 2000 mAh×0.6 0.069 mA =17391 h=724 days With this autonomy,
    the end-device would be able to operate for two years without the need for battery
    change or any maintenance. 5. Discussion Estimating the energy efficiency for
    an IoT device is very difficult when there are several communication technologies,
    electronic components, and measuring devices, as well as a multitude of environmental
    conditions and particular situations for each crop and its needs. These limitations
    are commented upon in some works [40]. It was not the objective of this work to
    modify hardware and software parameters to reduce consumption, but to decide on
    the most appropriate technology and components that would allow us to develop
    an end-device with low consumption. We also decided on the best intervals for
    data collection and sending, and the microcontroller was programmed to achieve
    minimal consumption. Finally, we compared the results with other similar works
    in the field of smart irrigation. The results achieved in this study improve upon
    the recently published ones. For instance, [13] present a node formed by the Msp430F1611
    Texas Instruments processor and wireless communication at 2.4 Ghz with a gateway.
    To measure the different terrain parameters, they used two Hydra Probe II sensors.
    The measurements were taken every 30 min, obtaining an average consumption of
    0.5035 mA. The calculated autonomy was 223 days, achieved by installing a 2700
    mAh battery. In [1], a device using LoRa communication was developed to measure
    temperature and humidity parameters and soil data. With a time between measures
    of 60 min, the average consumption of the device was 0.4026 mA, achieving a range
    of 73 days for a 2400 mAh battery. Unlike the previous case, the author corrected
    the duration of the battery by the factor 0.75, thus achieving a result closer
    to reality. The GAIA2 system [5] communicates via radio at 2.4 GHz with a gateway.
    In laboratory tests, with a node and a humidity and temperature sensor SHT71,
    an average consumption of 0.089 mA was obtained. On the other hand, a real field
    experiment was carried out in which two MPS-2 sensors were used, capable of measuring
    the water potential and soil temperature, obtaining a total battery life of 56
    days. Finally, the LoRa irrigation system proposed by [19], which uses a lithium
    battery with 4800 mAh, consumes, in their different operative modes, 2.0987 mA
    on average, equating to a battery life of 57 days under the same conditions as
    our experiment. We presented a system capable of an average consumption of 0.069
    mA, thus providing a battery life of up to 724 days. If we compare these results
    with those obtained in previous articles, we can see that consumption has been
    reduced significantly, along with a significant increase in battery life. The
    following Table 4 shows a comparison of the results obtained in other studies.
    Table 4. Comparison of data obtained with other methods. If we compare the results
    obtained in our study with those obtained by [13], we can see that both devices
    take measurements every 30 min and have two sensors that measure various parameters
    of the soil. However, the average consumption obtained by our device is a reduction
    of 86% compared to the consumption of the other device. Regarding the life of
    the battery, our device is capable of increasing the life of the battery by more
    than 300% compared to the work in [13]. Comparing the results of our BoXmote with
    those obtained by [1], we can see that our average consumption is 82% less than
    that of their device. Bearing in mind that in this case the time between measurements
    is 60 min, this would mean that average consumption would be even higher if the
    time were reduced to 30 min. Regarding the life of the battery, the BoXmote has
    an autonomy 990% greater than the device presented by [1]. Finally, if we compare
    the results of our BoXmote with [5], we can see that both devices have two soil
    sensors and a time between measurements of 30 min. In this case, the life of the
    battery is increased by 1292%, which represents a significant improvement over
    the solution proposed by [5]. As can be seen, a significant increase in battery
    life was obtained in terms of wireless sensor networks. In this way, one of the
    great problems that these devices present during their operation is solved. Another
    advantage that our system has over other similar ones that are currently marketed
    is its low cost. The BoXmote has a cost of 70.00€ compared to the usual cost of
    end-devices around 350.00€. This low cost allows us to distribute a large number
    of nodes for the crop, thus obtaining much more precise information. 6. Conclusions
    Most of the papers related to WSN do not include quantitative results about the
    impact of the WSN’s deployment in the field [41]. In this paper, we presented
    a low-cost system based on LoRa technology capable of taking measurements of the
    parameters most used in precision agriculture, such as humidity and ambient temperature,
    light received by the plant, and soil temperature, soil moisture, and EC. The
    results obtained show better consumption than that of commercial wireless sensors.
    The consumption of the node was measured in its different operating states, and
    the battery discharge curve was obtained, achieving, if measurements were taken
    every 30 min, an approximate battery duration of 724 days. All the consumption
    required by data acquisition and sending to the gateway was taken into consideration.
    In order to increase the battery life and take into account the discharge effect,
    a solar panel could be installed in the node and evaluation performed on how it
    affects the consumption of the battery. Another line of work is related to the
    type of battery installed. In this case, the operation of the node can be compared
    with another type of power, such as alkaline or lithium-ion batteries. We are
    aware that more work is needed on energy consumption, both from a theoretical
    and practical point of view. The analysis of gateway consumption is another interesting
    topic for agriculture, especially in remote areas or developing regions. Finally,
    a more detailed study on the evolution of NB-IoT technologies versus LoRaWAN and
    SigFox should be analyzed. Author Contributions Conceptualization, J.D.B.; Methodology,

  description: Soil and nutrient depletion from intensive use of land is a critical
    issue for food production. An understanding of whether the soil is adequately
    treated with appropriate crop management practices in real-time during production
    cycles could prevent soil erosion and the overuse of natural or artificial resources
    to keep the soil healthy and suitable for planting. Precision agriculture traditionally
    uses expensive techniques to monitor the health of soil and crops including images
    from satellites and airplanes. Recently there are several studies using drones
    and a multitude of sensors connected to farm machinery to observe and measure
    the health of soil and crops during planting and harvesting. This paper describes
    a real-time, in-situ agricultural internet of things (IoT) device designed to
    monitor the state of the soil and the environment. This device was designed to
    be compatible with open hardware and it is composed of temperature and humidity
    sensors (soil and environment), electrical conductivity of the soil and luminosity,
    Global Positioning System (GPS) and a ZigBee radio for data communication. The
    field trial involved soil testing and measurements of the local climate in Sao
    Paulo, Brazil. The measurements of soil temperature, humidity and conductivity
    are used to monitor soil conditions. The local climate data could be used to support
    decisions about irrigation and other activities related to crop health. On-going
    research includes methods to reduce the consumption of energy and increase the

  explanation: The study constructs a low-cost, open-source agricultural device that
    utilizes sensors to monitor the soil and environmental conditions in real-time,
    targeting farmers with lower resource access. The device detects crucial data
    such as soil temperature, moisture, electrical conductivity, and luminosity, which
    is then sent to a central hub for analysis. The data is transmitted to cloud-based
    platforms (such as AWS IoT, Google Cloud IoT, and Microsoft Azure IoT) for remote
    viewing and detailed evaluation through protocols like MQTT, CoAP, or AMQP. This
    enables farmers to monitor crop health and adjust irrigation systems remotely
    to optimize water usage and enhance agricultural productivity.

    CA, USA SECTION I. Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture can be defined
    as a set of crop management techniques created to optimize agricultural production
    to enable the efficient management of the soil, the quality of the environment
    and the crops according to the unique conditions of each planting area [1]. The
    crop area that was traditionally homogeneously managed are now organized into
    several small areas, each section receiving the appropriate treatment in order
    to increase crop production [2], [3]. Precision agriculture also requires the
    monitoring of natural and local resources of each growing area [4] in order to
    minimize the impact on the local environment and resources, and also to promote
    a sustainable food production [5]. For sufficiently large farms it is useful to
    use georeferencing information technologies to map the resources of each area
    [6]. Early developments in precision agriculture focused on collecting data on
    soil and local climatic conditions using vehicle-connected sensors (on tractors
    and harvesters which operate in field activities such as soil preparation, fertilizer
    application, harvesting, or by hand-operated portable devices,), or by satellite
    imagery. Data processing was carried out at defined time intervals that may no
    longer reflect the conditions of the soil or the crop at the moment of decision-making
    [7]. Although much of the data collection in the field are still carried out sporadically
    by vehicle-connected sensors, the necessity to control the use of agricultural
    inputs and to maximize the production using the minimum quantity of agricultural
    defensives, while at the same time not damage the environment in the productive
    area in real-time are key motivators for the development of technologies applied
    in the crops [8]. Recently there are several studies using drones [9] and a multitude
    of sensors connected to farm machinery to observe and measure the health of soil
    and crops during planting and harvesting [10], [11]. The sensing technologies,
    the geographic information system (GIS) and GPS are important technologies to
    precision agriculture [12]. Current precision agriculture devices are expensive
    and typically require a high level of technical training to utilize and interpret
    the large array of information generated making it difficult for poor uneducated
    farmers to apply them to crops [13]. With the advancement of low-cost IoT devices
    the possibility to develop custom made devices that are simple, designed with
    a particular set of functionalities to reduce cost, and are situated within crops,
    make it easier for these farmers to adopt. This paper describes a real-time, in-situ
    agricultural IoT device designed to monitor the state of the soil and the local
    environment. This device was designed to be compatible with open hardware and
    is composed of sensors for temperature and humidity of both soil and the environment,
    electrical conductivity of the soil, luminosity, GPS and a Zigbee radio for data
    communication. Customized central software received data from all devices and
    automatically located each sensor on a map using GPS. The device is powered by
    solar collector which charges a battery that allows for continuous monitoring
    of the soil and also, to send data to the central software. The data is transmitted
    using open standard protocols which make it possible to integrate the data with
    any algorithm or third party platform or system. SECTION II. Iot in Precision
    Agriculture IoT devices enables network communication, data acquisition through
    sensors and actuators, and distributed processing in a low -cost hardware which
    operate for long periods of time using low-powered batteries [14]. Agriculture
    is one of the primary industries that have embraced IoT applications since wireless
    sensors networks composed of devices that can work in coordination to cover broad
    spatial areas. The advantages of collecting data to support decision making in
    real-time to control field devices (e.g. irrigation) enables the creation of a
    robust and fault tolerance system [15]. Several IoT devices have already been
    applied to agriculture settings to monitor soil conditions such as PH and humidity
    through a wireless sensor network (ZigBee for mesh network) or using cellular
    communication system''s global system for mobile communications (General Packet
    Radio Service (GPRS). Such devices communicate with a system supported by web
    technologies and using open Application Programming Interfaces (API) or even third-party
    APls to offer georeferencing services to support decision-making [7], [16],1[7],
    [18]. The proposed prototype (figure 1) was designed only with open hardware and
    open source software, and it could be built with usual components for prototyping.
    This study investigate whether such components could be organized in such architecture
    to be effective in precision agriculture. Fig. 1. Monitoring node prototype Show
    All A. Parameters to Monitoring Soil health is an essential element to be monitored
    as unbalanced water and nutrients levels may compromise the quality of the crop
    [19]. In order to design an IoT device to monitor crops a number of essential
    parameters need to be considered. These can be categorized into four types of
    parameters: the visual, physical, chemical and biological. The visual parameters
    include changes of color of the soil, dust, water uptake or growing of weed that
    could be monitored by cameras or satellite images. Physical parameters include,
    among others, soil density, texture, humidity and soil temperature. Usually, such
    parameters are measured in the laboratory using several methods as described in
    [20] and [21]. Chemical parameters include pH, electrical conductivity and nutrients
    concentration usually measured in field or laboratory tests [21]. Biological parameters
    measure the presence of microorganisms and their influence on the soil quality
    are typically detected through laboratory testing. [22], [23]. The prototype proposed
    in this paper will monitor two physical parameters (soil temperature and humidity),
    one chemical parameter (electrical conductivity) and three physical parameters
    (temperature, luminosity, and humidity). All parameters are sent to a web platform
    at regular intervals in order to analyze the data. SECTION III. The Proposed Iot
    Device The proposed system is composed of three main components: monitoring node,
    central node, and the cloud. The monitoring nodes are installed in the several
    places in the field with sensors to monitor both soil and the environment. These
    nodes connect and send data to the central node using ZigBee network. The central
    node store data from all monitoring node and send them to the cloud through the
    internet. The central node in the cloud has a web-service with functions to receive
    data from the central node and recover data from database, among other functions.
    All nodes has a solar panel to provide enough energy to make system working and
    also charge a rechargeable battery of supply output 2500mAH and 3,7V. For that
    the available solar panel had a supply output of 10W with 6V. All nodes also has
    a Raspberry Pi 3 model B with current drain between 5mA to 10mA and up to 750mW.
    The sensors used in this prototype are broadly available in several countries,
    which permits this system could be built in anyplace with the same hardware specification.
    The cost was taken into consideration and the chosen sensors provide accuracy
    measures and measurement range to provide useful data to several soil modelling
    used in agriculture. B. Monitoring Node The monitoring node (figure 2) is composed
    of a Raspberry Pi that controls data acquisition and ZigBee communication between
    monitoring nodes and between monitoring node and central node (mesh network).
    The power source of the monitoring node is a solar panel that charges a battery
    designed to operate for several hours without the need to recharge. All sensors
    and GPS are connected in digital and analogic inputs in the Raspberry Pi shield
    and all software is written in NodeJS (open source). One sensor is used to measure
    all parameters of the soil with the specification in table I [24]. Table I. Soil
    sensor specification The environmental temperature and humidity are measured for
    one sensor with the following specification (table II) [25]: Fig. 2. Structure
    of the monitoring node Show All Table II. Environmental sensor specification The
    luminosity sensor measures the amount of light intensity in lux according to table
    III specification [26]. Table III. Luminosity sensor specification The ZigBee
    network interface has the specification depicted in table IV. This network interface
    was able to transmit 250kbps at 2,4Ghz in a distance of 100m without packet loss
    (although specification of outdoor rage is 90m). C. Central Node The central node
    (figure 3) was designed to be installed on the edge of the crop or even at the
    farm headquarter and its function is to collect data from monitoring nodes and
    store them in a local NoSQL database. This database is replicated to the cloud
    from time to time when the Central node has an available network communication
    with the cloud. The Central node also has a web interface to allow the farmer
    to check the system status and has information on the parameters collected from
    the crop. A Raspberry Pi controls the ZigBee communication between central node
    and the monitoring nodes, local information storage and the synchronization with
    the cloud. Table IV. Zigbee interface specification D. Node in the Cloud The node
    in the cloud was designed with the same technologies of the other nodes. Its role
    is to organize all information from several central nodes and provide tools to
    data correlation. All data is stored in a NoSQL database for future application.
    An API developed for this prototype controls all data exchange, including an open
    data structure transported in a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) message. The
    system has a Web Service interface that control the access to all system parameters.
    In case of any new sensor or parameter to be acquired, it is just necessary to
    include the method (software) in the Web Service interface and include a new structure
    in the database do store the new data/parameter. Such change does not imply in
    any modification in all other database structure, methods and JSON messages previously
    developed. The NoSQL database has an open source interface to allow access to
    data for decision making algorithms. The relationship between all nodes of the
    proposed system is depicted in table V. Fig. 3. Structure of the central node
    Show All SECTION I. Field Trials The field trial involved soil testing and measurements
    of the local climate in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The measurements of soil temperature,
    humidity and conductivity are used to monitor soil conditions. The local climate
    data could be used to support decisions about irrigation and other activities
    related to crop health. Table V. Relationship between nodes A. Sensors Calibration
    All sensors from the proposed device was verified to check whether their measures
    were correct compared to other measurements devices. The environmental sensors
    data was compared to a thermometer and a luximeter. The soil sensor was verified
    with a procedure described in its manual [24]. The table V presents data about
    sensors. Table VI. Sensors initial measures B. Measurementsfrom the Environment
    The measurements was obtained during a 4 hour period on one day in São Bernardo
    do Campo (city in São Paulo neighborhood) and data obtained by the IoT device
    was compared with available data from two sources: (i) The CPTEC/INPE - Center
    for Weather Forecasting and Climate Studies; (ii) Weather Underground. The data
    from CPTEC/INPE was collected in the Mirante de Santana station (in São Paulo
    city - closest station from São Bernardo do Campo). From Weather Underground the
    data was collected from a station located in São Bernardo do Campo city. The IoT
    device is installed in an area close to a dam, and usually the air humidity is
    higher compared to other areas of the city. The figure 4 presents the measured
    air temperature between 13:00 and 17:00 (GMT-3). The IoT device collected one
    measurement every four minutes. The measured temperatures were compared to the
    average temperature of CPTEC/INPE and Weather Underground (table VI). The average
    temperatures from all sources indicates the similar temperature readings compared
    to the IoT device. Taking into consideration the standard deviation from sensor,
    the IoT device could offer to the farmer accurate measurements. Fig. 4. Air temperature
    measures Show All Table VII. Air temperature comparation Localised variations
    in the environment were observed on the day of the experiment which was cloudy
    and the wind was stronger after 14:00 (from 9,3km/h at 13:00 to 16,7km/h at 16:00),
    which probably brought humidity from dam compared to the Weather Underground station
    which is located close to downtown). Fig. 5. Air humidity measures Show All Table
    VIII. Air humidity comparation With a real-time information from IoT device compared
    to other information source a decision support system could do a better control
    of an irrigation system because it would estimate the influence of the humidity
    in the crop and in the soil. The luminosity measurements (figure 6) indicates
    how much solar light the system detected during the tests. According to [27] June
    is a month with few natural lighting in the area when the system was evaluated
    compared to other areas in Brazil. Data from CPTEC/INPE indicates that the day
    of test was a cloudy day, with only some moments with sun. Although CPTEC/INPE
    did not offer measures about luxes per hours, it can be observed that the most
    luminous time of the day was in the morning up to 14:00, and after that the whether
    was cloudy again. Fig. 6. Environment luminosity measures Show All C. Measurements
    of the Soil The sensor was initially installed in 10cm depth in a sample of dry
    soil of 40cm depth. The soil sample was stored in a covered area for two month
    without any addition of water. At 16:00 the irrigation process started and it
    was operating for five minutes. As it can be observed in figure 7 the soil temperature
    was stable before the irrigation process and it decreased during the process and
    it was stable after 20 minutes. Fig. 7. Soil temperature measures Show All The
    figure 8 and 9 indicates that the volume of the water in the soil increased and
    the conductivity was higher as well. Although it is was not possible to check
    by other methods the accuracy of the equipment, the reading indicates that the
    sensor was working as expected according to the specification in [24]. The measurements
    of figure 8 indicates that soil was dry (around 2.6% of the sample contained water)
    and 15 minutes after the process the soil volumetric water as stable in 20%. Given
    the stability of the measurement, this information could be used to model if such
    level of water is adequate for different type of crop. Fig. 8. Soil volumetric
    water content measures Show All Data in figure 9 is consistent with all other
    measurements since the conductivity is directly related to the presence of water
    in the soil. Studies using the same sensor [28], [29] present similar results.
    It could be observed that soil conductivity was around zero in dry soil and changed
    fast during irrigation process. The peak occurred when the water was concentrated
    near to the sensor and the measurement was stabilized when all soil was homogeneously
    wet, since the sensor was located in the middle of the sample. However, such measurements
    were not verified using methods such as TDR [30]. Fig. 9. Soil conductivity measures
    Show All D. Tests with the Battery The tests with the battery was done fully charging
    the battery and activating the IoT device without the solar panel. It was measured
    for how much time the system could operate without fail. When the measured volts
    and current in the system did not support the fully operation of the system, it
    was considered that battery was empty (for the purpose of IoT device). Table VIII
    indicates the system elapsed time of a typical test. Table IX. Battery duration
    SECTION II. Concluding Remarks We have presented a preliminary field experiment
    of an IoT device for farmers in Brazil. Sensors detected water irrigation processes
    and the data was transmitted to a central node and then to the cloud. The initial
    evaluation indicate that the proposed IoT device could detect measurements close
    to the professional measurement devices and could react to changes in the environment
    and the soil, using open hardware and prototyping hardware and software developed
    with open source API. On-going research includes more experiments, methods to
    reduce the consumption of energy, increase the number of sensors and validation
    of the results using other calibrated sensors. Soil humidity and electrical conductivity
    will be evaluated with several kind of soil samples that are used in crops in
    São Paulo State, and results will be compared to other measurements procedures
    and techniques. The local climate data could be used to support decisions on irrigation
    and other activities related to crop health. Future applications include the use
    of the IoT device to detect fire in crops, a common problem in sugar cane crops
    and the integration of the IoT device with irrigation management systems to improve
    water usage. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by Telefonica Vivo which

  description: Agriculture has long grappled with challenges ranging from unpredictable
    weather patterns and resource scarcity to crop diseases and yield fluctuations.
    However, the advent of data science and smart agriculture has introduced innovative
    solutions to address these longstanding issues. This paper examines how data-driven
    approaches, combined with technological advancements, have revolutionized agriculture.
    By integrating sensor networks, satellite imagery, and IoT devices, farmers can
    gather real-time data on soil quality, weather conditions, and crop health. These
    data are then analyzed using sophisticated algorithms, allowing for precise decision-making
    in irrigation, fertilization, and pest control. This study explores a three-tier
    smart agriculture system using LoRa technology for seamless data transmission.
    The performance is evaluated against existing frameworks, considering factors
    like cost and latency. This approach has the potential to revolutionize rural
    farming, aligning with global trends while addressing specific challenges faced
    by farmers. Smart agriculture solutions encompass deploying IoT-based sensors
    for real-time data collection, optimizing crop management and resource allocation.
    This contributes to the agricultural field by bridging the gap between data science
    and agriculture, offering a practical solution to enhance crop yield prediction
    accuracy. The integration of data science in agriculture has the potential to
    transform the sector by enhancing productivity and sustainability. By enabling
    informed decision-making, our approach has the potential to optimize resource
    allocation, reduce waste, and ultimately contribute to global food security in
    the face of mounting challenges.

    paper examines how data-driven approaches, combined with technological advancements,
    have revolutionized agriculture. By integrating sensor networks, satellite imagery,
    and IoT devices, farmers can gather real-time data on soil quality, weather conditions,
    and crop health. These data are then analyzed using sophisticated algorithms,
    allowing for precise decision-making in irrigation, fertilization, and pest control.
    This study explores a three-tier smart agriculture system using LoRa technology
    for seamless data transmission. The performance is evaluated against existing
    frameworks, considering factors like cost and latency. This approach has the potential
    to revolutionize rural farming, aligning with global trends while addressing specific
    challenges faced by farmers. Smart agriculture solutions encompass deploying IoT-based
    sensors for real-time data collection, optimizing crop management and resource
    allocation. This contributes to the agricultural field by bridging the gap between
    data science and agriculture, offering a practical solution to enhance crop yield
    prediction accuracy. The integration of data science in agriculture has the potential
    to transform the sector by enhancing productivity and sustainability. By enabling
    informed decision-making, our approach has the potential to optimize resource
    allocation, reduce waste, and ultimately contribute to global food security in
    the face of mounting challenges. Published in: 2023 IEEE North Karnataka Subsection

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Belagavi, India SECTION I. Introduction Contemporary
    farming practices exhibit increased efficiency in agricultural development compared
    to earlier periods. The early indications of significant transformations in daily
    life and agricultural supply chains are becoming evident, particularly in the
    networks for food, fiber, and bio-energy distribution. This article delves into
    the current state of industrial agriculture, drawing insights from patterns at
    the farm level, production techniques, and agri-food supply within the industrialized
    context. To realize Agriculture 4.0, we explore the integration of artificial
    intelligence, big data, and blockchain. Our proposed approach facilitates the
    continuous monitoring and management of agricultural operations via remote observation,
    underpinned by IoT, AI, and related technologies. The article hones in on key
    research challenges and applications of these emerging technologies in the agriculture
    sector, aimed at introducing novel research opportunities to industry professionals.
    Anticipating the development of foundational IoT and technological tools for agricultural
    production, we envision a future characterized by interconnected, dependable,
    and productive agriculture [1]. Traditionally, predicting crop yields was a task
    undertaken by farmers who relied on their personal experience and knowledge of
    the specific field and crop cultivation and disease identification [17], [18].
    Nevertheless, the challenge of accurately forecasting agricultural crop prices
    persists, necessitating a more data-driven approach. This challenge can be effectively
    addressed through the utilization of statistical data analysis, pattern tracking,
    visualization techniques, and other data mining methods facilitated by computer
    applications. This study presents a comprehensive model for forecasting crop prices
    by leveraging the past decade''s worth of data on agricultural field crop prices
    and incorporating detailed weather information, including rainfall data. The objective
    of this research paper is to develop a robust framework for predicting future
    crop prices that takes into account various interdependent factors. By harnessing
    a decade''s worth of historical data on agricultural field crop prices and coupling
    it with pertinent weather data, a structured approach to classifying crop prices
    emerges. In summary, this research endeavor aims to provide an innovative solution
    to the complex challenge of forecasting crop prices. Through a meticulous analysis
    of historical agricultural field crop prices and the incorporation of relevant
    weather data, this model endeavors to empower farmers with valuable insights into
    future crop pricing trends [2]. Fig. 1 Rapid growth of agriculture. Show All Agriculture
    involves the application of modern data analysis techniques to enhance decision-making
    and crop management practices. This approach leverages various advanced technologies,
    including automated steering systems, Geomapping, remote sensing, satellite positioning
    systems, and variable rate technology. The overarching goal of precision agriculture
    is to incorporate automation into the agricultural domain. However, it remains
    crucial for farmers to acquaint themselves with these technological advancements.
    Overcoming these obstacles can lead to streamlined agricultural processes and
    improved outcomes. The rapid advancement of computational methods has opened doors
    to the integration of data mining principles in agriculture. This research paper
    seeks to shed light on both the merits and demerits of precision agriculture,
    thereby offering insights to guide its effective implementation. By addressing
    the challenges and benefits, this study aims to facilitate the progress of agricultural
    practices in the right direction [3]. Agriculture''s significance as a crucial
    foundation in China is unwavering, and the constant progress in science and technology
    has consistently been accessible to all. Enhancing the scientific precision and
    convenience of farming for a broader community through intelligent technology,
    while concurrently tackling challenges and predicaments in agricultural practices,
    remains an enduring concern deserving thoughtful consideration and practical action.
    This study''s objective is to establish an innovative paradigm within the agricultural
    landscape. By harnessing the structural framework of this emerging agricultural
    knowledge base, the aim is to establish a standardized and systematic repository
    of knowledge. This encompassing repository includes an extraction corpus for agricultural
    planting data, intended to be a vital resource during data mining and model creation.
    The ultimate aspiration is to offer an effective and specialized solution in the
    form of an extensive big data corpus for crop planting. This resource is poised
    to serve as a proficient catalyst for applications involving agricultural knowledge
    graphs [4]. In agricultural fields, predominantly situated in desert areas, face
    significant climatic impacts on both crops and workers. These expansive fields
    often lie far from residential zones, posing challenges for effective monitoring
    and management. To address these issues, this study introduces an innovative smart
    irrigation system employing Zigbee technology for wireless monitoring and control.
    The system takes into account crucial parameters such as temperature, humidity,
    moisture, and gas concentration. Real-time assessment of farm conditions occurs,
    prompting automated adjustments to irrigation and cooling systems. The acquired
    data is communicated wirelessly to farmers. A unique aspect of this research involves
    modeling the system as an Agent-based framework, portraying the dynamic state
    of the agricultural field. Practical implementation and testing took place on
    a small-scale farm, effectively tracking farm status, depicting system behavior,
    and promptly responding to abnormal data. Notably, the results indicate that the
    system''s implementation enhances crop quality, leading to increased production
    levels [5]. Fig. 2 presents the existing agricultural technologies and the models.
    Fig. 2 Agricultural technologies and models. Show All The Indian agricultural
    sector has symbolized rural development movements such as the green, yellow, white,
    and blue revolutions. Serving as the driving force of the economy, a significant
    portion of the population is directly or indirectly engaged in farming. The overarching
    objective is to enhance both crop quality and quantity while optimizing labor
    input. The emergence of smart farming and the integration of the Internet of Things
    into agriculture are propelling a potential Third Green Revolution. Given the
    current circumstances, the adoption of smart agriculture has become an imperative.
    This research was conducted in the delta districts of Tamil Nadu, aiming to assess
    farmers'' characteristics and their knowledge regarding the adoption of smart
    agricultural practices. Furthermore, the study delved into identifying the significant
    challenges that farmers encounter when adopting smart agricultural techniques.
    Ultimately, the insights from this study can serve as valuable guidance for policymakers
    in comprehending farmers'' perceptions toward embracing smart agriculture. Enhancing
    the well-being of farmers not only benefits them individually but also contributes
    to the overall growth of the country [6]. SECTION II. Related Work With the continuous
    advancement of the Internet of Things, the realm of smart agriculture is undergoing
    a rapid evolution. Leveraging IoT-based solutions presents farmers with the opportunity
    to augment profits and decrease manual labor demands on their agricultural fields.
    Intelligent agricultural systems harness efficient, cost-effective sensors strategically
    positioned around crops and within fields, gathering real-time data on crop status
    and environmental factors. This data serves dual purposes: immediate decision-making
    and long-term planning for improved outcomes. However, there exist hurdles such
    as communication delays, bandwidth usage, sporadic internet connectivity in rural
    locales, and cost implications that warrant attention. This article delves into
    our ongoing endeavors concerning a three-tier smart agriculture system founded
    on LoRa technology: (i) Sensing, (ii) Fog, and (iii) Cloud layers. Our primary
    focus lies in harnessing LoRa''s characteristics of low-power consumption and
    extended range to convert traditional rural Indian farmlands into hubs of intelligent
    agriculture. This initiative holds the potential to revolutionize agriculture
    in rural settings, aligning with the broader global trend driven smart agriculture
    while being tailored to address the specific challenges faced by Indian farmers.
    [7]. This study takes a focused approach towards leveraging technology to forecast
    fertilizer requirements, thereby amplifying crop yields and financial gains. The
    task of fertilizer prediction, a cornerstone of agriculture, involves the intricate
    determination of the most suitable type and optimal amount of fertilizers for
    specific crops. Despite its pivotal role, this task presents formidable challenges,
    directly impacting both crop yields and the overarching goal of environmental
    sustainability. To transcend these challenges, the research harnesses the Random
    Forest machine learning technique, selected for its demonstrated superiority in
    accuracy when compared to methods like linear regression and K-Nearest Neighbours.
    By assimilating historical conditions and insights from farmers through Kaggle
    datasets, this study establishes a predictive framework capable of suggesting
    appropriate fertilizers based on a comprehensive analysis of environmental, soil,
    and plant-related factors. As a result, the research contributes significantly
    to the realm of fertilization strategy forecasting, tailored to the unique conditions
    encompassing each agricultural scenario. In the larger context, this undertaking
    exemplifies the marriage of traditional agricultural wisdom with cutting-edge
    technology, promising a future where precision agriculture thrives and yields
    are maximized in harmony with ecological sustainability [8]. This research delves
    into the realm of smart agriculture powered by Internet of Things technologies,
    which have significantly transformed conventional farming methods. The infusion
    of sensors and devices into the agricultural landscape has generated copious amounts
    of data, driving the need for effective data management and transfer due to challenges
    in data volume and storage. The study''s primary objective is to examine and contrast
    diverse data reduction methods aimed at optimizing IoT data transmission within
    smart agriculture. The evaluation of these techniques employs a specialized real-time
    dataset tailored for smart agricultural systems, encompassing five key features:
    ambient air temperature, ambient air moisture, soil temperature, soil moisture,
    and soil pH. The assessment of the techniques is based on three core metrics:
    information loss, computational cost, and energy consumption, while factoring
    in the size of each transmitted sample. The implementation of the three data reduction
    methods is realized using the Python programming language. The findings emphasize
    the existence of a delicate balance between information loss, computational expenditure,
    and energy usage, warranting meticulous consideration when selecting an appropriate
    data reduction technique for IoT nodes in the context of smart agriculture applications.
    This analysis furnishes valuable insights for informed decision-making that effectively
    balances these factors, duly accounting for distinct application prerequisites
    and constraints [9]. Precision agriculture deploys sensors to monitor vital environmental
    factors like temperature, humidity, and water levels. Despite infrequent update
    needs for these attributes, sensors continuously transmit data, causing significant
    redundancy. This inefficiency wastes network resources and unnecessary energy.
    To tackle this, the LEACH routing protocol is introduced as a self-regulating,
    energy-efficient solution. Optimizing data aggregation, it aims to improve network
    efficiency and energy conservation. LEACH organizes sensor nodes into clusters
    with designated cluster heads that collect and summarize data before transmitting
    it to a central base station. This approach drastically reduces redundant data
    transmission, aided by the dynamic selection of cluster heads, which balances
    energy distribution among nodes. Traditional data aggregation methods directly
    transmit raw data to a central base station, causing redundancy and energy drain.
    In contrast, LEACH''s emphasis on aggregating data at its source mitigates network
    congestion and wasteful energy use. The study evaluates LEACH''s effectiveness
    against conventional data aggregation through energy efficiency, network durability,
    and data accuracy metrics. Simulations and empirical analysis provide insights
    into the protocol''s benefits and limitations across diverse scenarios. Overall,
    the LEACH protocol offers a promising solution to the challenge of redundant data
    transmission, contributing to energy-efficient precision agriculture [10]. In
    the contemporary era, the proliferation of IoT devices and emerging technologies
    has led to an exponential surge in data creation. Novel strategies are emerging
    to effectively manage such extensive data volumes. Leveraging this data to make
    informed decisions in agriculture, in tandem with the integration of smart agricultural
    techniques, holds the potential to revolutionize traditional farming practices.
    The efficacy of smart agriculture hinges on the seamless synchronization of diverse
    devices, where pivotal tasks include data retrieval, storage, and analysis. Traditional
    approaches, however, grapple with challenges such as data security, privacy concerns,
    real-time decision-making, and the handling of semi-structured and unstructured
    data when confronted with substantial data generation. In the realm of smart agriculture,
    Probabilistic Data Structures have emerged as a potent and efficient solution
    for managing data and facilitating real-time responses. This study is dedicated
    to thoroughly analyzing the implementation of PDS applications within the domain
    of smart agriculture. Delving into the foundations, challenges, unexplored research
    avenues, and potential trajectories of smart agriculture, this paper aims to comprehensively
    elucidate the role of PDS. It caters to readers and researchers eager to broaden
    their understanding of this domain and seeks to identify uncharted research opportunities
    within this evolving field [11], [12]. With the global population on the rise,
    the demand for increased crop production is becoming more pressing. Despite current
    efforts where farmers cater to global food requirements, challenges like dwindling
    horticultural space, resource depletion, and a growing population underscore the
    necessity to enhance agricultural yields. This has sparked the emergence of smart
    farming, a term encompassing a range of innovations by startups, technology pioneers,
    and governments aimed at bolstering overall crop output. SF involves integrating
    data, communication technologies, hardware, and sensors into agricultural systems
    to yield more insightful information. Detecting plant diseases efficiently using
    advanced algorithms becomes a crucial task in this context. The research paper
    addresses three key dimensions: firstly, an effective approach for disease detection
    and cavity area identification through the Image Segmentation Algorithm; secondly,
    the application of diverse data analysis methods tailored for improved crop management,
    including the use of an optical transducer for detecting Nitrogen, Phosphorous,
    and Potash levels in soil, as well as soil moisture content assessment through
    sensors; and thirdly, the utilization of machine learning algorithms to predict
    fertilizer quantities based on soil sample features, thereby aiding farmers in
    accurate amount estimation [13], [19], [20]. Drones, also recognized as unmanned
    aerial vehicles , have predominantly been linked with military and industrial
    functions. Nevertheless, recent strides in sensor and information technology have
    broadened their applications, encompassing sectors like agriculture. With the
    world''s population set to reach 9 billion by 2055, addressing the surge in agricultural
    demand is imperative. While agriculture holds immense promise, it grapples with
    multifaceted challenges—labor scarcity, erratic weather, inadequate fertilization,
    and health risks from chemicals and pests. Leveraging advanced technologies, particularly
    drones, holds the potential to tackle these hurdles. Drones play pivotal roles
    in irrigation, crop supervision, soil analysis, field evaluation, and pest management.
    Their evolution incorporates open-source solutions, advanced sensors, extended
    flight durations, and versatility in tasks spanning crime prevention to disaster
    monitoring. This research seeks to underscore the pivotal role of drones in agriculture
    and assess the finest drones available for crop and field monitoring. The objective
    is to elevate crop quality, forestall field deterioration, and foster sustainable
    agricultural practices. [14] New Agricultural Financial Entities encounter obstacles
    in their advancement due to financial constraints stemming from information disparities
    among financiers, limited collateral choices, and internal limitations. To mitigate
    these challenges, a pioneering strategy is put forth in this study. It harnesses
    the tamper-resistant and decentralized attributes of Blockchain technology in
    combination with the robust capabilities of Big Data for data mining, analysis,
    and processing. This inventive framework seeks to institute a reliable mechanism
    aimed at effectively tackling the financial barriers. By leveraging Blockchain''s
    transparency and data integrity, and utilizing Big Data''s analytical power, this
    approach intends to foster a secure and credible environment for financing transactions.
    The proposed solution addresses the lack of information symmetry by ensuring transparency
    and immutability of financial records through Blockchain. This empowers financiers
    alike with accurate and accessible information, reducing risks and enhancing trust.
    Furthermore, the integration of Big Data technology enhances risk assessment,
    enabling more informed lending decisions while expanding collateral options through
    comprehensive data analysis. Through this novel framework, can potentially access
    the funding they require, overcoming their financial impediments. By establishing
    a secure and efficient financing ecosystem, this approach aims to not only boost
    the progress contribute to the broader growth of the agricultural sector. As a
    result, this study''s innovative fusion of Blockchain and Big Data technologies
    presents a promising avenue for transforming the landscape of agricultural finance
    [15], [16]. SECTION III. Research Gap A significant challenge in the field of
    agriculture is the lack of integration and interconnectedness among various domains
    within the sector. This lack of synergy between different aspects of agriculture
    poses several drawbacks and limitations. Additionally, the slow adoption of advanced
    algorithms and combinational methods further compounds these challenges. Figure
    3 presents however, the isolation of these domains can lead to fragmented information
    and siloed decision-making. Farmers and stakeholders may lack a comprehensive
    view of their operations, making it difficult to optimize resource allocation
    and respond effectively to changing conditions. Without effective integration
    of agricultural domains, potential synergies between different aspects of farming
    remain untapped. For instance, if weather forecasts could be combined with soil
    data and crop growth patterns, farmers could make more informed decisions on irrigation
    and planting schedules. The absence of such interconnectedness hampers the ability
    to leverage valuable insights and seize opportunities for improved efficiency
    and productivity. Fig. 3. Interconnection of domains and revealing significance.
    Show All The lack of integrated data and algorithms contributes to inefficient
    resource management. For instance, fertilizers and pesticides might be applied
    uniformly across a field, regardless of variations in soil conditions or pest
    prevalence. This leads to unnecessary expenses, environmental impact, and reduced
    profitability. Sustainable agriculture requires careful consideration of environmental
    factors, resource use, and economic viability. Integrating algorithms and combinational
    methods could help identify optimal approaches for minimizing environmental impact
    while maintaining profitability. The absence of such integration could hinder
    the adoption of sustainable practices. Addressing these drawbacks necessitates
    a concerted effort to bridge the gaps between different agricultural domains and
    to accelerate the adoption of advanced algorithms and methods. Collaboration among
    researchers, technologists, policymakers, and farmers is essential to develop
    holistic solutions that optimize agricultural operations and contribute to a more
    resilient and sustainable future. SECTION IV. Proposed system Table 1 presents
    the gradations of disputes by incorporating Edge Computing into the IOT framework
    for climate determination in agriculture, we can leverage its advantages of real-time
    analysis, reduced data transmission, immediate responses, enhanced data privacy,
    scalability, and efficient handling of data volume. This innovative approach empowers
    farmers with actionable insights, enabling them to make informed decisions promptly
    and effectively manage climate conditions for optimal agricultural outcomes. Edge
    Computing is a paradigm that involves processing data closer to the data source,
    at the ''edge'' of the network, rather than sending all data to a centralized
    cloud server for analysis. In the context of agriculture and climate determination,
    this means that IOT devices equipped with sensors can process and analyse data
    locally, on-site, without the need to transmit all data to a distant cloud server.
    This reduces latency and enables faster decision-making. Table 2 presents the
    summary of various techniques especially Big Data analytics empowers stakeholders
    to make data-driven decisions by providing actionable insights based on comprehensive
    analyses. This can result in more informed market strategies and risk management.
    Probabilistic Data Structures might not offer the same level of data-driven decision
    support due to their limitations in handling complex, multidimensional data. In
    conclusion, while Probabilistic Data Structures have their place in specific data
    manipulation tasks, the intricate and multifaceted nature of Global Trade and
    Market Dynamics in agriculture benefits significantly from the capabilities of
    Big Data analytics. With its ability to handle comprehensive datasets, identify
    patterns, provide real-time insights, scale to accommodate growth, offer contextual
    understanding, and drive data-driven decisions, Big Data analytics stands as the
    preferred choice for efficiently determining global trade and market dynamics
    in agriculture. TABLE I. Comparison of several methods As compared with time taken
    TABLE II. Comparison of Several Methods As compared with time taken SECTION V.
    CONCLUSION & FUTURE SCOPE In conclusion IoT-driven smart agriculture is revolutionizing
    the farming landscape, bolstering productivity and minimizing labor through the
    power of data-driven solutions. The seamless integration of real-time data capture
    and strategic sensor deployment empowers agile decision-making and strategic long-range
    planning. However, it''s important to confront hurdles like communication bottlenecks,
    financial implications, and connectivity challenges head-on. The convergence of
    machine learning with agriculture, as evidenced by techniques such as Random Forest,
    holds the potential to revolutionize crop yields through precise fertilizer predictions.
    This is particularly pivotal in meeting the global demand for sustenance. The
    strategic adoption of LoRa technology within the realm of intelligent agriculture
    opens doors to innovative breakthroughs, especially within rural Indian settings,
    presenting transformative solutions to age-old agricultural obstacles. Drones
    stand as indispensable tools, playing a pivotal role in overseeing crops, alleviating
    labor scarcities, and mitigating pest-related concerns. By incorporating Probabilistic
    Data Structures, the management of the copious data generated by IoT devices in
    agriculture gains efficiency and effectiveness. Moreover, the fusion of Blockchain
    and Big Data technologies has the capacity to overhaul agricultural financing,
    instilling transparency and fostering exponential growth. This amalgamation of
    technological prowess and agricultural acumen propels efficiency, sustainability,
    and advancement within the realm of farming, ushering in an era of unprecedented
    progress implementing the real time. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics

    India Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction In the last few years, IoT has gained
    much attention and is affecting every aspect of life. IoT is changing the way
    information is collected and being transmitted. IoT network is built with smart
    devices having processing, and communication capabilities. Embedded systems, cloud
    computing, sensors, wireless communication technologies, and web-enabled application
    are some of the backend technologies that are integrating smartness with the devices
    and making IoT implementation possible. Deployment of IoT has a great social,
    economic, and environmental impact. IoT has been deployed in many applications
    such as smart mobility, smart grid, smart homes, industrial control, and agriculture.
    Wireless communication technologies play an important role in a role providing
    the communication method between the IoT sensor nodes and also with cloud services.
    Some of the wireless communication technologies successfully deployed in IoT are
    ZigBee, RFID, NFC, Bluetooth, BLE, LTE, 6LoPWAN, Sigfox, and LoRa. Every technology
    has its advantages and disadvantages, in this article communication range and
    power efficiency of various technologies are reviewed. [1], [2] Precision Agriculture
    is yet another area emerging and gaining importance as an application of IoT due
    to the projected world population and impact of inefficient agricultural practices
    on the environment. Precision Agriculture requires monitoring of soil and weather
    conditions for better decision making. IoT adopted for Precision Agriculture uses
    wireless communication technologies for the collection of the agricultural parameters.
    The most common wireless communication technologies used in agriculture are ZigBee,
    Bluetooth, SigFox, WiFi, and LoRa [3]. In the present article popular and important
    wireless communication technologies are reviewed for their technical specification
    mainly communication range and power efficiency. The technical specifications
    of every technology have a great impact on the utilization of specific communication
    technology in IoT applications. The communication range decides how far the wireless
    node can be placed for monitoring and control, power efficiency decides the operation
    period i.e. lifespan of the wireless node. In the last, the article concluded
    with the suggestion for the suitable technologies for Precision Agriculture based
    on communication range and power efficiency. For open field monitoring and control
    applications LoRa is a good choice offering a long communication range with power
    efficiency, ZigBee is suitable for indoor or Greenhouse monitoring with short-range
    and good power efficiency. SECTION II. IOT and Wireless Communication Technologies
    IoT provides the system with the capability of monitoring and control. IoT idea
    was initiated in 1999 and was to make devices intelligent through the installation
    of sensors, processing units and giving them communication capabilities. The number
    of connected devices by IoT has been forecasted as 2000 billion by 2050. In IoT
    communication is the most important aspect and IoT mainly deploys wireless commutation
    methods for data transmission. Many wireless communication technologies are available
    for IoT with associated advantages and disadvantages. Some of the wireless communication
    technologies are Bluetooth, BLE, ZigBee, Wi-Fi, WiMax, etc. For short-range Bluetooth,
    BLE and ZigBee are used whereas LoRa and WiFi are the technologies for long-distance
    communication [1]. IoT has a wide range of applications including social gaming,
    industry, healthcare, logistics. These applications comprise smart devices that
    transmit/receive data and make the decision to help humans. For such IoT-based
    applications ICT is used for the transmission of information from human to human,
    human to machine, and machine to machine. Wireless communication technologies
    for IoT are divided or categorized into LPWAN and Short Range Network. Different
    wireless communication technologies falling under the LPWAN and Short Range Network
    are summarized in Figure 1. Figure 1 IoT wireless communication technologies Show
    All SigFox is a low-power technology capable of transmitting data up to 50 Km
    and suitable for only low data rates. Cellular is suitable for applications where
    a high data rate is desired. ZigBee supports different network topologies like
    mesh, star, tree and has longer battery life. BLE is characterized as low power
    technology and with low setup time. RFID uses preprogrammed RFID tags, which can
    be an active tag or passive tag. RFID cannot be used for direct measurement and
    diagnosis due to its preprogrammed nature. NFC uses technology almost similar
    to RFID [2]. IoT is the communication of the future by transforming real-world
    devices/objects into smart devices. IoT aims to unite every object in the work
    in such a way that humans can control them via the internet. IoT depicts the trisectional
    relationship between things, humans, and the internet as shown in Figure 2. Figure
    2 Trisectional relationship of IoT Show All It has been projected that by 2025
    about 75 billion devices will be connected over the internet and IoT will be a
    market of over $300 billion. IoT mainly communicates information via wireless
    communication technologies such as F As per records these are the people who have
    filled the form but not vaccinated to date; get it filled as otherwise they may
    not be allowed to join on campus duties RFID, LR-WPANs, Zways, LTE, LoRa, NFC,
    UWB, M2M, 6LoWPAN. Technical specifications for some of the wireless communication
    technologies are provided in table 1. Table 1 Technical Specifications of Wireless
    Communication Technologies [1] [3] [4] RFID consists of a reader and tags. Each
    tag is associated with a specific address. RFID is used for real-time monitoring
    without the requirement of line-of-sight communication with humans. IEEE802.15.4
    is the standard for LR-WPAN with the working model at 915 MHz. Z-waves are the
    communication protocol for home automation networks with low power consumption.
    Distance between 2 communicating nodes in Z-wave cannot be greater than 30 meters.
    LTE is the high-speed data transfer communication protocol with low latency and
    higher data throughput. NFC is a technology very much similar to RFID and is being
    recognized as RFID integrated into the mobile phone. NFC is a short-range, low-power
    communication technology capable of transferring a small amount of information
    between two devices. UWB is also a short-range communication technology similar
    to NFC but supports bandwidth up to 500Mhz against 13.56 MHz for NFC. LoRa is
    the communication technology used for long-range connectivity in rural areas and
    industries [3]. By 2024 IoT industry is expected to rise by a 4.3 trillion-dollar
    market with applications such as smart cities, smart homes, military, healthcare,
    farming, and many more. IoT architecture comprises four layers namely the actuation
    layer, communication layer, IoT management layer, and application layer. The communication
    layer connects the various layers in IoT architecture and transmits the sensor
    data. Based on communication range and bandwidth requirement, figure 3 shows the
    categorization of wireless communication technologies. Figure 3 IoT wireless communication
    technologies range vs bandwidth Show All The classification of different IoT wireless
    communication technologies is provided in figure 4. NFC and RFID are the technologies
    for the ultra-low range. The main difference between RFID and NFC is of the operating
    frequency range, NFC operates in medium and RFID operated in the highfrequency
    range. NFC data rate varies from 106 to 424 Kbits/s and communication range is
    from 100cm to1m while RFID communication range is 10m to 200mnwith data rate from
    40 Kbits/s to 640 Kbits/s. Bluetooth works at 2.4Ghz and is classified into 4
    classes based on communication distance. BLE or Bluetooth 4.0 has increased range
    and optimized power usage. Bluetooth 5 is also better in power utilization with
    linger battery lifetime higher data rate and speed. ZigBee and Z-wave are some
    of the other wireless communication technologies in the short-range. LoRa, NbIoT,
    and SigFox are wireless technologies for long-distance communication. LoRa and
    SigFox use unlicensed frequency and while NB-IoT operated on a licensed frequency
    band. SigFox has a data rate up to 100bps while LoRa data rate varies from 300bps
    to 37.5Kbps. Both works in the sub-1GHz spectrum. LoRa offers a communication
    range of up to 2 Km while on th3e other hand up to 15 Km while SigFox has a communication
    range up to 30Km [4]. Figure 4 IoT wireless communication technologies Classification
    based on communication range Show All In IoT, energy-efficient and reliable communication
    is an important aspect. LoRa consumes about 1-10mA of current whereas the current
    rating of WiFi is 100-350mA, Bluetooth rating is 1-35mA and that of ZigBee is
    1-10mA. LoRa offers a communication range of up to 2Km while on the other hand,
    different wireless communication technologies offer a range of about from 1-100m
    only. LoRa also offers the data security of 128 bits [5]. SECTION III. Wireless
    Communication Technologies and Precision Agriculture The world population is expected
    to grow by 9.2 billion by 2050. Which may result in food shortage. Precision Agriculture
    is the technological solution to eh sought problem of food shortage along with
    water scarcity and deterioration of soil properties. In article [6], three WSN
    narrowband IoT wireless communication technologies, NB-IoT, LoRa, and ZigBee are
    analyzed for their power consumption and communication range for applications
    in Precision Agriculture. If the range is not a constrain, ZigBee is the most
    suitable technology for agriculture applications. ZigBee falls in short-distance
    communication technology and offers the best power efficiency. But if the communication
    distance is an important factor then NB-IoT and LoRa are suitable options for
    agricultural applications. They offer a coverage range of up to 15Km. But the
    disadvantage with NB-IoT is that it comes up with a monthly subscription cost
    while LoRa works on an unlicensed frequency band. Both offer good power efficiency
    [6]. Due to the social and environmental implications, smart farming is the need
    of the modern world. Under such a situation IoT offers novel solutions and smart
    applications in the agriculture field. The data collection and its management
    through the underlying communications technologies and protocols, mainly application
    layer protocols of IoT architecture are an important aspect of IoT. Various application
    layer protocols in IoT architecture are summarized in figure 5. In terms of power
    consumption CoAP is the best followed by MQTT. The sequence of IoT application-layer
    communication protocols in decreasing power consumption is HTTP, AMQP, MQTT, and
    CoAP. When the latency is compared, irrespective of QoS (Quality of Service),
    CoAP showed less latency than MQTT. Latency of MQTT shows variance with change
    is QoS factor. As for the deployment of protocols in smart farming is considered,
    MQTT and REST protocols are used for simple and small applications such as soil
    water content measurement, controlling of water pump and measurement of atmospheric
    pressure, relative humidity, etc. For smart farming prototypes employed in medium
    and large applications MQTT, CoAP, REST, and sometimes MQTT and CoAP combinedly
    are used [7]. Applications of IoT in Precision Agriculture are elaborated in the
    article [8]. The major applications areas of IoT in agriculture are identified
    as monitoring, control, and tracking. About 70% of the study of IoT in agriculture
    is focused on, monitoring, 25% on control, and only 5% of the total work on Precision
    Agriculture are focused on tracking. Major agricultural applications or activities
    being supported by IoT are monitoring of temperature, humidity, fertilization,
    disease development, animals, water, irrigation, and monitoring of air conditions.
    In the article, the major IoT wireless communication technologies presented for
    Precision Agriculture are RFID, ZigBee, WiFi, Bluetooth LoRa [8]. WSN employed
    in agriculture fields can provide a large amount of information to farmers. WSN
    nodes are generally battery-operated and incorporate sensors and RF modules. Figure
    5 IoT Application layer communication protocols Show All Few of the IoT wireless
    communication technologies deployed in agriculture are provided in figure 6. ZigBee
    is considered the best protocol for agricultural applications. Many applications
    are developed using ZigBee such as irrigation supervision, water quality management,
    cattle localization systems, WSN-based Greenhouse, etc. ZigBeebased sensor nodes
    can communicate up to a distance of 100m. ZigBee offers good power efficiency
    when made to switch between active and sleep modes. Bluetooth is preferred for
    portable devices with a communication distance of up to 10m. Various agricultural
    applications deploying Bluetooth are weather monitoring, soil moisture monitoring,
    temperature monitoring, and irrigation monitoring. The main advantages of using
    Bluetooth are low power, availability, and ease of use by countrymen. LoRa with
    specifications as low power consumption and long-distance communication range
    is also deployed in many agriculture applications such as smart irrigation, green
    area monitoring, fertilization improvement, and many more. If power efficiency
    is looked at ZigBee, SigFox, and LoRa are the best-suited technology providing
    the best power efficiency and thereafter next comes Classic Bluetooth, WiFi and
    WiFi come under the category of high-power consumption technologies. As for communication
    range, LoRa offers a communication range up to 5Km, Sigfox up to 15Km, BLE up
    to 10m, and ZigBee, classic Bluetooth offers a communication range from 10100m.
    LoRa and SigFox are the best contenders if the cost of deployment for agricultural
    applications is considered, thereafter comes the WiFi, BLE, Bluetooth, and ZigBee
    [9]. In IoT-based smart irrigation systems, air monitoring, humidity, rain wind
    soil moisture, soil temperature, and weather forecast are important monitored
    parameters. In smart irrigation systems, the wireless communication technologies
    deployed are GSM, WiFi, ZigBee, Bluetooth, LoRa, 4G, 6LoWPAN. Among all the available
    wireless communication technologies, most of the literature is published using
    WiFi for smart irrigation followed by GSM, ZigBee, Bluetooth, LoRa, and 6LoWPAN.
    LoRa is not much exploited and is left with many opportunities in Precision Agriculture
    [10]. In article [11], the performance of WSN networks under varied vegetation
    conditions for irrigation systems is tested. The proposed system was developed
    using an ESP32 WiFi node. On the basis of coverage range and acceptable quality,
    the best results were obtained when sensor nodes are installed near the ground.
    Figure 6 Communication technologies for agriculture Show All The sensors are required
    in agriculture for collecting weather, crop, and soil information for distributed
    land for monitoring, fertilization and water requirement, and different crop requirements
    based on weather and soil conditions. Various agricultural operations/activities
    where WSN has to be used are fertilization, greenhouse monitoring and control,
    irrigation, pest control, animal and pasture monitoring, Horticulture, and Viticulture.
    The article has focused on the use of ZigBee, Bluetooth, and WiFi in Precision
    Agriculture [12]. IoT requires technologies capable of providing cost low cost,
    power-efficient, and simple solutions for end devices with wireless communication
    over a long distance. LPWAN technologies such as SigFox, NB-IoT, and LoRaWAN are
    some of the technologies that qualify the IoT requirements for end devices. LoRa
    is being deployed successfully in many applications such as wellbeing monitoring,
    traffic monitoring, smart city applications, and agriculture monitoring. LoRa
    not only offers the possibility of creating a private network but also integrates
    itself with other IoT platforms [13]. LoRa is low power and long-range wireless
    communication technology for IoT applications. Lora offers much better scalability
    than the pure Aloha protocol. For 1000 devices per gateway, LoRa losses 32% of
    the transmitted packets while Aloha 90% of the packet loss is observed [14]. LoRa
    is operated on a battery and its battery can last up to 5 years. LoRa is being
    deployed in many applications such as healthcare, industrial control, home automation,
    smart cities, environmental monitoring, smart chain and logistics, and irrigation
    monitoring and control. The proposed pump control system for irrigation uses LoRa
    as transmitting and receiver in the control unit. The control and monitoring are
    done through a mobile application developed using MIT app inventor [15]. LoRa
    is different from other suitable wireless protocols for IoT like ZigBee, NRF,
    or Bluetooth in terms of throughput, communication range, and network topology.
    The system proposed for irrigation in agriculture uses LoRa as collector and executor.
    The collector LoRa node was equipped with different sensors to collect and transmit
    the agricultural data. Executor LoRa nodes control the actuators for the irrigation
    of fields [16]. SECTION IV. Conclusion IoT with wireless communication technologies
    is providing a suitable solution to agriculture. IoT makes the system smarter
    and provides the capability of monitoring and control in different application
    areas such as healthcare, industry, and Precision Agriculture. Various IoT wireless
    communication technologies deployed in agriculture are ZigBee, Bluetooth, WiFi,
    RFID, GSM, 4G, SigFox, and LoRa. ZigBee is suitable for short-distance communication
    and offers good power efficiency and scalability but is not suitable for long-distance
    communication range. If a long communication range along with power efficiency
    and acceptable data rate is required, then LoRa is the suitable choice for monitoring
    and control of agriculture parameters. Sigfox also offers good power efficiency
    and a long communication range but is limited in data rate. IoT with wireless
    communication technologies collect the information and provides it to farmers
    related to weather, atmosphere, and soil conditions. The collected information
    helps the farmers to plan agricultural activities efficiently. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

  description: In developing countries like India, where agriculture plays a major
    role a smart sensor for controlling the environmental changes in areas where crop
    fields are grown is necessary. For improving the productivity of the crop using
    less quantity of water as well as to reduce the complexity this Raspberry Pi based
    internet of things (IoT) irrigation system has been developed. On whole day, these

  explanation: The research presented in the paper "Smart Irrigation for Enhanced
    Agriculture Production using IoT" focuses on developing a smart irrigation system
    using sensors, IoT, and MQTT protocol to monitor and optimize irrigation management.
    The system uses various sensors (temperature, moisture, humidity, and light intensity)
    to gather real-time data on environmental conditions and crop health. This data
    is transmitted to a cloud platform via the MQTT protocol, where it is analyzed
    and used to automate irrigation decisions based on crop-specific needs and weather
    conditions.
  extract_1: The proposed system utilizes the MQTT protocol for transmitting sensor
    data to the cloud platform. MQTT is specifically designed for IoT applications
    and provides reliable and efficient data transmission over constrained networks.
  extract_2: The system continuously monitors environmental conditions and crop health
    using sensors, and this data is transmitted to the cloud in real-time. This enables
    remote access and analysis of the data, allowing for timely and informed decision-making
    regarding irrigation management.

    Abstract In developing countries like India, where agriculture plays a major role
    a smart sensor for controlling the environmental changes in areas where crop fields
    are grown is necessary. For improving the productivity of the crop using less
    quantity of water as well as to reduce the complexity this Raspberry Pi based
    internet of things (IoT) irrigation system has been developed. On whole day, these
    environmental changes are controlled using IoT through simple message transfer
    protocol (SMTP) and message queue telemetry transport protocol (MQTT) having temperature
    sensor, moisture sensor, gas sensor and LDR where information from all these sensors
    estimates the need of water to the fields. Message queue telemetry transport protocol
    (MQTT) having high-speed data transmission both the old data and the current data
    collected by the sensors are sent to Message queue telemetry transport client.
    To analyze the weather conditions and to increase the yield of crops precision
    agriculture with cloud computing using water fertilizers has been implemented.

    Chapter © 2024 1 Introduction The main factor for the agriculture is to predict
    the weather, climatic changes and also mainly to predict that when the atmosphere
    conditions are going to change. Here, both the automated irrigation system and
    the IoT is employed for the irrigation monitoring. It will be helpful for us when
    to irrigate the crop or field at what conditions will the crop be able to sustain
    and also the other environment and also the other changes. To monitor the weather
    and climatic conditions which are varying with the time and space, so the use
    of these electrical devices in the agriculture has been increasing rapidly. So
    the use of these WSN technology is applied to the irrigation systems, and it automatically
    removes high risk to the cable line due to the automatic operations of the machines
    [1]. Due to the high cost of the WSN system modules, we are not using these type
    of technology and also it requires high energy for the data transmission between
    the client and server. So we will use the IoT and with the help of the IoT we
    are employing the several systems in the different crop fields by naming it as
    the clients and this clients, which is getting reported every time to the server
    about the status of the crop, climatic changes of the temperature, humidity, and
    also the moisture of the certain place. So that the watering and also the when
    the pesticides can be served based on the conditions on the field. The paper is
    organized as follows: Section 2 describes the literature survey. Section 3 explains
    the proposed system in which the environmental changes are controlled using IoT
    through simple message transfer protocol (SMTP) and message queue telemetry transport
    protocol (MQTT). Section 4 mentions about the hardware description. In Sect. 5,
    results are discussed. Finally, conclusion in Sect. 6. 2 Literature Survey Wireless
    sensor network and GPRS module are used in automatic irrigation system as shown
    in Fig. 1. A wireless sensor network in which the required parameter sensors are
    placed in the root zone of the crops. To transmit the information received through
    sensors, it has gate way unit and trigger acculators [2]. To know the required
    amount of water starting values of soil moisture and temperature are taken into
    consideration and algorithm is developed. It uses photovoltaic panel and cellular
    internet communication link for data transference and irrigation check. First
    and foremost, it uses expensive and complex algorithms to get the required information.
    Secondly, it doesn’t help to control the environmental changes and low-communication
    speed. Fig. 1 GPRS module in automated irrigation system Full size image 2.1 Smart
    Phone Irrigation Taking agricultural crops into consideration, irrigation sensor
    was designed. The camera captures the images of the soil and roots of the crop
    to estimate the requirement of water. To estimate the wet and dry area of the
    crop using antireflective glass window an android app was developed so that this
    app activates the device to capture the images. A Wi-Fi connection is also needed
    to control the irrigation as in Fig. 2. This model addresses a lot of issues like
    having a smart phone with a Wi-Fi connection resulting in battery issues of phone,
    poor signal and time consuming. Fig. 2 Smart phone irrigation Full size image
    2.2 Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) To get the best crop conduction, increase the
    productivity WSN is used as in Fig. 3. Many environmental parameters are sensed
    using sensors which continuously sends the data about water shortage. The soil
    conditions, need of water and climatic changes are known by using a Bluetooth
    device [3, 4]. This Bluetooth is used to transfer the information from sender
    to the receiver. Though this model is of low cost and gives the output results,
    it cannot recollect the old data, and it is less secure weather forecasting cloud
    technologies are not used. Fig. 3 Wireless sensor network Full size image 2.3
    IoT in Agriculture IoT has the ability to rule the world in many industries, smart
    cities and especially when it comes to agricultural sector it has a great wallop.
    The conventional based farming approach is too difficult when compared to smart
    farming based IoT [5, 6]. It has great advantages like less water usage, control
    over environment and updated input treatments. It makes stock man and farmers
    to get the useful data, making the farmers understand the process by installing
    the necessary smart ways to increase the productivity as in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 IoT
    in agriculture Full size image 2.4 Drone Applications of IoT in Agriculture It
    is one if the best application of today’s growing technology. It handles crop
    health, irrigation, crop records, crop spraying and soil field analysis. Drones
    get the data by insight monitoring and observations [7]. To select a ground resolution
    farmer, enter the data so that plant height measurement, yield prediction and
    so on can be identified. It is used by many organizations and one of the most
    recognized application of IoT agricultural division. It utilizes various sensors,
    control systems, robotics, automated hardware, free vehicles [8]. It adopts high-speed
    internet, mobile devices and low-cost satellites are few technological trends.
    The chance of crops being damaged will be reduced if accuracy of weather is high.
    It is used for food production and safety. Agriculture IoT not only concentrates
    on increasing the productivity of the crop and control of weather conditions but
    also takes responsibility about food security like storage transportation, etc.
    Shipping time, storage temperature and cloud-based records are monitored by this
    system. 3 Proposed System In the present system, we are using the crop field algorithm.
    So the resulting data is having the high accuracy about the environment, and also
    mainly we are using the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) instead of
    using the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is MQTT is very much faster than the WSN.
    We are using this message queuing telemetry transport to transfer all the information
    about the climatic conditions are processed automatically, like if there is any
    possibility of rain in the weather cloud, then the climatic conditions and also
    the upcoming possibilities of the rain data log and also the current image of
    the environment will also be sent to the users mail. 3.1 Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT) Message queuing telemetry transport is a feather weight ISO standard
    publisher-subscriber messaging protocol specially designed for the internet of
    things. Internet of Things is creating the massive machine to machine network
    so that all of the devices like sensors, systems and also the actuators can connect
    to and communicate on the internet and with they need a communications protocol
    so that they can understand each other one of those protocols is message queuing
    telemetry transport. Message queuing telemetry transport is a TCP/IP protocol
    based on subscribe and publish messaging protocol designed for light weight machine-to-machine
    communications. MQTT has built the QoS to deliver the message. QoS 0: Once in
    a time “fire and forget,” if the device is online, it sends the message, and it
    gets delivered or if the device is offline it can’t be delivered it will be thrown
    away. QoS 1: Atleast once. QoS 2: Exactly once, 2 phase commit. Both the QoS 1
    and QoS 2 have the effectively guaranteed delivery, while the QoS 2 uses the two
    phase summit guaranteeing exactly once delivery and also it can give the end-to-end
    protocol level but not within the stacks on each side of the connection these
    QoS 1 and QoS 2 are queued for clients when the user is also online but have no
    timed out. To work the message queuing telemetry transport, it has three stages
    they are called as the message queuing broker. It is like a gateway receiver or
    server and allows the clients to send and also to receive the short messages from
    the broker only if they have subscribed to any topic like weather, temperature
    and also the humidity. Here in the below diagram, the client A is the publisher
    and the remaining client B and C are the subscribers whom receives the information
    which is sent by the sensor known as the client A. And also, these two B and C
    clients subscribe to the particular topic and gets published to the broker all
    the three will have the TCP connection with the broker as in Fig. 5. The sensor
    or the publisher which is called as the client A updates the topic and publishes
    the information about the topic to the MQ broker. These clients have subscribed
    to the topic so when the new piece of information gets published to the topic
    they then get the information from the MQ broker. Fig. 5 Message queuing telemetry
    transport Full size image 3.2 Sensor/Publisher The publisher has the information
    about the topic, and also this publisher has the data about the topic which the
    subscribers have been subscribed earlier. It is connected to the broker via TCP
    connections on all the sides whenever the new data comes, it will be sent to the
    broker. And also the publishers and also the subscribers are not connected directly
    through the TCP/IP connection. And this MQTT publishers allow username and password
    for the authentication and these clients can directly log on via password. These
    passwords are sent by the MQTT via the plain text or in encrypted form. If no
    data was sent, then the publisher will be in the off mode. The subscriber receives
    the filtered messages every message is being filtered by the broker which is the
    middle of the publisher and it also knows that who will send the message and also
    who will receive the message. The subscriber is the application based. The broker
    filter the messages based on the subject and the content based and also the type
    based filtering by the broker. A user can also subscribe to the one topics or
    more topics. When subscribed to the one or more than one topics two characters
    can be used. MQTT supports disconnect and last will and testament messages in
    this they are two types: namely hash character—multi-level wildcard and plus character—single-level
    wildcard MQTT. Clients which disconnect intentionally use disconnect message as
    in Fig. 6. MQTT broker will automatically publish last will and the testament
    messages on the behalf of the clients with unintentionally terminated messages.
    It also supports the retained messages which are automatically delivered when
    a client subscribes to the topic. Fig. 6 Block diagram of MQTT subscriber/client
    Full size image The topics which we select in the MQTT are similar to the files
    in a system using the forward slash(/). In message queuing telemetry transport,
    there is no formal structure to select the topic and a publisher is free to choose,
    it’s own topic names and also the structure but it should consists atleast on
    character to be valid. There is no topics created by the broker. All topics are
    created by a subscriber and also the publisher client, are not permanent. A topic
    only exists only if a subscriber has already subscribed to it before only or a
    broker has restore the last messages stored for that topic. This is the example
    for that E.g.: School/Room/Sensor. 4 Hardware Description Raspberry pi 3 begins
    as a toy computer and ends up being a real desktop PC having an upgraded ARMv7
    multicore processor and gigabytes RAM. In general, Raspberry pi has mode B and
    B+, mode A and A+, Pi zero. This Raspberry pi mode B and B+ are the simplest and
    cheapest but B+ has a bit more improved design of embedded applications. Raspberry
    pi zero has input or output, general purpose input or output (GPIO) and Bluetooth
    capability. They mostly operate at a frequency of 800–1000 MHz, in extreme case
    they can be operated upto 1500 MHz. In this model neither USB nor ethernet ports
    are changed. GPIO are the general purpose input and output pins which are used
    to turn off and to turn the devices like LED which will be present in the Raspberry
    pi. These pins allow you to connect and also to talk to the hardware modules that
    supports the protocol. UART is the universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter.
    It receives several bytes of the data from the GPIO pins but it transmits only
    bits of the data in the sequential order. In the asynchronous transmission of
    the data, it allows the bits to be sent or transmit without the sender but it
    will send the signal like the clock signal to the receiver side. UART can be used
    between the two devices only like simplex means data transmitted on one side only
    and also the half duplex in which the data can be transmitted in the either direction
    or the Full duplex. MPC3008 is a high performed and low power 10-bit analog-to-digital
    converter (ADC). In general to know the hotness as well as the coldness of an
    object, temperature sensor is used. In this LM 35 temperature sensor, the output
    is almost equal to the temperature. It doesn’t require any amplified output rather
    provides higher output than thermocouples. It is sometimes used as a power supply,
    battery, etc. To measure the amount of water in the soil moisture sensor is used.
    Indirectly either by using electrical resistance or neutron interactions water
    volume is measured. Light dependent resistor (LDR) is a variable light control
    resistor. As the light intensity increases, the resistance of LDR decreases. It
    can be used in circuits with light and dark activation switching and also in some
    light sensitive devices. 5 Results Figure 7 shows that the sensor parameters and
    also the weather conditions like temperature, moisture, humidity and also amount
    of light which is receiving. It compares the data log with the already existing
    weather reporting conditions. It also finds whether there is any possibility of
    the rainfall then it will intimates to the user through the registered mail. It
    will also predict the parameters like thunder storms, etc., as in Fig. 7. Fig.
    7 Message queuing telemetry transport conversation/data log Full size image These
    sensor values are being sent to the clients using the cloud and MQTT protocol.
    These parameters can be checked by the client through the registered mail. 6 Conclusion
    In this system, the irrigation system becomes more simple and easy with the quick
    transmission of the weather parameters by using the MQTT protocol and sending
    this data through cloud to the cloud who has been subscribed. The main advantage
    of using these protocol is when the client is not available then the parameters
    will be sent through the mail. When the client is available with the network then
    he can able to see the data parameters and also he can compare the present data
    with the existing data which has been already sent. So that the farmer will be
    able to know the changes in the atmosphere every day. This can also be implemented
    by using the computer-based algorithm and also the data can be processed without
    any further complexity. With the other specifications, sensors are used to make
    the process better. References J. Gutiérrez, J.F. Villa-Medina, A. Nieto-Garibay,

    Location: Chittagong, Bangladesh SECTION I. Introduction Precision agriculture
    is an information and technology based site specific farming practice with the
    aim of maximizing the crop production along with the efficient usage of resources
    involved in farming process. It provides real time assessment of various crop
    and environment parameters by precising the observed farming land as well as the
    amount of required water, fertilizer and other input needs [1]. This method enables
    our farmers to achieve efficient water consumption by irrigating with proper amount
    in the required time and therefore ensures growth of non-toxic, safe and healthy
    crop [2]. But to fulfill its purpose there needs a continuous, organized and precise
    observation with the help of information technologies like Global Positioning
    System (GPS), sensors, satellites or aerial images, etc. [3]. However, scientific
    approaches should be more convenient, comprehensive, and cost efficient. In recent
    years our current technological discipline has intensely impacted by Internet
    of Things (IoT). It has been taking part in enriching almost all sectors of modern
    life and precision agronomy is a potential area which can be mostly advantaged
    by IoT [4]. Our goal is to use IoT technology to overcome the difficulties of
    adaptation in real field of existing platform and developing a cost effective
    system as well. So, on the basis of IoT and by merging variant useful technologies
    and mechanisms we have designed and implemented a smart farm monitoring and irrigation
    management system for PA. In which, sensing and measuring the variations of some
    meteorological factors (Temperature, humidity) and some soil attributes (soil
    temperature, moisture, pH), which are essential parameters for proper growth monitoring
    of crop and irrigation management are obtained by corresponding sensors. One of
    the unique features of the system is to use IoT protocol based LoRa transceiver
    for wireless and rapid communication, and long distance coverage between the gateway
    and the sensor nodes. A cloud based database with web application for data management
    and monitoring has been added to the system. Addition to the uniqueness of our
    cloud based system; we have also developed an android application, which provides
    the users their corresponding field condition in daily and weekly basis as well
    as irrigation controlling feature. In brief, features of the system are real time
    field condition monitoring, managing and analyzing data using cloud server, user
    understandable presentation using numerical and graphical plots of data on web
    application and android application, controlling the irrigation system as well
    as expandability of the platform. Consequently, by implementing our system, farmers
    can remotely obtain their field status instantly and thereby take the necessary
    decision. The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows: literature
    review will be discussed in section II and the overall system architecture, in
    section III. Methods and materials will be presented in section IV. Irrigation
    control system will be included in section V. Finally, in section VI and VII,
    result, conclusion and future work will be discussed respectively. SECTION II.
    Literature Review IoT has been emerging in the numerous field of life for the
    purpose of monitoring, data collecting, and machine controlling, security. A survey
    on IoT in smart agriculture has been presented by Mekala MS, Viswanathan P. [5].
    [6] J. Ye, B. Chen, Q. Liu, and Y. Fang have proposed a platform to implement
    IoT for PA using WebGIS. The architecture would require expertise to operate and
    develop the system. Fig. 1. Overall system architecture for smart farming Show
    All [7]T. Ojha, S. Misra, and N. Singh has highlighted the problems and challenges
    in implementing wireless sensor technology in agro-field by surveying the previously
    proposed techniques. [8] I. Mohanraj, K. Ashokumar, and J. Naren have proposed
    work on overcoming limitations of traditional agricultural procedures using IoT
    in agriculture. Nevertheless, in literature, works has been proposed on IoT in
    monitoring [2] [9] without any hardware deployment. On the other hand, WSN technology
    can be implemented in greenhouse monitoring and controlling, and in viticulture
    [10] [11]. A prototype has been developed for monitoring and prediction purpose
    based on WSN [12]. Implementation of WSN in precision farming in Egypt has been
    developed by Sherine M. Abd El-Kader [13]. Likewise, WSN has also been implemented
    in the Southern Spain for precision horticulture [14]. By studying recent works
    and their flaws of data integrity, area coverage, applicability and user amenability,
    we have developed an IoT based system for PA providing the facility of real time
    and automatic control of irrigation system as well. Moreover, existing systems
    uses Bluetooth or Zigbee [12] wireless communication protocol for data transmission
    which which are quite expensive, have less coverage area, fewer devices communicability
    and higher power consumption than LoRa which has been used in our system. SECTION
    III. System Architecture The overall IoT based agro filed monitoring and irrigation
    controlling system architecture is presented in figure 1. The proposed platform
    is designed, so that real time data are automatically obtained on a periodic basis
    or spontaneously, stored and viewed for the purpose of monitoring the field condition.
    Therefore, data acquisition, data transmission, data management and analysis,
    data visualization and controlling-these five functions defines the whole platform.
    Data from the sensor node are transmitted to the cloud server using LoRa IoT protocol
    through the gateway node which is can be located within a distance of 2-22km from
    the field where WiFi is available. Gateway needs to be connected to the Internet
    via. WiFi. However, this platform is provided with cloud based database server
    and provides API(Application Programming Interface) for data access, data import
    from the database for data visualization and the farmers i.e., authentic remote
    users can monitor the real time field condition by accessing to the server database.
    Furthermore, we have designed the monitoring and controlling interface amenable
    for the farmer by developing an android application “CropNet” which uses REST
    API services to import and export data from the database. Therefore, data from
    the database are imported to the mobile application on user''s request and again
    user can send command to control the irrigation system using this app to control
    the system. SECTION IV. Methods and Materials The system incorporates 3types of
    node: sensor node, gateway node, irrigation node; database, web application and
    android application. A. Sensor Node Design The architecture of the sensor node
    is presented in Fig. 2. Since measurement should be taken from different locations
    of the field, the sensor network should be comprised of adequate number of sensor
    nodes. Again each sensor node comprises of 4 basic units including sensors, communication
    unit, data processing unit and power unit. Our designed sensor node contains sensors
    for sensing environmental temperature, humidity, soil moisture and soil temperature.
    Moreover, Arduino Nano, Lora SX1278 IC with antenna as transceiver, and 6V power
    supply unit has been included sensor node. The hardware implementation of sensor
    node is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 2. Sensor node architecture Show All Fig. 3. Sensor
    nodes: NODE-700, NODE-800 (hardware) Show All Fig. 4. Working flow diagram of
    the sensor node Show All Corresponding data from all sensors are collected and
    then formatted into JSON data packet. After communication is confirmed between
    the both transceivers of gateway and sensor node data packet is send to the gateway.
    The data packet can be sent within few seconds and we have configured the sensors
    to send real time data at an interval of 5min. The working flow diagram of the
    IoT sensor node is presented in Fig. 4. B. Gateway Node Gateway node has been
    designed using Node MCU 2.1 and Lora SX1278 with its antenna, router, and 6V power
    supply. It works as a medium of communication between sensor nodes and the cloud
    server. It receives data packet wirelessly using LoRa IoT protocol from the sensor
    node and posts the data packet to the cloud server via. Internet. The working
    flow diagram of the gateway node is presented in Fig. 7, where it is used as receiver,
    data coordinator and data transmitter. Block diagram and hardware architecture
    is shown in Fig. 5, 6 respectively. Since, sensor nodes and gateway node are connected
    through LoRa protocol which has large coverage area; gateway node can be located
    at any distance less than 22 km from the sensor node (LOS) which provides this
    system more flexibility for using in remote areas where Internet facility is not
    available or weak. Moreover, a repeater node containing Arduino microprocessor
    and LoRa transceiver can be used to coverage a larger area between sensor nodes
    and gateway node. We have tested the system locating the gateway node at a distance
    of approximately 1km from the sensor nodes and the data communication was successful.
    Fig. 5. Gateway node architecture Show All Fig. 6. Gateway node (hardware) Show
    All C. Data Transmission A recent development in IoT platform for low power, long
    range, wide area coverage LoRa WAn has been used here for data transmission between
    sensor nodes, gateway and irrigation node. Authors found this technology is best
    suitable for smart agriculture [15]. LoRa is a private and spread-specteum technique
    which allows sending data at extremely low-data-rates to extremely long range
    securely. The low data-rate (down to few bytes per seconds)and LoRa modulation
    lead to very low receiver sensitivity (down to −134dBm), which combined to an
    output power of +14dBm means extremely large link budgets: up to 148 dB., what
    means more than 22km (13.6miles) in LOS links and up to 2km (1.2miles) in LOS
    links in urban environment (going through buildings) [16]. Fig. 7. Flowchart of
    working of the gateway node Show All Fig. 8. Login interface of web application
    Show All Fig. 9. Nodes added to the network Show All D. User Interface Design
    User interfaces: a web application and an android application have been developed
    so that field level users can understand the system''s purpose and use them without
    difficulty. 1): Web Application FeatureCollected data from the sensor nodes are
    consumed by the database and displayed to the clients from a running query from
    database on the web application. Our MySQL server is located at pythonanywhere.com.
    This server allows us installing web2py web framework which has been used to develop
    web application. Since only the authentic users have access to the database using
    login accounts and passwords as shown in Fig. 8, users have to be authorized using
    valid emails. Here, every farmer is a user and has own dashboard where real time
    data from his registered nodes are displayed. Therefore, to get data from particular
    nodes a user need to authorize his nodes to his dashboard. We have tested a list
    of nodes in Fig. 9 by changing node ID to confirm data reception from different
    nodes added to the networks. There are web interfaces to visualise the numerical
    data of individual node(Fig. 11, 12) as well as all data of all nodes together
    (Fig. 10). Fig. 10. Neumerical data from all nodes Show All Fig. 11. Web interface
    for data from node 700 Show All 2): Android Application FeatureFor android application,
    we have successfully developed some basic interfaces and managed to pursue data
    from the database for the user. The main interface contains daily data, weekly
    data and condition analysis, irrigation cotrol sub interfaces (Fig. 13). Data
    are displayed on different interfaces (Fig. 14) so that the user can monitor farming
    condition daily as well as throughout a whole week using the weekly node data
    interface, on which all the data throughout a week are displayed. Again the average
    condition of filed will be provided in the app as in Fig. 13d. The soil pH value
    will be manually measured and users need to send the data to the server using
    the ‘PH Sensor Test’ option in Fig. 13d. We have added this feature, because we
    are working on providing solutions and suggestions for the farmers based on the
    real time data. Fig. 12. Web interface for data from node 800 Show All Fig. 13.
    Android application features Show All Fig. 14. Different interfaces of android
    application showing daily data Show All SECTION V. Smart Irrigation Scheme We
    have proposed an irrigation system which can be controlled by the user using android
    application. A node will perform as data receiver from the user through gateway
    using LoRa. Irrigation node is composed of an irrigation pump or a reservoir with
    solenoid valve, a controller circuit to operate the motor or solenoid valve, arduino
    nano, LoRa SX1278 transceiver with antenna and solar panel with solar charger
    circuit. The block diagram of the irrigation node architecture is presented in
    fig 16. According to the command the node performs automatic or force-stop irrigation.
    Automated irrigation will be performed based on the filed condition in which exceeding
    threshold level will turn on the irrigation and after a pre-determined time automatically
    will be switched off. On the other hand, the force-stop mode enables farmer to
    hold control on stopping irrigation. This mode will be helpful to save crops from
    overwatering problems as well as save energy. SECTION VI. Result and Implementation
    The whole setup was deployed in the kitchen garden of our residence (Fig. 16)
    and has been observed for two days. We have implemented two sensor nodes: NODE-700,
    NODE 800 for testing. Gateway node was placed inside the house which was connected
    Internet using WiFi. Success of the sending data from the sensor nodes and storing
    these data in the database is 99%. There are 5,164 data stored in the database
    which includes all the test level data of the system. We have shown the interfaces
    of web application and android app for numerical data visualization with real
    time data collected from field. The graphical representations of the collected
    data from NODE-700 and NODE-800 of one day are presented in Fig. 17 and 18 respectively.

    an attractive part of research because of its application in numerous fields.
    In the field of agriculture the most necessary help can be provided by this technology.
    The study is about developing a feasible system which can be adopted in every
    filed where monitoring and controlling is required. The performance of the system
    proves it relevancy and technological efficiency to implement in PA. Besides,
    we are developing the irrigation node in the mean while a prediction model for
    disease detection is being developed. The irrigation node will add a new dimension
    to the system since it will complete the cycle by including the control mechanism.
    Moreover, a predictive model for providing suggestion and treatment for different
    problems of crops will be added to the android application. We have also designed
    our goal to include a model for disease detection of crops, which will be developed
    using image processing and machine learning algorithm. Therefore, a complete platform
    will be provided to enhance the agricultural output in upcoming days. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

  description: Adopting and developing sustainable precision irrigation systems allows
    for improving productivity, reducing water and energy losses in agricultural fields.
    This paper deals with the development and real-time implementation of a smart
    precision irrigation system (SPIS). The proposed system combines two irrigation
    approaches, processed by a feedback fuzzy logic (FL) controller, and long-range
    data transmission and monitoring via the LoRa protocol. The combined approaches
    not only enhance overall performance but also address several limitations commonly
    associated with existing approaches. The proposed system uses the collected data
    from the sensors unit to provide the optimal irrigation decision and communicates
    it with the operator (farmer) via a developed IoT platform. Data from soil moisture,
    ambient temperature, solar irradiance, and rainfall sensors are processed through
    the FL controller to adjust the irrigation times. The inputs and outputs are fuzzified
    by trapezoidal and triangular membership functions. Mamdani's fuzzy inference
    is used to control the system through a set of linguistic control rules for a
    more accurate decision for each scenario. The field experimentation of the developed
    SPIS in the eastern region of Morocco shows high efficiency and reliability by
    saving water and energy compared to traditional irrigation control. The proposed
    system, with remote data monitoring, promotes better management of irrigation,
    water, and energy consumption, and it is suitable to be mounted with any type
    of irrigation installation in the field, without extensive modifications.

    logicWater savingEnergy saving 1. Introduction Agriculture is considered a key
    issue of national development due to the important economic, social, and territorial
    stakes of this sector (Knox et al., 2012). In Morocco, agriculture is the first
    contributor to the gross domestic product (GDP) with a variation of 11 % to 18
    %, which is mainly influenced by climatic conditions. Moreover, Moroccan agriculture
    employs nearly half of the active population and provides 23 % of the nation''s
    exports1. In 2022–2023, water scarcity in Morocco is considered a major concern
    as water reserves have been reduced by 59 %, which exposes them to spatial and
    temporal irregularity issues. Fig. 1 (a) shows the rainfall deficit percentage
    and Fig. 1 (b) shows the drought index of January 2023 in Moroccan regions2. Given
    the enormous evolution of irrigated agricultural areas that consume huge amounts
    of water, the unpredictability of rainfall may lead to increasing and deepening
    the problem of water availability and the failure to meet the irrigation needs
    of crops, resulting in rising drought areas and a decline in agricultural productivity.
    One of the factors contributing to this is the use of permanent alimentation solenoids
    to activate irrigation systems and low performance irrigation approaches (Avşar
    et al., 2018, Le et al., 2020). These solenoids require a continuous power supply,
    leading to increased energy demands. The reliance on such solenoids is prevalent
    in various agricultural processes, including irrigation systems, crop harvesting
    machinery, and automated greenhouse controls. The constant power requirements
    of these solenoids contribute significantly to the overall energy consumption
    in the agricultural sector, further straining the already limited resources. Addressing
    this issue and exploring alternative energy-efficient solutions could mitigate
    the environmental impact and reduce the sector''s overall energy consumption.

    Fig. 1. (a) The rainfall deficit percentage (%), (b) The drought index of January
    2023 of Morocco. For the agricultural areas of eastern Morocco, irrigation water
    and energy losses are generally caused by two factors: the first factor is the
    manual control of the pump and valves in the pressurised irrigation system. According
    to Hamami and Nassereddine, 2020, Xie et al., 2022, the inefficiency of these
    irrigation systems extends beyond Morocco and has been observed in other regions
    as well. The studies highlight that these traditional irrigation systems, which
    rely on manual pump activation, contribute to significant losses in irrigation
    water and energy. These findings suggest that the low efficiency of such systems
    is not limited to a specific geographical area but is a widespread issue that
    affects multiple agricultural regions (Kumar et al., 2023). In those cases, farmers
    use their prior knowledge of crop response, or by observing leaf stress, to determine
    the duration of irrigation. This technique cannot be relied upon since it does
    not reflect the actual water needs of the plants, which are related to the growth
    stage and weather conditions (Jaafar et al., 2021). On the other hand, the second
    factor is the losses due to the process in which irrigation water is released
    into the atmosphere as vapor, caused mainly by the high temperature and solar
    irradiance rates. This factor can be solved by using drip irrigation methods,
    but it is also necessary to adopt advanced control techniques. The development
    and design of smart precision irrigation systems and mechanisms with the use of
    IoT technologies for the visualization and monitoring of different parameters
    of agriculture and irrigation is the key solution to managing irrigation water
    resources efficiently and sustainably by delivering the exact amount of water
    required by the crop (Capraro Fuentes et al., 2018). In addition, optimizing the
    energy supplied to operate the various actuators (Qaisar et al., 2021, Mellit
    et al., 2021). Irrigation systems are classified into two categories according
    to their control, open-loop and closed-loop control systems. Open-loop control,
    also called no-feedback control, is a type of controller that generates decisions
    based on the current state, i.e., it has no feedback to determine if the assessed
    input has achieved the desired objective, in our case satisfying the crop''s water
    needs with precision while considering climatic-soil conditions (Navarro-Hellín
    et al., 2016). Therefore, an open-loop irrigation system cannot be reliably used
    to deal with the challenges of precision irrigation. Programmable irrigation controller,
    also called irrigation timers are among the systems based on this control technique.
    The scheduling of the period and duration of the irrigation remains constant without
    knowing the real needs of irrigation in the crop. Closed-loop control systems
    are the most efficient and robust in terms of decision support and allow for precision
    irrigation (Bwambale et al., 2022). The action depends on the output provided
    by the system; the input varies according to the output, which produces a more
    accurate decision. The feedback loop also allows for automatic adjustments to
    be made in real time, which improve the accuracy, stability and performance of
    irrigation decisions. Sensor units are used to provide this feedback to the processing
    unit. According to agriculture experts and scientific research, three approaches
    are distinguished (Abioye et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020). The first approach
    is based on the measurement of soil moisture, which indicates the amounts of water
    consumed and absorbed by the crop during a period, and then decides on the scheduling
    of future irrigation times by setting a percentage of soil moisture, so the irrigation
    system works until it reaches the set value of moisture (Soulis et al., 2015).
    An intelligent urban irrigation system is discussed in (Mason et al., 2019) aiming
    at decreasing water use without reducing crop yield. The system includes a wireless
    soil moisture sensor network and controllable valves and tested in nine climatic
    regions of the contiguous United States. Tomatoes are chosen due to their sensitivity
    to water stress. The second approach is to control irrigation according to the
    evolution of the meteorological conditions (Kool et al., 2014). The measurement
    of environmental variables in real time such as: air temperature and humidity,
    solar irradiance and wind speed allows estimating the reference evapotranspiration
    level (ET0) (Chiew et al., 1995), which indicates the water losses suffered by
    the plant and the soil (J. Doorenbos et al., 1976). Weather stations or IoT-based
    sensor networks are used to provide such information. In (González-Briones et
    al., 2018), a monitoring system able to collect various data on its environment,
    by sensing temperature, solar irradiance, pH, humidity, and wind speed is presented.
    The objective of this research is to build virtual organizations of agents based
    on several master and slave nodes that are connected to ensure data exchange from
    sensors while monitoring the crops. The development of a platform (IoT) with a
    fibrous capillary irrigation system based on the climatic demand estimated by
    the weather condition was reported by (Abd Rahman et al., 2019). The experiment
    has been conducted using a Choy sum plant as a test crop in a greenhouse. Demand
    tracking, management of the irrigation system, and the use of weather information
    allowed for near real-time estimation of the crop''s water requirements, which
    also allowed the monitoring of the progress of water consumption by the plants.
    The last approach is the survey of the plant evolution parameters, such crop water
    stress index (CWSI), which determine the water needs of the plant, through the
    measurement of canopy temperature. Most irrigation systems are based on simple
    control techniques and algorithms (Davis, and Dukes, 2010; Singh et al., 2023),
    containing a single input or a threshold value to be set by the operator to decide
    on starting or ending the irrigation. The reliability and efficiency of those
    controls’ techniques are limited and unable to reliably schedule irrigation since
    precision irrigation involves the evaluation and processing of multiple inputs.
    Fuzzy logic (FL) is one of the intelligent control techniques that allow to manipulation
    of multiple input variables while taking account of the output action. So, it
    is more suitable for non-linear systems due to its flexibility in data processing
    and it is very effective for decision-making problems that require precision (Zadeh,
    1999). The operation of fuzzy logic has been thoroughly tested in a diverse and
    challenging field (Yahyaoui et al., 2017). It is structured with three main modules,
    a fuzzification module, an inference engine, and a defuzzification module. Mamdani
    and Sugeno are the two popular approaches in FL (Omomule et al., 2020, Shafaei
    et al., 2017), each with its own distinct characteristics. The key difference
    lies in how they handle the fuzzy rule’s consequences. In Mamdani-FL, the output
    membership function is a fuzzy set representing the degree of membership of the
    output variable. This allows for linguistic descriptions, where the output can
    be interpreted in terms of linguistic terms (Pourjavad et al., 2019). On the other
    hand, Sugeno-FL employs a more mathematical approach, where the output is represented
    as a crisp value or a mathematical function of the input variables. This enables
    precise numerical calculations and facilitates mathematical modelling. The advantage
    of the Mamdani-FL lies in its ability to incorporate linguistic rules and provide
    interpretable outputs. By using linguistic terms, the system''s behaviour becomes
    more understandable and intuitive to humans, making it suitable for applications
    where transparency and explainability are crucial. It allows experts to easily
    define rules using their domain knowledge and linguistic terms, making it a powerful
    tool in decision-making processes (Hamam et al., 2008). Additionally, Mamdani-FL
    supports a wide range of inference methods and can handle complex and nonlinear
    systems effectively. While Sugeno-FL has its own advantages, such as its computational
    efficiency and ability to handle mathematical modelling, the interpretability
    and linguistic-based nature of Mamdani-FL make it a preferred choice in agriculture
    applications (Urbieta Parrazales et al., 2021). A FL-based irrigation controller
    is designed and integrated into a field in India, to perform multi-criteria decision-making,
    this allows to select of the most efficient and adequate irrigation sub-system
    (Yilmaz and Harmancioglu et al., 2010). Another application of FL has been reported
    in (Krishnan et al., 2020). The objective is to automatically control the irrigation
    through the measurement of soil moisture to decide the necessary flow for irrigation.
    Six fuzzy rules have been implemented. DC motor is activated in cases where the
    soil moisture value is between medium and very low values, otherwise the contrary.
    The modelling and simulation of a fuzzy irrigation system have been presented
    in (Mushtaq et al., 2016). The approach is based on the calculation of ET by a
    fuzzy inference system. The input variables are temperature, humidity, wind, and
    solar radiation. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the fuzzy system
    in accurately determining and compensating the water loss due to ET. Another work
    (Kurniawan et al., 2017) presented the combination of a prediction algorithm and
    fuzzy control. The combination of fertilization and irrigation precisely to reduces
    the amount of irrigation water and the waste of chemical fertilizers. This results
    in further saving and reducing production costs and improving agricultural efficiency.
    In our previous work (Benzaouia et al., 2021) we developed an intelligent irrigation
    system based on FL controller for the automatic watering of agricultural areas
    (Oriental Morocco). The simulation results proved that the irrigation system allows
    to keep the soil moisture measurements higher than the value specified by the
    user and eliminates the under-irrigation risk. In the presented research works,
    the utilization of FL is primarily focused on simple applications. These applications
    involve employing fuzzy sets and membership functions to handle vague or uncertain
    data and make decisions based on fuzzy reasoning. Moreover, a noteworthy aspect
    of these works is the use of minimal control rules, implying that the number of
    rules employed in the fuzzy logic systems is kept to a minimum. In the realm of
    modern field management, it is crucial not only to adopt advanced control systems
    but also to incorporate communication IoT protocols to enable seamless data transmission
    and enhanced control. The integration of IoT offers numerous benefits, including
    real-time data acquisition, remote monitoring, and improved decision-making capabilities.
    Various communication technologies, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and others,
    can be utilized to establish reliable connections in field management applications.
    Table 1 provides a summary of these technologies and their application for irrigation
    monitoring, outlining their respective ranges and power consumption. The common
    characteristic among these technologies is their low data transmission range.
    However, in the case of large agricultural areas, it becomes necessary to employ
    technologies that can cover vast distances with improved sending capabilities
    which makes them very limited. LoRa technology stands out as one of the promising
    solutions that has proven its effectiveness in various industrial applications
    (Kaur et al., 2022), additionally, in fields such as telemedicine (Ayat et al.,
    2023). It offers several advantages for IoT applications, its long-range capability
    allows for communication over large distances, while its low power consumption
    ensures minimizing energy consumption. The cost-effectiveness of LoRa, coupled
    with its scalability and secure communication features, also makes it suitable
    for large-scale deployments. The flexibility of LoRa enables its use in diverse
    environments, and its open standard promotes interoperability. Table 1. IoT technologies

    smart precision irrigation system with a combined weather-soil approach is proposed
    and designed, to efficiently schedule the irrigation of apple trees in fields
    located in the eastern region of Morocco. Soil moisture, ambient temperature,
    solar irradiance, and rainfall are the inputs of the FL controller. They are sensed
    through different sensors, and subsequently transmitted to apply the well-designed
    fuzzy rules for irrigation control, while the output is the duration and timing
    of irrigation which depends on the crop requirements in the field. This allows
    for optimizing the soil water content, enhancing plant health and product quality.
    The system also includes a long-range LoRa communication module for wireless transmission
    and a developed IoT platform for visualization and monitoring to enhance the mentioned
    drawbacks of discussed IoT techniques in irrigation. The techno-economic study
    between the proposed system in the literature and the one available on the commercial
    market, proved the reliability of the proposed SPIS to manage the irrigation process
    in a precise and intelligent manner with low-cost installation. This is the first
    research study reported on the design of an intelligent precision irrigation system
    adapted to the eastern climate of Morocco. The main contributions of the paper
    can be summarized as follows: • The design of an automated intelligent irrigation
    controller based on FL inference that evolves in real-time the weather-soil monitoring
    approach to decide the optimal irrigation time and impulse solenoid-valve opening.
    The system is highly efficient and tested in an agricultural field under real
    scenarios. • The development of a real-time visualization and monitoring IoT platform
    for irrigation and field data such as system status, soil moisture, air humidity,
    ambient temperature, solar irradiance, irrigation time, energy, water consumption,
    etc. • Provide a reliable and efficient irrigation system at a low cost. The article
    is organized as follows, Section 2 presents the design and control of the proposed
    irrigation system. Section 3 describes the operating steps of the system. Section
    4 discusses the software and hardware implementation. The experimental performance
    evaluation and the techno-economic study are given in Section 5. Conclusion and
    future improvement are reported in the last Section 6. 2. Design and control of
    the proposed irrigation system The structure of the proposed smart precision irrigation
    system based on an effective strategy that combines both weather and soil approaches
    is given in Fig. 2. It consists of five essential sub-systems: (1) the sensors
    unit, (2) the controller unit, (3) the irrigation unit, (4) the IoT communication
    unit, and finally (5) the power unit. A detailed description of the methodology
    of the development of these subsystems is given in the following sections. Download

    The structure of the smart precision irrigation system. 2.1. Location and specification
    of the study field An agricultural field situated around the eastern region of
    Morocco has been selected to carry out the experimentation of the developed irrigation
    system (See Fig. 3). The location and global positioning are a latitude of 34.811835
    and a longitude of −1.967141 (34°48′42.6″N 1°58′01.7″W). Download : Download high-res
    image (271KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Geographical view of
    the field of experimentation. The field is divided into three areas (A), (B) and
    (C). The focus is only on the A and B zones, the irrigation system in the first
    zone (A) is controlled by the proposed smart precision irrigation system and the
    second zone (B) temporised controller is used. Note that the area A and B are
    about 1300 m2 for each and contain about 140 apple trees, with an irrigated surface
    approximately 100 m2. The experiment region exhibits a unique semi-arid climate
    influenced by its geographical location and topography. Situated in the eastern
    part of the country, this region experiences distinct climatic conditions that
    have significant implications for agriculture and socio-economic activities. The
    climate can be classified as Mediterranean with semi-arid characteristics. It
    is characterized by hot and dry summers with limited rainfall and mild, wet winters.
    The region is known for its high temperatures during the summer months, often
    exceeding 40 °C (104°F). Additionally, the area experiences high ET rates due
    to the combination of high temperatures and limited rainfall, resulting in the
    loss of water from both the soil and vegetation. Precipitation is moderate, with
    most rainfall occurring between October and April. However, there is considerable
    variability in precipitation patterns, leading to occasional drought conditions.
    The unique semi-arid climate of the region plays a crucial role in shaping agricultural
    practices, water resource management, and overall livelihoods in the area. 2.2.
    Sensors unit The sensors unit consists of specific field sensors for soil moisture
    measurement, and climatic sensors for measuring ambient temperature, relative
    air humidity, solar irradiance, and rainfall. All the used sensors are calibrated
    to prevent any drift that could be generated during their operation. 2.2.1. Soil
    moisture sensing Soil moisture information is extremely important for the control
    and scheduling of irrigation periods. It allows to identify the characteristics
    of diffusion or storage of water in a defined soil, which is usually influenced
    by its composition and texture (sandy, clayey and silty soil). There are two main
    techniques for determining soil moisture, the direct method and the indirect method.
    The direct method, known as gravimetric, consists of drying a soil sample and
    then determining the weight of the water contained in the sample. This method
    is not adapted to real-time applications and remains expensive. Indirect methods
    consist in measuring the electrical conductivity or the dielectric permittivity
    of the soil and then converted to volumetric soil water content. For this application,
    a UM-MS-10 sensor is selected. This sensor is dedicated to precision irrigation
    applications while offering very accurate measurements, and a high sensitivity
    to amounts of water applied to the soil with a low error range (about ± 2 % and
    ± 4 % for a water content between 0 and 53 % and 53–100 % respectively), in addition
    to the possibility of calibration for specific soils. Determining the number of
    soil moisture sensors is based on several factors, including the size and nature
    of the area being monitored, the type of crops, the depth of the root zone, the
    soil properties, and the way that the area is exposed to weather variations. In
    our research focused on apple trees, a case study to examine soil moisture levels
    in zone A has been conducted firstly. Multiple sensors have been strategically
    placed at different locations within the zone to capture comprehensive data. The
    analysis revealed consistently low measurement errors, attributable to the soil''s
    homogeneity and absence of geographical irregularities. Consequently, a single
    sensor has been selected and positioned at a depth of 0.3 m. This depth is justified
    based on the relevant findings reported in our previous research (Benzaouia et
    al., 2021). To ensure the generalizability of our results across the entire field,
    further investigations are planned. These subsequent examinations will involve
    subdividing the field into smaller zones, allowing for the optimization of sensor
    placement, and determining the minimum number of sensors required for accurate
    soil moisture assessments. This approach enhances the scientific rigor of the
    study and provides valuable insights into the spatial variability of soil moisture.
    2.2.2. Ambient temperature sensing As temperatures increase toward limit values,
    the plants'' ET rates increase and the water balance of the soil decreases, therefore
    the scheduling of irrigation according to temperature variations is also crucial.
    The DHT-11 sensor is a reliable sensor for measuring ambient temperature and relative
    humidity, requiring no external calibration, and able to measure temperatures
    from −40 to + 125 °C with an accuracy of ± 0.5 °C and relative humidity ranges
    from 0 to 100 % with an accuracy of ± 2 %. 2.2.3. Solar irradiance sensing Solar
    irradiance is a source of energy that comes from a thermal process, which also
    contributes to the evaporation process. So, it is important to schedule irrigation
    during a period of minimal solar irradiance. Several devices are available to
    measure and quantify the intensity of solar irradiance, including pyrometer, LDR,
    photoristor and others. However, most of them are expensive and usually require
    an adapter to exploit the collected data. For economic and technical reasons,
    a BH1750 sensor has been selected to estimate solar irradiance intensity. It allows
    a measurement range from 1 lx to 100.000 lx, with an error of ± 3 % for low and
    high ranges, additionally to its robustness against IR radiation (Very small effect
    of IR radiation). 2.2.4. Rainfall sensing To save the water and energy consumption
    of the proposed irrigation system in the agricultural field in case of precipitation,
    a rain sensor or rain switch is integrated, allowing the detection of rainfall.
    Hence, if the feedback received from the sensor indicates the availability of
    high rates of rainfall, the system is turned off and the irrigation periods are
    rescheduled by referring to fuzzy logic rules. 2.3. Controller unit The controller
    is held responsible for intelligent data processing for irrigation scheduling,
    and the generation of the output control signal, namely the duration, time, and
    period of irrigation unit opening and activation which is decided by FL programmed
    and implemented in ATmega2560 microcontroller. In addition, this unit is responsible
    for receiving and transmitting time-series data from the sensor’s unit to the
    developed visualization and monitoring platform. 2.3.1. Mathematical modeling
    The proposed FL controller is composed of three key components, namely the fuzzification
    module, the inference engine, and the defuzzification module, as illustrated in
    Fig. 4. The system operates by developing a universe of discourse ( ) that entails
    a membership function and defining an interval of ( ) represented by . In this
    context, is characterized as a membership function that comprises a set of ordered
    pairs of elements and the probability that e belongs to ( ), as described by Pazouki
    et al., 2021. Download : Download high-res image (171KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Flow-chart of FL inference-based irrigation controller. The system
    requires three input parameters, namely soil moisture (SM), temperature (T), and
    solar irradiance (SR). Each of these parameters comprises three membership functions
    that are identified by a fuzzy subset of ( ). Specifically, variable represents
    soil moisture, variable represents temperature, and variable represents solar
    irradiance. The degree to which a given value of belongs to variables , , and
    is expressed by the membership functions , and . Equations (2), (3) respectively
    provide the fuzzy intersection and union set for the three variables. The purpose
    of the fuzzification step is to transform a digital input obtained from a sensor
    into a linguistic variable by means of membership functions. A membership function
    can be defined as a function that specifies the degree of membership of a numerical
    input to a linguistic variable. In this context, the membership function employed
    regulates a variety of parameters, including fluctuations in soil moisture, temperature,
    and solar irradiance. The proposed irrigation system commonly employs triangular
    and trapezoidal membership functions to make appropriate decisions. Equations
    (4), (5) depict the triangular and trapezoidal shapes, respectively, for a three-value
    fuzzification system. Fig. 5 illustrates the membership functions for both the
    inputs and outputs of the FL controller. (2) (3) (4) (5) Download : Download high-res
    image (340KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Inputs and output membership
    functions. The fuzzy inference process involves the interpretation of input values
    gathered from sensors, which are then utilized to determine output values based
    on sets of rules. To accomplish this, a set of if-then rules has been formulated
    to operate with the membership functions of each input. The literature describes
    two types of fuzzy inference systems that can be implemented: Mamdani type and
    Sugano type. The Mamdani type has been selected for the proposed irrigation system
    because it is well-suited for expert system applications. In each given scenario,
    the output of the controller is represented by the irrigation duration, time and
    periods which varies in accordance with the fuzzy rules grouped in Table 2, Table
    3, and Table 4. Table 2. Rules of the output (duration of irrigation in min) for
    dry soil. Temperature (°C) Solar irradiance (%) Dark Medium Light Cold Very Long

    Zero In the process of implementing an intelligent irrigation strategy, defuzzification
    serves as the final step. After fuzzification, the rules are applied to generate
    a fuzzy output which is subsequently transformed into a scalar quantity. The selection
    of the centroid defuzzification method has been based on its precision in producing
    reliable outputs. Equation (6) expresses the defuzzified output ( ). (6) 2.3.2.
    Simulation and validation of proposed system A preliminary simulation of the irrigation
    system has been carried out using the FL toolbox available in the Matlab/Simulink
    environment in order to build the fuzzy rules for each irrigation scenario and
    verify the system responses. The fuzzy rules are based on Mamdani''s “if-then”
    conditions. The 3D graphical representation of the temperature and soil moisture
    variables as a function of the irrigation time is given in Fig. 6. It is clear
    that the system allows the irrigation process with variable duration according
    to the parameters of the plants, the soil, and the weather conditions. Download

    3D Fuzzy logic graph of rules. 2.4. Irrigation unit The irrigation unit is composed
    of an impulse solenoid and diaphragm valve, distribution pipes, and emitters.
    The solenoid is controlled through the output signal provided by the controller
    unit. The opening time and duration can be adjusted according to the decision
    of the FL controller and vary depending on the conditions affecting the irrigation.
    The efficiency of the system is considered. For this purpose, a flow meter is
    located next to the valve to measure the water consumption in the distribution
    line. Moreover, the overall energy consumed during the operation under the adopted
    irrigation strategy is calculated from the installed voltage and current sensors.
    The obtained values are used to calculate the energy consumed per time unit. 2.5.
    LoRa based IoT communication unit In order to closely monitor the status of the
    irrigation system and to visualize the evolution of the parameters related to
    precision irrigation to fulfil the customer''s display requirements, ten parameters
    are displayed in a developed platform (See Fig. 7). This platform allows to follow
    in real-time the evolution of each parameter as well as the implementation of
    alerts (e-mail, telegram, and SMS) in case of failure (problems at the level of
    the sensors, condition on the irrigation parameters), moreover the transversal
    communication between the hardware and software part. The main page that is displayed
    contains an indication of the status of the system (on/off), the air temperature,
    the soil moisture, the soil temperature, the electrical conductivity, and the
    salinity. The irrigation duration provided by the FL controller, the evolution
    of the solar irradiance (the parameter is displayed as a percentage just to simplify
    the display) during each day is also displayed, and finally, the water flow rate
    distributed to the plant for each irrigation decision. An example of visualization

    frameworks, and a hardware environment containing boards with microcontrollers
    for processing as well as different communication shields for sending and receiving
    data, Fig. 9 represents the conception of each environment. Django is chosen given
    the multiple advantages that it presents, namely the robust development language
    Python, the ability to run with any client-side infrastructure, return data in
    any format namely HTML, RSS, JSON, XML, and provides robust security features
    that avoid common security errors (Srivastava et al., 2021). MySQL database is
    chosen as a manager owing to its many advantages in terms of rapidity, and ability
    to perform various operations using interfaces written in C, C++, Python, Java
    and PHP (Rao et al., 2014). The configuration of the manager is done at the Django
    framework level. Download : Download high-res image (247KB) Download : Download

    communication between the HTTP client and the platform is done through an API,
    which allows to interface and translate the requests received by the HTTP client
    to the server and return a response to the clients (when the Rest-API has what
    it needs, it sends back a response to the clients, typically be in JSON or XML
    format) (Ong et al., 2015). ATmega2560 programming is based on the Processing
    IDE and programmed with Arduino IDE software. The code is called a sketch and
    the assembly of several for functionalities are called libraries, which simplifies
    the user''s programming tasks by hiding the code in the libraries as a “black
    box”. The ATmega2560 can be programmed within the limits of 256 Kb of Flash memory
    with a clock rate of 16 MHz, moreover in this application of the smart precision
    irrigation system, it is autonomously working without being connected to an interface
    (computer) for control exchange. 2.6. Power unit The power consumption of the
    controller and sensor units, which represent a node in the proposed SPIS, is presented
    in Table 5. Specifically, the sensor unit consumes approximately 1.3 mA. Current
    investigations are being conducted to test the effectiveness of using small batteries
    to power this node. Based on initial estimations, two batteries of 6600 mAh associated
    in parallel could potentially provide a supply duration of around 1 year. This
    allows for reliable data collection with long-range capabilities and the ability
    to record hourly data. Table 5. Current consumption of the proposed system. Sensor

    the primary goal is to gather precise and comprehensive data. To achieve this,
    an integrated system that relies on a PV panel for power supply coupled with batteries.
    3. Operating steps of the proposed irrigation system The operating steps of the
    proposed system are shown in Fig. 10. In the first step, the precipitation status
    is checked, if the sensor indicates that availability, the system is turned off,
    otherwise the system proceeds to the next step of sensing the values received
    by the sensor unit hourly (ambient temperature, solar irradiation and soil moisture).
    The time and duration of irrigation is given after applying the appropriately
    designed fuzzy rules by reasoning according to the information from these sensors.

    Fig. 10. Operating steps of the proposed irrigation system. In this study, the
    information generated by the soil moisture sensor indicates the requirement for
    irrigation. According to the expert of agriculture, the optimal threshold of soil
    moisture for apple tree’s is 30 %. Therefore, the measurement of this variable
    is taken into account in this study. For each situation and variation of the input
    variables of the FL controller, the result is determined by the rules summarized
    in tables 2,3 and 4. Some real scenarios examples are given as follow: • If the
    soil is wet, i.e. exceeds 30 %, and regardless of the values of solar irradiance
    and ambient temperature, the irrigation decision is given by a duration equal
    to zero. • If the soil moisture equals 30 %, and regardless the value of all input
    variables, the system remains turned off, with a null irrigation duration decision.
    • If the soil contains an average soil moisture value, with an average temperature
    and solar irradiance, then the irrigation duration is set to very short duration.
    • If the soil is dry with a high temperature and a minimum solar irradiance, the
    duration is set to zero, since the high temperatures generate an increase in evaporation
    and water loses. In the area where the experiment is conducted, the process of
    water aspiration through the soil has been estimated at 60 min. This duration
    is based on experimental measurements for a well-known soil constitution. The
    system is programmed to restart the same sequences, which justifies the frequency
    of sending data to the platform. 4. Software and hardware implementation The FL
    controller has been implemented in real-time through a code in C language adapted
    with ATmega2560 microcontroller, the structure of the code is given as follows:
    firstly, a declaration of the libraries to be used, namely that of the FL, the
    sensors used, the actuators (relay) that is used to control the impulse solenoid
    and the display. After acquiring the data, the processing by fuzzy controllers
    begins. The fuzzy logic code is devised in three parts, first is the design of
    the membership functions by using equations (4), (5) on each of the three inputs
    (soil moisture, ambient temperature, and solar irradiance) and defining the variation
    ranges. Secondly the design of the fuzzy rules, in our case 27 rules are implemented.
    The last part is the defuzzification, which consists in assigning the results
    to the output in the form of linguistic variable to be exploited afterwards. The
    output being the duration and the time of irrigation, this value is converted
    into control signal form to activate the relay that enables to activate the electro
    valve and pump to start the irrigation process. The controller is programmed to
    repeat the same sequences every hour, the program performs and schedule automatically
    the duration and times of irrigation periods without any human intervention. The
    communication between the control unit (ATmega2560), the sensors unit, the irrigation
    unit and the IoT platform is realized via the ESP32 development board by sending
    instructions. The SPIS prototype is shown in Fig. 11, and the irrigation unit
    is shown in Fig. 12. The control unit, which provides decisions, and the sensor
    unit are assembled in a case with an IP67 degree of protection. After receiving
    the decision from the FL controller, an electric control signal is sent back to
    the solenoid. It should be noted that the solenoid is impulse driven, i.e., for
    switching on and off states, it is sufficient to send only one impulse for micro-seconds.
    The operation of the solenoid according to the time decided by the proposed fuzzy
    controller, operates on the internal membrane of the valve. The component list

    17. The experimentation has been conducted over ten days of two different seasons,
    the summer of 2022 and the winter of 2023, this allowed to obtain an overview
    of the behaviour of the system as well as to perform a test under different meteorological
    variations in order to approve the efficiency of the adopted soil-weather approach.

    data for the summer period from 05/09/2022 to 14/09/2022 are presented in Fig.
    14 (a) The data are sensed hourly and consist of temperature (T) and solar irradiance
    (G) measurements. The highest and lowest temperatures are 37.72 °C and 15.32 °C
    respectively. The solar irradiance values vary from 0 to 1000 W/m2, indicating
    the intensity of solar radiation received during each hour. It can be observed
    that lower solar irradiance values occur during the night-time hours, indicating
    the absence of sunlight. As the day progresses, the solar irradiance values increase,
    reaching their peak at 1000 W/m2. The temperature fluctuations correlate with
    the solar irradiance values, as higher solar irradiance leads to higher temperatures.
    The collected data from the sensor unit of the SPIS have been cross validated
    with the measurements obtained from a trusted meteorological station. These validations
    have confirmed the accuracy of the collected data, with minimal margin of error.
    During the 10-day performance evaluation, it can be observed that the FL controller
    effectively avoids operating the system during periods of high temperatures and
    intense solar radiation, as depicted in Fig. 14 (b) and Fig. 14 (c) and decides
    on short durations when input variables are medium. This strategy significantly
    contributes to the reduction of ET losses throughout the day. Additionally, by
    referring to the well-designed fuzzy rules, the FL controller selects the appropriate
    timing and duration for system operation. Consequently, the actual soil moisture
    closely tracks the desired value of 30 % with smooth oscillations (See Fig. 14
    (d)), in contrast to traditional single input- single output (SISO) feedback systems
    that often result in low irrigation performance. This performance evaluation over
    the 10-day period demonstrates the effectiveness and improved performance of the
    FL in maintaining optimal soil moisture levels while minimizing water loss. An
    extensive performance analysis has been conducted on two specific days of summer
    period (13 and 14 September), to understand the overall operation of the SPIS
    (See Fig. 15). September 13th (13/09/2022) represents the operational conditions
    of the system that persist throughout the 10-day experimental period in September
    (summer). By observing the system''s performance on this day, valuable insights
    can be gained regarding its sustained operation throughout the experiment. In
    addition, September 14th (14/09/2022) has been chosen due to the presence of precipitation.
    This provides an opportunity to assess the system''s performance under the same
    conditions (high weather parameters variation), but with the added factor of precipitation.
    Analysing its behaviour on a day with precipitation allows for an evaluation of
    the system''s ability to cope with such weather conditions. Throughout the selected
    two-days observation period, it is evident that the FL-based irrigation system
    allowed for considerable irrigation durations during periods of minimal variation
    in meteorological conditions as seen in point A (See Fig. 15). However, it effectively
    avoided irrigation during high-temperature and solar radiation conditions, as
    observed in point B. Consequently, the system reprograms the irrigation decision
    until conditions reached minimal or intermediate values. These decisions have
    been automatically made by the system based on fuzzy rules summarized in Table
    2, Table 3 of section 2.3. Given the high hourly ET rate during the observed period
    in point B, it was apparent that the amount of water applied during irrigation
    would be lost to the air without benefiting the crops. This finding aligns with
    expert recommendations on irrigation practices. In the case of point C, where
    soil moisture is about 24 % and the solar irradiance variable is at a minimum
    value (G = 17 w/m2) while the temperature in a medium value (T = 29 °C), the irrigation
    duration is decided as medium. This approach effectively minimized losses in terms
    of ET. A similar decision was observed in point F, where G = 330 w/m2 and T =
    24 °C. The system consistently made the decision to withhold irrigation when soil
    moisture reached the pre-defined value set by the farmer. This is being observed
    in multiple points during the experimental days, particularly at points D. Additionally,
    the system maintained the same decision (null duration of irrigation) in the presence
    of precipitation, as observed in points E. The average applied amount of water
    for the first day was 529,6L, over the irrigated area which is approximately 100
    m2. It follows that the proposed FL-irrigation control system provides appropriate
    duration to the irrigation unit of the field to apply an average of 5.29L/day/m2,
    that is, 5.29 mm/day. This is similar to the daily estimated ET value using the
    Penman-Monteith FAO model, which is about 5.31 mm/day (according to data collected
    from the sensor unit). Similarly for the second day, the system permit applying
    an average of 471,4L/day/m2, while the ET value is about 4,73 mm/day. The proposed
    irrigation-based soil-weather approaches have been verified under summer period,
    the FL controller avoids applying water during periods when there are significant
    variations in weather conditions (See Fig. 16), this avoids the loss of water
    through evaporation processes, while keeping the plants in a better condition,
    i.e., no stress. In addition, as noted, the duration of irrigation varies depending
    on the conditions measured by the sensors, namely, soil moisture, ambient temperature,
    solar radiation, air humidity and rainfall. 5.2. Inter period Likewise, the obtained
    results during the winter period over 10 days (From 11/01/2023 to 20/01/2023)
    show that the irrigation system is operating in efficient mode and compensates
    the quantities of water required by the plants while considering the values of
    solar irradiance and temperature which are practically small and average during
    this period. A daily average of 1.98 mm/day, has been applied to the soil, which
    permits maintaining a soil moisture close to the predefined value of soil moisture
    30 % defined by the user (See Fig. 17). During this period, the system considers
    the presence of rainfall rates, to minimize the over-irrigation that influence
    the plants. The evolution of soil moisture is shown in Fig. 17 (d). It is remarkable
    that this variable reaches maximums of about 48 % since the precipitation rate
    are important. The duration and period of irrigation are always optimized during
    the variations of solar irradiance and temperature (See Fig. 17 (b) and Fig. 17
    (c)). The system avoids applying water to the plants during the night period,
    this is justified by the minimal ET rate during this period, and low irradiance
    and temperatures values therefore the irrigation durations are at mid-days. In
    summary, the aforementioned results indicate that the proposed irrigation system
    based on the soil-weather approach and fuzzy concept effectively compensates water
    losses in semi-arid regions where the experiment has been conducted, ensuring
    optimal hydration for well-watered and actively growing crops. The SPIS also has
    the capability to adjust water requirements according to weather conditions that
    influence the irrigation process, thereby facilitating improved irrigation management.
    Achieving a forecast of irrigation duration for several days would entail the
    creation of suitable artificial intelligence algorithms, such as artificial neural
    networks (ANN), long term short memory (LSTM), and support vector machines (SVM)
    which can be trained using extensive data collected through the SPIS. At present,
    our team is actively engaged in the development of these algorithms, as well as
    expanding the system to cover larger agricultural areas. 5.3. Water and energy
    consumption analysis The energy and water consumption at the level of the “irrigation
    unit” in the ‘A’ and ‘B’ areas of the experiment field have been carried out.
    It should be noted that the ''A'' area is furnished with drip irrigation pipes,
    along with the proposed SPIS and an impulse solenoid valve, and ‘B’ area is equipped
    only with a manual drip irrigation based commercial timer to preset the applied
    water flow and period which are performed according to the knowledge and visualisation
    of the water-stress on the leaves by the farmer. It is noted also that the ‘B’
    area contains a classical solenoid, which require a significant current to maintain
    the On state compared to the adopted impulse solenoid. During the summer period,
    the farmer refers to a commercial timer to regulate a fixed water flow rate of
    approximately 11 mm/day for ‘B’ area. This estimation was based solely on the
    observation of climatic conditions, neglecting the influence of irrigation quantities
    on plant growth and soil moisture dynamics. Conversely, the proposed irrigation
    system demonstrated its efficacy in area ‘A’ through the evaluation of climatic
    and soil variables. It effectively delivered a precise water supply while maintaining
    soil moisture levels near the optimal range for apple trees. By incorporating
    these variables, the proposed irrigation system proficiently optimized the water
    supply for apple trees, resulting in a notable water-saving of nearly 61 % (±2%)
    over a 10-day period. The farmer consciously decided to apply an average of 110
    mm of water, whereas the SPIS determined a more optimal irrigation amount of 51.6
    mm, equivalent to an approximate daily application rate of 5.16 mm/day. This demonstration
    underscores the system''s efficiency and significance in precise irrigation management,
    ensuring the health and optimal growth of plants. Similarly, the power consumption
    in area ‘B’ stands at approximately 620Wh. Nevertheless, by optimizing water usage
    levels using the proposed SPIS-based FL decision and impulse solenoids, a remarkable
    reduction of approximately 46 % in overall power consumption has been achieved.
    6. Conclusion In this paper, a feedback FL control and combined soil-weather approach
    were presented, to foster water conservation and better irrigation scheduling
    and management in the eastern agriculture fields of Morocco. The fuzzy controller,
    developed based on Mamdani fuzzification using trapezoidal and triangular membership
    functions, effectively determined the duration of irrigation for crops. This utilization
    of FL control played a crucial role in maintaining soil moisture levels above
    pre-defined thresholds, exhibiting slight oscillations to prevent excessive run-off,
    thus conserving water and energy resources. To facilitate real-time performance
    monitoring and the creation of a comprehensive database, LoRa protocol has been
    utilised to communicate with a developed IoT platform. This enabled data to be
    collected on key environmental and climatic variables, as well as precise information
    on irrigation duration and soil proprieties. Presently, this is significantly
    contributing to data analysis and enhancing system performance. Implementing the
    system is straightforward, and its economic viability. CRediT authorship contribution

    IEEE Conference Location: Coimbatore, India SECTION I. Introduction India is mostly
    an agricultural country. Farmers currently manually irrigate the area at regular
    intervals. There is a danger that the crop will get dry because of increased water
    usage or longer travel times for the water to its destination. In many agricultural
    fields, real-time temperature and humidity monitoring is vital. However, the outdated
    wired detecting control approach is rigid, which has various application restrictions.
    This initiative automates irrigation, which is a critical solution to this issue.
    A microcontroller is used to accomplish this, and it uses input to regulate the
    moisture and temperature sensors. This is accomplished by building an automated
    plant watering system using moisture sensors. The primary goals are to eliminate
    continual monitoring and to simplify supervision. With the aid of our system,
    we can implement smart agriculture. The IoT-based agricultural monitoring is part
    of this system. The IOT is revolutionizing the agriculture sector and overcoming
    the significant difficulties and barriers that farmers now confront. If the soil’s
    moisture content is low, then the relay unit connected to the motor switch needs
    to be regularly checked. The soil moisture sensor is used to assess whether the
    soil is wet or dry. It will activate the motor when the soil is dry and deactivate
    it when the soil is wet. SECTION II. Literature Review G. Santhakumar et al. [1]
    proposed a devastating storm that is not a pleasant source of water is what business
    industry in our nation depends on. The water structure is therefore employed in
    the world of commerce. Bush receives aquatic irrigation in an irrigation arrangement
    based on world kind. Plants’ leaf soundness and moisture are both managed during
    this stage The main objective of this work is to construct a pointed remote device
    affiliation (WSN) for a farming environment. In this project, there are two zones:
    the transmitter and the beneficiary space, which houses customers’ laptops. To
    determine how much sponginess is present in the soil, soil moisture monitoring
    equipment is employed. The microcontroller receives data from the moist sensing
    element so that the camera can interpret and monitor the leaf conditions. Within
    the range of 0-5V, sensing element yield is crucial in nature. A microcontroller
    converts unambiguous data to automatic information. The aquatic stream in an extremely
    tank starts to stream in an extremely line by turning on the engine precisely
    when the moisture content is dry. Once the moisture content reaches its maximum,
    the motor must be turned off before the aquatic stream can stop flowing in a straight
    line. Et-Taibi Bouali et al. [2] proposed the ecology is harmed by the unchecked
    control and extensive use of fossil fuels for irrigation water table pumps. In
    this article, they outline a comprehensive SA solution that makes use of cost-effectiveness.
    In this proposed system data processing, data visualisation, and data storage
    are all handled by the Big Data Analytics. This platform also manages the farm’s
    drip irrigation and lighting systems. The components for this project are deployed
    using a Raspberry Pi and Node Red. The latter is a local server with a control
    unit that uses algorithms to decide whether to use a water pump to draw water
    from a basin or from a groundwater source. By turning on and off the lighting
    and water pumps, the wireless actuator network implements BDAP choices. The farm
    and storage are powered by solar panels, a renewable energy source. The storage
    unit is in charge of keeping additional electrical energy generated by the solar
    panels and using it to run the water pumps and lighting when necessary. Whether
    to send the generated electricity to the Smart Farm or store it in batteries for
    later use is decided by the Control Unit. Data collection and data filtering are
    handled by the Cluster Controller. By regulating drip irrigation, addressing the
    electricity scarcity, and encouraging sensible water use by controlling water
    pumping, this proposed system is intended to meet the rapidly increasing demand
    for water tables. Syeda Iqra Hassan et al. [3] proposed automation in agriculture
    is a key area of development for many nations. The need for food is rising in
    line with the world’s population growth rate, which will double in the coming
    decades. Automation in agriculture is the best approach to addressing this sharp
    increase in demand. Farmers’ traditional methods are ineffective for meeting the
    escalating demand. When nutrients, water, pesticides, and fertilizers are used
    improperly, agricultural growth is disrupted and the land remains unproductive
    and desolate. The Internet of Things, Aerial photography, Multispectral, Hyperspectral,
    NIR, Infrared, and RGB cameras, as well as machine learning and artificial intelligence
    approaches are all examined in this study. By using the many automation and control
    approaches stated above plant diseases, the control of pesticides, the management
    of weeds, irrigation, and water management are all easily resolved. Automation
    using advanced control mechanisms for agricultural practises has been shown to
    boost crop yield and strengthen soil fertility. Devi kala rathinam et al. [4]
    propose India’s economy is based mostly on agriculture, which supports roughly
    70% of the population. To meet the global population’s demand for food, agriculture’s
    yield needs to be significantly expanded. Modern technology called the Wireless
    Sensor Network (WSN) is employed to deal with a number of contemporary problems.
    In many fields, including transportation, medicine, the military, mobile phones,
    home appliances, and others, WSN is crucial. All living organisms rely on agriculture
    as one of their major food sources. But due to several environmental changes nowadays,
    farm crops are suffering. WSN plays a significant function in agriculture to help
    overcome this. Here WSN is used for monitoring field, measuring temperature, controlling
    irrigation system. WSN enables the farmer to increase crop production while lowering
    yield costs. The management of soil and water may be done with using WSN. Utilizing
    wireless sensors in this case resulting in very inexpensive implementation costs.
    In this study, the crops are observed using wireless sensor nodes. Sensors can
    be used to measure temperature, humidity, and other theft indicators. Agriculture’s
    productivity is boosted as a result. Automatic processes eliminate the need for
    human work and encourage farmers to develop their farmland. Using GPS, the location
    of the farmland may be transmitted. a few elements, such as a sensor and Wi-Fi.
    Zuraida Muhammad et al. [5] proposed process of attaching equipment’s and other
    items to a network in order to share information and data. The IoT most often
    being used to link things and to gather data. Therefore, the usage of the IoT
    in agriculture is essential in modern agriculture. This work is to build a smart
    agriculture network that is integrated with the Internet of things. To deal with
    changing weather, technology is coupled with an smart irrigation system. The Microcontroller
    Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is used for this system microcontroller. The sensors like
    DHT22 sensor and soil moisture sensor are used for tracking of the temperature
    and humidity as well as the moisture content in the soil. Both a PC and a smartphone
    will be able to access the data. As a result, IoT and Smart Agriculture Systems
    based on Raspberry Pi have a great impact on farmer’s work. The production of
    agriculture will benefit from it as well. When compared to traditional irrigation
    systems, smart irrigation systems using IoT saves about 24.43 % of water annually
    in Malaysia. By doing this, labour costs might be reduced, and water waste from
    daily demands could be avoided. Shrihari et al. [6] proposed irrigation is one
    of the main issues that both scientists and farmers face while trying to automate
    agricultural production; this idea has been around since the early 1990s. A dynamic
    system, irrigation is strongly dependent on external factors. In order to create
    a smart system, the method described in this article uses a specially created
    an model to process data on Google Cloud using Wireless sensors. A design that
    can scale up to large farms and is IoT enabled. About nearly 35 people have been
    harmed by animals, according to Holistic Agricultural Studies. Tensor flow and
    deep learning neural networks are used by this intelligent system to identify
    animals according to their threat level as well as unauthorized humans who enter
    the farm and promptly inform the farmer. The gadget comes with an android application
    that enables remote access and live video streaming surveillance. H. G.C.R. Laksiri
    et al. [7] proposed another critical need for farmers in the agricultural sector
    is the creation of an efficient Internet of Things (IoT) based smart irrigation
    system. An integral cost-effective smart irrigation system based on the climate
    is created by this research. The first step is to develop an irrigation system
    that can be automatically process the required amount of water to crops based
    on the moisture content present in the soil. An IoT based communication feature
    is included to further increase the effectiveness of this water-saving irrigation
    system. This feature enables farmers to monitor the moisture level in the soil
    and controls the irrigation. The system also incorporates updated sensors for
    temperature, humidity, and rain drop size that enable online remote monitoring
    of these variables. These field meteorological parameters are continuously kept
    in a distant database. The management of water distribution is then done using
    an algorithm based on weather prediction based upon on the current weather conditions.
    With the suggested smart irrigation system, farmers can do irrigation in more
    effective. Mohammad Samunul Islam et al. [8] proposed system that will function
    in stages. First motor will be linked to the microcontroller Raspberry Pi when
    the device has been turned on. The system’s salinity, water level, soil moisture,
    and humidity sensors operate automatically based on sensor results. For the purpose
    of converting sensor’s analog values to digital values, the sensors are connected
    to an Arduino NANO. The Wi-Fi microchip module is connected to microcontroller
    for the internet. The microcontroller unit will transfer the data to the Android
    device using internet if the system mode is set to manual. The system then sends
    a push notice to the user’s Android mobile phone. And the farmer can see the sensor
    data in that notice. The farmer will act appropriately after assessing the situation
    as it stands. Alternatively, if the user selects the automatic operating option,
    the system will calculate the sensor data. Water pumps would turn on if the value
    determined is one that is suitable for irrigation. The mechanism, however, remains
    off if the value isn’t suitable for irrigation of water. Abhinav Malhotra et al.
    [9] proposed work collects data from variety of sensors, and stores it, and performs
    analysis on given data. Real-time data capturing for many aspects uses a variety
    of sensors. A PM sensor with excellent precision is SDS011. The data is gathered
    using MICS 2714, which can detect the presence of nitrogen dioxide in the air.
    Data on carbon monoxide are gathered using MQ7. Moisture measurements are taken
    using an FC28 sensor, while temperature measurements are taken with an LM35 sensor.
    For wireless communication, several Pi Zero W must be distributed together with
    the sensors. Numerous sensors will be linked to each Raspberry Pi in order to
    collect data in real time. The data is migrated to a central location, which collects
    data and produces the findings as required, the hardware connections are made.
    The even more cheap and portable microcontroller Raspberry Pi Zero W is a scaled-down
    version of the larger device. WiFi and Bluetooth are included into it. Wireless
    communication between the Raspberry Pi model and the Pi Zero W is planned. Tigor
    Hamonangan Nasution et al. [10] proposed system consists of three components sensor
    system, control system, and monitoring system. Mushroom farming is the focus of
    the sensor and control systems. The monitoring system will run by web pages, while
    the sensor node is made up of sensors that will measure the humidity and temperature
    of the field used for mushroom farming. The microcontroller Arduino Nano serves
    as the command-and-control hub for the sensor system and controllers. A lot of
    monitoring and control systems have been developed using Arduino. The SHT11 sensor
    is the one that this system uses. The output is digitally calibrated by the SHT11
    single-chip temperature and relative humidity sensor, which has many sensor modules.
    Using the Bluetooth communication device HC-05, the sensor value will be read
    and communicated to the bridge device. The information will then be transferred
    via the POST method to ThingSpeak, a cloud service. Peltier modules are utilized
    in the control system as a part of temperature regulation. The Arduino Nano will
    use a relay to activate this module when the temperature rises over 28 C so that
    temperature can be lowered. Anushree Math et al. [11] proposed method of providing
    specific amount of water at a particular time to the crops. This work deals with
    installing a sophisticated drip irrigation system on the National Institute of
    Technology (NIT) Karnataka campus to irrigate the plants. The system’s primary
    controller is the open-source platform, which is utilized to do this. Numerous
    sensors have been used to provide the most recent values of the variables that
    continuously affect the health of plants. Water is delivered to the crops at regular
    intervals by manipulating a valve, based on the information obtained from the
    RTC module. The entire irrigation system can be managed and monitored using a
    website. This website has an feature that lets you either manually or automatically
    to regulate how often plants are watered. Using a microcontroller Raspberry Pi
    camera that provides live streaming to the webpage, the health of the plants is
    checked often. Through a wireless network, the controller gets information about
    water flow from the sensor. The controller examines this data to see whether the
    pipe has any leaks. Weather forecasting is done to limit the required amount of
    water provided, making it more reliable and effective for farming. G. Sushanth
    et al. [12] proposed an IoT system is used to construct a smart agriculture system
    that uses the sensors and microcontrollers. The implementation’s purpose is to
    show off how the microcontroller can be smart and sophisticated enough to make
    decisions about when to water the crops based on monitoring of the surrounding
    environment in the field. It also provides farmers with a pre-determined irrigation
    schedule that can be put into a special application. A distributed sensors for
    soil moisture and temperature sensors placed in plant root zones make up the implementation,
    which is a photovoltaic-powered automated irrigation system. These sensors operate
    as a continuous monitoring system for the parameters, sending data to the microcontroller
    for processing. The WiFi module will be updating the data to the cloud. Through
    a connected module, the IOT gateway also offers GSM capabilities, and this receiver
    unit features an cellular-Internet interface that employs the general packet radio
    service (GPRS) protocol, a packet-oriented mobile data service utilized for mobile
    communications (GSM). Juan et al. [13] proposed work explains about the challenge
    that was solved by creating the Smart node precision agricultural technology,
    which is affordable for farmers. In this technology, the software and hardware
    platforms enable monitoring of agroclimatic factors for optimum crop production.
    To design the suggested system, the following hardware must be used: 1) Low cost,
    2) Distance: the data center is around 2 kilometers from the crop, 3) Reliable:
    communicates data collected to the central unit promptly and accurately; 4) Robust:
    withstands all weather conditions; 5) Accessibility: regional networks, the internet,
    and mobile applications, 6) Energy Efficient: uses relatively little energy while
    in use, and 7) Ecofriendly: system runs on a battery that is recharged by solar
    power. The best components were selected in accordance with these specifications
    in order to meet those requirements. The best parts were chosen so they would
    meet those requirements. There are three primary components to this project: hardware
    node, a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), and the software, which consists of a programmer
    that reads data from a USB port and a Android application. Nils Aschenbruck et
    at. [14] proposed tried-and-true approaches to deal with the two different types
    of challenges stated in the preceding section. Our main methods involve redundant
    hardware, straightforward software, and remote system control. A Wireless Sensor
    Network (WSN) based monitoring system specifically designed for assessment makes
    up the bulk of the architecture. As a result, two crucial measurement sites are
    needed: a ground-level sensor and a similar reference sensor, both of which detect
    incoming solar irradiation in the PAR range. In order to guarantee comparable
    irradiation conditions, the devices must not be placed in the same location and
    their spatial distance must not be excessive either. Routing protocols are not
    needed in the current setup. Due to the fact that cluster heads are continually
    accessible to ground sensors, time synchronization procedures are also not necessary.
    As a result, they might also modify their reference sampling to account for ground
    packet receive events. A central base station is linked to each cluster head in
    turn. Multi-hop routing may be required for these connections, depending on the
    size of the WSN, but is not yet taken into account in our deployments. Instead,
    WLAN is used to connect cluster heads. SECTION III. Execution Plan According to
    the block design as in figure 1, the execution plan will be separated into four
    components. Fig.1. Block diagram Show All These four key elements are the physical
    setup, data collection, data processing, and data analytics. The most crucial
    element for precision agriculture to prevent any unintended outcomes is the physical
    structure. The sensors, actuators, and gadgets are all controlled by the overall
    system architecture. A sensor is capable of several different functions, including
    sensing moisture, light, temperature, soil, and the atmosphere. Similar to this,
    devices carry out several control tasks like node discovery, device identification,
    and naming services, among others. Any device or sensor that is controlled by
    a microcontroller can carry out all these tasks. Any computer or remote device
    linked to the Internet can carry out this controlling function. SECTION IV. Proposed
    System Fig.2. Proposed System Show All The study’s goal is to keep track of a
    wide range of operations, including soil and plant monitoring, environmental monitoring
    (such as temperature and moisture levels), transportation, supply chain management,
    infrastructure management, control system management, animal monitoring, and also
    pest control as in figure 2 Therefore, automation needs to be used in agriculture
    to solve these issues. The Wi-Fi module is initialized when the power supply is
    turned on. The microcontroller and WiFi module talk to one another. The NPK sensor
    analyses 19 soil characteristics, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium,
    and advises fertilizer when the soil is deficient in these nutrients. The soil
    moisture sensor measures relative humidity, with a maximum threshold of 1000°C
    and a minimum threshold of 300°C. The pump motor will pump the water to the field
    when the amount of soil moisture is less than 300oC. The temperature sensor will
    assess the immediate environment. farm’s ambient temperature. Utilizing WSN technology,
    the user will be aware of all the aforementioned information. The mobile application
    allows the user to receive real-time field updates. SECTION V. Result and Implementation
    We are able to observe that the from beginning to end WSN system is able to quickly
    detecting soil parameters and monitoring a field in real time as in figure 3.
    If the soil moisture level is low, watering can be automated by the user using
    a mobile application. The microcontroller provides a fertilizer alarm to the user
    if the N, P, or K values are low. These results demonstrate the effectiveness,
    accuracy, and dependability of our technology as an early detection tool. examines
    how the size of the packet and the quantity of nodes in a region relate to the
    packet loss rate. Our experimental findings on communication dependability show
    that even at low moisture levels, trustworthy and consistent data transport between
    nodes is still possible. Fig.3. Result and implementation Show All SECTION VI.
    Conclusion The suggested work provides data on several soil factors, such as soil
    parameters like soil temperature, soil moisture, and humidity, in order to forecast
    irrigation appropriateness. This technology aids in the analysis of the soil’s
    properties, resulting in a more effective irrigation system for agricultural use.
    To achieve a fully automated system, machine learning techniques are used to teach
    the sensor data how to learn. Utilizing an IoT-based smart agriculture system
    improves crop quality while minimizing human labour requirements. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

  description: Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in a variety of fields and
    has the potential to alter how we currently view farming. Due to its emphasis
    on effectiveness and usability artificial intelligence has the largest impact
    on agriculture of all industries. We highlight the automation-supporting technologies
    such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, and Long-Range (LoRa)
    technology which provides data integrity and protection. We also offer a structure
    for smart farming that depends on the location of data processing after a comprehensive
    investigation of numerous designs. As part of our future study we have divided
    the unresolved difficulties in smart agriculture into two categories such as networking
    issues and technology issues. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are
    examples of technologies whereas the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
    satellite and LoRa are used for all network-related jobs. The goal of the research
    is to deploy a network of sensors throughout agricultural fields to gather real-time
    information on a variety of environmental factors including temperature, humidity,
    soil moisture and nutrient levels. The seamless data transmission and communication
    made possible by these sensors’ integration with Internet of Things technologies.

  explanation: This study presents a fabrication and investigation of an agricultural
    monitoring system using IoT (Internet of Things) and AI (Artificial Intelligence).
    The system utilizes sensor networks for data collection and transmission, and
    AI techniques for data analysis and decision-making. The study highlights the
    role of IoT in enabling the seamless transmission of sensor data and the use of
    AI in extracting valuable insights from this data to optimize irrigation management.
  extract_1: Real-time monitoring of the environment in agricultural areas is made
    possible by integrating sensors with a microcontroller unit. The system can identify
    the presence of pests or unusual variables linked to pest attacks by deploying
    sensors like temperature, humidity and pest-specific sensors. Early identification
    is made possible by this allowing farmers to act right away and minimise any crop
    damage.
  extract_2: According to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, pests lose
    between 30 and 35 percent of India's annual agricultural yield. By applying cutting
    edge AI solutions to this issue there is a tremendous possibility to raise our
    yield. Early pest detection allows for the use of appropriate and less-excessive
    pesticides to protect the crop, increasing crop output.

    Era of Internet of Things Article Open access 20 December 2022 1 Introduction
    The present world population will increase to 8 billion people in 2023. Rapid
    population growth according to the United Nation (UN) makes it more difficult
    to eradicate poverty, end hunger and malnutrition, and broaden access to healthcare
    and educational opportunities [1]. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation predicts
    that the global food supply would need to increase by 70% by 2050 as a result
    of decreasing agricultural lands and the depletion of limited natural resources
    [2]. As a result there is a pressing need to raise farm productivity. Due to a
    lack of natural resources such as fresh water and cultivated land as well as trends
    in declining agricultural yields for several key commodities the issue has gotten
    worse. Another obstacle is the agricultural workforce’s changing organisational
    structure. There seem to be astonishing numbers for the Indian agricultural industry.
    With a Gross Value Addition of US Dollar 265.51 billion it supports the livelihood
    of 58% of Indians. Despite employing around 58% of the working force directly
    and indirectly, this industry only provides about 15.87% of the nation''s Gross
    Domestic product (GDP) [3]. The topic of agricultural productivity is brought
    up as a result. Agricultural Value Added per Worker is the indicator that is most
    frequently used to gauge agricultural output. China, India, Indonesia and other
    impoverished or emerging countries with large populations have the lowest agricultural
    value added per worker. India has the lowest agricultural value added per worker
    among the top 20 economies. Water is essential to life for all creatures including
    plants and animals. It is a fundamental necessity of every human being. The only
    way that water is used in agriculture in India today is for irrigation. This proportion
    may increase as a result of increased food consumption and population growth.
    So a problem that affects most agriculture is a lack of water. By applying various
    water-saving strategies this can be reduced to a minimum. There are many strategies
    to stop or minimise water waste. Tamil Nadu''s quick development and industrialisation
    is responsible for the state''s excessive water usage. The primary factor influencing
    the rapid deployment of ground water irrigation is the ongoing change in Tamil
    Nadu''s yearly rainfall pattern. The main objective of this work is to use groundwater
    irrigation to decrease the negative effects of water scarcity on crop productivity
    in order to sustain agriculture in Tamil Nadu throughout the year. This investigation
    looks at temporal variations in irrigated areas between 2000 and 2014 [4]. We
    use spectral matching methods to map and classify the seven bands of MODIS satellite
    images of the land surfaces in order to show changes in rainfall at the sub-basin
    level. The only way that water is used in agriculture today is for irrigation.
    This proportion may increase as a result of increased food consumption and population
    growth. Thus, one of the problems facing the planet is water scarcity. Day by
    day the most efficient plant monitoring systems currently in use make use of plant
    optical and infrared imaging. Everyone needs water including humans, animals,
    and plants. It is a fundamental necessity of human being. Water waste is the key
    problem in the majority of agriculture. By applying various water-saving strategies
    this can be reduced to a minimum. There are many strategies to stop or minimise
    water waste. Water is trickled onto the plant’s roots using drip irrigation which
    is the most effective method of irrigation [5]. A sprinkler system is an irrigation-based
    system that makes use of tubes-mounted guns, sprays, or sprinklers. Abiotic and
    biotic constraints are two categories of environmental limitations that have an
    impact on crop production. Actually these aspects are more obvious due to climate
    change brought on by global warming [6]. Abiotic stresses modify a plant''s morphology,
    physiology, biochemistry, and molecular structure which negatively affects its
    growth and productivity. Climate and soil characteristics (soil components, physicochemical,
    pH, and biological features) (drought, flood, cold, heat stress, etc.) are examples
    of abiotic constraints. On the other hand biotic variables include weeds, vertebrate
    pests, pathogens, beneficial species (pollinators, decomposers, and natural enemies),
    and anthropogenic evolution. To address all the environmental issues that are
    lowering crop yields and maintaining food security, trans- and multidisciplinary
    research is required. Numerous factors present a severe risk that will lower productivity
    if farms are not adequately monitored and maintained. Three categories biological,
    environmental, and technological can be used to categorise these variables [7].
    Due to the need to increase crop production and the increasing use of farming
    practises like irrigation, extensive inorganic fertiliser application, and synthetic
    chemical weed and insect control, more land has been converted to agriculture
    [8]. These operations have decreased the quality of the soil, the water, exacerbated
    soil erosion, contaminated groundwater and the quality of the food. In an effort
    to enhance yields on current farms while reducing the environmental effect of
    agriculture this has prompted programmes for sustainable development [9,10,11,12,13].
    Today wireless sensor networks play a huge role in agriculture. These systems
    among others include those that use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based
    traceability systems, continuously monitor the environment and preserve agricultural
    accuracy. For the automated irrigation system to transmit the sensor data for
    the soil moisture content, temperature, and humidity to the remote area, a wireless
    modem using LoRa is essential. Wireless sensor networks are used to remotely monitor
    humidity and temperature information on a regular or irregular basis utilising
    General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) based systems. The aforementioned information
    allows us to frame the proposal’s objective as Fabrication of monitoring device
    with AI analyzation of Drought Monitoring and forecasting by Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data from MODIS Satellite. The contributions
    of the study are as follows NDVI time series data from MODIS Satellite along with
    Micro climate Analysis for adapting the new cropping pattern. Implementation of
    irrigation depends on age of crops and Micro climate using AI To monitor crop
    growth leaf colour changes, pest control, nutrients deficiency by Spectrogram
    images adopting AI. Also provide Fertilizer calculator to have a realistic estimate
    of the quality of fertilizer needed for our crop and area. To proposed LoRa Technology
    transmit all sensors data from farm field to control unit without Global System
    for Mobile communication (GSM) technology and any other Internet facilities. 2
    Literature review Currently irrigation is the only usage of water in agriculture.
    Increased food demand and population expansion could cause this percentage to
    increase. Therefore a global issue is the lack of water [14]. Utilising plant
    optical and infrared pictures the most effective plant monitoring systems are
    being implemented daily [15]. Every human, animal and plant needs water to survive.
    Every human being has a basic need for it. Water waste is the main issue in the
    majority of agriculture. Utilising various water saving techniques can help to
    lessen this [16]. There are numerous ways to prevent or reduce water waste. The
    first one is the ditch irrigation system, in which rows of seeds are placed in
    ditches that have been dug out. For the passage from the main ditch to the canals
    there are tubes resembling syphon tubes. The most effective technique of irrigation
    is drip irrigation which involves pouring water onto the plant''s roots [17, 18].
    Sprinkler systems are another type of irrigation-based system that employ sprinklers,
    sprays or guns mounted on tubes. The tubes carry water and some of the ends include
    sprinklers to apply water where it is needed. The sprinkler won’t activate until
    the temperature and humidity sensor in the root zone surpasses the threshold value.
    The rotary system is the best irrigation technique for large regions. The rotary
    system uses mechanically driven sprinklers that travel in a round motion due to
    its 100-foot range. As a result the device sprinkles over time in a larger area
    while using less water. For the purpose of watering cotton crops, infrared thermometers
    are utilised to measure the temperature of the remote canopy [19]. A temperature
    threshold is upheld during this process. When the canopy temperature rises above
    a certain threshold the mechanism activates. The majority of irrigation systems
    are automated rather than manual in order to maximise cotton production and water
    usage. An alternative parameter to calculate agricultural irrigation requirements
    is plant Evapotranspiration (ET). When two terms are combined as in evaporation
    and plant transpiration the result is called ET. Evaporation is the vaporisation
    of water from soil, water bodies and canopy interception [20] into the atmosphere.
    Water vaporises from stems, flowers, and leaves during the process of transpiration.
    Water reductions of up to 42% are possible with ET-based systems [21]. Due to
    uses like vehicle monitoring and robot control, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)
    nodes have grown in popularity in recent years. IRIS nodes built on TINY OS are
    used to measure the soil moisture content of paddy fields [15]. The most popular
    method for measuring the data in irrigation fields is the ZigBee transmission
    of data from end devices. However the distance between the two nodes is only 10
    to 100 m when these devices are used. As a result the majority of applications
    transport data to faraway locations using GPRS-based technologies [17]. ZigBee-based
    transmission is used in the agricultural sector to collect data from numerous
    sensor nodes. In today''s world wireless sensor networks are essential to agriculture
    and the food industry. These systems among others, include those that use RFID-based
    traceability systems, continuously monitor the environment and uphold agricultural
    precision [16].A wireless modem using GSM/GPRS is called the SIM900A. It is crucial
    for the automated irrigation system to communicate the values from the soil moisture
    [12] content sensor as well as the temperature, humidity and other sensor data
    to the remote area. The AT commands can be used to do this. The microcontroller
    unit and GSM/GPRS modem are interfaced [12]. Wireless sensor networks are used
    for remote monitoring using GPRS-based systems to continuously or sporadically
    monitor temperature and humidity data in industry and even in agricultural [18].Various
    models and limitations of existing systems are discussed in the Table 1. Table
    1 Comparison of existing systems Full size table The main objective of this article
    is to develop an automatic watering system using AI and sensors linked to a microcontroller.
    This study made use of the DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity as well as
    the VH400 sensor for soil moisture. These sensors are interfaced with the microcontroller
    unit which was buried beneath the root zone of the plant. Sending an SMS to a
    mobile phone of a remote owner is the main goal of using a microcontroller. SMS
    messages are delivered using the SIM900A module which is coupled to the microcontroller
    unit. The irrigation system is put to the test with various plants at various
    humidity and temperature levels in both dry and typical situations. To keep the
    water content in those specific regions soil moisture sensors are used. All results
    acquired under wet and normal conditions have been shown to be logical. 2.1 LoRa
    technology A LoRa-enabled architecture for precise irrigation and monitoring has
    been demonstrated [28] with each sensor node being able to connect to another
    LoRa-enabled receiver and create a communication channel. A low-power operating
    method called LoRa allows for transmission and reception over a vast communication
    range. Despite the fact that LoRa technology makes it simple to transfer sensor
    data from farm fields to a control unit. Field-installed sensors gather information
    about things like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. These sensors broadcast
    the data in discrete packets using low-power, long-range wireless technology called
    LoRa. The packets are sent by LoRa-capable sensors to LoRa gateways placed around
    the farm. Gateways accept the packets and use the LoRaWAN (LoRa Wide Area Network)
    protocol to send them to a central control unit. The control unit gathers and
    analyses the incoming data to produce actionable insights. Real-time updates on
    crop conditions may be included in this data, enabling knowledgeable decisions
    on pest management, fertilisation, and irrigation. 2.2 Challenges of AI Although
    implementing AI in the agricultural sector faces significant obstacles it is a
    logical step towards smart agriculture for efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable
    farming. The agricultural sector and the field of AI research are not connected.
    Therefore AI researchers are not well-versed in the issues that farmers confront,
    and farmers are also not well-versed in the AI technologies that are currently
    available. It will take more interdisciplinary cooperation to find a solution
    to this dual issue. The use of AI in agriculture is still in its early stages,
    hence there aren''t any established norms or regulations. As a result there are
    several legal questions surrounding smartt farming. Because the majority of AI-IoT
    solutions were cloud-based until recently, farmers were reluctant to adopt AI
    methods due to worries about cyber attacks, data security, and privacy. A new
    IoT option called \"Edge AI\" has emerged to address this problem. Edge AI handles
    sensor data locally and offers better data protection and privacy as well as reduced
    latency and cost. Another challenge for AI in agriculture is a lack of data. AI
    is a data-driven technology. The absence of pertinent data makes it difficult
    to deploy certain AI algorithms. In remote, rural areas with no higher speed mobile
    networks but where agriculture is the main industry, edge AI has the potential
    to transform the game. The potential for intelligent agriculture is increased.
    Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) were used in [29] to compress sensor image data
    at the edge layer before transmitting the compressed data to the fog layer using
    LoRa technology. 3 System architecture The three layers of the proposed system
    architecture are depicted in Fig. 1. Layer 1: A farming device The foundation
    layer of the smart farm architecture is called layer. It consists of numerous
    components, including sensors which are dispersed across the agricultural ground.
    These devices also known as distributed source nodes, are simply LoRa wireless
    sensor networks. They recognise the physical parameters continuously collect data
    in real-time and send it to the gateway node at the following layer. The data
    received by several sensors and cameras in various smart agriculture applications
    is shown in Fig. 2. For instance data is gathered by on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
    (UAV) sensors and cameras in a field of rice and relayed to the edge where subsurface
    soil sensors process it. Fig. 1 System architecture Full size image Fig. 2 Product
    over view Full size image Layer-2: The Edge Computing Layer is included in Layer
    2. There are several edge nodes in this. Depending on the particular smart agriculture
    system, different nodes may be present. Here, layer-1 data is processed, filtered
    and encrypted. Due of resource constraints at the edge layer the prognostic and
    solution components were previously completed at the following layer. Trained
    machine learning models can perform prognostics and provide suggestions at this
    layer, nevertheless thanks to recent hardware advancements and initiatives for
    AI at the edge. However if the task requires a lot of resources or is not time-sensitive,
    prognosis and inference can both be done in the following layer. For instance
    the ESP8266 for integrating smart agricultural components to manage environmental
    conditions [25] and the ESP32 for smart irrigation [26]. Layer-3: The third or
    uppermost layer in the bottom-up design of the smart agriculture system is cloud
    computing. This virtual layer is often located in data centres and is accessible
    via the Internet from any location in the world [27]. Massive amounts of data
    generated by cameras or sensors in agricultural farms are required. 4 Data 4.1
    Satellite data The seven bands of MODIS are used to measure surface reflectance.
    Blue wavelengths between 459 and 479 nm, green between 545 and 565 nm, red between
    620 and 670 nm, near-infrared between 841 and 875 nm, and short-wave infrared
    between 1628 and 2155 nm, are used to examine vegetation and land surfaces. For
    monitoring the vegetation at a continental scale [30] using the Terra platform''s
    MODIS 500-m resolution and 8-day surface reflectance. Scientific Data Set documentation
    for MOD09A1 [31] is given. The study also included secondary data in addition
    to the original data set, which came from MODIS time-series data as shown in Fig.
    3a Fig. 3 a Rainfall fluctuations over time in different irrigated agricultural
    areas in Tamil Nadu. b Tamil Nadu agricultural land classification, by source,
    with major river basins Full size image 4.2 River basins and their irrigated area
    There are 40,000 tanks, 1 million wells, and 61 large reservoirs that rely extensively
    (17.5 BCM) on surface water. Surface irrigation is not as important as ground
    water irrigation (15. 3 BCM). Table 2 provides information on the basin''s irrigation
    condition for 39 years, from 1976 to 2014, together with 54 years'' worth of rainfall
    data, from 1961 to 2014 shown in Fig. 3b also. At the sub-national level, which
    is similar to a state, county or district, statistics on the total amount of irrigated
    agriculture and irrigated area of the country were gathered. The Department of
    Economics and Statistics of the Tamil Nadu government provided data on irrigated
    areas. Daily rainfall data from 2000 to 2014 were collected from the India Meteorological
    Department''s (IMD) Hydro Met Division website at http://imd.gov.in. The monsoon
    was the subject of our investigation. We focused our research on the monsoon season
    (kharif season) from May to December because all the agricultural activities are
    done during this season and image analysis also carried out for that season. Table
    2 Characteristics of the major river basins Full size table 4.3 Spectral matching
    techniques for identifying changes in irrigated area using NDVI The NDVI, which
    is a combination of near infrared and red bands, is frequently used to discern
    vegetation conditions such as density and vigour. NDVI values range from − 1 to + 1,
    with higher values indicating more vigorous vegetation and lower values indicating
    less vigorous vegetation. The total area irrigated from 2000–2001 to 2014–2015
    and the annual irrigated area differ significantly. The change in the irrigated
    area was discovered using spectral matching techniques. The highest mean NDVI
    value in Tamil Nadu was 0.79 during the kharif season. From this result along
    with the micro climate analysis (Temperature, Air quality index and Humidity)
    suggest the right crop for the season. 4.4 Crop management Crop management is
    the process of evaluating the sociological, ecological and economic factors that
    play a significant role in the choice, growing and selling of crops. Cropping
    patterns are influenced by crop growth, the availability of water resources, labour,
    insurance, and environmental conditions using MODIS satellite and AI. Cropping
    patterns might change according to ecological variables. For instance traditional
    crops like paddy agriculture, which require extensive water resources, cannot
    be supported in places with diminishing water supplies and groundwater tables.
    Crop choice is also influenced by the agricultural product''s market as well as
    the export and import regulations of other nations. 4.5 Soil monitoring In the
    overall farming process, soil moisture is crucial. During the course of a plant’s
    growth, it is in charge of photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration and the
    transfer of minerals [30]. In making decisions for farms, soil monitoring is crucial.
    Cropping patterns are influenced by a number of variables, including soil salinity,
    pests, precipitation, pH, and humidity. These elements support the evaluation
    of soil health. Field-based sensors track the temperature and humidity of the
    soil, and the cloud receives through LoRa Transmitter and the process the data.
    Farmers will be informed about a variety of issues, and planting patterns are
    evaluated and chosen depending on salinity content, soil nutrient level, humidity,
    and temperature. A wide range of topics will be discussed with farmers, and planting
    patterns will be considered and selected based on factors like salinity content,
    soil nutrient level, humidity, and temperature. Water is essential for photosynthesis,
    regulates temperature, and transports food and nutrients for plant growth, making
    soil moisture a crucial element in plant growth. Humidity controls the food supply
    and transpiration rate for ideal plant growth. A humidity of 50% to 60% is ideal
    for the growth of vegetable plants [32]. To ensure the best possible use of water
    resources, soil moisture sensors are inserted into plant roots and analyse soil
    moisture level measurements [33, 34]. 4.6 Smart irrigation Smart irrigation is
    the practise of enhancing the quality and quantity of production while making
    the most use of available water resources. By giving the plants the right amount
    of water, it saves water. Irrigation systems can be classified as either soil
    moisture sensor-based or weather-based. A controller controls the irrigation in
    weather-based irrigation systems, which collect temperature and rainfall data
    from a nearby small weather station. In irrigation systems using soil moisture
    sensors, sensors buried in tree grass provide precise measurements of the soil''s
    moisture content. In order to irrigate the field with this sort of irrigation,
    precise humidity and air temperature measurements, weather monitoring, and cropping
    patterns are all necessary with AI. Sprinkler actuators and data are delivered
    to the cloud together [35]. The data from the soil moisture sensor determine the
    irrigation schedule for each farm area. Maximum crop growth and 100% water utilisation
    efficiency are guaranteed by micro level analysis, scheduling, and effective actuation
    [36]. From a mobile application built for smart phones, farmers can monitor and
    may control the irrigation system. This irrigation system is based on information
    collected from field-installed temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and ultrasonic
    sensors [37]. Farmers can execute actuation by turning on the irrigation pumps
    to water the farm using a user-friendly mobile application that is built for smart
    phones and connected to the cloud for analysis. 4.7 Plant growth monitoring The
    key step after selecting a crop is crop cultivation. Modern technology is available
    to farmers and sensors installed in the field monitor plant growth. For instance,
    ultrasonic sensors. For instance, to track the presence of insects and pests that
    hinder plant growth, ultrasonic sensors are deployed in the field. When pests
    are found, high frequency sound waves are produced to eliminate them, and the
    farmer is also made aware of their presence for additional assistance [31]. 5
    Methodology and implementation Applied Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
    Machine intelligence that resembles human intelligence is known as artificial
    intelligence. Many industries, including e-commerce and marketing [38], human
    resources [39], computer vision [40], multimedia forensics [41, 42], healthcare
    [43], social media [44, 45], gaming [46, 47] and agriculture have showed great
    potential as a result of advancements in AI and ML. In agriculture, artificial
    intelligence (AI) is used to improve productivity, crop yield, and profitability
    as well as to track livestock, monitor the weather, optimise supply chains, manage
    irrigation systems, manage pesticide and fertiliser use, and control weeds. Researchers
    are using fuzzy logic, other AI/ML techniques like classification and logistic
    regression, as well as Neuro-Fuzzy logic, to improve agricultural decision-making,
    predictive analytics, and mobile expert systems [48]. Real-time monitoring of
    the environment in agricultural areas is made possible by integrating sensors
    with a microcontroller unit. The system can identify the presence of pests or
    unusual variables linked to pest attacks by deploying sensors like temperature,
    humidity and pest-specific sensors. Early identification is made possible by this
    allowing farmers to act right away and minimise any crop damage. The system may
    analyse sensor data and detect certain pest species or patterns linked to pest
    infestations by incorporating AI algorithms. The accuracy of pest identification
    can be increased over time by using AI models that have been taught to detect
    pests. The manual effort needed for pest monitoring is decreased thanks to this
    automated identification procedure which also provides prompt and precise detection.
    By utilizing LoRa the system can transmit data even in areas with poor or no network
    coverage. This is particularly valuable in rural or remote agricultural locations
    where traditional network connectivity may be limited. The agricultural system
    can transmit pest detection data via LoRa to a central server or cloud platform.
    Using LoRa technology alerts can be sent to the farmer’s mobile device as soon
    as the system detects and identifies a pest attack. These notices may contain
    details on the individual pest the intensity of the attack and suggested pest
    control measures. This makes it possible for farmers to act quickly and protect
    their crops no matter where they are. Farmers can keep informed and make informed
    decisions wherever they are thanks to remote accessibility via mobile alerts.
    According to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, pests lose between 30
    and 35 percent of India''s annual agricultural yield. By applying cutting edge
    AI solutions to this issue there is a tremendous possibility to raise our yield.
    Early pest detection allows for the use of appropriate and less-excessive pesticides
    to protect the crop, increasing crop output. Three steps make up the Process Flow
    module: Data gathering, Keras-RetinaNet-based pest detection and Pest attack density
    detection as shown in Fig. 4 Fig. 4 AI process flow for pest detection Full size
    image 5.1 Training the model We utilised a Keras-RetinaNet model to identify pest
    photos because deep learning for visual identification is becoming increasingly
    successful. Keras-RetinaNet With ResNet + FPN as the backbone for feature extraction
    and two task-specific subnetworks for classification and bounding box regression,
    Keras-RetinaNet, developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR), achieves state-of-the-art
    performance and outperforms Faster RCNN, the well-known two-stage detector [49].
    Recent studies have shown that adopting pre-trained networks and applying them
    to other datasets significantly improves performance compared to developing new
    models from scratch. This was made possible by the models’ capacity to discover
    general features applicable to a variety of computer vision tasks. On the COCO
    dataset, we used a pre-trained model with a ResNet50 backbone, and we trained
    it using our own data. To train our model, we utilised the weights “resnet50_coco_best_v2.1.0.h5”.
    We have tested a number of models throughout the course of this project and updated
    them as we discovered models that performed better. 5.2 Features Pest Detection:
    Detects pests through Keras-RetinaNet object detection model. (As explained above)
    Pest affect Density: The amount of pests found in each image is counted by the
    model. It serves as a criterion to determine how much damage has already been
    done and provides an estimate of how many pests are present on a leaf. The sensors
    and AI will begin to function according to the power supply given to the Arduino
    board in the proposed approach. A soil moisture sensor coupled to a microcontroller
    unit delivers the corresponding readings on a periodic basis, and the DHT11 sensor
    detects the temperature and humidity in the crop roots on the other end. An air
    index sensor is also used to determine the air index. The microcontroller unit''s
    primary goal is to get the data values sent by the sensors and ESP32, which was
    configured to save the data in the cloud. These values are shown on the LCD screen
    by the data that is delivered to the microcontroller. For timely irrigation, which
    supplies the necessary amount of water to the receptive crops according to the
    stages, a Direct Current (DC) Pump and a Microcontroller are employed. If the
    Arduino is turned on and all the sensors are controlled by Arduino, then all of
    the aforementioned sensors will start working at once. The Raspberry PI, AI, and
    camera that are housed in the other portion of the gadget are utilised to detect
    both pest and disease attacks. The farmer is informed if the camera detects the
    insect attack. We also offer a fertiliser calculator to help you determine how
    much fertiliser is necessary for each crop in order to control insect attacks.
    Therefore, farmers may apply the proper amount of fertilisers to the crops using
    our fertiliser calculator. We now offer a mobile application that allows you to
    examine real-time farm data in addition to the fertiliser calculator feature.
    Our mobile application pulls data from the cloud and displays it in accordance
    with what farmers are asking for. Micro climate analysis, harnessed through AI
    algorithms, offers a data-driven approach to optimize crop selection. Through
    continuous monitoring of temperature, air quality index, and humidity, AI employs
    decision trees algorithm to correlate environmental variables with crop preferences.
    For instance, decision trees analyze historical and real-time data to identify
    temperature thresholds where specific crops flourish, ensuring ideal growing conditions.
    Air quality insights guide choices, as AI recognizes crops resilient to pollutants
    or sensitive to air composition changes. Humidity data guides water-intensive
    crop selection in suitable conditions. Additionally, AI can perform clustering
    analysis, grouping areas with similar micro climates, enabling regional-specific
    crop recommendations. AI''s adaptive learning capabilities fine-tune crop recommendations
    over time, enhancing accuracy with each season’s data. 5.3 Implementing a fertilizer
    calculator with AI involves several steps 1. Collect data on crop types, soil
    characteristics, growth stages, and historical pest incidents. 2. Apply regression
    algorithms to analyze this data, correlating nutrient levels with pest occurrences.
    3. Train the AI model using historical data to predict optimal nutrient requirements
    based on crop and soil conditions. Incorporate real-time data such as weather
    forecasts and pest population trends to dynamically adjust recommendations. 4.
    Create a user-friendly Mobile App interface where farmers input crop details and
    receive AI-generated fertiliser suggestions. Integrate data from IoT devices and
    sensors for accurate, up-to-date information. 5. Regularly update and refine the
    AI model with new data to improve accuracy. 6 Results Framework of proposed work
    is variety of environmental factors including temperature, humidity, soil moisture
    and nutrient is defined. Next, select and fabricate the necessary hardware components,
    including sensors and IoT devices. Then, set up data collection and management,
    ensuring secure storage and preprocessing. Develop AI models for real-time analysis
    and visualization of data, enabling actionable insights for farmers. According
    to the suggested algorithm as depicted in Fig. 2, the sensors will start operating
    in accordance with the power supply provided to the Arduino board. The microcontroller
    unit and the soil moisture sensor are both interfaced, and the microcontroller
    unit periodically receives the corresponding readings from the soil moisture sensor.
    Along with the temperature and humidity of the microenvironment detected by the
    temperature sensor, the air index is also monitored using an air index sensor
    and NDVI time series data from MODIS Satellite for adapting the new cropping pattern.
    The main objective of the microcontroller unit is to receive the data values transmitted
    by the sensors and the LoRa transmitter, which is set up to save the data in the
    cloud. The microcontroller receives the data from the LoRa receiver and displays
    the information in the LCD screen. For timely irrigation, which supplies the necessary
    amount of water to the receptive crops according to the stages, a DC Pump and
    a Microcontroller are employed. If the Arduino is turned on and all the sensors
    are controlled by Arduino, then all of the aforementioned sensors will start working
    at once. The Raspberry PI, AI and camera that are located in the other portion
    of the gadget are utilised to detect both insect and disease attacks. The farmer
    is informed if the camera detects the insect attack. We also offer a fertiliser
    calculator to help you determine how much fertiliser is necessary for each crop
    in order to control pest attacks. So, according to our fertilizer calculator farmers
    can feed the correct quantity of fertilizers to the crops. Along with fertilizer
    calculator facility we also provide Mobile Application to view the live data of
    the farm. Our mobile application retrieves data from the cloud and shows it in
    accordance with what farmers are asking for (multilingual). Google Firebase, where
    the database is located and the web server is hosted on Apache Web Server, receives
    the data. Figures 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 display the entire prototype output

    7 Conclusion Technology advancements and the meteoric expansion of ICT have transformed
    traditional agriculture into a smart, intelligent, automated agriculture. Smart
    agriculture reduces its carbon footprint by implementing sustainable, green farming,
    limiting the use of pesticides and fertilisers, and increasing the use of natural
    resources. As was already said, smart agriculture has various challenges. To get
    around these challenges, both new and old technologies must be used. In this work,
    cloud-based AI models for smart agriculture are used. The use of advanced microcontrollers
    in hardware has expedited the shift in computing paradigm. Giving IoT devices
    intelligence is the most recent development. LoRa technology enables network accessibility.
    If the sensor data exceeds a predetermined threshold value, the microcontroller
    unit continuously examines the sensor data using AI and sends an alarm SMS to
    the mobile phone of an owner who is in a faraway place. The relevant data obtained
    from measuring the DHT11 sensor''s varied readings in a range of climatic conditions
    are used to determine the threshold value. By employing WSN nodes like LoRa for
    data transmission and database systems for local data storage, this system can
    be improved. Technology advancements and the meteoric emergence of AI have transformed
    traditional agriculture into a smart, intelligent, automated agriculture. Smart
    agriculture reduces its carbon footprint by implementing sustainable, green farming,
    limiting the use of pesticides and fertilisers, and increasing the use of natural
    resources. The agricultural industry will soon include Agriculture 5.0 [48]. By
    doing this, the system''s sustainability will be preserved as yields rise. Both
    industrialised and developing countries will follow a similar trend. From an economic
    and environmental standpoint, humanity will embrace efficient food production
    and delivery more than ever [50]. Future work of the work should prioritize sensor
    technology advancements, enhancing AI models for precision agriculture, optimizing
    energy efficiency, expanding user-friendly interfaces, promoting scalability and
    cost-efficiency. These efforts will contribute to more accurate data collection,
    better decision-making for farmers, sustainable IoT implementations, improved
    accessibility, and wider adoption of this technology, ultimately fostering increased
    agricultural productivity and sustainability. References World Health Organization

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Sydney, NSW, Australia SECTION I. Introduction
    There is increasing demand to improve agricultural productivity, with the world''s
    population set to reach 9 billion by the middle of this century [1]. At the same
    time, there are competing demands on limited resources such as land and water.
    This has led to multi-disciplinary research on improving crop yields relative
    to inputs, such as water and fertilizer, while improving environmental sustainability.
    This research has involved agricultural scientists, geneticists, irrigation engineers,
    hydrologists, chemical engineers, among others. There is a demand to improve overall
    cropping productivity across fields, farms and countries. A crucial factor in
    this work is gathering data on the drivers of crop growth, including water, weather
    and soil properties. Being able to collect and process such data as cheaply, accurately
    and robustly as possible will enable more growers access to optimize day-to-day
    farming decisions. It will also provide researchers with the information needed
    to study crop yield versus inputs, thus allowing the overall productivity and
    profitability of farming operations to be maximized. Advances in electronics,
    communications, data analysis and visualization provides opportunities to greatly
    improve the volume and usefulness of data being gathered. The internet-of-things
    (IoT) revolution is of particular interest, as it is enabling low cost, low power
    consumption and highly scalable sensor networks to be deployed [2]. Example sensor
    data of interest is environmental data such as wind speed, solar radiation and
    rainfall; soil data such as moisture content, oxygen status and temperature; and
    plant data that indicate stress such as leaf temperature and sap flow. Having
    online access to this kind of data is enabling smarter farming decisions in terms
    of the timing and quantity of irrigation, fertilization and herbicide application.
    This can lead to improved outcomes in terms of yield, profit, and environmental
    management. Agricultural data has historically been gathered using expensive and
    dedicated sensors and loggers. Data had to be downloaded periodically and manually
    over wired interfaces, such as RS-232. This was cumbersome and inefficient, and
    did not facilitate real-time monitoring and sharing of data. More recently, sensors
    with wireless upload capability have been deployed. Some of these devices have
    a cellular connection per sensor. This results in high cellular subscription costs
    if many sensors are needed, and there are difficulties providing reliable connectivity
    in many farming areas with poor cellular coverage. Other systems use mesh or machine-to-machine
    networks such as Zigbee (based on IEEE 802.15.4), with a central gateway to the
    internet. Such networks have limited data rates, which means they are only useful
    for sensors with low bandwidth requirements. In addition, the end devices are
    not directly accessible through the internet, so remote software upgrade and debugging
    is difficult. When device updates are needed, expensive and time consuming travel
    to farm sites is required. Available wireless protocols are described in [3] and
    summarized in Table I. There are a number of upcoming longer range and lower power
    protocols such as LoRa [4] and 802.11 ah [5], which will be attractive in agricultural
    settings. The IEEE 802.11 a/b/n protocol (WiFi) has traditionally been considered
    too expensive, power hungry and short-range to be useful for agriculture sensor
    networks [6]. However, we see a number of distinct advantages of this technology.
    Firstly, WiFi is the wireless protocol of the internet - it is widely available
    in portable devices including those used in farming scenarios. Secondly, it supports
    high data-rates, which is becoming increasingly important in farming applications
    such as wireless cameras monitoring irrigation flow, and interaction with drone
    and satellite imagery. Such applications are not possible with low data-rate networks
    such as Zigbee. Thirdly, the transmission range is very workable in the outdoor
    on-farm scenario as will be demonstrated later in this paper. Thus, given that
    WiFi supports many applications of interest to farms, not only the wireless sensor
    network application, we considered it an attractive proposal to base a wireless
    data logging platform on it. It will be demonstrated that the perceived disadvantages
    of the WiFi protocol for farming applications can be overcome using thoughtful
    system and device design. Table I Comparison of wireless technologies for agricultural
    applications. All numbers are approximate, as a simple indication of the order
    of each parameter. This paper describes a new data gathering platform using WiFi,
    named WiField. It uses various techniques to provide a low-cost, low-power and
    flexible solution. It enables gathering data from a wide range of sensors, including
    soil properties and weather. New sensor types and functionality can easily be
    added through remote, wireless software updates. It is highly scalable, so many
    devices can be deployed across a field or farm. It will be demonstrated that on-farm
    communication ranges of greater than 1km are easily achievable. Many devices have
    been deployed on farms both in Australia and South-East Asia, and the real-time
    data is being used by researchers and growers to study and improve crop productivity.
    Goanna Telemetry Systems1 are now providing the technology to commercial farming
    operations, monitoring soil moisture, rainfall, canopy temperature, water and
    fuel levels (rice paddy, storage, channel, tank), and weather stations. SECTION
    II. System Design The system is illustrated in Fig. 1 and consists of: the on-farm
    WiFi network provided by an internet-connected WiFi access point; the WiField
    devices that can connect to this network; and the cloud-based data storage, processing
    and internet interface. The internet interface includes data visualization to
    support farm decision-making, and tools to check device configuration and status.
    The WiFi network used to connect the WiField devices to the internet may take
    several forms, depending on requirements and the availability of power and network
    at each site. An example farm scenario making use of WiField devices is shown
    in Fig. 2. On large farms with loggers across multiple fields, there is the option
    of using point-to-point links to share the internet connection with another WiFi
    access point. Distances around 10km are easily achievable with these links. Fig.
    1. Wifield system overview. Show All Fig. 2. Example on-farm wifi network, providing
    direct internet access to many wifield devices along with machines and computers.
    Show All A. Continuous Upload Using Fixed Wifi Access Points The preferred use
    case, illustrated in Fig. 2, is to have a WiFi access point providing continuous
    internet connection across a farm. This may be powered from the mains, with data
    supplied by a wired ethernet connection if available. However, often power and
    network are not available on farms. In this case, a solar-powered WiFi access
    point is set up. This includes a cellular antenna, and a 3G modem with SIM card
    supplying the internet connection to the WiFi access point. In remote sites with
    poor cellular coverage, high-gain Yagi cellular antennas pointed at the nearest
    cell tower have provided a robust internet connection. For the WiFi access point,
    devices such as the Ubiquiti Nanostation M2 have been used, which have a beamwidth
    of around 60 degrees, giving 10dBi gain for the WiFi signal. As will be discussed
    in Section IV-A, this has provided connectivity to the WiField loggers over a
    range of more than 2.5km. For powering the 3G modem and WiFi access point at these
    remote sites, a 12V battery is used, typically with 15Ah capacity. This is kept
    charged using a solar panel, typically 40W. One cellular data connection can be
    shared among many loggers on a site, thus reducing cellular access costs, making
    this a very scalable solution. B. Infrequent Upload Using Portable Wifi Access
    Points In some cases, a continuous internet connection is not required or available.
    For these cases, the WiField devices contain 32kB of memory, which can be used
    to store data. As an example, assuming a WiField device is attached to a capacitive
    moisture probe with 12 sensors each providing moisture, temperature and salinity
    data. This uses 44 bytes per reading. There is then memory to store more than
    700 readings. If the device is configured to take one reading per hour, this equates
    to more than 4 weeks of data storage. To upload stored data, a portable WiFi access
    point or a smartphone with WiFi tethering enabled can be taken to each WiField
    device and the data uploaded as often as needed. There is a button on the WiFields
    that causes the device to wake up, take a reading from the sensors, and attempt
    to upload all stored data (entering the loop in Fig. 3 at “Wake from deep sleep”).
    If there is new configuration data or new software available, this will be pushed
    to the device at the same time. C. Wireless Configuration One advantage of using
    the WiFi interface is that the devices can have their software updated or be re-configured
    remotely over the internet. The configuration is sent to a particular device using
    its unique http address. Some of the features that can be configured in this way
    are: Logging interval Level of status information to store and send What type
    of logger scenario and power management is being used (eg solar-powered weather
    station or battery-powered logger) What types of sensors are connected Adding
    WiFi SSID and password credentials if a new network is to be used Addresses and
    types of cloud-based services that data should be uploaded to. Currently implemented
    examples include Google Sheets using the Google API, proprietry APIs for commercial
    agriculture data providers (e.g. Goanna Telemetry Systems) and FTP to weather
    data providers. WiField users can re-configure their devices as farm monitoring
    needs change. For example, they might have soil tension and SDI-12 moisture sensors
    connected to schedule irrigation during the wheat growing season, and water-depth
    and temperature sensors to set ponded water depth during the rice-growing season.
    Device status and debugging data is sent to a cloud-based spreadsheet. This allows
    an administrator to keep abreast of device performance, any issues that arise
    with sensors and how the WiFi network is performing as crops grow (through examining
    received signal strength indicator). SECTION III. Wifield Device Design The WiField
    data loggers are based on the Electric Imp imp002 module2. The module integrates
    a low-power microprocessor, WiFi transceiver and antenna. Code is written in Squirrel,
    a Javascript-like language. The Electric Imp infrastructure defines device code
    that runs on the device hardware; and agent code that runs on their cloud-based
    servers. Electric Imp provide code libraries to facilitate agent interaction with
    web services and common sensors, and they also manage IoT security. This greatly
    reduces development time by allowing engineers to focus on the end-user applications.
    Fig. 3 shows a simplified view of how the WiField device, agent and web interact.
    Fig. 3. Wifield sleep/wake algorithm and flow of data between device, agent and
    web. Show All A. Power Management There are two main application scenarios for
    the WiField devices. The first is where the device is connected to a self-sustaining
    power supply, such as a solar-charged battery. The WiField includes a port for
    a solar panel and can be configured to keep the battery charged using the solar
    panel, making use of analog sensing of both the battery and solar voltages to
    optimize charging. The second case is where the device is connected to disposable
    batteries, which will be replaced by the user periodically. In this case, it is
    desirable that the device power consumption is minimized so it can keep operating
    without user intervention for at least a growing season. A number of techniques
    are used to minimize power consumption. A buck converter is used to regulate the
    battery voltage to the imp002 supply of 3.3V. This maximizes efficiency, compared
    to using linear regulator. The module has a low power sleep state, during which
    it draws less than 10μA . During the sleep time, the power supplies (Vbat, 5V,
    3.3V) to all sensors are shut down using field-effect transistor (FET) switches,
    which helps keep sleep current very low. The module is woken at the interval specified
    by the user as described in Section II-C. The typical wake/sleep flow is shown
    in Fig. 3. An example measurement of WiField wake current is shown in Fig. 4.
    The wake time is typically around 20 seconds, including 10 seconds to read the
    sensors and 10 seconds to attempt connection to a WiFi network and upload data.
    The typical current while reading sensors, and while WiFi is active, is 50mA (depending
    on sensor type). So, assuming a wake interval of one hour, the average current
    over an hour is (20×50 + (60×60–20)×0.01)/3600 < 0.3mA, which is dominated by
    the wake time current. If standard Alkaline 2500mAh AA batteries are used, the
    battery life will be on the order of a year. Using AA batteries is inexpensive
    and allows users to easily replace them when needed. However, the WiField can
    be supplied by any battery type with voltage from 6-17V. Higher battery voltages
    and capacities will increase battery life proportionally due to buck regulation.
    Fig. 4. Example current consumption from 9v. Show All B. Hardware Design The physical
    design of a WiField logger is shown in Fig. 5. The Electric Imp imp002 module
    with integrated WiFi antenna is on the right of the PCB. There is a switch array
    to enable/disable sensor interfaces, for example to switch between weather station
    and probe scenarios. There are a number of FETs, used for power management functions
    such as switching the power to sensors off during sleep and enabling/disabling
    solar charging of a connected battery. Other FETs and ICs are used to implement
    non-standard sensor interfaces that the imp002 module doesn''t support natively.
    The boards are assembled at a medium-scale production facility and mounted into
    rugged farm-ready casing with waterproof connectors. The platform was originally
    designed for an irrigation research group, so flexibility and the ability to capture
    data from new sensor types was a priority, as was having a single platform for
    both weather stations and crop/soil monitoring. Few existing loggers on the market
    provide such flexibility in a single product. The digital sensor interfaces that
    are supported by the WiField platform include I2C, SPI, UART, OneWire, SDI-12,
    RS-422 and pulse counting. Analog interfaces include 4-20mA, voltage and soil
    tension (AC resistance). Soil tension, sensed by gypsum blocks and Watermark sensors,
    is measured using multiplexer ICs. These ICs drive the tension sensors with AC
    pulses. The soil tension in kPa is calculated from the resistance of these sensors.
    Up to 4 soil tension sensors can be connected to each WiField. Fig. 5. A wifield
    unit, as assembled by goanna telemetry. Show All SECTION IV. Results WiField devices
    have been deployed on farms across Australia and South-East Asia since 2016. The
    devices are being used with weather stations, capacitive and gypsum block soil
    moisture probes, tank level monitoring, rice paddy temperature and water level
    sensing, and soil redox potential sensors. The coming season will see additional
    sensor types deployed, including sap flow and infra-red canopy temperature sensors.
    A. Wifi Signal Range One concern that has limited WiFi adoption in farming scenarios
    is signal range. However, tests have shown WiFi range between a Ubiquiti Nanostation
    M2 antenna and the WiField devices of more than 1km on many farms. An example
    is shown in Fig. 6. A WiField was connected to a GPS unit using a UART interface,
    and was programmed to log GPS coordinates and received signal-strength indicator
    (RSSI) every 10 seconds. The device was placed on the dashboard of a car, which
    was driven around the channel banks of the farm. The figure shows logged position
    and RSSI. The maximum measured distance between the Ubiquiti access point and
    the WiField device where the internet connection was still reliable was 2.6km.
    Trees, geography, crop height and weather conditions will affect RSSI, and will
    be the subject of further study. Tests performed towards this study so far indicate
    that the signal range exceeds 1km in all crops tested, provided the logger is
    20cm above the crop canopy. B. Example Data Use and Device Performance An example
    application making use of distributed WiField loggers is now described. The site
    is a large-scale cotton operation in NSW, Australia. A research project studying
    the effects of different irrigation schedules, fertilizer rates and their interactions
    was established in the 2016–2017 season. One of the research questions was: how
    do shorter and longer intervals between irrigations (compared with usual industry
    practice) affect cotton plant growth, yield, water and nitrogen fertilizer use
    efficiency. A randomized complete block design trial comprising three irrigation
    treatments (short deficit, usual practice, long deficit) and two nitrogen rates
    were established. Fig. 6. Ubiquiti nanostation m2 to wifield wifi signal range
    on a cotton and maize farm. The color of the trace indicates received signal strength
    indicator. The blue line measures the maximum tested distance from the access
    point to the device, which was 2.6km. Show All Ten WiField loggers were deployed.
    Six of these measured soil moisture status and temperature in the various treatments,
    from which the irrigation timing was scheduled and the depth of soil the cotton
    roots were drawing water from could be assessed. Three WiFields were used to assess
    soil redox potential, which is a measure of waterlogging after irrigation or rain
    events. An addition WiField was configured as a weather station, collecting temperature,
    humidity, solar radiation, rain, wind speed and direction every ten minutes. The
    weather data was used to calculate evapotranspiration, which is a measure of total
    crop water use. Some of the data derived from the array of WiFields is shown in
    Fig. 7. The graphs are described from top to bottom. The three irrigation deficits
    (short, standard, long) were defined by the soil tension in kPA, a measure of
    how much suction is required for roots to draw water. More negative values indicate
    that greater suction is needed draw water from the soil. The top graph shows the
    soil tension in kPa vs date, measured using Watermark soil tension sensors connected
    to the WiField loggers. There are multiple sensors at different depths, but for
    brevity, only those at 23cm are shown. The plants in the short irrigation treatment
    were irrigated when tension was less than −20kPa, the standard when tension was
    less than −60kPa, and the long when tension was less than −100kPa, as indicated
    by the horizontal lines on the graph (Fig. 7a). Fig. 7b shows the Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI). This is calculated from plant reflectance in the red
    and near-infrared bands from multi-spectral imagery [7] and is correlated with
    plant biomass. NDVI was captured on a number of dates over the season using a
    MicaSense RedEdge multi-spectral camera mounted on a drone. The mean NDVI in each
    of the irrigation treatments was computed. It can be seen that the short irrigation
    treatment had the highest NDVI, corresponding to highest biomass. The dashed line,
    referenced to the right y-axis, is the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) in mm,
    from WiField weather station data. It is calculated using the Penman-Monteith
    equations [8] from measured temperature, humidity, solar radiation and wind speed.
    Fig. 7c shows the cumulative water use. The daily water use is the actual evapotranspiration
    ETc which is related to reference evapotranspiration and plant biomass (NDVI)
    [7]: ETc=ETo× k c =ETo×(1.37×NDVI−0.086) (1) View Source The daily water use is
    summed to show the total water use, and the water use is reset to 0 after an irrigation.
    Figures 7d-f illustrate the data from SDI-12 EnviroPro capacitance moisture probes,
    placed in each irrigation treatment. These are cylindrical probes that are inserted
    into the soil, and have a number of sensors at 100mm increments. Each sensor measures
    the volumetric water content of the soil amongst other parameters. The graphs
    show the water content through the soil profile, from the soil surface (Omm) down
    to −900mm. Green indicates high water content, red very low water content. It
    gives a dynamic display of the depths the roots of the cotton plants are drawing
    water from as the season progresses. In the short irrigation frequency treatment,
    the roots don''t need to draw water below 400mm for most of the season, due to
    constant water availability closer to the surface. In contrast, the long treatment
    plants are drawing water from increasing depths, even below 900mm by February.
    After the final irrigations as the crop is being readied for harvest, all of the
    treatments exhaust water supplies near the surface. This set of example results
    from WiField loggers demonstrate how they are being used to schedule irrigations
    and study plant water use and growth. Such data is possible due to the wide range
    of sensors that can be connected, the low per-unit cost (so many can be deployed
    across a site), and the WiFi connectivity that facilitates effective data collection
    over a site from many loggers. SECTION V. Discussion The WiField data logging
    platform has been demonstrated to be a robust and flexible solution to enable
    real-time use of agricultural sensor data to make farming decisions. WiFi is an
    attractive technology to gather data from wireless sensor nodes on farms. The
    power consumption is not prohibitive, the device costs are low, and in the outdoor
    farming environment the transmission range can easily exceed 1km. Deploying on-farm
    WiFi enables many other connected devices and applications, all using the same
    data account. Some of these applications rely on the high data rates and immediate
    internet connectivity that only WiFi can provide. In our experience, growers are
    very pleased with the new opportunities provided by a fast internet connection
    covering their fields. Fig. 7. Data from numerous wifield loggers on a cotton
    farm. The top three graphs show soil tension, NDVI and eto and calculated crop
    water use. The bottom three graphs show the soil moisture profiles in each irrigation
    treatment and how it progresses throughout the growing season. Show All WiFi in
    indoor environments has been studied thoroughly. There is little work on WiFi
    links in outdoor environments, although one example is [9]. Farming environments
    present unique physical characteristics affecting signal propagation. Therefore,
    it will be useful to investigate signal range and link reliability in these environments.
    The WiField devices are continuously gathering received signal strength indicator
    (RSSI) data, and have been deployed on cotton, maize and rice farms. All of these
    have different characteristics which affect the performance of the wireless link.
    For example, the cotton plants are quite short (<1m), whereas maize is tall (>2m).
    How does crop height affect WiFi performance? Rice is grown in ponded water. How
    does the water affect WiFi performance? Does weather have an impact? A study of
    some of these questions has recently been described in [10]. A natural extension
    of the WiField platform would be to add farm automation capabilities. This could
    be used to control irrigation actuators and channel gates. The loop from sensing
    to control could then be closed, allowing the optimization of automated irrigation
    systems. Such optimization is already a topic of active research [11], and the
    WiFi platform here could contribute because of its low cost and ease of connection
    to cloud-based analytics. The new WiFi protocol, IEEE 802.11 ah will be of interest
    to this system in the future [5]. There are currently no chipsets available supporting
    this protocol. When they are available, there should be the potential of further
    increasing the signal transmission range and lowering power consumption, as well
    as enabling device-to-device communication. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors thank

  description: 'Water resources have a great influence on human society, but saving
    water in irrigation still remains a challenge. This article proposes an intelligent
    irrigation system that integrates a data fusion model and a long-rang (LoRa) network
    for optimizing the watering schedule. A data fusion model is proposed, which first
    adopts the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to simulate and predict the proper
    watering demands by integrating multi-source heterogeneous data, that is, historical
    weather data, user irrigation logs, weather forecasts, and online monitoring sensor
    data. A self-powered wide-area network is implemented and deployed by using LoRa
    to facilitate multiple Internet of Things (IoT) application scenarios. It includes
    a gateway and two types of nodes: a valve node and a sensing node. The node is
    capable of energy autonomy through the scheme of waterflow-based power generation,
    thus realizing maintenance-free throughout the life cycle. A cloud platform is
    designed to provide network management, intelligent irrigation control, and the
    interface of the mobile application. The proposed system is evaluated through
    a case study of landscape watering. On average, the proposed system achieves a
    water-saving efficiency of 94.74% compared with the conventional manual setting
    solutions.'
  doi: 10.1016/j.jii.2022.100367
  explanation: The authors present an intelligent irrigation system that seamlessly
    combines IoT and machine learning technologies. The system consists of multiple
    LoRa nodes deployed across various scenarios, including landscape watering, dust
    removal, and agriculture irrigation. The LoRa gateways act as data hubs, facilitating
    the transmission of LoRa node data to the cloud platform for further processing.
    The cloud platform hosts the LoRa network and provides services for each functional
    block, including data fusion. The system has the capacity to learn from different
    domains of knowledge to enhance its adaptability to various application scenarios.
  extract_1: The valve node supports a two-zone output to switch the valve on and
    off. The output signal is a 9-V 120 ms pulse, so a power conversion circuit with
    large capacity is carefully designed to store enough power to drive the valve.
    As to the sensing node, an RS485 interface is implemented instead of the DC output.
    The RS485 module provides an interface for multiple sensors.
  extract_2: The history records depict the daily and monthly water consumption for
    the user, as illustrated in Fig. 3(e). Fig. 3(f) shows the smart watering interface.
    Once it is enabled, the data fusion model is activated. It provides the watering
    adjustment by combining multi-source data. As a result, the watering schedule
    is optimized automatically.

    a data fusion model and a long-rang (LoRa) network for optimizing the watering
    schedule. A data fusion model is proposed, which first adopts the long short-term

    throughout the life cycle. A cloud platform is designed to provide network management,
    intelligent irrigation control, and the interface of the mobile application. The
    proposed system is evaluated through a case study of landscape watering. On average,
    the proposed system achieves a water-saving efficiency of 94.74% compared with

    autonomous 1. Introduction Water resources are one of the most important resources
    on Earth but are uneven in both time and space distribution. Agriculture, as the
    foundation of human society, is by far the biggest consumer of water. Therefore,
    the use of water resources with high efficiency is an important research field
    in agricultural development. Multiple technologies have been developed to improve
    water utilization, such as soil-less culture [1], sprinkling irrigation [2], [3],
    and trickle irrigations [4]. Although recent advances in agriculture have dramatically
    improved water use efficiency, there is still a high demand for saving water to
    further improve water utilization in some dry areas. Irrigation systems have been
    effectively used in agriculture for many years. A conventional irrigation system
    requires many wires to collect sensor signals and transmit commands to control
    the solenoid valves. The high cost of cables and various accessories makes the
    entire system expensive and complex, limiting the scale of deployment. Emerging
    communication technologies, such as general packet radio service (GPRS) cellular
    networks [5], [6], ZigBee [6], [7], and Bluetooth [8], enable wireless coverage
    for farmland. However, they also have some limitations. For instance, the devices
    using GPRS always consume power, which increases the maintenance workload of battery
    replacement. In addition, they rely on the cellular network provided by telecom
    operators, which is not reliable in some rural areas. As to the solutions with
    ZigBee or Bluetooth, the communication distance is not long enough to cover the
    large area of farmland, although the low power performance of the devices can
    be guaranteed. Recently, multiple low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies
    have emerged, such as NB-IoT, SigFox, and long range (LoRa) radio technique. The
    key features of LPWAN technology include a long-distance communication, low power
    consumption, high capacity, and low cost. The LPWAN overcomes the limitations
    of conventional wireless technologies. Combined with energy harvesting, it makes
    energy-autonomous IoT nodes possible. Consequently, it is a promising technology
    to be used in wireless irrigation systems. In recent years, several IoT-enabled
    water management solutions have been developed for precision agriculture. However,
    most of them are sensing-based solutions, and the watering schedule is a predefined
    offline system. Few solutions consider the user’s experience, knowledge, and long-term
    environmental variables. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI), the long short-term
    memory network (LSTM), was introduced in the field of precision agriculture [9].
    As a special type of neural network, the LSTM is especially helpful for the time
    series analysis [10]. It inspires us to use LSTM to analyze the relationship between
    weather changes and irrigation needs set by farmers and gardeners. Further, the
    acquired models can predict the future irrigation needs for common users. In order
    to achieve the goal, an intelligent water irrigation system is proposed. The novelty
    of the work is that an intelligent irrigation system with data fusion is proposed.
    The data fusion model considers the history of local weather, irrigation logs,
    weather forecasts, and real-time sensor data; analyzes their internal relationships;
    and then forms a big data fusion system to improve water-saving efficiency. This
    article presents an intelligent irrigation system based on a LoRa network and
    a data fusion model. The following are the technical contributions of this work.
    • We explore the method of data fusion to realize intelligent irrigation. Unlike
    the conventional predefined offline system, the proposed system combines history
    logs, weather forecasts, and real-time data to predict the proper water demand
    for future irrigation. By loading knowledge from different domains, the data fusion
    model is expected to extend to more IoT application scenarios. • We implement
    a self-powered wide-area network using LoRa to facilitate multiple IoT scenarios,
    owing to its long-range communication and low-power feature. The waterflow-based
    energy harvesting scheme is designed and implemented by integrating the micro
    hydro generator. The scheme can achieve maintenance-free of battery replacement
    in the whole life cycle. The rest of the article is organized as follows. The
    related work is introduced in Section 2. Section 3 describes the architecture
    and implementation of the proposed system. Section 4 provides the details of the
    experimental results. Finally, the conclusion is presented in Section 5. 2. Related
    works 2.1. IoT-enabled intelligent irrigation The rapid development of the IoT
    has enabled irrigation systems with more new features that can effectively improve
    watering efficiency. In recent years, a variety of wireless sensor network (WSN)-based
    irrigation systems have been proposed. With sensors deployed, multiple types of
    environment information can be monitored. The irrigation system can determine
    watering actions based on the sensor data and the preset threshold by users [5],
    [7], [11], [12]. For example, Roy et al. [6] designed a real-time automated irrigation
    system for crop fields. The system sets up the WSN to sense the parameters of
    the environment using ZigBee. More recently, LoRa was introduced for various IoT
    applications [13], [14]. Zhao et al. [15] designed and implemented a smart irrigation
    system based on LoRa. The system can cover up to 8 km, while the node is self-powered
    with a water turbocharge mechanism. Another widely used water-saving technique
    is evapotranspiration (ET)-based irrigation. The concept of ET is to calculate
    the evaporation from the soil surface and the transpiration through plant canopies
    [16]. The ET-based intelligent watering controller calculates the watering demand
    based on the value of ET [17], [18]. Klein et al. [19] demonstrated a closed loop
    irrigation system that calculates the water requirement from satellite images
    and local daily weather. It achieved a 26% yield increase and a 16% increase in
    water-use efficiency. Munoz et al. [20] proposed a cloud platform for greenhouse
    crop production. It provides forecasting based on models for the climate, crop
    production, and irrigation processes, which makes it more flexible than traditional
    hard-coded approaches. The ET-certified controller usually costs a few hundred
    dollars on the market. In addition, the parameter setting is complicated, requiring
    professional weather and agronomy knowledge. In recent years, AI has emerged as
    a new technology introduced in agriculture [21]. Specifically, in the field of
    water conservation, multiple machine learning algorithms have been proposed to
    simulate the water-balancing model and predict the water demand [22], [23], [24],
    [25]. Goap et al. [22] proposed a machine learning algorithm to estimate the difference
    and changes in soil moisture due to weather conditions. Chang et al. [23] proposed
    a machine-learning-based smart irrigation system with a LoRa P2P network that
    can automatically learn the irrigation experiences from expert farmers for greenhouse
    crops. Moghadas et al. [24] proposed an algorithm for accurate characterization
    of the soil moisture from electromagnetic induction data using Bayesian inference
    and a neural network. Nie et al. [25] presented the prediction result of soil
    moisture by employing different machine learning models. 2.2. Data fusion With
    the development of the IoT and big data, the explosive growth of various types
    of data has brought great challenges to data processing and utilization. Data
    fusion, which can be explained as the process of fusing multiple records representing
    the same real-world object into a single, consistent, and clean representation,
    is used to integrate huge amounts of data from heterogeneous information systems
    [26]. Data fusion was first applied in the military [27]. It is extremely important
    to obtain all kinds of useful sensor information on the battlefield, for example,
    by evaluating battlefield situation and threats and providing tactical and strategic
    decision-making assistance for the combat forces. With the continuous development
    of data fusion, it gradually expanded to many other areas, such as cyber–physical–social
    systems [28], human activity detection and health monitoring [29], sentiment analysis
    of educational big data [30], and industrial fault detection and identification
    [31]. Multiple methodologies for cross-domain data fusion have been proposed [32].
    Dragos et al. [33] presented a method to combine soft and sensor data to create
    enhanced situation assessment for a track-and-detect application. Chen et al.
    [34] proposed a ternary data fusion model based on reinforcement learning in the
    production process of hot rolling. By merging the ternary data, faster and better
    decisions can be made. Zhao et al. [35] developed a positioning system using big
    sensor data preprocessing in multi-source fusion. The fusion technique can reduce
    the data collection amount significantly. Data fusion has also been further extended
    to the field of precision agriculture. In 2014, Mouazen et al. [36] presented
    a data fusion approach for the delineation of water-holding capacity zones for
    site-specific irrigation based on multiple sensors. More recently, Viani et al.
    [37] proposed a low-cost wireless monitoring and decision support system for water
    conservation in agriculture. The system contains a fuzzy logic theory that integrates
    the farmers’ experience, irrigation practices, soil conditions, and crop models,
    providing improved water conservation compared to the conventional threshold-based
    technique. In summary, the existing automatic irrigation systems are mostly sensing-based
    solutions. The watering demand algorithms are usually threshold-trigged, timer-based,
    soil–water balancing schemes, and ET-based, which lack the ability to dynamically
    adjust in time according to weather changes. To the best of our knowledge, few
    studies have focused on AI-based systems with data fusion. In this article, we
    propose a knowledge-based data fusion model based on big data, that is, the history
    of local weather, irrigation logs, weather forecasts, and real-time sensor data.
    The model can achieve optimization for the future watering schedule to improve
    water-saving efficiency. In addition, as we load the knowledge from different
    domains into the proposed model, the system can be extended to more IoT application
    scenarios. Download : Download high-res image (563KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Architecture of the intelligent irrigation system. 3. System architecture
    and implementation The architecture of the system is shown in Fig. 1. It consists
    of three phases, devices, cloud, and user. Various LoRa nodes are deployed in
    multiple scenarios, such as landscape watering, dust removal, and agriculture
    irrigation. The LoRa gateways are deployed as a data hub, in which the data from
    LoRa nodes are preliminarily processed and transmitted to the cloud platform.
    The IoT cloud platform hosts the LoRa network and provides services for each function
    block. The data fusion model deployed in the cloud platform optimizes the watering
    scheduler. Different domains of knowledge can be selected and input to the data
    fusion model to fit the corresponding application scenarios. Moreover, users can
    access the irrigation system either from a mobile application or a web interface
    to check and control the watering schedule remotely. 3.1. Hardware design 3.1.1.
    Gateway The LoRa gateway is the core of the LoRa network and acts as a relay between
    the LoRa nodes and the cloud platform. For irrigation in farmland, the gateway
    is usually deployed on the top of a tower or a building. It can provide signal
    coverage over the whole farmland, usually dozens of square kilometers. As for
    landscape watering in a garden, the gateway can be mounted on the wall of a house,
    depending on the ease of installation and electrical connection. Further, the
    whole LoRa gateway is packaged in a plastic box with IP-68 standards to provide
    waterproof capability. Download : Download high-res image (432KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Design of the LoRa gateway and nodes. (a) LoRa gateway.
    (b) Valve node. (c) Sensing node. (d) Micro hydro generator integration. The gateway
    consists of a microprocessor and multiple modules to realize communication, execution,
    display, and other functions. An ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller is selected as
    the core of the gateway. It can provide high performance calculation with low
    power consumption. It has rich communication interfaces such as USART, I2C, and
    SPI, which are sufficient to interact with other modules. A 2-Kb electrically
    erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM) is used as external memory to
    backup data and configurations in case of power loss. The gateway provides both
    wired and wireless connections to the valve nodes. For the wired access, the interface
    of the 12-zone 24-V AC output is designed through optoisolators. The AC output
    can connect directly to the valve nodes, controlling their working states. A programmable
    logic controller (PLC) interface is also integrated into the board, providing
    an alternative method of node connection. For wireless access, a LoRa module is
    customized based on sx1268 from Semtech. The communication distance can be as
    far as 8 km. The module supports a LoRa network with up to 72 nodes. To interact
    with the cloud platform, the gateway supports multiple communication modules for
    facilitating different scenarios, including Wi-Fi (USR-WIFI232), LTE cat −1 (WH-GM5),
    and Ethernet. Also, a 480 × 320 LCD touch screen is used to set local configurations
    and display the basic information of the gateway. The printed circuit board (PCB)
    of the LoRa gateway is depicted in Fig. 2(a). 3.1.2. LoRa node The LoRa nodes,
    both the valve node (Fig. 2(b)) and sensing node (Fig. 2(c)) are deployed in the
    farmland far away from the gateway, controlling the solenoid valves or collecting
    environment information. An ARM Cortex M0 microcontroller operating at 32 MHz
    is selected. It has 8 Kb of RAM and 64 Kb of Flash, which are sufficient for the
    program running on the LoRa node. Compared with the gateway, the peripheral modules
    are simplified. A LoRa module is integrated for communication with the gateway.
    The power-management module performs the power conversion from the battery. The
    LCD is designed for local debugging and configuration and is tiny and power efficient.
    It can be disabled after deployment. There is a slight difference between the
    two types of nodes. The valve node supports a two-zone output to switch the valve
    on and off. The output signal is a 9-V 120 ms pulse, so a power conversion circuit
    with large capacity is carefully designed to store enough power to drive the valve.
    As to the sensing node, an RS485 interface is implemented instead of the DC output.
    The RS485 module provides an interface for multiple sensors. Unlike the gateway,
    the nodes are usually in a power-constrained environment with limited access to
    electricity. For both the valve node and sensing node, a 2200-mAh Li-ion battery
    is selected to provide the power supply. In addition, a micro hydro generator
    is integrated with the valve node, as shown in Fig. 2(d). The water pipe is divided
    into two branches: One is for the irrigation and another is for electricity generation.
    This structure successfully avoids the decrease of water flow velocity caused
    by the generator. The charging current is between 200 mA and 300 mA at a fixed
    5-V output, which is much higher than that consumed by the node every day. Therefore,
    the valve node can be self-powered, forming an energy-autonomous system. The PCB
    of the node and the battery is packaged inside an IP-68 waterproof plastic box,
    with dimension of 90 mm  × 50 mm × 42 mm. The antenna, made from flexible material
    is attached to the inner side of the box, which makes the node compact. 3.2. Software
    design 3.2.1. Cloud platform A cloud platform is designed and implemented. Considering
    the high availability and load balancing, an HTTP-MQ architecture is designed
    and deployed. The core of the cloud platform is the clustered servers, in which
    RabbitMQ is installed as the middleware of the message queue. The servers provide
    both the RabbitMQ application program interface (API) and hypertext transport
    protocol (HTTP) API for different types of connections. The LoRa gateways and
    mobile applications connect to the servers through the HAProxy server via the
    message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol. Moreover, the web client
    connects the servers through the Nginx server, where HTTP requests are distributed.
    Benefiting from such an architecture, the mobile application can connect to the
    devices through the shared memory message queue. Therefore, the latency is significantly
    reduced compared with the HTTP request mechanism. To meet the requirement of storing
    heterogeneous data, a MySQL database and a backup database are implemented. 3.2.2.
    Mobile application A mobile application is developed to provide an application
    software and an interface for the users, as shown in Fig. 3. The menu interface
    (Fig. 3(a)) contains manual watering, irrigation schedule, real-time sensor display,
    system settings, smart watering, and history records. The watering time of each
    valve can be set in the manual watering interface (Fig. 3(b)). A timer-based scheduler
    (Fig. 3(c)) is available for the user to set the watering time and frequency for
    a whole week. The offset of sensitivity can be set according to the user’s experience.
    The real-time sensor data, such as soil temperature and moisture, air temperature
    and humidity, and water flow, provide online monitoring for users, as shown in
    Fig. 3(d). The data are also uploaded to the cloud platform as feedback for the
    intelligent irrigation model. The history records depict the daily and monthly
    water consumption for the user, as illustrated in Fig. 3(e). Fig. 3(f) shows the
    smart watering interface. Once it is enabled, the data fusion model is activated.
    It provides the watering adjustment by combining multi-source data. As a result,
    the watering schedule is optimized automatically. Download : Download high-res

    (e) History records. (f) Local weather information. 3.3. Data fusion model For
    conventional irrigation systems, the valve controllers are deployed in each zone
    of the garden or farmland. The controllers are usually timer-based. The users
    usually roughly set the daily watering schedule in advance according to their
    experiences. However, such a setting is inconvenient in daily life and inflexible
    for dynamic adjustment. Various factors affect the watering schedule. For example,
    the watering amount can be reduced if there is a thundershower just before watering.
    Therefore, an intelligent irrigation with watering schedule optimization is needed.
    To solve the problem, a data fusion model based on the LSTM network is implemented
    and deployed on the cloud platform, as shown in Fig. 4. The historical weather
    data and the irrigation logs are sourced from the last two years. The weather
    forecast for the next few days is also ported to the model through the API from
    the website. The real-time environment information is collected from the sensing
    nodes for feedback. Thus, the data from the past, present, and future are used
    together as the input parameters to the model. Through the fusion of multi-source
    data, the model learns the users’ irrigation experiences in the past few years,
    and then outputs the optimized irrigation schedule. Download : Download high-res
    image (198KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Data fusion framework.
    The historical weather data and user irrigation logs are exported from the database
    online. It covers as much climate information as possible in the past 2 years
    to ensure the generalization ability of the model. The 13 types of weather information
    in an hourly interval are used, including temperature, daytime, wind speed, wind
    direction, weather code, precipitation, humidity, visibility, pressure, cloud
    cover, heat index, dew point, and wind gust speed. The irrigation logs of each
    zone are also combined as an input of the network. Therefore, the whole dataset
    is a matrix with 13+2 × columns. The first 13 columns represent the weather information,
    the following columns represent the preset watering schedule of zones, and the
    last columns are the actual watering results which are set by professional gardeners.
    Each row shows the timestamps in hourly intervals. The data in each column are
    standardized to have zero mean and unit variance. An LSTM network composed of
    six layers is implemented to estimate the proper watering schedule. The sequence
    input layer receives the data in hourly intervals. Then the LSTM layer with 200
    hidden units learns the correlation of time series and the watering schedule.
    A dropout layer is used with a dropout probability of 0.5 to prevent overfitting.
    Also, two fully connected layers are added to achieve the conversion of different
    dimensions. Finally, the regression layer outputs the estimated results for the
    watering schedule. The action commands are sent to the valves through the watering
    scheduler. In this scenario, the online monitoring data are further used as feedback
    for the watering scheduler. Thus the closed loop of the irrigation system is built.
    It monitors the irrigation process conditions, such as the soil moisture content,
    to avoid any unexpected over-irrigation. 4. System evaluation and analysis Three
    scenarios of intelligent irrigation are deployed in this work. The first is a
    signal coverage test in an urban area. The second is the irrigation of apple seeding
    in a greenhouse located in Shaan Xi Province, China. In this scenario, the mist
    spray in the greenhouses is frequently switched on/off every few tens of seconds
    to maintain the optimal air humidity for apple seeding. Thus, the system’s real-time
    performance is assessed. The final scenario is landscape watering in a private
    home garden where we pay more attention to intelligent irrigation as well as low
    power consumption. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    rate: 2.4k bps. 4.1. Case I: Urban signal coverage The signal coverage test is
    conducted in an urban area. The LoRa gateway is placed on top of a building. The
    detailed parameters are listed in Table 1. During the test, the LoRa node is placed
    on a moving car and slowly moved far away from the gateway. The position and received
    signal strength indication (RSSI) are recorded and displayed on the map, as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Two types of tests with different transmission speeds are carried out.
    For the baud rate of 50.78 bps, the communication distance is as far as 8 km,
    and the receiving sensitivity can be lower than −120 dBm. For the baud rate of
    2.4 kbps, the communication distance is a bit lower, around 5.6 km. The results
    show that the signal coverage decreases with the increase of the transmission
    rate, which is a tradeoff during deployment. Download : Download high-res image

    is deployed on farmland composed of several greenhouses. The gateway is installed
    in a metal box (Fig. 6(a)). The LoRa nodes are placed in the greenhouses, connected
    to the valves and sensors (Fig. 6(b)). The distance between the gateway and each
    node is less than 1.5 km. Also, there is no obvious obstruction for the radio
    transmission, so, the signal coverage can be well guaranteed. Download : Download

    40 m Antenna Isotropic, 3 dBi Baud rate 50.78 bps/ 2.4 kbps Packet length 15 Bytes
    Moving speed <10 km/h The system latency is a critical issue in this scenario,
    as the valves should be controlled in real-time. An experiment on the transmission
    latency between the LoRa gateway and the LoRa nodes is conducted. The gateway
    broadcasts the packet with 10 bytes periodically. The system latency is recorded
    as soon as the packet is received by the node. As illustrated in Fig. 7, with
    the increase of the transmission speed, the receiving latency is significantly
    reduced. The curve flattens out when the transmission speed exceeds 10 kbps. To
    ensure a latency meets real-time demands, a transmission speed of at least 2.4
    kbps is required, and then, the latency can be less than 300 ms. 4.3. Case III:
    Landscape watering We also deploy a LoRa network at a private garden, in Mission
    Viejo, California, USA. The garden is divided into four zones. A valve node is
    deployed in each zone to control the watering. Unlike the greenhouse, the low-power
    and smart watering performance is of greater concern in this scenario. Download

    The battery-powered nodes are deployed in the garden. The wireless solution can
    reduce the cost of deployment compared with the wired controllers, in which the
    power cable accounts for a large proportion. A detailed analysis of energy consumption
    is carried out. The analysis is assumed in a daily use scenario. The irrigation
    system works once a day, and the valve is switched on for 1 min. The LoRa module
    consumes a considerable amount of current; so an experiment is conducted to observe
    the power consumption under different conditions. The module is configured in
    sleep state. It wakes up at regular intervals to listen for any packets to receive.
    The experiment result is shown in Fig. 8. It is obvious that with the increase
    of the wake-up interval, the average current decreases significantly, especially
    when the wake-up time is less than 2500 ms. Besides, a lower speed transmission
    rate consumes more current, as it takes more time for the RF module to transmit
    the same length of data. Considering the balance between power consumption and
    response time, as well as the signal coverage, a wake-up period of 2 s is selected
    with a transmission speed of 2.4 kbps. The total power consumption of the LoRa
    node consists of five parts in different working states. For each state the current
    is carefully measured, as shown in Table 2. Then, the amount of battery power
    consumed is determined using the following equations: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) where:
    is the power consumption of the main board in sleeping mode; is the power consumption
    of the LoRa module in standby mode; is the power consumption of the main board
    in working mode; is the power consumption of the LoRa module in data transmitting
    mode; and is the power consumed to switch the valve on and off. hence, the energy
    consumed everyday can be calculated as follows: (6) The number of days can be
    obtained as follows: (7) In this sense, a battery-powered valve node can work
    for approximately 18 months at a frequency of switching valve eight times every
    day. In some real deployment environments, the frequency of valve action is lower
    than the calculated assumption, so, the battery life cycle can be further extended.
    In addition, the microhydro generator is integrated in some application scenarios.
    In this case, the battery is charged when the valve is on. According to the previous
    assumption, the valve is switched on four times for 1 min each time. The generated
    electricity is determined by using the following equation: (8) It is obvious that
    can cover the energy consumption, . This indicates that an average of 1 min of
    charging can fulfill the node’s daily energy consumption. In fact, the irrigation
    time can be larger in some actual deployments. Therefore, the node can be self-powered,
    achieving an energy-autonomous system. 4.3.2. Intelligent watering performance
    There is a dry season and a rainy season in Mission Viejo, California, as shown
    in Fig. 9. From June to October, there is almost no rain (less than 5 mm). The
    rainy season is from November to April, in which the rainfall is always larger
    than 60 mm. Therefore, there is a strong correlation between the local weather
    and watering amount. For the sake of sightseeing, it is necessary to ensure the
    normal growth of flowers and grass. Owing to the lack of water, the use of a smart
    controller is incentivized by law to avoid over-irrigation in California, especially
    as rainfall is abundant some days. Download : Download high-res image (357KB)

    the proposed data fusion system, the predicted results are compared with the watering
    records of gardeners, as shown in Fig. 10. The predicted results from the model
    are similar to the manual watering schedules in all zones. Table 3 lists the output
    of data fusion model in terms of the total watering amount, average amount, and
    root-mean-square error (RMSE). The RMSE of all zones is close to zero, indicating
    that the deviation between the predicted results of the model and the actual watering
    amount is small. Therefore, it is believed that the model learns the user experience
    from the multiple input data sets. A case study on general users followed, and
    30 days’ data were selected independently of the training samples. The predicted
    watering amount was delivered to the valve nodes to replace the original timer-based
    watering schedule. As shown in Fig. 11, the predicted values are dynamically adjusted
    according to the changes of weather conditions. The predicted value is slightly
    lower in zone 1, zone 3, and zone 4. For zone 2, there are approximately 100 s
    longer than the original watering schedule, which is still acceptable in the daily
    watering. The detailed results of each zone are presented in Table 4. The landscapes
    in the four zones are grow well during this month; so, we believe that the predicted
    watering schedule generated by the LSTM network is reasonable. The watering efficiency,
    defined by the predicted value over the scheduled value, is 94.74% within the
    last 30 days. The advantages of the intelligent irrigation model over other approaches
    are its simple deployment and self-learning capability. Conventional irrigation
    devices, such as timer-based or ET-based devices always require complicated parameter
    setting, which requires professional weather and agronomy knowledge. As to the
    proposed system, it can learn the user’s watering experience and provide optimizations;
    so, it is more user-friendly and convenient for deployment. 5. Conclusion In this
    article, we have presented an intelligent irrigation system based on data fusion.
    The system explores LPWAN techniques, which provide a wireless, low-power, low-cost,
    easy-to-deploy, and intelligent solution over conventional irrigation systems.
    The cloud platform provides a data fusion model that combines multiple types of
    information, enabling an optimized decision for the watering schedule. The user-friendly
    mobile application allows users to set watering schedules remotely, as well as
    check the real-time sensor data for monitoring. Table 5 presents the comparison
    of the proposed work with other state-of-the-art systems. Our work has demonstrated
    a promising IoT-enabled intelligent irrigation system for precision agriculture.

    edge computing, the system can be made more flexible to adapt to different application
    scenarios, and the response can also be further improved in some latency critical
    scenarios. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have

  description: Due to the increasing world population, demand for food products have
    created the need to modernize and intensify agricultural operations through precision
    agriculture. The Internet of Things offers a wide variety of solutions for precision
    agriculture, but implementing it in the agriculture field imposes challenges to
    hardware and data communication in the network. Importantly, the sensor nodes
    have to be reliable for long periods with the limited available battery power.
    In this connection, the goal of this paper is to propose an efficient data collection
    algorithm which improves the network lifetime of the wireless sensor network (WSN),
    decreases the energy hole issue and reduces the data collection delay. In the
    proposed work, the rendezvous points (RPs) in the network are selected based on
    the energy level of the nodes, data packet density and the distance to the RPs.
    Then the mobile sink (MS) moves to the RPs in the shortest possible path to collect
    the data from the data-powered points. A hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm called
    WOAXGWO is proposed to find the shortest path for the MS. To assess the performance,
    the network's lifetime, energy consumption, and latency are considered. Simulation
    findings show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and are validated on
    a coconut farm to demonstrate its reliability.

    premature convergence. • Proposed data collection algorithm first determines the
    optimal set of RPs. • Mobile sink determines the shortest path to visit all the
    RPs and reduces the delay. • The proposed work is implemented in real-time coconut

    battery power. In this connection, the goal of this paper is to propose an efficient
    data collection algorithm which improves the network lifetime of the wireless
    sensor network (WSN), decreases the energy hole issue and reduces the data collection
    delay. In the proposed work, the rendezvous points (RPs) in the network are selected
    based on the energy level of the nodes, data packet density and the distance to
    the RPs. Then the mobile sink (MS) moves to the RPs in the shortest possible path
    to collect the data from the data-powered points. A hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm
    called WOAXGWO is proposed to find the shortest path for the MS. To assess the
    performance, the network’s lifetime, energy consumption, and latency are considered.
    Simulation findings show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and are validated
    on a coconut farm to demonstrate its reliability. Previous article in issue Next

    lifetimeAgriculture 1. Introduction According to the UN Food and Agricultural
    Organization, the world will need to produce 70% more food in 2050 due to the
    exponential growth of the population [1]. But the challenges such as shrinking
    agricultural lands, natural resource depletion, and declining agriculture workforce
    triggered the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) based solutions in farming.
    It helps farmer to ensure high crop yield, reduce operational costs, and to close
    the supply demand gap [2]. In addition, IoT leverages an important advantage of
    automating the irrigation system and monitoring the agriculture field conditions
    from anywhere in the world. Favorably, smart agriculture is under major focus
    and in R&D in recent years [3]. In farming, the IoT is deployed for irrigation
    management, disease and pest monitoring, soil and water quality monitoring, and
    intelligent greenhouses [4]. The IoT is defined as the system of inter-related
    computing devices which has the ability to transfer data across the network without
    any human interventions [1]. IoT integrates a bundle of technologies such as Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSN), middleware systems, cloud computing and end-user applications.
    Implementation of IoT in any application involves four major components: IoT devices,
    communication technology, internet and data storage, processing and monitoring
    [5]. The IoT devices are battery operated embedded systems deployed in the farm
    to measure field data such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, soil moisture and
    soil nutrition. The measured data values are transmitted to the cloud/database
    server for data storage, data processing and to extract meaningful information.
    Using the derived information, the necessary actions are automated with the help
    of actuators. Real time monitoring systems are used to present the information
    to the farmers in their own understandable form. In this work, IoT is deployed
    to irrigate a coconut farm and the farm taken into consideration uses Tamil Nadu
    Agricultural University (TNAU) [6] prescribed main and sub channel drip irrigation
    model. The sensors monitor soil moisture, nutrition and weather data are deployed
    in the farm which are capable of communicating with each other through Zigbee
    [7]. The corresponding implementation of the IoT ecosystem at coconut farm is
    shown in Fig. 1. Though IoT yield number of benefits, there are numerous challenges
    in implementing it in the agriculture field, namely, poor internet connectivity,
    high hardware costs, high maintenance and lack of data security [8]. In particular,
    since the sensor nodes are mostly battery operated, the available energy in the
    nodes are limited [9]. The major energy consumer of a sensor node is radio module
    [10]. So during data transfer, improper routing and imbalance in workload will
    cause uneven energy consumption between the nodes creating energy hole issues.
    Consequently, it reduces the network lifetime and results in huge maintenance
    cost. Using mobile sink (MS) with an efficient data collection technique is one
    of the most effective approaches to mitigate the energy hole issues and minimize
    the data packet delay and packet loss [11], [12], [13]. Download : Download high-res

    Data collection using MS can be categorized into direct and rendezvous methods
    [14]. In direct method, the MS moves to each node and collects data from them
    individually. But with the large number of sensors deployed in the network, it
    induces high data collection delays [15], [16]. Rather, in a rendezvous based
    data collection method, the subset of sensors called rendezvous points (RPs) or
    collection points are selected and the other nodes send the data to the closest
    RP. Then, MS moves to each RP and collects data from them. So the rendezvous based
    method facilitates collecting the data well before the delay bound [17], [18].
    Moreover, improper or static RP rotation policy will cause huge workload on the
    RP nodes and again resulting in the energy hole issue [19]. In order to tackle
    this problem, dynamic RP selection policy [14] is employed where the energy and
    workload balance among the sensors can be achieved. The next challenge is planning
    the trajectory for efficient data collection from the RPs using the mobile sink,
    which is an NP-hard problem [20]. Trajectory planning can be either a learning-based
    or non-learning-based approaches. In this work, a non-learning based approach
    is employed in order to reduce the computational complexity. Finding the tour
    is essentially the well-known traveling salesman problem (TSP), where the goal
    is to find the shortest path to visit all the RPs. TSP can be solved using optimization
    techniques and, in the literature, algorithms such as the whale optimization algorithm
    (WOA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant colony optimization algorithms (ACO)
    [21], etc., have been used. Though these algorithms are effective in solving routing
    problems, they suffer from poor convergence and trapping of local optima. Among
    these algorithms, the performance of WOA has been proven better than the other
    algorithms. WOA works best, especially in the exploration phase, but it lacks
    performance in the exploitation phase [22], [23]. Hence, in this paper, a new
    hybrid meta heuristic algorithm called WOAXGWO is proposed to avoid premature
    convergence, improve WOA’s exploitation phase, and extend the network lifetime.
    For improving the readability of the work, all the acronyms and abbreviations
    are mentioned in the Table 1. The main contributions of this work are: Table 1.

    a novel hybrid meta-heuristic optimization algorithm (WOAXGWO) is proposed to
    improve the performance of the WOAs exploitation phase and alleviate the premature
    convergence. The proposed data collection algorithm first finds the optimal set
    of RPs for each round based on the weight factor calculated using residual energy,
    the data packet density of the node, and the distance between the next nearest
    RPs. • Then the mobile sink determines the shortest route to visit all the RPs
    to reduce the data collection delay. The shortest tour path is determined by solving
    the TSP problem using the proposed WOAXGWO algorithm. • The results of the proposed
    WOAXGWO are compared against other state-of-the-arts such as WOA, GWO, IGWO, and
    WOAGWO. The simulation results for the proposed algorithm are presented. In addition,
    the proposed model is implemented in real time coconut farm to prove its reliability,
    and the corresponding results are shown. 2. Related work Generally, the network
    is divided into a number of grids where each grid has an RP node with a number
    of other sensor nodes. Many works in the literature employed dynamic RP selection
    policies, metaheuristic algorithms, etc. to choose the RPs in the network [14].
    Artificial fish swarm optimization algorithm, Global Levy Flight of Cuckoo Search,
    Particle Swarm Optimization, WOA are some of the optimization algorithms used
    to choose RPs in the network [24]. Residual energy, coverage contribution, data
    fusion degree, the hop distance, the number of packets transmitted and randomly
    generated values are the parameters majorly used in the selection process [17].
    And to forward data from the ordinary nodes to the RP, ring and tree topology
    is the most adopted techniques. In tree topology, the RP nodes act as the root
    nodes. The main disadvantage is that the network experiences under additional
    load during each round due to the tree construction phase. Also there are chances
    that the same nodes get elected as RPs in consecutive rounds. This would cause
    a huge data forwarding load and an energy imbalance among the nodes. Considering
    the movement cost of the MS, it must travel in the shortest possible path to reduce
    end-to-end data collection delay. For this purpose, a number of works in the literature
    employed TSP. TSP can be solved using optimization techniques [17] and the most
    recent interesting trend in optimization algorithms is hybrid metaheuristics [25].
    The major challenge in the development of any meta-heuristic algorithm is to find
    the balance between exploration and exploitation phase. Exploration phase is the
    process in which the optimization algorithm investigates the promising area of
    the search space while in the exploitation phase concerns to the local search
    capability in the design space found in exploration phase [26]. To enhance the
    performance of the metaheuristic algorithms, one algorithm is hybridized with
    another to extract the best performance [25]. Some of the hybrid algorithms proposed
    in the literature are; ant colony optimization algorithm with glow swarm optimization
    [21], dragon fly with firefly algorithms [27], etc. In [21], ant colony optimization
    algorithm is integrated with glow swarm optimization approach, to find the optimal
    cluster head. Distance, delay and energy is used as the parameters in the fitness
    function to select the cluster head. In [27], dragon fly and firefly algorithms
    are hybridized to find the RPs where the fitness function is designed based on
    energy, delay and distance. While, grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm is used
    to propose a distance based clustering algorithm in [28] to improve the performance
    of the WSN. Chauhan et al. [29] proposed firefly optimization algorithm based
    RP selection using the residual energy of the nodes, distance between nodes and
    node to sink. Boyineni et al. [17] proposed a modified ACO algorithm to find the
    RPs and the trajectory for mobile sink by considering residual energy and distance.
    But these works failed in considering path cost, network load balancing and data
    collection latency. One of the widely used latest optimization algorithm is WOA,
    in which the performance in finding the best solution (exploration phase) is good
    but it lacks refining the optimum solution (exploitation phase) [30]. In the literature,
    the simulated annealing algorithm is embedded in WOA algorithm [31] and GWO is
    hybridized with WOA (WOAGWO) [32] to enhance the exploitation phase of WOA. But
    the problem of imbalance between the exploration and exploitation phase still
    existed in both the works. An improved version of GWO (IGWO) is proposed in [33]
    to alleviate the imbalance, but it lacked the performance in the exploration phase.
    Hence, in this work, GWO is improved using dimension learning-based hunting (DLH)
    mechanism and is hybridized with WOA. The resultant algorithm is named as WOAXGWO
    and is used to solve the TSP problem in this work. 2.1. Grey wolf optimization
    GWO is based on the hunting behavior of grey wolves in which the search process
    is controlled by three best wolves , , and in each iteration, and leads wolves
    to the best position to find global solutions. Encircling the prey and hunting
    are the two main steps of wolf hunting. First, the wolves stop the movement of
    the prey by encircling them. The corresponding mathematical formulation is given
    by where . Here, is the current iteration, is the position of the prey, and coefficient
    vectors and are used to control the movement of the wolves near the prey. In the
    hunting process, the alpha wolf identifies the best solution and it updates its
    position if improved at each iteration. While beta and delta wolves identify the
    prey’s location. The following are the equations that are used to update the position
    of the wolves. But in contrast, GWO suffers from the imbalance between the exploration
    and exploitation phase, and stagnation in the local optima [33]. 3. System model
    In this paper, wireless homogeneous sensor nodes are considered and randomly deployed
    in a two dimensional space. These nodes are static in nature which are capable
    of communicating with each other. They are grouped together to form a network
    and the established network model can be described as a bidirectional weighted
    graph G(V,E,w) where is the set of all sensor nodes given by , is the set of all
    the edges in the network given by and is the weight of the edge. Here is a communication
    link established between the nodes and . and are given by where is the Euclidean
    distance between the sensor node and . The sensor nodes are homogeneous, and hence,
    the same initial energy ( ) is set to all the nodes. The location and energy information
    about sensor nodes with G(V,E,w) of the network is fed in MS. In order to collect
    the sensed data and to balance the energy and workload among the sensor nodes
    in the network, dynamic RP selection policy [17] is used. For each round, the
    number of RP nodes in the network are selected and given by and . Then, the possible
    paths to reach all the RPs are constructed, and the distance of the path is given
    by . The shortest path is chosen by the MS to collect data from the RPs where
    that minimizes the sum . Here, finding the shortest path by MS is similar to finding
    the shortest path by solving TSP. As TSP is an NP-hard problem solving it requires
    a better optimization algorithm and in this work new optimization algorithm WOAXGWO
    is proposed and used to solve TSP. So the main goals of this work are summarized
    as follows: (1) improve the network lifetime ( ) of the network by selecting optimal
    RPs dynamically (2) minimize the distance traveled by the MS to collect data from
    RPs and (3) consequently minimize the data delivery delay . This work considers
    that: (1) Wireless links are symmetric and bidirectional. (2) The sensor nodes
    can adjust their transmission power based on the distance between the nodes. (3)
    There are no isolated nodes in the network. (4) There are no obstacles between
    any pair of nodes. 3.1. Energy model The most common radio model [34] is considered
    in this work. Radio communication between the nodes are two types: (1) free-space
    model and (2) multi-path fading model. When the distance between the nodes is
    less than , the nodes can communicate in a single hop and is called as a free-space
    model. While if the distance between them is greater than , they communicate through
    multi hop and is called as a multi-path model. The energy consumption for transmitting
    an bit message over distance for free space and multi-path model is given by (1)
    and the energy consumption to receive this message is given by (2) where , , and
    . 4. Proposed model The proposed work has three subsections: (1) a procedure to
    select rendezvous points in the network, (2) a novel hybrid meta-heuristic optimization
    algorithm WOAXGWO to find the shortest path for the MS to reach all the RPs, and
    (3) a scheme to collect data. 4.1. Rendezvous points selection MS calculates the
    weight factor ( ) for all the sensor nodes and the nodes with heavier will be
    selected as RP. The weight of the node is calculated by multiplying the energy
    ratio with the number of packets that the node generated and the distance to the
    nearest RP. (3) where represents the probability of the node to be selected as
    RP, is the current round number, , is residual energy and is the initial energy
    of the node . is the number of data packets generated by in round and returns
    the distance between sensor and the closest RP. Here, returns the closest RP to
    the sensor and is given by (4) where is the set of RPs and . Initially and if
    there is no RP selected by the algorithm, then . The Eq. (3) ensures the following:
    1. The probability of the node getting selected as RP in round is high, are the
    ones with maximum residual energy, maximum number of data packets generated in
    the previous round. 2. The node which is farthest to the already selected RP has
    high value and hence it ensures that the RPs are spread evenly and hence, the
    number of nodes connected with each RPs is similar and the energy depletion among
    the nodes are balanced. 4.2. WOAXGWO for shortest path selection The performance
    of WOA in finding the best solution (exploration phase) is good, but it lacks
    refining the optimum solution (exploitation phase). So a hybrid WOA approach is
    proposed to improve the exploitation phase and to find the best route for MS to
    reach all RPs. The corresponding algorithm for selecting the best path using WOAXGWO
    is presented in Algorithm 1. The set of selected RPs in the network is fed as
    input to WOAXGWO. To find the tour path, a random RP is selected as a source node
    and from that the distance to other RPs (agents) are computed. Then, the population
    limit of the search agents that is the number of RPs ( ) is initialized. For each
    agent, the is assigned as fitness function ( ). The agent with best score is considered
    as . To start the hunt, the algorithm locates the prey (the next best RP) using
    (5) Download : Download high-res image (622KB) Download : Download full-size image
    where is the position vector ( ) and is the best position of the whale ( ) i.e.
    the best next RP found by the algorithm so far. Initially, the best position is
    chosen randomly. The coefficient vectors and are calculated by , where is a random
    vector in the interval of , is decreased from 2 to 0 to achieve shrinking encircling
    mechanism based on . Here, is the current iteration and represents the allowed
    number of maximum iterations. By adjusting the vectors and , the whale can locate
    itself near the prey. Next, the algorithm generates a random value in the range
    between 0 and 1. Based on the values of and , the algorithm chooses its action
    between (a) positioning the whale in the found best position, (b) exploration
    and (c) exploitation phase. If the value of is less than 0.5 and if then the whale
    is positioned at the best position found so far based on Eq. (5) (refer to line
    9 in Algorithm 1). The exploration phase is initiated if and . In this phase,
    to move the whale far away from the current position, the value of is chosen either
    greater than 1 or less than −1. Hence, the position of the search agents is updated
    using the below given equation (6) where is randomly chosen position of the whale.
    Exploration phase is shown in Algorithm 1 between the lines 12 and 15. If the
    value of is greater than 0.5, then the exploitation phase is initiated. In Algorithm
    1, lines 16 to 24 explain the exploitation phase. Here, the current position of
    the search agent is updated by GWO based approach. The first three best search
    agents from the population are considered as , , and . Then, the prey encircling
    is determined by considering the position of , , and from the equations below;
    (7) (8) here is the iteration number. The first candidate for the new position
    of search agent named as which is calculated by the following equation (9) When
    the new position of the search agent is generated only with the help of three
    best search agents, it causes the search agents to get trapped in local optima
    and slower convergence rate. So dimension learning-based hunting (DLH) mechanism
    [33] is adapted. The position of the search agent at the th iteration is given
    by where is the dimension number of the problem. In DLH mechanism, search agents
    individual hunting is considered and is learned by its neighbors. So, the neighbors
    of are constructed and is given by (10) where is the distance between the position
    vector and at iteration and the radius is given by (11) After constructing , multi-neighbor
    learning is performed where each dimension of the search agent new position is
    calculated by the th dimension of the neighbor chosen from and the random search
    agent from the population. (12) where is th dimension of . The last phase of WOAXGWO
    is selection and updating phase. In this phase, the fitness value of and is compared
    and the best candidate is selected from them. (13) is selected as next best RP.
    The process is repeated until all the nodes are traversed and the best path is
    found. 4.3. Data collection scheme 1. TDMA schedule is assigned for the communication
    between RP and the ordinary nodes to avoid packet congestion and packet losses.
    In the assigned time schedule, ordinary nodes transmit the sensed data to the
    RP and only the nodes which transmit the data will be active. In order to save
    the energy, all other nodes will turn-off their radio. 2. After collecting the
    data from the ordinary nodes, RP aggregates the data to avoid redundancy and fair
    utilization of bandwidth. 3. MS travels to all the RPs in the path selected using
    WOAXGWO. Once the MS reaches an RP, it transmits a Ready-to-Receive beacon to
    the RP. RP acknowledges back by sending the aggregated data to the MS. 4. After
    receiving the data from an RP, MS moves to the next RP. The data collection algorithm
    is provided below as Algorithm 2. Download : Download high-res image (402KB) Download

    (1) first, the proposed WOAXGWO algorithm results are compared to state-of-the-arts,
    improved and hybrid algorithms such as WOA [26], GWO [35], IGWO [36] and WOAGWO
    [32], (2) then the wireless sensor network is implemented in matlab with the proposed
    RP selection policy and mobile sink with shortest path data collection algorithm
    and are compared against EAPC [37], MSECA [29] and DDCF [14] and (3) finally,
    the work is implemented in real time coconut farm to test the reliability and
    effectiveness. 5. Performance evaluation of WOAXGWO The numerical efficiency of
    the proposed WOAXGWO algorithm is tested by solving 23 classical benchmark functions
    (See Table 7, Table 8, Table 9) which were used in the optimization literature
    [26]. Population size and maximum iteration for all the algorithms are set to
    30 and 500 respectively. The classical benchmark functions used in the literature
    [26], [35], [36] are considered to test the exploration and exploitation capabilities
    of WOAXGWO. Table 2. Comparison of optimization results of unimodal benchmark

    Analysis of exploitation capability The functions f1–f7 have only one global optimum,
    and hence they are called as unimodal functions. These functions can be used to
    evaluate the exploitation capability of the proposed meta-heuristic algorithm.
    It can be noted from the Table 2 that the proposed WOAXGWO algorithm is capable
    of providing competitive test results on unimodal functions. In particular, WOAXGWO
    outperforms other meta-heuristic algorithms in F1, F2 and F5. This is due the
    adaptation of DLH search strategy with the integrated mechanism of GWO in WOA.

    f8–f23 are multimodal and fixed-dimension multimodal functions which allow to
    evaluate exploration capabilities of meta-heuristic algorithms since they have
    many local optima. The corresponding evaluation results are presented in Table
    3 and is evident that WOAXGWO is very competitive in exploration as well. Thus
    proving that the performance of the WOA is improved in both exploration and exploitation
    phase. 6. Numerical simulation 6.1. Evaluation of the proposed algorithm To evaluate
    the performance of the proposed work, MATLAB simulator is used to develop the
    simulation environment. The nodes are deployed randomly in 100 × 100 simulation
    area and are varied between 50 and 200. The proposed work is compared against
    EAPC [37], MSECA [29] and DDCF [14] because these works have similar objectives
    as that of the proposed work. The sensors are homogeneous in nature and it is
    assumed that, initially all the sensor nodes are fully charged with 0.5 J of energy.
    The speed of the mobile sink is set to 1 m/s, the data transmission rate is 20
    kbps and it is assumed that there are no obstacles in the MS path. All the other
    parameters and their values are presented in Table 4. Networks energy decreases
    when the data transmission begins. Fig. 2(a) shows the comparison of average energy
    consumption of the network in a round and Fig. 2(b) depicts the comparison of
    average energy consumption of a node in a round. The proposed work yields best
    performance as it consumes very minimal energy than other three existing works
    (EAPC, MSECA and DDCF). Also, it is noticeable from Fig. 2(a) that, the energy
    consumption of the network increases with the increase in the number of nodes.
    In the proposed work, the average network energy consumption is minimized as the
    RP nodes are spread evenly across the network. This ensures that the distance
    between any node and its RP is less and hence reducing the energy consumption
    for data communication. In addition, a considerable amount of energy can be saved
    through data aggregation before forwarding the data in the network. Also, the
    average energy consumption of a node per round (Fig. 2(b)) is reduced because
    all the complex computations such as RP selection and the routing algorithms are
    performed by the MS. These computed routing information from the MS are forwarded
    to the source nodes through RPs. Hence, the computation load and energy drain
    of the nodes have reduced drastically. Table 4. Simulation parameters. Parameter

    it is important to observe the behavior of residual energy. As shown in Fig. 3(a)
    the proposed algorithm performs better when compared to other algorithms as it
    covers a number of rounds. The energy spent by the node is less in each round
    due to the proposed energy efficient data collection scheme. Fig. 3(b) compares
    the performance of the algorithms in terms of network lifetime. In this work,
    the network lifetime is measured by calculating the time span between the network’s
    operation initiation and the time at which the first node ran out of its energy.
    Through the proposed work, only the nodes with higher residual energy and the
    nodes that generate a large number of data packets in the network can become RP.
    This reduce the chances of early node dead and eventually increases the network
    lifetime. Download : Download high-res image (442KB) Download : Download full-size

    lifetime analysis. Furthermore, Fig. 4(a) depicts the number of alive nodes after
    each round of execution. To compute this, the network size is set to 200 nodes.
    As the network starts data transmission, the energy of the node decreases and
    eventually drains all its energy. The improvement in the number of alive nodes
    is observed with the proposed algorithm, and it is due to the and other factors
    considered in the fitness function for the RP selection. Likewise Fig. 4(b), compares
    the analysis of dead nodes in the network. In Fig. 5(a), the performance of the
    algorithms in terms of worst case end to end data delivery delay is analyzed by
    varying the network size. Delay is minimal with the proposed data collection algorithm
    because the tour cost for the MS is minimized with the help of the proposed hybrid
    WOAXGWO algorithm. With the adopted DLH mechanism, WOAXGWO avoids ending up in
    local optima and premature convergence and obtains the optimum result quicker.
    Also, the proposed work, ensures that the RPs are evenly spread in the network
    to avoid data hotspot issues which eventually reduces packet loss and packet re-transmission.
    In addition to that, TDMA scheduling is incorporated to reduce the delay due to
    data collision. Download : Download high-res image (414KB) Download : Download

    implementation of proposed method The proposed work is tested in the laboratory
    setup with 10 XBee based sensor nodes and a mobile sink in an area of 20 ft ×
    20 ft room without any obstacles. The mobile sink is designed using raspberry
    pi, and the sensor node is designed using Arduino UNO with XBee modules for communication.
    All the 10 sensor nodes are powered using 12 V battery and among them three nodes
    are considered as rendezvous points. Each sensor node is equipped with soil moisture
    sensors. So, now all the nodes have same initial energy, sensing and computational
    capability, hence making the network homogeneous in nature. In this work, for
    computational simplicity, homogeneous network is considered. But, in actual scenario,
    different sensors must be used to measure different aspects of the environment
    (heterogeneous network). The real time parameters and components used are listed
    in Table 5. The communication is initiated, and the drop in voltage is observed
    as average voltage drop directly implies the average energy consumed. The desirable
    working voltage for Arduino is between 12 V and 5 V and if the voltage of the
    node drops below 5 V, the node is considered as dead in this experiment. The proposed
    work is compared against ESDCS [38]. After every 20 min, the RP rotation is performed
    based on the proposed RP selection strategy. Also, the battery voltage for all
    the nodes are observed every 20 min and the average voltage against time are plotted
    and presented as graph in Fig. 5(b). The first node dead for ESDCS is noted in
    100th min and for the proposed work in the 120th min. Through this observation,
    the proposed RP selection strategy with the considered parameters proves to be
    more reliable and the workload of the nodes is evenly balanced than ESDCS. In
    order to measure the average packet delay, the packet is time stamped at the node
    during the packet construction. The packet is transmitted to the sink where the
    system time is noted and the difference in time is logged at the sink which is
    measured as delay. The average delay measured through the proposed work is 10
    s while with ESDCS, it is 12 s. The observed delay is minimal with the proposed
    work and is due to the proposed shortest path selection algorithm using WOAXGWO.

    Ublox NEO-6M Place Outdoor Motor driver L298N motor driver The proposed model
    is deployed and tested in a coconut farm with 10 trees while 10 more trees are
    considered as a control group. All the 20 trees are about 50–60 years old, tall
    variety and planted in sandy soil where the soil moisture mostly differs between
    7–9. Drip irrigation is used for irrigating the farm. Though the crop yield depends
    on various factors like nutrition and fertilizer application, here in this work
    to evaluate the reliability of the proposed work, only the quantity of water used
    for irrigation and the yield obtained is considered while treating the crop with
    same nutrition supply. Three sensors are deployed (one for each drip sub-line)
    with an MS and tested the proposed work during the months between June 2020–May

    scarcity condition, the required quantity of water per tree according to Tamil
    Nadu agriculture university expert system for coconut [6] is 30 L per day for
    the months of June, July, October, November and December while 35 L per day for
    the months of January, August and September and 45 L for the months of February
    to May [6]. An actuator with flow control and solenoid valve is deployed to measure,
    manage and control the irrigation. In this work, round-robin irrigation policy
    is adopted and the trees are irrigated once in four days. To say, in the month
    of December, a tree is irrigated with 120 L of water once in four days and hence
    the equation falls to 30 L/day. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    Soil moisture sensors are deployed for three trees as shown in Fig. 6(a) to know
    if the moisture of the soil falls below the threshold value. The corresponding
    circuit diagrams are shown in Fig. 6, Fig. 6. As these sensor nodes are static
    in nature, their GPS location information are pre-fed them to save energy. Fig.
    7(a) depicts the amount of water to be irrigated prescribed by the TNAU expert
    system with the average amount of water used for irrigation per tree per day by
    both the proposed work and drip irrigation models. Fig. 7(a) shows that the water
    irrigated through the proposed work follows the prescribed pattern and varies
    its water usage according to the month of irrigation. But with the manual drip
    irrigation model, the amount of water used is usually higher than the prescribed
    amount as the farmer irrigates with the available power supply rather measuring
    the amount of water used. Generally, the crop is harvested once in 45 days. So
    in the period of evaluation, the crop is harvested seven times and the corresponding
    yield is presented in Fig. 7(b). In Table 6, the yield achieved through the proposed
    method for the corresponding harvested period is given. Here, the yield is measured
    by calculating the total number of crops cultivated per tree and the total weight
    of the coconut crop in kilograms for all the 10 trees obtained through the proposed
    work is presented. From Fig. 7(b), the proposed model yield is significantly improved
    when compared to the drip irrigation method. The result in Fig. 7(a) also shows
    that the amount of water used for irrigation is less with the proposed work than
    with the manual model. Thus, the proposed method achieves better yield with less
    water consumption for irrigation in relation to the ability to achieve reliability.

    7. Conclusion In this paper, the energy efficient data collection scheme using
    mobile sink is presented to reduce the energy hole problem. The proposed work
    selects the rendezvous points based on residual energy, packet density of the
    nodes and distance to the existing RP such that it reduces the energy consumption
    of the sensor nodes. A hybrid meta-heuristic WOAXGWO algorithm is proposed using
    which MS solves the TSP problem to visit all the RPs for data collection. The
    results obtained through computer simulations show that, the proposed work consumes
    about 17% less energy than DDCF and also outperforms MSECA and EAPC algorithms
    in terms of network lifetime and delay. The proposed model is also tested in irrigating
    the real-time coconut farm, and the results prove that it produces a similar yield
    to that of traditional drip irrigation practices. This work is limited to small-scale
    WSNs and it is not validated for large-scale networks, communication characteristics
    in logistic supply chain management systems, and multiple mobile sinks. In future
    work, machine learning algorithms will be implemented to optimize the water and
    fertilizer usage and the sensors will be equipped with energy harvesters to prolong
    the network lifetime. CRediT authorship contribution statement Vishnuvarthan Rajagopal:

  description: This study aimed to establish a water-saving irrigation technique-based
    Smart Field Cultivation Server (SFCS) for paddy field irrigation by employing
    information and communication technologies. The development of SFCS considered
    the requirement on rice growth, pest development, and fieldwork management. The
    proposed SFCS is equipped with a solar power supply system and consisted of sensors
    including illumination, air temperature, air humidity, water level, soil moisture
    content, soil electronic conductivity, and soil temperature. Narrowband Internet
    of Things (NB-IoT) is used for data transmission due to the data size and transmitting
    frequency. A smartphone-based application (APP) has been developed for users to
    monitor field environment by tabular, dashboard panel, and whisker chart box,
    provides multiple data display ways for different purposes. Moreover, a proposal
    for a water-saving irrigation technique named system of probiotics rice intensification
    (SPRI) has been integrated into the APP. With the developed APP, farmers will
    receive fieldwork reminders by calendar day that water-saving irrigation may be
    possibly implemented. The SFCS is not only shown ability on the field monitoring
    but also links the gap between the fieldwork application and modern technology.

    Help Internet of Things based Smart Irrigation Control System for Paddy Field
    Li-Wei Liu, Mohd Hasmadi Ismail, Yu-Min Wang, Wen-Shin Lin  Abstract  This study
    aimed to establish a water-saving irrigation technique-based Smart Field Cultivation
    Server (SFCS) for paddy field irrigation by employing information and communication
    technologies. The development of SFCS considered the requirement on rice growth,
    pest development, and fieldwork management. The proposed SFCS is equipped with
    a solar power supply system and consisted of sensors including illumination, air
    temperature, air humidity, water level, soil moisture content, soil electronic
    conductivity, and soil temperature. Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is
    used for data transmission due to the data size and transmitting frequency. A
    smartphone-based application (APP) has been developed for users to monitor field
    environment by tabular, dashboard panel, and whisker chart box, provides multiple
    data display ways for different purposes. Moreover, a proposal for a water-saving
    irrigation technique named system of probiotics rice intensification (SPRI) has
    been integrated into the APP. With the developed APP, farmers will receive fieldwork
    reminders by calendar day that water-saving irrigation may be possibly implemented.
    The SFCS is not only shown ability on the field monitoring but also links the
    gap between the fieldwork application and modern technology.  Keywords  Irrigation

  description: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have demonstrated research and developmental
    interests in numerous fields, like communication, agriculture, industry, smart
    health, monitoring, and surveillance. In the area of agriculture production, IoT-based
    WSN has been used to observe the yields condition and automate agriculture precision
    using various sensors. These sensors are deployed in the agricultural environment
    to improve production yields through intelligent farming decisions and obtain
    information regarding crops, plants, temperature measurement, humidity, and irrigation
    systems. However, sensors have limited resources concerning processing, energy,
    transmitting, and memory capabilities that can negatively impact agriculture production.
    Besides efficiency, the protection and security of these IoT-based agricultural
    sensors are also important from malicious adversaries. In this article, we proposed
    an IoT-based WSN framework as an application to smart agriculture comprising different
    design levels. Firstly, agricultural sensors capture relevant data and determine
    a set of cluster heads based on multi-criteria decision function. Additionally,
    the strength of the signals on the transmission links is measured while using
    signal to noise ratio (SNR) to achieve consistent and efficient data transmissions.
    Secondly, security is provided for data transmission from agricultural sensors
    towards base stations (BS) while using the recurrence of the linear congruential
    generator. The simulated results proved that the proposed framework significantly
    enhanced the communication performance as an average of 13.5% in the network throughput,
    38.5% in the packets drop ratio, 13.5% in the network latency, 16% in the energy
    consumption, and 26% in the routing overheads for smart agriculture, as compared
    to other solutions.

    cluster heads; energy efficiency; data security; signal strength 1. Introduction
    In various domains, the technology of wireless sensor network (WSN) [1,2,3] has
    been used in an efficient way to improve network performances. The main reason
    to uses different sensors in the environmental field due to their manageable and
    easy configuration setup [4,5,6,7]. Additionally, the sensor nodes operate autonomously
    and construct the network infrastructure in an ad-hoc manner. In such infrastructure,
    nodes have not a stable network topology and they can join the more suitable neighbor
    for data transmission based on some factors. The sensor nodes sense the observing
    data and forward towards BS with the help of some gateway and cluster heads. These
    cluster heads have a role of aggregating the received data packets and relay towards
    BS. The cluster heads effectively construct a single-hop or multi-hop path to
    BS and work as a focal point in entire data transmission. Furthermore, the cluster
    heads store the received data in its memory and follow the store and forward mechanism.
    The end-users access the centralized BS via the Internet or different web-based
    applications to retrieve the required observing data [8,9,10,11]. During data
    transmission, the deployed sensors can be static or mobile. The static sensors
    are also referred to as non-adaptive and their constructed routing tables are
    fixed. While on the other hand, the routing tables of mobile sensors are dynamic
    and frequently updated when any change incurs in the network topology. The static
    routing solutions are more secure when compared to dynamic routing; however, the
    solutions that are based on the static algorithms are not appropriate for large
    regions and network scalability [12,13]. In recent years, the technology of IoT
    has been merged a lot with other fields to improved communication in terms of
    network throughput, resource utilization, and load distribution [14,15,16]. In
    IoT, many physical objects are attached to convert the information while using
    the Internet. Moreover, the technology of WSN provides the foundation for IoT
    systems and supports in observing and forwarding the conditions for the physical
    environment [17,18,19]. Figure 1 illustrates the scenario for smart agriculture
    based on various sensors, sink nodes, BS, Internet, and users. Figure 1. Smart
    agricultural environment based on wireless sensor network (WSN). The drastic changes
    in climate negatively impact the agriculture eco-system causing heaving rains,
    droughts, floods, and abrupt weather conditions [20,21]. These changes are deriving
    threats to agriculture-related food security in the developing as well as the
    developed world. The climates related challenges that are faced by agriculture
    can be overcome by adopting smart agriculture using IoT devices, which can increase
    agriculture yields and productions. The use of sensors in agriculture has been
    introduced in the last few decades as an offline data collector [22,23,24]. The
    offline sensor infrastructure collects data and provides sufficient information
    for making good decisions to overcome future yields or for the next year crops,
    yet they are unable to provide data regarding frequent changes in the environment,
    threatening the agriculture yields. This article is aimed at using state of the
    art IoT based sensor infrastructure to collect data from the environment and securely
    transfer the data to the BS for efficient decisions. In the proposed framework,
    wireless agriculture sensors are scattered in the agriculture land for extracting
    different information related to soil composition, like humidity, temperature,
    moisture levels, and water level finders. This information is securely transmitted
    to the cluster heads, which works as memory buffers or storages to forward data
    towards BS. Upon the reception of data by the BS securely, the BS can provide
    up to date information to users for an efficient decision with minimum time. The
    proposed framework offers an energy-efficient and reliable routing to automate
    agriculture productions with minimum farmer’s burden. The observing data of agricultural
    sensors are routed towards BS intelligently and securely, which improves the monitoring
    and productivity of the agricultural land. The simulated experiments for the proposed
    framework demonstrated outperformed results when compared to existing solutions
    that are based on different network parameters. This article is outlined in multiple
    subsections: Section 2 provides the background work and problem statement, Section
    3 explains the proposed framework, Section 4 shows the simulation setup and detailed
    of parameters, Section 5 provides the experimental results along with discussion,
    and Section 6 provides the conclusion and the future work in this domain. 2. Background
    In the recent era, the technologies of WSN have been applied by different fields
    because of their low cost, easy deployment, and cost-effective environment [25,26].
    In WSN, a large number of sensor nodes are scattered in observing the field to
    sense the needed data. All of the data are gathered and forwarded towards BS via
    single or multi-hop adopted data transmission paradigm for post-analysis. Today,
    the field of agriculture performs a vital role in the improvement and economic
    growth of any country. Therefore, the field of agriculture should be exploited
    with some modern technologies, such as IoT-based WSN to reduce time and human
    efforts, and increase the agricultural throughput in the quality manner [27].
    In agriculture land, different kinds of sensors are used for determining the soil,
    weather, wetness, and temperature conditions. Although, the field of WSN has been
    exploited by many researchers in the domain of agriculture to improve its performance
    and reduce the farmer’s burden [28,29]. However, the deployed sensors have limited
    constraints in terms of memory, processing, transmitting and energy power. Besides,
    data protection is another major research challenge for WSN based applications
    because of their undependable, uncontrolled, and free-space communication foundation.
    In WSN [30,31,32], many researchers have proposed different clustering schemes
    that aimed to prolong network lifetime and efficient data transmission [33,34,35].
    In such schemes, WSN divided into various regions and each region has one cluster
    head, which aims to gather and forward the sensory information towards BS. Furthermore,
    most of the sensor nodes moved to sleep mode for prolonging network lifetime.
    Low energy adaptive cluster hierarchy (LEACH) was proposed by [36], aiming to
    introduce the concept of a cluster-based approach and improve energy efficiency
    as compared to traditional approaches. The role of the cluster head is randomly
    rotated and, accordingly, the LEACH protocol balances the energy consumption among
    the sensor nodes. In [37], the authors proposed the analytic hierarchy process
    (AHP), which aims to centralize the process of cluster head selection mechanism.
    Residual energy, mobility, and distance towards cluster centroid are considered
    to be the main factors for the selection process of cluster heads. The proposed
    solution significantly improved network lifetime in the comparison of other solutions.
    The authors in [38] proposed an energy-efficient k-means technique (EKMT) and
    determine the optimal cluster heads. The selected cluster heads are closer to
    the cluster’s member as well as the BS. The proposed solution offers to decrease
    the communication distance among nodes and improve the network lifetime. However,
    the proposed solution is not efficient in an insecure and unrestricted space environment,
    as it is open to malicious extortions and might be harmful to sensors data. Authors
    [39] proposed cluster head selection in wireless sensor networks while using a
    fuzzy environment. The proposed solution based on the fuzzy multiple attribute
    decision making (MADM) approach and uses residual energy, distance to BS, and
    the number of neighbor’s factors for selecting the cluster heads. A simulated
    network lifetime is prolonged than hierarchical agglomerative clustering (DHAC)
    [40] protocol under a homogeneous background. An improved chain-based clustering
    hierarchical routing (ICCHR) algorithm that is based on LEACH [41] consists of
    cluster formation, cluster head selection, chain formation, and data transmission
    phases. The selection and distribution of cluster heads in the proposed protocol
    are non-optimal and they cause extra energy consumption. Based on simulation results,
    the proposed ICCHR algorithm decreases the ratio of energy consumption, evenly
    distributing the load among sensor nodes. The authors in [42] proposed an optimized
    zone-based energy-efficient routing protocol for mobile sensor networks (OZEEP).
    The main aim of the proposed solution is to improve the network performance in
    terms of cluster formation and cluster head selection based on distance, density,
    mobility, and energy factors. The proposed solution achieves balanced energy consumption
    and improved network lifetime; however, the evaluation of wireless links is missing
    in the proposed solution. Moreover, security measurements are also not taken into
    consideration, which results in frequent links and routing failures. The authors
    [43] proposed the particle swarm optimization-energy efficient-based cluster head
    selection (PSO-ECHS) protocol, which prolongs network lifetime and network stability.
    In the proposed PSO-ECHS protocol, the cluster heads are selected using fitness
    function, which comprises residual energy, distance from sensor nodes to neighbors,
    and distance from sensor nodes to BS. The cluster heads are selected based on
    minimum fitness value and, afterward, the cluster formation phase is initiated.
    All of the selected cluster heads announced their advertisement message and normal
    nodes joined them to formulate the clusters. In [44], the authors proposed an
    energy-efficient centroid based routing protocol (EECRP) to achieve data transmission
    while using wireless sensor networks. In the proposed protocol, BS initiates the
    process to compute the centroid position and split the network field into various
    clusters. In the beginning, the node that is closer to the centroid position is
    selected as the initial cluster head and the role of the cluster head is shifted
    by determining the new centroid position. Besides, the proposed protocol also
    decreases the energy consumption for long-distance data communication. In [45],
    the authors proposed a secure user authentication and key agreement scheme while
    using WSN, which aims to securely monitor the agriculture domain. The proposed
    protocol is validated using Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic and the simulation
    results demonstrate better improvement in terms of security against malicious
    attacks. However, in most of the other existing works, the proposed solution also
    does not consider the performance of links in data transmission and leads to packets
    drop and latency ratio. It is seen from the discussed studies that sensor nodes
    are very limited in terms of battery power, transmission, storage, and processing
    resources. Additionally, it is not possible to replace the components of the sensor
    nodes in dense and large regions. These low powered sensor nodes have significant
    impact on the performance of the network in terms of delivery ratio and energy
    consumption. Furthermore, most of the WSN based smart agriculture applications
    need the required information in an efficient and timely manner. Therefore, optimizing
    network lifetime with stable routing and data delivery performance are most of
    the important research challenges in WSN based applications. Additionally, the
    selection of cluster heads performs a very important role to balance the load
    distribution and energy consumption in the WSN based agricultural land. The cluster
    heads that are one hop away from BS exhaust their energy resource much quickly
    and lead to the energy hole issue, which degrades network throughput and increases
    the latency ratio. Moreover, it is observed from the existing work that most of
    the solution does not consider the strength of the signal in data routing, which
    significantly increases the packet drop ratio and instability in the network region.
    Accordingly, most of the energy power of sensor nodes is dissipated due to the
    selection of poor wireless carrier channels and it leads to frequent retransmissions
    of agricultural sensors’ data. Furthermore, end users obtained the information
    from the IoT based WSN while using the Internet, which is full of malicious actions
    and network information can be disclosure to anonymous nodes. Therefore, data
    security is another important research aim for a WSN based smart agriculture to
    achieve network reliability and trustworthiness. Consequently, an energy-efficient
    and secure IoT based WSN framework must be layout and developed for smart agriculture
    to optimize network lifetime with reliable delivery performance to end-users.
    Besides, a trustworthy mechanism can increase the security of individual sensors
    and formulate realistic end-to-end routing paths. Therefore, the combined concept
    of energy efficiency with lightweight data security among the low power sensor
    nodes can improve the efficacy of the IoT-based WSN framework for smart agriculture.
    3. Proposed Energy Efficient and Secure IoT-based WSN Framework for Smart Agriculture
    Several researchers have used the technology of WSN in various domains to sense
    the environmental data. WSN has also played a vital role in the observation and
    management of agricultural land in terms of crops, climate, water usage, etc.
    However, the agricultural land still has some challenges, such as energy efficiency,
    data routing, and security, due to the limited battery power of sensors and open
    transmission medium. The basic aim of the proposed solution to develop an energy-efficient
    and secure IoT based WSN framework for the monitoring and production of agricultural
    land. In the proposed framework, an appropriate clusters heads are selected based
    on the optimal decision function. Furthermore, the SNR factor also incorporated
    in the decision to compute the strength of wireless signals and increase the successful
    ratio of sensors packets. Our proposed framework offers reliable and energy-efficient
    methods for the improvement of large-sized agricultural land. Moreover, the proposed
    framework also accumulated the data security among agricultural sensors to cluster
    heads and from cluster heads to BS based on secret keys while using the linear
    congruential generator [46,47], which requires minimal memory and processing time.
    Accordingly, our proposed framework ensures the trade-off among energy consumption,
    reliable and secure routing for the agricultural filed. The research design of
    the proposed framework is explained in this section. The proposed framework comprises
    of two main components. In the first component, the agricultural sensors are dispersed
    to gather information. The sensor nodes are heterogeneous in terms of residual
    energy, such that the energy level of the heterogeneous nodes is higher than normal
    sensor nodes. The agricultural sensors are dispersed into various distant areas
    and each area consists of one cluster head. The role of the cluster head is to
    receive the information from agriculture land and forward towards BS in a fault-tolerant
    and energy-efficient manner. The proposed framework balances the load among agricultural
    sensors and it selects suitable cluster heads based on multi-criteria decision
    function. Moreover, our proposed framework makes use of a single-hop transmission
    instead of a multi-hop paradigm to reduce the network bottlenecks and network
    latency. In the second component, the proposed security mechanism exploits symmetric
    data encryption between agricultural sensors and presents a robust transmission
    in the field using pseudorandom number generation. Figure 2 demonstrates the research
    design of the proposed framework for smart agriculture. Figure 2. The research
    design of proposed energy-efficient and secure IoT-based WSN framework for smart
    agriculture. 3.1. Network Assumptions Before discussing the proposed Energy Efficient
    and Secure IoT Based WSN Framework for Smart Agriculture, some network assumptions
    are highlighted, as follows: 𝑁 number of agriculture sensors are dispersed in
    the observing squared sized area. All the agriculture sensors and BS remain fixed
    after the nodes deployment. Transmission links are symmetric. Agriculture sensors
    are heterogeneous in terms of energy resources. BS has the most powerful node
    with unlimited resources. The location of agriculture sensors is determined using
    Global Positioning System (GPS). 3.2. Energy and Link Efficient Routing This section
    presents discussion on the design of the proposed energy and link efficient routing,
    which includes two main levels. The first level is based on a multi-criteria decision
    function for the selection of optimal cluster heads. Afterwards, the least energy
    consumption nodes are formulated into different clusters. The second level of
    the proposed energy and link efficient routing is to make the routing channel
    more stable for a longer time, which prevents the wireless link from misbehaving
    activities from cluster heads to the BS. Our proposed framework uses the node
    energy  𝑒 𝑖 , Signal to Noise Ratio 𝑆𝑁 𝑅 𝑖,𝐵𝑆 , and distance to BS 𝑑 𝑖,𝐵𝑆 as a
    multi-criteria decision-making function 𝑓(𝑛) for the selection of cluster heads,
    as given in equation 1. The aim of using SNR [48,49] is the proposed framework
    is to determine the strength of the signal and efficiently increase the delivery
    performance. SNR is defined as the ratio of the Received Signal Strength Indicator
    (RSSI) to background noise. Let us consider that 𝑅𝑆𝑆 𝐼 𝑖 is the received signal
    strength indicator and 𝐵 𝑛 𝑖 denotes the background noise for link 𝑖 accordingly,
    the value of 𝑆𝑁 𝑅 𝑖 can be computed by 𝑅𝑆𝑆 𝐼 𝑖 /𝐵 𝑛 𝑖 . The link with the least
    value of 𝑆𝑁 𝑅 𝑖 is chosen as being more appropriate for data transmission. 𝑓(𝑛)=
    𝑒 𝑖 +(1/ 𝑑 𝑖,𝐵𝑆 )+(1/𝑆𝑁 𝑅 𝑖 ) (1) The value of 𝑓(𝑛) is normalized in the range
    of [0…1] using 1− 𝑓(𝑛) . In the proposed framework, BS maintains a global table
    that comprises information regarding agricultural sensors. The store information
    consists of node position, distance from BS, residual energy and SNR factors.
    Based on the stored information, BS evaluates 𝑓(𝑛) and generates a normalized
    score. Afterward, BS chooses the highest scored sensor node in agriculture land
    as an initial cluster head. Accordingly, BS maps the entries against the nodes
    as selected cluster heads based on 𝑓(𝑛) . The rest of the nodes that are not marked
    as cluster heads are considered to be normal nodes. Subsequently, BS formulate
    the one-hop nodes from each cluster head as its member and accordingly updates
    the global table. In the proposed framework, all the agriculture sensors gathered
    the required data and forwarded it to their cluster heads. Afterward, cluster
    heads exploit a single-hop mechanism to transmit the data towards BS, which further
    interconnects to the Internet and the end-users can obtain the data regarding
    agricultural land for further analysis. 3.3. Secure Data Transmission from Agriculture
    Sensors towards BS In the proposed framework, data from the agriculture sensors
    are routed while using a secure and trusted network towards the cluster heads
    and further towards the BS. In this framework, the BS generates secret keys using
    the recurrence of the linear congruential equation that is given by Equation (2).
    𝑌 𝑛+1 =(𝛼 𝑌 𝑛 +𝛽) 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑚 (2) where 𝑌 𝑖 are the generated secret random values for
    sensor node 𝑛 𝑖 , 𝑚 is the modulus parameter which must be greater than 0, 𝛼 is
    the multiplier parameter and it must be greater than zero and less than the modulus  𝑚
    , 𝛽 is the increment parameter and it must be greater or equal to zero and less
    than the modulus 𝑚 , and 𝑌 0 is the seed value and it must also be greater or
    equal to zero and less than the modulus 𝑚 . Accordingly, all of the sensor nodes
    are provided secret keys using equation 2. Afterward, when the sensor node 𝑛 𝑖
    send data 𝑚 𝑖 to the cluster head CHj, it is encrypted while using Equation (3).
    𝐸 𝑗 ( 𝑚 𝑖 )= 𝑚 𝑖 ⊕ 𝑌 𝑖 (3) where ⊕ is the XOR operation between the data 𝑚 𝑖 from
    the agriculture sensor node 𝑛 𝑖 towards CHj. The encrypted data 𝐸 𝑗 ( 𝑚 𝑖 ) is
    further transmitted towards the BS, which can decrypt it by taking the XOR with
    the key 𝑌 𝑖 as given in equation 4. 𝐷 𝑗 ( 𝑚 𝑖 )= 𝐸 𝑗 ( 𝑚 𝑖 )⊕ 𝑌 𝑖 (4) 4. Simulation
    Setup with Experimental Results This section presents the default simulation parameters
    [50,51,52] that are used in the experimental analysis of the proposed framework
    against relevant solutions i.e., PSO-ECHS [43] and EECRP [44]. The simulation
    experiments are executed using Network Simulator2 (NS2) [53,54], which is a well-known
    open-source and best simulation tool to analyze network routing and communication.
    Table 1 illustrates the simulation parameters along with their default values.
    The simulation results are evaluated based on a varying number of rounds. The
    period of a single simulation round is set to 20 s. Additionally, the number of
    agriculture sensors and anonymous nodes is set to 100 and 15, respectively. All
    of the agricultural sensors, i.e., temperature sensors, light sensors, soil moisture
    sensors, location sensors, airflow sensors, etc., and anonymous nodes are scattered
    randomly. The number of agricultural sensors is set to 100. The number of malicious
    nodes is fixed to 15. Packet size (k) and payload size are set to 64 bits and
    256 bytes. The residual energy of agriculture sensors is non-uniform, i.e., 2j
    to 4j. The data traffic between the sensor nodes is a type of Constant Bit Rate
    (CBR) and a transmission range of agriculture sensors is fixed to 20 m. Table
    1. Simulation parameters. 5. Experimental Results and Discussion The section explains
    the experimental results between the proposed framework and the existing solution.
    The performance of the proposed framework with other solutions is measured based
    on network throughput, packets drop ratio, network latency, energy consumption,
    and routing overheads. 5.1. Analysis of Network Throughput with Discussion In
    Figure 3, the proposed framework is compared with an existing solution in terms
    of the network throughput under varying simulation rounds. It is seen from the
    simulation experiments that the proposed framework improved the performance of
    network throughput in comparison with the existing solutions by 10% and 17%, respectively.
    The improved performance of network throughput is due to the robust and link-aware
    cluster heads. Unlike other solutions that do not consider the measurement of
    signals strength between sensor nodes, the proposed framework incorporates SRN
    factor in an intelligent selection decision for choosing cluster heads, which
    increases the ratio of packet delivery in agricultural land due to their robust
    behavior. Moreover, the increase in network throughput for the proposed framework
    against existing solutions is due to the sharing of data encryption secret keys
    that are based on the linear congruential generator, such that proposed solution
    leads to efficient network throughput with consistent network connectivity. Additionally,
    the proposed framework measures the SNR ratio among nodes for a particular data
    transmission link, which considerably affects the transmission of agricultural
    data towards BS. Figure 3. The impact of the simulation rounds on network throughput.
    5.2. Analysis of Packets Drop Ratio with Discussion Figure 4 demonstrates the
    simulation results of the proposed framework with other solutions in terms of
    the packet drop ratio. It is observed from the results that the proposed framework
    improved the packet drop ratio by 29% and 48% when compared to the existing solutions.
    The existing solution overlooked the importance of transmission link factor thereby
    results in increasing drop rates. Our proposed framework makes use of the measurement
    of signal strength along with the residual energy of sensor nodes during data
    forwarding, which results in offering efficient routing performance. Furthermore,
    the proposed framework improves the ratio of packets delivery by evaluating the
    multi-criteria decision function and eliminating the congested nodes for data
    routing. Additionally, the proposed framework incorporates the distance to the
    BS factor and reduces the length of routing paths and achieves a better packet
    reception ratio. Besides, the proposed framework makes the data transmission more
    secure with limited computational overheads on the part of sensor nodes, which
    decreases the chances of anonymous nodes to drop the data packets and increases
    the performance of data privacy. Figure 4. The impact of simulation rounds on
    the packets drop ratio. 5.3. Analysis of Network Latency with Discussion Figure
    5 illustrates the performance between the proposed framework and existing work
    concerning network latency. It increases the chances of network dis-connectivity
    and gives rise to a network latency ratio due to the presence of malicious nodes.
    However, it is observed from the experimental results that the network latency
    ratio of the proposed framework is improved by 11% and 17%, respectively, as compared
    to the existing solutions. The proposed framework chooses the most link and energy-efficient
    cluster heads for data routing towards BS. Moreover, the proposed framework exploits
    the SNR factor to identify the ratio of the congested link and reduces the chances
    of selecting the weak node as a data forwarder. Unlike a multi-hop paradigm that
    has the chances of a lot of obstacles on each hop, our proposed framework uses
    single-hop data transmission mode. Such an obstacle not only increases the network
    latency from cluster heads to BS, but on the other hand, it also reduces the energy
    consumption, when the transmission power of sensor nodes is considered in the
    measurement of network performance. Such a dynamic decision offers a longer lifetime
    routing path and agricultural data arrives at BS in a timely and efficient manner.
    Additionally, the proposed framework exploits the direct transmission path and
    decreases the ratio of network delay instead of using the multi-hop path, which
    significantly increases the ratio of network latency due to store and forward
    mechanism. Moreover, unlike most of the existing solutions that do not consider
    data security and lead to drop the data packet by the malicious node. Our proposed
    framework presents a secure algorithm for data encryption, which helps to avoid
    the data re-transmission and explicitly reduce the ratio of network delay between
    agricultural sensors and BS. Figure 5. The impact of the simulation rounds on
    network latency. 5.4. Analysis of Energy Consumption with Discussion In Figure
    6, the performance analysis of the proposed framework in comparison of other solutions
    under varying simulation rounds is illustrated. It is seen from the simulation
    results that the proposed framework improves the ratio of energy consumption with
    other solutions by 11% and 21%. This is due to the proposed framework evenly distributing
    the load of energy consumption between sensor nodes. In the proposed framework,
    based on multi-criteria decision function an optimal nodes are selected for the
    position of clusters in agriculture land. Furthermore, the process of cluster
    heads selection and cluster formations are controlled by BS instead of in a distributed
    manner, which pointedly decreases the ratio of energy depletion in the observing
    field. Moreover, the process of recurrent re-clustering and re-routing are avoided
    by the proposed framework due to the multi-criteria decision function. The proposed
    framework significantly reduces the energy consumption in the agriculture domain,
    because the more appropriate cluster heads are selected in terms of energy efficiency,
    distance to BS, and signal strength factors. Figure 6. The impact of the simulation
    rounds on energy consumption. 5.5. Analysis of Routing Overheads with Discussion
    In Figure 7, the routing overheads between the proposed framework and other solution
    is illustrated under varying simulation rounds. The experimental results demonstrate
    that the proposed framework improves the routing overheads in comparison with
    the existing solutions by 19% and 33%, respectively. The proposed framework offers
    an intelligent decision that is based on multiple criteria for the selection of
    cluster heads with minimum processing overheads on sensor nodes. Besides, instead
    of using a multi-hop paradigm, the proposed framework exploits a single-hop pattern
    for data routing and makes use of distance to BS factor along with other performance
    parameters in routing decision. Such an approach decreases the probabilities of
    unnecessary energy consumption and overheads in data transmission. Additionally,
    unlike other solutions that maintain a local routing table on each node level
    and all the nodes update it frequently. The proposed framework maintains a global
    information table on BS and the table is updated in a controlled manner when needed.
    This mechanism expressively decreases the ratio of routing overheads and improves
    the performance of data transmission in the agriculture field. Moreover, the proposed
    framework drops the routing overheads under anonymous nodes by decreasing the
    possibility of data re-routing due to the integration of a data encryption algorithm
    based on the recurrence of the linear congruential generator. Figure 7. The impact
    of simulation rounds on routing overheads. 6. Conclusions The technology of wireless
    sensor networks performs a vital role in the development of the agriculture domain.
    This paper presents an energy-efficient and secure IoT based WSN framework for
    smart agriculture application. The main aim of the proposed framework is to appoint
    the more suitable cluster heads based on multi-criteria decision function. The
    decision is based on residual energy, distance to BS, and SNR factors. Additionally,
    the proposed framework is to adopt a single-hop paradigm for data transmission
    and decreases the chances of bottlenecks among agriculture sensors and BS. Our
    proposed framework presents an intelligent decision for data routing and decreases
    the ratio of energy consumption with improved data delivery performance in the
    agriculture field. Unlike most of the existing solutions, the proposed framework
    exploits a mechanism that is based on the SNR factor to determine the strength
    of signals and it achieves more stable network performance between agriculture
    sensors and BS. Moreover, the proposed framework offers secure data transmission
    from agriculture sensors towards BS based on secret keys while using the recurrence
    of the linear congruential generator. In future work, we aim to analyze the performance
    of the proposed framework in a mobile-based IoT network and Intelligent Transportation
    System (ITS). Author Contributions Conceptualization, K.H. and I.U.D.; Methodology,

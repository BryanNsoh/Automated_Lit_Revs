    1. Introduction\nCitizenship education traditionally aimed to prepare young people\
    \ to take their place\nin adult society [1]. The values intended to be promoted\
    \ are those of democracy, with\na focus on human rights, a creative spirit, and\
    \ an eager critical sense, creating effective\nopportunities that involve young\
    \ citizens in solving their own problems. “Government of\nthe people, by the people,\
    \ for the people” remains the sovereign deﬁnition of democracy,\nas stated by\
    \ Winston Churchill’s speech to the House of Commons in 1947.\nThe Portuguese\
    \ Ministry of Education (ME) has recently published several docu-\nments regarding\
    \ citizenship education, more speciﬁcally, Portuguese Citizenship Education\n\
    Guidelines (PCEG) [2], National Education Strategy for Citizenship (NESC) [3],\
    \ and Sustain-\nability for Environmental Education Referential (SEER) [4]. PCEG\
    \ states, “The practice of\ncitizenship is a participatory process, both individual\
    \ and collective, that calls for reﬂection\nand action on the problems experienced\
    \ by each person and by society” [4] (p. 1), thus,\ndeﬁned to contribute towards\
    \ the development of a just and equal society. The NESC aims\nto contribute to\
    \ developing autonomous, responsible, and solidary citizens with others\nthey\
    \ interact with. It also seeks to lead young citizens to know and exercise their\
    \ rights\nand social duties, always respecting others. SEER, on the other hand,\
    \ kept in line with\ninternational policies to seriously address climate change,\
    \ such as the 1972 Stockholm\nConference; the 1975 Belgrade Conference; the 2000\
    \ United Nations (UN) Millennium\nDeclaration; the 2016 UN 17 Sustainable Development\
    \ Goals; The Paris Climate Conference\nSensors 2023, 23, 3070. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23063070\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 3070\n2 of 36\n(COP-21)\
    \ of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; and recently, to reinforce\n\
    the 1972 principles, 2022 Stockholm +50 UN Conference. The SEER is a guiding document\n\
    for this theme implementation within the scope of Citizenship and Development\
    \ (CD)\nsubject that integrates the curriculum in the different cycles and levels\
    \ of education and\nteaching in Portugal. The main objective is to prepare young\
    \ students to exercise conscious\ncitizenship, be informed about current environmental\
    \ problems to effectively change atti-\ntudes and behaviors, and promote new environmental\
    \ values. This objective is aligned with\nStockholm + 50 Leadership Dialogue 1:\
    \ reﬂecting on the urgent need for actions to achieve a\nhealthy planet and prosperity\
    \ of all, which stresses the need for promoting environmentally\nconscious syllabi\
    \ and curricula [5]. Citizenship is the practice of someone playing an active\n\
    role in their own community. For example, volunteer work, garbage-cleaning campaigns,\n\
    local elderly care cooperatives, or involvement in decision-making about the municipal\n\
    budget. In the same line of thought, it is current practice for students to exercise\
    \ their right\nto choose where part of the school budget should be invested. Residents\
    \ should become\nmore involved in public life, so the role of government is to\
    \ consider community initiatives,\nso-called “government participation”. A new\
    \ way for citizens and government to work\ntogether is do-ocracy. Do-ocracy is\
    \ a kind of organizational structure where citizens choose\nwhich roles they will\
    \ play, as well as tasks, and carry them out; a do-it-yourself approach\nfosters\
    \ a sense of responsibility towards a common goal.\nCitizen Science (CS) is a\
    \ growing phenomenon that echoes citizens’ contribution to\ngenerating scientiﬁc\
    \ information, new knowledge, and understanding, a common name\nfor a wide range\
    \ of activities and practices that promote public awareness and involve-\nment\
    \ [6–8]. The design of CS activities in collaboration with citizens is a complimentary\n\
    science approach to traditional sensor-based collection. CS engages citizens in\
    \ data gather-\ning activities, community-based environmental monitoring, data\
    \ collection and interpre-\ntation, and providing answers to achieve full participation\
    \ in science and policymaking.\nCitizens work together in collective decision-making\
    \ to identify communal issues and ﬁnd\nparticipatory solutions, which enables\
    \ science to become more responsive to community\nneeds. Therefore, communities\
    \ can raise awareness and develop strategies and solutions to\nmitigate communal\
    \ issues based on the data gathered. Citizens assume different roles with\ndifferent\
    \ levels of engagement, from a simple contributory level, through collaborative,\n\
    or at a co-created level. In any of them, engagement can be top-down, led by the\
    \ project\nleaders, or bottom-up, guided by the participants themselves [9]. The\
    \ Internet of Things\nis a key enabler that provides a path to support data collection\
    \ activities in a real-world\nCS project in a Smart City approach, using low-cost\
    \ sensors for gathering and reporting\ndata and cloud storage for hosting and\
    \ storing data [10]. CS integration into school practice\ncan strengthen students’\
    \ science and environmental literacy and promote their citizenship\nidentity and\
    \ active participation competence. Overall, the study aims to explore the educa-\n\
    tional value of CS strategies developed within an educational scope and the potential\
    \ of\nthe Internet of Things to contribute towards participatory citizenship,\
    \ engaging citizens in\ncommunal issues, providing rich and detailed information,\
    \ and proposing and contributing\nto co-created solutions [11]. Retaining citizens\
    \ as volunteers is crucial to ensure their on-\ngoing long-term participation.\
    \ So, encouraging teachers to integrate CS into their teaching\npractice will\
    \ foster empirical evidence that citizen engagement can provide a local and\n\
    contextual dimension to communal issues, being able to educate and engage communities.\n\
    CS integration into school practice can strengthen students’ science and environmental\n\
    literacy and promote their citizenship identity and active participation competence.\n\
    While there is generally much to praise about the rise in acknowledging the need\n\
    for young citizens to exercise their rights and duties, the belief remains that\
    \ this is not\nyet entrenched in young citizens’ overall democratic involvement.\
    \ A lack of citizenship\nand engagement in community issues was revealed by a\
    \ recent study conducted by the\nauthors in a secondary school from the outskirts\
    \ of Aveiro, Portugal, during the 2019/2020\nschool year, regarding students’\
    \ participatory citizenship attitudes [12]. The exercise of\nSensors 2023, 23,\
    \ 3070\n3 of 36\nparticipatory citizenship should begin at an early age [13,14];\
    \ therefore, enhancing such an\nexercise in an educational context should be emphasized\
    \ and an object of study.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section\
    \ 2 presents an overview of\nthe related work. Section 3 describes the smart learning\
    \ environment and the technical\nset-ups of the proposed systems. Section 4 describes\
    \ the implementation of the designed\nsystems, data interpretation, and discussion\
    \ of evaluation results. Finally, Section 5 presents\nconclusions and future work\
    \ that needs to be addressed.\n2. Theoretical Framework\n2.1. Citizenship Education\n\
    Launched in September 2012, under the United Nations’ umbrella, the Global Educa-\n\
    tion First Initiative’s three main priorities are: (1) put every child in school;\
    \ (2) improve\nthe quality of learning; and (3) foster global citizenship. These\
    \ three pillars are the core\nof the 2015 United Nations advocated model, supported\
    \ by UNESCO, which are to be\nimplemented until the 2030–Education 2030 Agenda\
    \ and Framework [15]. The intercon-\nnected NESC and SEER are impacting the policy\
    \ visions and practices of ministries of\neducation around the world, which also\
    \ impacts how teachers work but requires measures\nto achieve a Global Citizenship\
    \ Education (GCE) [16]. According to UNESCO, GCE aims to\nenable students to assume\
    \ active roles, both in their local community and globally, which\nwill allow\
    \ the construction of more peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, and safe societies [17]\n\
    aligned with the objectives of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) and\
    \ the Sus-\ntainable Development Goals (SDG 4 on Education). UNESCO also points\
    \ to the sense\nof belonging to a larger community and common humanity as global\
    \ citizenship [18,19].\nThe World Conference on Education for All in Jomtien,\
    \ Thailand, on 5–9 March 1990, may\nbe considered the ﬁrst global education initiative\
    \ in the last decade of the 20th century.\nAbout 1500 delegates from 155 countries\
    \ and representatives of some 150 governmental,\nnon-governmental, and intergovernmental\
    \ organizations, including the United Nations\nEducational, Scientiﬁc and Cultural\
    \ Organization (UNESCO), United Nations Children’s\nFund (UNICEF), United Nations\
    \ Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP), and the\
    \ World Bank as key education stakeholders, attended the\nconference. Participants\
    \ in the conference adopted the World Declaration on Education for\nAll and a\
    \ Framework for Action to Meeting Basic Learning Needs, highlighting the need\
    \ to\ninvest in education aimed at universalizing primary education. This declaration\
    \ is in line\nwith Millennium Development Goals [20] (replaced by the SDGs in\
    \ 2015)—surely one of\nthe most important global development initiatives [21]—that\
    \ were to be achieved over the\nperiod 2000–2015.\nWestheimer and Kahne [22] call\
    \ attention to “participatory citizens” as those that\ntake in hand the concept\
    \ of the “good citizen”, and that can support democracy helpfully,\npinpointing\
    \ the need for educational programs to prepare students to engage in collective\n\
    efforts. Such a citizen “actively participates in the civic affairs and the social\
    \ life of the com-\nmunity at local, state and national level”, working together\
    \ for the common good, with a\nstrong collective faithfulness, to solve communal\
    \ issues [22] (p. 240). Amagir et al. provide\nevidence that “the development\
    \ of educational curricula that focus on the development\nof active citizenship”\
    \ [23] (p. 57) should be considered as early as possible. Citizenship\neducation\
    \ could be the right host as it seeks to engage students to be more active, informed,\n\
    and responsible [24]. Active citizen participation in a democratic society requires\
    \ informed\ndecision-making. Based on the effects of human activities on the environment,\
    \ the Por-\ntuguese ME [4] highlights the need to enhance students’ knowledge\
    \ that allows them to\ninterpret and assess the communal surrounding reality so\
    \ that they can formulate and\ndebate argumentation that permits the sustainability\
    \ of their positions and options.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3070\n4 of 36\n2.2. The Internet\
    \ of Things and Smart Cities\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a global network\
    \ of “things” that are connected to the\ninternet using several communication\
    \ technologies [25] and can “communicate” with each\nother, aiming to monitor\
    \ and control the physical world through collecting, processing,\nand analyzing\
    \ data gathered by IoT devices, without human intervention [26]. IoT devices\n\
    must be connected to the internet and use Transmission Control Protocol/Internet\
    \ Protocol\n(TCP/IP), the internet network protocol, to communicate among themselves.\
    \ Different com-\nmunication protocols for data transmission in IoT and M2M systems\
    \ can be used, such as\nIoT Data Communication Protocols; Message Queue Telemetry\
    \ Transport (MQTT); Hyper-\ntext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), among others [27].\
    \ Accurate consumer-data provided by IoT\nsensors can be communicated to a broker\
    \ by MQTT and be remotely accessed/controlled\nin real-time by IoT devices, computers,\
    \ smartphones, or tablets [27]. MQTT requires low\nbandwidth consumption with\
    \ efﬁcient distribution of information—one or many receivers\n(subscribers)—with\
    \ low power consumption; MQTT is ideal for M2M/IoT applications [28],\nwith a\
    \ tiny code footprint. There are several MQTT brokers and client libraries in\
    \ the indus-\ntry, such as Mosquitto, EMQ X, HiveMQ CE, HiveMQ, Thingstream, Adafruit\
    \ IO, Eclipse\nM2Mqtt, IBM Watson IoT Platform Message Gateway, and many more.\
    \ This article will\nnot discuss their advantages, disadvantages, or functional\
    \ differences. A more detailed\ncomparison of some currently available MQTT implementations\
    \ can be found in [27]. For\nthe research purpose authors used the HiveMQ MQTT\
    \ broker that provides a public MQTT\nbroker (www.broker.mqtt-dashboard.com) (accessed\
    \ on 2 January 2023).\nStill, there is no one-size-ﬁts-all solution regarding\
    \ communication technologies. One\nmust consider throughput, range, and power\
    \ consumption, etc. Several wireless communi-\ncation technologies exist, such\
    \ as short-range wireless, cellular, and low-power wide-area\nnetworks (LPWANs).\

    \ IoT communication protocols.\nData gathered by sensors are sent to other IoT\
    \ devices or a gateway and analyzed lo-\ncally or sent to a cloud provider to\
    \ be further analyzed. In the end, as Hosseinzadeh et al. [29]\nrefer to, the\
    \ main objective of IoT is to “connect anything to any object, at any time, and\n\
    over any network/service”. Statista [30] forecasts an increase of three times\
    \ the number\nof connected IoT devices from 9.7 billion in 2020 to more than 29\
    \ billion in 2030. IoT is\nassumed by Nižeti´c et al. as “one of the key pillars\
    \ of the fourth industrial revolution” [31].\nOver the last few years, the IoT\
    \ has entered various sectors, so this network of sensors, actu-\nators, and smart\
    \ objects, whose purpose is to interconnect all things, has huge potential and\n\
    usefulness beneﬁts for the population [31]. IoT is used in many ﬁelds, such as\
    \ agriculture,\nsmart cities—including smart homes, smart grids, smart agriculture,\
    \ smart lighting systems,\nsmart transportation, smart healthcare, and augmented\
    \ reality (AR) [32–34], alongside\ntrafﬁc, healthcare, security, and retail. Still,\
    \ there are other ﬁelds, like education, where it is\nrelatively scarce [31].\
    \ For instance, in the agriculture ﬁled, IoT is often used in the process\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 3070\n5 of 36\nof crop nutrition monitoring, light, ph, temperature,\
    \ and humidity, using sensors that send\ndata from node to node to be processed\
    \ and to make decisions or can change other devices\nautomatically regarding system\
    \ decisions [25,31,35–37].\nThe “employment of IoT in education is still considered\
    \ at its early stages but is highly\nencouraged” [38]. As [39] state, the coming\
    \ years will have a huge increase of connected\ndevices, so this should be seen\
    \ as an opportunity for educational institutions to incorporate\nIoT in the school\
    \ environment [39–41], prepare students for the upcoming years’ challenges,\n\
    making learning relevant to students. IoT in education provides learning concepts,\
    \ such\nas e-learning, including media that transforms virtual classrooms into\
    \ signiﬁcantly more\nefﬁcient places [42]. Based on the already overloaded school\
    \ curricula, attention must\nbe paid to incorporating IoT skills to bestow a plethora\
    \ of skills and abilities to students.\nThe ideal would be to have stand-alone\
    \ courses to ensure enough time can be devoted\nto cover the various topics but\
    \ could also be offered in line with CD subject context in\na transdisciplinary\
    \ effort with Information Communication Technology (ICT) or even at\nschool projects/clubs.\n\
    High urbanization of cities and communities, alongside huge population increase,\n\
    presents societal challenges such as climate change. Technology can be a “game\
    \ change\nfactor” in sustainable development, as well as a facilitator of citizens’\
    \ resilience [43], pro-\nviding citizens with a sense of ownership of their surroundings\
    \ [44]. There is a need to\nchange, and the power “needs to be challenged” to\
    \ an “inclusive city” that is “governed\nby powerful place-based democratic institutions”\
    \ and create an equal society, instead of\nwhat is happening in an era of strong\
    \ globalization where “place-less leaders” are gaining\nground [45]. The aim is\
    \ to advocate the need for a look at the collective power exercised\nby the citizen,\
    \ an escape from the marketing approach, which treats people as consumers,\ntowards\
    \ a more democratic approach, which treats people as free and responsible citizens,\n\
    with the right to be heard, a citizen-oriented approach, as stated by Hambleton\
    \ [45].\nAs cities take advantage of emerging technologies, such as IoT, several\
    \ facets of day-\nto-day urban life are undergoing enormous transformations [46].\
    \ The capitalization of\ntechnologies by smart cities paves the way for citizens\
    \ to interact with cities’ physical infras-\ntructure, services, and many more\
    \ [40], transforming/fostering citizenship and enabling\ncitizens’ right to the\
    \ smart city. De Wall, Lange, and Bouw proposed The Hackable City re-\nsearch\
    \ project as innovators regarding the “hackable city”, which put forward collaborative\n\
    city-making approaches that empower stakeholders in an open and democratic community\n\
    and can be “hacked” or appropriated by their citizens towards a common public\
    \ good [44].\nHowever, who has the power and the means to name an issue and put\
    \ it on the\nagenda? Citizens may organize themselves in informal groups of neighborhood\
    \ residents\nrather than waiting for new solutions to come into view or with local\
    \ stakeholders around\nthe issues they deem urgent. Three distinct sets of smart\
    \ city visions were introduced by de\nWall and Dignum: the control room; the creative\
    \ city; and smart citizens—assuming that\ncitizens should be linked with new roles\
    \ and responsibilities, integrated into an ideological\nperspective that underlies\
    \ the notion of citizen-centered smart cities [43,47,48]. The notion\nof “smart\
    \ citizens” is opposed to the notion of the “control room” since it is not just\
    \ the\nperspective of a collection of infrastructures and services in a top-down\
    \ approach but\nrather a perspective of the community city, relying on citizens’\
    \ aspirations, problems, and\nskills, mobilizing themselves around common issues.\
    \ Arnstein [49] deﬁnes three levels\nof typology of participatory citizenship:\
    \ (1) citizen power; (2) tokenism; and (3) non-\nparticipation. Based on Arnstein’s\
    \ work, Cardullo and Kitchin [50] and Cowley et al. [51]\nhave explored different\
    \ roles of involvement of citizens in smart cities, but both indicate that\nmore\
    \ active roles for citizens are not necessarily a desired goal. Indeed, what roles\
    \ should\nbe assigned to citizens—students are the focus of this paper—based on\
    \ their individual\nchoices and meeting the common good? In this paper, collaboration\
    \ and co-creation in an\nopen and sharing process (bottom-up approach) are assumed\
    \ as the main role for students\nto assume, a citizen power form of participation\
    \ in partnership with teachers, parents, local\npower, and local stakeholders.\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 3070\n6 of 36\nAlmost all smart city infrastructures have sensors\
    \ built into their core. Being easy\nto handle, this wireless network of low-cost\
    \ and low power-consumption easy-to-use\nsensors covers a large area without any\
    \ large space requirements, based on its wireless\ncommunication capability. Low-cost\
    \ devices combined with advanced information systems\ncan reduce the cost of daily\
    \ life monitoring [52]. The enormous amount of data generated by\nthe countless\
    \ interconnected devices offer unique opportunities to solve urban challenges.\n\
    The use of these sensors, combined with applications for smartphones, is making\
    \ its path\nacross domains such as noise, air quality, or radiation monitoring\
    \ [53–55]. Air quality is a\nmajor concern in urbanized areas, so research on\
    \ air quality is huge [56–69]. The European\nUnion’s (EU) clean air policy is\
    \ based on three pillars: ambient air quality standards,\nreducing air pollution\
    \ emissions, and emissions standards for key sources of pollution.\nAccording\
    \ to the European Environment Agency (EEA), air pollution is Europe’s biggest\n\
    environmental health risk [70]. World Health Organization (WHO) [71] global air\
    \ quality\nguidelines regarding particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone, nitrogen\
    \ dioxide, sulfur\ndioxide, and carbon monoxide states that millions of deaths\
    \ and the loss of healthy years\nof life reﬂect exposure to air pollution. The\
    \ report highlights that in 2020 in the EU, “96%\nof the urban population was\
    \ exposed to levels of ﬁne particulate matter above the health-\nbased guideline\
    \ level set by the WHO”. Setting pathways to cleaner air, water, and soil,\nthe\
    \ European Commission (EC) has placed air quality at the top of its priorities,\
    \ which is\nwhy it is committed to continuing to improve air quality in strict\
    \ alignment with EU air\nquality standards and WHO recommendations. Due to human\
    \ activities causing polluting\nemissions, Europe’s air quality has deteriorated\
    \ considerably. To ﬁght climate change,\nenvironmental pollution, biodiversity\
    \ loss, and unsustainable use of natural resources, the\nEC stated in 2021 the\
    \ zero-pollution vision for 2050 under the European Green Deal’s Zero\nPollution\
    \ Action Plan [72].\nThe second most damaging environmental threat to human health\
    \ in the modern\nday is noise pollution. WHO published noise guidelines to provide\
    \ recommendations\nfor protecting human health from exposure to environmental\
    \ noise [73]. According to\nthe report, in the EU, “at least 100 million people\
    \ are affected by road trafﬁc noise and in\nwestern Europe alone at least 1.6\
    \ million healthy years of life are lost as a result of road\ntrafﬁc noise”. Regarding\
    \ road trafﬁc noise, the WHO recommended reducing noise levels\nproduced by road\
    \ trafﬁc below 53 decibels (dB) and below 45 dB for night noise exposure.\nRecommendations\
    \ regarding railway, aircraft, wind turbine, and leisure noise are also\naddressed.\
    \ In a recent survey carried out by Ka´zmierczak et al. [74] in 2021 in Polish\
    \ cities\non 770 residents’ opinions on their perception of the city’s acoustic\
    \ environment, about\n85% of respondents stated that city sounds matter to them.\
    \ A Google form was sent out\nto a non-probability sample city resident via the\
    \ internet. The authors used an extensive\nsnowball sampling method to reach city\
    \ residents. Other studies have been conducted\naiming at smart cities’ noise-related\
    \ issues [75–81].\nThe increase in population in urban centers entails a huge\
    \ increase in waste production,\nwhich has certainly become a signiﬁcant challenge.\
    \ Urban waste and recycling management\ninclude, among other actions, maintaining\
    \ a healthy and clean city, production, transport,\ncollection, storage, sorting,\
    \ treatment, recovery, and disposal, so the collaboration of citizens\nis fundamental\
    \ [82–94]. The World Bank [82] predicted that by 2050 the annual solid waste\n\
    generation would reach around 3.40 billion tones. The report refers to the need\
    \ to make\ncitizens environmentally aware of reducing the amount of waste produced,\
    \ separating\nit, and placing it in appropriate containers. There is a close link\
    \ between the success of\nsustained solid waste management and public engagement.\
    \ Of the countries and cities\nstudied in Kaza et al. [82], several make waste\
    \ management information available to the\npublic. The most common types of available\
    \ information include collection schedules\nand waste drop-off locations, budgets\
    \ and fees, local statistics on waste generation and\ncomposition, and community\
    \ programs and recycling campaigns. Between Christmas and\nthe end of 2022, waste\
    \ collection in Portugal recorded high values, with residents of the\nLisbon Metropolitan\
    \ Area producing more than 21,000 tons and those in Porto exceeding\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 3070\n7 of 36\n10,000 tons [95]. City councils deﬁne sweeping plans for\
    \ the city, with frequencies that vary\nin garbage collection and recycling according\
    \ to the characteristics of each zone and the\ntime of year. City councils are\
    \ often faced with unnecessary trips as some of the containers\nare empty or with\
    \ a load of less than 50%, thus being faced with an inefﬁcient process,\na great\
    \ environmental impact, and high costs for cities. There is a need for intelligent\n\
    technology to support the municipal solid waste management system.\nAli et al.\
    \ [85] identiﬁed solid waste management as critical in their study regarding\n\
    IoT systems smart waste bin monitoring for smart cities. Several comparison tables\
    \ are\nprovided regarding existing proposed systems in the market. From the analyzed\
    \ systems,\nfeatures such as cloud storage, real-time data, waste prediction,\
    \ GIS, and bin locations are\nprovided. Most systems are grounded at LoRa and\
    \ GPS/GSM communication, providing\nbin locations and allowing cloud storage.\
    \ All systems are Arduino-based microcontrollers\nand rely mostly on Java and\
    \ C++ software. Only one used the ThingSpeak platform and\nGoogle Map API. In\
    \ Mozambique, the MOPA (https://www.mopa.co.mz) (accessed on\n4 January 2023)\
    \ project engages citizens in waste management problems to report through\na digital\
    \ platform. Relaying these problems through an open-source map, the city council\n\
    will recruit micro-enterprises for waste collection. There are already alternatives\
    \ in the\nPortuguese market that make it possible to take advantage of the Internet\
    \ of Things and\nsensors to carry out integrated waste management (http://www.360waste.pt/indexpt)\n\
    (accessed on 4 January 2023). Garbage container real-time data is certainly an\
    \ added value\nfor the city and citizens, as one can take advantage of the information\
    \ gathered by sensors\nto determine which garbage container is full and cannot\
    \ be avoided.\nEven though some proposed system enables citizens to report collected\
    \ waste, there\nis a need to engage citizens from the early stage of the deﬁnition\
    \ of the system, i.e., in\na bottom-up approach [96]. Citizens are merely collecting\
    \ data (citizen-sense approach)\nbut not engaging from the early beginning regarding\
    \ issue deﬁnition, and in the last\nphase regarding analysis and strategies deﬁnition\
    \ to mitigate the issues, a citizen-science\napproach. Through citizens’ participatory\
    \ endeavors regarding waste and recycling, mu-\nnicipal management strategies\
    \ can be designed more effectively, so long-term outcomes of\nsuch strategies\
    \ would be achieved.\n2.3. Educational Project of the Target School\nAiming for\
    \ educational success and the formation of upstanding citizens with full\nrights\
    \ and duties, four major Areas of Intervention in the target school’s 2022–2025\
    \ Educa-\ntional Project (EP) [97] are selected. The EP is an instrument that\
    \ aims to bring together the\neducational community, focusing on improving students’\
    \ results, training for citizenship,\nand, lastly, the school’s self-evaluation\
    \ process. With a vision focused on the education\nof citizens of a world in fast\
    \ transformation, the EP aims to emphasize the work that\nhas been carried out\
    \ in the pursuit of equal opportunities, opening the doors to the local\ncommunity,\
    \ which allows the educational community to be involved in active participa-\n\
    tion, thus fostering a sense of belonging. In line with the NESC, the school highlights\
    \ the\nimportance of reinforcing the paradigm of partnerships with entities outside\
    \ the school, as\nwell as the articulation with local authorities and municipalities,\
    \ fostering the creation of\n(1) collaborative and networked practices and work\
    \ with an emphasis on sharing reference\npractices in Education for Citizenship;\
    \ (2) networking between schools; and (3) networking\nbetween schools and stakeholders.\
    \ To achieve such objectives, and for each main area,\ngeneral objectives and\
    \ the respective action strategies and measurement indicators were\ndeﬁned to\
    \ monitor and evaluate the results. Goal 2 of the “Assessment, Teaching and\n\
    Learning” intervention focuses on “Enhancing citizenship practices”. To achieve\
    \ this, seven\naction strategies and respective measurement indicators were deﬁned\
    \ (see Table 1).\nSensors 2023, 23, 3070\n8 of 36\nTable 1. Assessment, teaching,\

    This section presents the research milestones and the description of the smart\
    \ learning\nenvironment as well as the design and implementation of CS strategies\
    \ at Smart School Lab.\n3.1. Research Milestones\nThe investigation began in the\
    \ 2018/2019 school year with the creation of the smart\neducational community.\
    \ The necessary steps for its creation were the following: (1) state-of-\nthe-art\
    \ literature review; (2) document analysis; (3) geomentors mobilization; (4) local\
    \ needs\nand contextual purposes regarding School and Municipality; (5) roles\
    \ and commitments.\nThe creation of the community started with the ﬁrst civic\
    \ co-creation workshop—“Smart\nSchools: civic co-creation of smart educational\
    \ communities”, where the project’s objectives\nwere discussed, and local issues\
    \ were raised. These questions formed the basis for the next\nphase of the project.\
    \ To participate in this workshop, 16 teachers from the target school of\nthe\
    \ study from different disciplinary areas signed up (see Figure 2).\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 3070\n10 of 36\n x FOR PEER REVIEW \n5 of 39 \n \nFigure 2. Smart School\
    \ Workshops. \nA 50-h teacher training course was also conducted in a co-creation\
    \ process with a \nsmart educational community and stakeholders. A group of 18\
    \ teachers that taught grades \n7–12 and encompassed several disciplinary areas\
    \ attended the teachers’ training course. \nResearch has occurred in six face-to-face\
    \ sessions and six online sessions. More infor-\nmation regarding phase 1, conducted\
    \ in 2019, is available in Santos et al. [98]. \nA second DBR cycle was implemented\
    \ in the 2021/2022 school year, with a refinement \nof prior CS strategies designed,\
    \ implemented, and analyzed in a co-creation process in the \nfirst cycle. An\
    \ initial three-hour workshop was carried out with four teacher participants \n\
    of the study in the early school year, aiming for the representation of expertise\
    \ within the \nSTEAM field was considered. Each teacher majored in one of the\
    \ following: Physics and \nChemistry, Mathematics, Arts, and Technology and Engineering.\
    \ Researchers presented \nseven didactic kits co-developed in a teacher training\
    \ course in 2020, and their function-\nalities were discussed, as well as their\
    \ pros and cons regarding the implementation or \nadaptation by the teachers.\

    \ training and learning space where schools and mu-\nnicipalities learn collaboratively\
    \ through citizenship strategies. Implemented in 2018 in \nthe target school of\
    \ the study, several workshops and training sessions have been pro-\nmoted, aiming\
    \ to create an intelligent educational community. In a smart city topology, \n\
    all educational system’s local actors work together to co-create CS strategies\
    \ with partici-\npatory data collection gathered by sensors—real-world data collection—microcontrollers\
    \ \nand IoT, discovering and building apps, and engaging in solving important\
    \ local issues. \nSmart environments automate field data collection in the natural\
    \ environment, like air \nquality, noise, and waste management. The Smart School\

    \ skills [100]. Recently the European Commission\nhas introduced a new Digital\
    \ Education Action Plan (DEAP) 2021–2027 [101] designed\nto tackle emerging challenges\
    \ to delivering education. The two DEAP priority areas and\nactions are: (1) fostering\
    \ the development of a high-performing digital education ecosystem\nand (2) enhancing\
    \ digital skills and competencies for digital transformation. Each priority\n\
    area has developed a series of actions to achieve each goal. DEAP priority area\
    \ number\n1 has six series of actions, number 6 being “Implement Artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ and data usage\nin education and training”. Related to the use of extended reality\
    \ (XR) in education and\ntraining, this action focusses on developing a basic\
    \ knowledge of Artiﬁcial Intelligence to\nexploit its potential by citizens. Action\
    \ 10, on the DEAP priority area number 2, proposes a\n“Council recommendation\
    \ on improving the provision of digital skills in education and\ntraining”. The\
    \ major outputs will be: (1) improve the provision of digital skills in education\n\
    and training; (2) ensure that 65% of Europeans have at least basic digital skills\
    \ by 2025. To\nachieve “Digital Opportunity Traineeships”, action 12 ensures that\
    \ vocational education\nand training (VET) has “the opportunity to gain hands-on\
    \ professional experience in digital\nﬁelds demanded by the labour market”. In\
    \ Portugal, about 40% of learners in secondary\nSensors 2023, 23, 3070\n12 of\
    \ 36\neducation undertake a VET program, which leads to a double certiﬁcation\
    \ [102]. A great\nmajority of students who attended the SSL club come from VET.\
    \ These students are very\nreceptive to project-based learning. In 2012 the European\
    \ Schoolnet (http://www.eun.org/)\n(accessed on 3 January 2023) created the Future\
    \ Classroom Lab (FCL) (https://fcl.eun.org/)\n(accessed on 3 January 2023) focused\
    \ on rethinking pedagogy, technology, and design in\nBrussels classrooms, supporting\
    \ the dissemination and expansion of innovative pedago-\ngies aided by Information\
    \ and Communication Technologies. These spaces privilege the\nstudent’s action,\
    \ which fosters motivation, creativity, and involvement in the individual\nand/or\
    \ collective construction of knowledge. SSL goals and strategies align with DEAP,\n\
    aiming to foster students’ and teachers’ digital skills and competencies regarding\
    \ digital\ntransformation, delivering 21st-century learning skills.\n3.3. Design\

    \ the defense and improvement of quality of\nlife. Data collected by citizens\
    \ include the name and photo of the issue and its geographic\nlocation using GPS\
    \ technologies (see Figure 8). Based on the georeferenced issues, the\nstudents\
    \ produced a digital narrative using Esri StoryMaps. Based on this work, a safe\n\
    route for cyclists and pedestrians is currently being built at the municipality’s\
    \ request.\nThe ﬁfth proposed system collected data regarding municipality toponomy\
    \ in the\n2019/2020 school year. Students tend not to know the underlying history\
    \ of many streets\nin the municipality, intensiﬁed by the factor that parents\
    \ do not transmit this legacy of in-\nformation about the streets and culture\
    \ of the municipality to their children. The municipal\nproject made it possible\
    \ to intensively collect information on the toponyms of the streets,\nalleys,\
    \ gardens, and avenues of the municipality of the city under study. An active\
    \ learning\nenvironment was created under the theme of local toponymy to develop\
    \ students’ knowl-\nedge and collaborative abilities and to allow them to learn\
    \ in a dynamic and participatory\nway. Students who participated in data collection\
    \ with the Survey123 application designed\ngeoreferenced routes based on toponymy\
    \ (see Figure 8). The project constituted an excellent\nchallenge for knowledge\
    \ and dissemination of the land, a way of valuing the place where\none was born\
    \ and where one lives, developing a sense of belonging and, simultaneously,\n\
    identity and civic awareness. There is evidence of the increase and strengthening\
    \ of the\nculture and identity of the municipality by the students, thus valuing\
    \ its identity and roots.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3070\n16 of 36\nSince these strategies\
    \ have sharpened the students’ curiosity about the streets where they\nlive, it\
    \ is imperative to continue with activities of this type so that the historical\
    \ legacy of\nthe streets is not lost.\nThe sixth proposed system collected data\
    \ in the 2019/2020 school year regarding\ncharity (human rights) and is related\
    \ to the exponential increase in the number of requests\nfor help from residents\
    \ of the target local community related to the COVID pandemic\nbreakout. The charity\
    \ mission is anchored in integral human development, as well as in\ndefense of\
    \ the common good, promoting the sharing of goods and assistance in calamity\n\
    and emergency situations. This project aims at young people to be able to: (1)\
    \ analyze\nand critically question reality, evaluate, and select information,\
    \ formulate hypotheses, and\nmake informed decisions in their daily lives; (2)\
    \ be free, autonomous, responsible, and\naware of themselves and the world around\
    \ them; (3) dealing with change and uncertainty\nin a rapidly changing world;\
    \ (4) continue learning throughout life, as a decisive factor in\ntheir personal\
    \ development and social intervention; (5) know and respect the fundamental\n\
    principles of a democratic society and the rights, guarantees, and freedoms on\
    \ which\nit is based; (6) value respect for human dignity, for the exercise of\
    \ full citizenship, for\nsolidarity with others, for cultural diversity; and (7)\
    \ reject all forms of discrimination and\nsocial exclusion. In a more simplistic\
    \ way, it is intended, then, that students: (1) aspire to\nachieve a job well\
    \ done, with rigor and overcoming challenges; (2) persevere in the face of\ndifﬁculties,\
    \ be aware of oneself and others; (3) have sensitivity; and (4) be sympathetic\

    \ CS co-created strategies\nand their curricular integration and presents the\
    \ results. IoT wireless network-based sensors\nwith a limited and unlimited power\
    \ supply connected to a network are also considered.\n4.1. Curricular Integration\
    \ of Communal Environmental Issues in School Projects\nAs a result of increasing\
    \ globalization and technological development, and in line with\nthe Ministry\
    \ of Education and Science Decree-Law N◦. 55/2018 [109], it is essential that\n\
    students develop skills for integrating emerging knowledge and solving complex\
    \ problems.\nThese skills presuppose the implementation embodied in Decree-Law\
    \ N◦. 54/2018 [110],\nin an inclusive way, of meaningful learning for all students\
    \ based on each student’s speciﬁc\ncontexts and needs. In this context, the possibility\
    \ arose for each school to carry out\nan autonomous and ﬂexible management of\
    \ the curriculum, an instrument that must\nconsider local realities. Management\
    \ must be coordinated between all those involved in the\neducational process,\
    \ in a close dialogue between teachers, students, families, and the local\ncommunity\
    \ focused on building knowledge that allows all students to achieve the skills\n\
    set out in the students’ proﬁles at the end of compulsory education [111]. The\
    \ Domains of\nCurricular Autonomy (DAC) thus constitute a curricular option for\
    \ interdisciplinary work\nand/or curricular articulation, whose planning should\
    \ preferably involve all disciplines,\nwhich will allow the mobilization of knowledge\
    \ from different disciplines/disciplinary\nareas. It is intended to develop interdisciplinary\
    \ and/or curricular articulation work that\nallows valuing the “transdisciplinarity\
    \ of learning, mobilizing different literacies ( . . . ),\npromoting scientiﬁc\
    \ knowledge, intellectual curiosity, critical and interventional spirit,\ncreativity\
    \ and collaborative work” [109].\nThe curricular integration of CS strategies\
    \ took place in two Design-Based Research\n(DBR) cycles. The ﬁrst moment was embodied\
    \ in the DAC moments, and the second cycle\nwas implemented in a Science, Technology,\
    \ Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM)\napproach, with the reﬁnement of\
    \ prior CS strategies designed, implemented, and analyzed\nin a co-creation process\
    \ in the ﬁrst DBR cycle. The integration of STEAM, a multi-discipline\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 3070\n22 of 36\napproach to teaching that enhances students’ digital\
    \ skills and competences, fostered by\nIoT technologies, ensures the interdisciplinary\
    \ dialogue between the disciplines, with new\nlearning scenarios that promote\
    \ students’ participation in community issues [39,41,112,113].\n4.1.1. Citizen\

    the citizenship strategies, students are more aware of their civic duty and the\
    \ ability to\nbe interventionists in their community. The number of students that\
    \ were involved in\nparticipatory citizenship activities increased. The same happened\
    \ regarding helping with\nissues in several domains.\nRegarding the type of volunteer\
    \ involvement, CS could be classiﬁed as contributory,\ncollaborative, or co-created.\
    \ In contributory involvement, citizens merely contribute to data\ncollection\
    \ and eventually help analyze or disseminate the data. On the other hand, a col-\n\
    laborative approach will allow citizens to analyze samples and data and, sometimes,\
    \ even\nhelp design the study, interpret the gathered data, draw conclusions based\
    \ on the results\nand disseminate them. Finally, the co-creation approach allows\
    \ citizens to participate at\nall stages of the projects. They deﬁne the questions,\
    \ draw hypotheses, discuss the results,\nand answer questions. The EU-Citizen.Science\
    \ (https://eu-citizen.science/) (accessed on\n7 January 2023) is a European platform\
    \ for sharing CS projects. Many CS projects are\nregistered in Portuguese and\
    \ from other European countries, aiming to solve a local or\nnational problem.\
    \ The seven Portuguese projects are Explorator, GelAvista, Invasoras,\nCoAstro,\
    \ BioRegisto, MosquitoWeb, and GripeNet. They are all framed in the contributory\n\
    volunteer involvement ﬁeld. Regarding international projects, Crowd4SDG, Achieving\
    \ a\nnew European Energy Awareness (AURORA), Butterﬂy Migration, Hush City, or\
    \ Science in\nthe city, all, as with the Portuguese projects, citizens are merely\
    \ contributing to science. The\nCitiMeasure project (https://citimeasure.eu/)\
    \ (accessed on 7 January 2023) aims to raise\nawareness about citizens’ importance\
    \ in implementing citizen science initiatives in their\nlocal community. Focused\
    \ on a co-creation process, the project is grounded in three main\ninstruments:\
    \ comparability of air quality measurement initiatives, digital inclusion compe-\n\
    tencies, and citizen science initiatives’ inﬂuence on behavior and policy changes.\
    \ CitiAIR is\na tool provided by the project that brings together European projects\
    \ related to air quality.\nThe SmartAir (https://citimeasure.eu/initiatives/smartair/)\
    \ (accessed on 7 January 2023)\nproject is also referenced here with the main\
    \ missions of your measure/monitoring air qual-\nity, promoting smart/sustainable\
    \ mobility, and raising awareness/education on the issue of\nair quality. Certainly,\
    \ one of the main goals of the projects is to improve citizens’ quality of\nlife\
    \ and, eventually, to increase their scientiﬁc literacy. However, they do not\
    \ allow effective\ncitizen participation in local decision-making, just as not\
    \ being co-created by citizens; they\ndo not allow for an increase in the level\
    \ of citizens’ co-responsibility. By going through\nall the phases of the projects,\
    \ the students became more aware of communal problems\nas they gained a more comprehensive\
    \ knowledge of them. Not only did they recognize\nthe existence of the problems,\
    \ but they also discussed and found together with teachers\nand stakeholders the\
    \ best ways to mitigate them. Students also proceeded to analyze the\ncollected\
    \ data and disseminated the results among peers and even at the community level.\n\
    The construction of collaborative projects between the educational agents, starting\n\
    with the identiﬁcation of issues and the search for possible solutions, going\
    \ through the\nimplementation of the action plan, and ending with sharing the\
    \ results with the local\ncommunity, were catalyzers that fostered students’ participatory\
    \ citizenship. Indeed, CS\nstrategies aided by collective awareness platforms,\
    \ sensors, and micro-controllers, engaging\nlocal society in communal problems,\
    \ can contribute to a more effective dialogue between\nthe educational agents\
    \ and promote students’ participatory citizenship.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3070\n31\
    \ of 36\n4.3. Study Limitations\nThe data provided by the CO2 sensor outside the\
    \ school did not undergo signiﬁcant\nchanges in their readings, not meeting what\
    \ was expected to happen. The equipment\nwas eventually reconverted for internal\
    \ reading of the CO2 level inside the classrooms\nafter the breakout of the COVID-19\
    \ pandemic situation. Another limitation of the study\nis related to data communication\
    \ based on LoRa technology, which was not carried out\ndue to the inexistence\
    \ of LoRa Gateways in the target city of the study. Not being able to\ntake advantage\
    \ of LoRa long-distance communication, researchers opted for Wi-Fi and\nMQTT protocol\
    \ to upload data. Built on top of the TCP/IP, MQTT is a standard for IoT\ncommunications,\
    \ with low bandwidth consumption, efﬁcient distribution of information,\nand low\
    \ power consumption.\nIoT technologies have some seriously limited resources that\
    \ need to be addressed, such\nas energy, CPU power, and memory. The most challenging\
    \ one was energy consumption.\nData routing and transfer are of great importance;\
    \ in wireless communications, it consumes\nmore energy than processing. SmartGreen\
    \ and the SmartAir equipment have built-in\nrechargeable batteries that will be\
    \ recharged using a solar panel that should be installed\nlater this school year.\
    \ By default, the ESP32 module has built-in 4 MB ﬂash memory and\nmay also be\
    \ ordered with a custom ﬂash size of 8 or 16 MB. The data will be saved in the\n\
    ﬂash memory, even when the ESP32 resets or power is removed. Wi-Fi credentials\
    \ and\nvariables state, or any other type of data that needs to be saved permanently,\
    \ will be saved\nin the ﬂash memory. The ﬂash memory reading process is inﬁnite,\
    \ but the writing process\ncan only be done, in most devices, for about 100,000–1,000,000\
    \ operations.\n5. Conclusions\nThis study reports on CS strategies developed at\
    \ the curricular level, integrating com-\nmunal environmental issues in school\
    \ projects supported by the Internet of Things, aiming\nto foster students’ participatory\
    \ citizenship, promote the dialogue and communication\nbetween local actors, and\
    \ contribute to informing municipal education policies.\nStudents’ prior lack\
    \ of citizenship and engagement in community issues was addressed\nby new pedagogies\
    \ that contributed to developing autonomous, responsible, and solidary\ncitizens,\
    \ focusing on communal issues like climate change. Several documents recently\n\
    published by the Portuguese Ministry of Education reveal concerns about the lack\
    \ of\nwork done in the national public school about citizenship education. The\
    \ Portuguese\nCitizenship Education Guidelines, the National Education Strategy\
    \ for Citizenship, and\nthe Sustainability for Environmental Education Referential\
    \ are examples of this concern.\nMoreover, interdisciplinarity pedagogical practices\
    \ should include real-time data-gathered\nactivities with subsequent classroom\
    \ analysis and interpretation. The study’s ﬁndings\nsuggest that to build a bridge\
    \ for participatory citizenship, teachers should engage students\nin communal\
    \ environmental issues in a STEAM approach or under Domains of Curricular\nAutonomy\
    \ activities. CS strategies aided by collective awareness platforms, sensors,\
    \ and\nmicrocontrollers were catalyzers that fostered students’ participatory\
    \ citizenship. There\nwas a huge involvement of the parish council and municipality\
    \ in the training sessions and\nin the educational community awareness activities,\
    \ contributing to a greater articulation\nand concertation of agendas between\
    \ the school, municipality, and parish council. Several\nprojects were created\
    \ under the aegis of the Smart School Lab, which substantially improved\nthe quality\
    \ and sustainability of educational intervention projects.\nThe study was carried\
    \ out in a secondary school, so future work should target basic\neducation students\
    \ starting in the ﬁrst cycle of basic education. Regarding the IoT concept,\n\
    data privacy is always important, considering information published online [114].\
    \ Some\nsensitive data, such as the possibility of accessing the users’ location,\
    \ should be further\nstudied, including better data encryption. In addition to\
    \ the already mentioned issues,\nuninterrupted network connectivity, security-related\
    \ issues, and the physical safety of\nobjects are also a concern.\nSensors 2023,\

    20, 7163. Abstract Research has shown the multitude of applications that IoT,
    cloud computing and forecast technologies present in every sector. In agriculture,
    one application is the monitoring of factors that influence crop development to
    assist in making crop management decisions. Research on the application of such
    technologies in agriculture has been mainly conducted at small experimental sites
    or under controlled conditions. This research has provided relevant insights and
    guidelines for the use of different types of sensors, application of a multitude
    of algorithms to forecast relevant parameters as well as architectural approaches
    of IoT platforms. However, research on the implementation of IoT platforms at
    the commercial scale is needed to identify platform requirements to properly function
    under such conditions. This article evaluates an IoT platform (IRRISENS) based
    on fully replicable microservices used to sense soil, crop and atmosphere parameters,
    interact with third party cloud services, planning and scheduling irrigation as
    well as control of irrigation water control devices. The proposed IoT platform
    was evaluated during one growing season at four commercial scale farms on two
    different broadacre irrigated crops with very different water management requirements
    (rice and cotton). Five main requirements for IoT platforms to be used in agriculture
    at commercial scale were identified from implementing IRRISENS in rice and cotton
    production: scalability, flexibility, heterogeneity, robustness to failure and
    security. The platform addressed all these requirements. The results showed that
    the microservice approach followed in the platform is robust against both intermittent
    and critical failures in the field that could occur in any of the monitored sites.
    Further, processing or storage overload caused for any reason at one farm did
    not affect the performance of the platform regarding the other monitored farms.
    This paper also discusses how the microservice approach can address the data heterogeneity
    issue when crops with different management requirements are monitored. Since there
    are no shared microservices among farms, the IoT platform proposed here also provides
    data isolation maintaining data confidentiality for each user, which is relevant
    in a commercial farm scenario. Keywords IoT platform; microservice; smart agriculture;

  key_findings: The study found that the IRRISENS platform is scalable, flexible,
    heterogeneous, robust to failure, and secure. The platform was able to handle
    intermittent and critical failures in the field, and it was not affected by processing
    or storage overload at one farm. The microservice approach allowed the platform
    to address the data heterogeneity issue when monitoring crops with different management
    requirements.
  limitations: The study was conducted on a limited number of farms (four) and crops
    (two), so the findings may not be generalizable to all commercial farming scenarios.
    The authors also acknowledge that the platform has not been tested in extreme
    weather conditions or with a large number of sensors and cameras.
  main_objective: The main objective of the study was to evaluate the performance
    and requirements of an IoT platform for monitoring soil, crop, and atmospheric
    parameters in commercial-scale agriculture.

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart

    irrigation system

    Abstract: Precision agriculture is a breakthrough in digital farming technology,
    which facilitates the appli-

    cation of precise and exact amount of input level of water and fertilizer to the
    crop at the required time for

    increasing the yield. Since agriculture relies on direct rainfall than irrigation
    and the prediction of rainfall

    date is easily available from web source, the integration of rainfall prediction
    with precision agriculture

    helps to regulate the water consumption in farms. In this work, an edge computing
    model is developed for

    predicting soil moisture in real time and managing the water usage in accordance
    with rain prediction. A

    soil moisture prediction hybrid algorithm (SMPHA) has been developed that revolves
    around the decision-

    making techniques with live environmental parameters including weather parameters
    for the prediction of

    soil moisture through the impact of precipitation. Numerous algorithms with the
    combination of regression

    + clustering are estimated, and it is inferred that XGBoost + k-means outperforms
    other algorithmic com-

    binations that is deployed in edge model. This model is used as an intermediary
    between the end IoT

    devices and cloud that results in the saving of computationally intensive processing
    performed on cloud

    servers. The servers located on a local edge network perform the developed algorithmic
    computations.

    Avoiding transmission over the cloud results in signiﬁcant latency, response time,
    and computation power

    savings and therefore increases the eﬃciency of data transfer. The proposed edge
    computing model is

    implemented in Raspberry Pi as an edge, Heroku as cloud, and edge nodes as the
    combination of Pi with

    actuators and sensors. The monitored data from Pi are stored in MongoDB webserver
    that is controlled by

    Web dashboard. Finally, the developed model is implemented in cloud and edge where
    the edge server

    implementation performs better in terms of latency, bandwidth, throughput, response
    time, and CPU

    memory usage.

    1 Introduction

    It is evident that agriculture always has a specialized role in the anthrophonic
    evolution and has been

    serving as an important economic factor for the growth of a country [1]. Around
    58% of the population

    depend on agriculture as the chief source of livelihood in India. The quality
    and productivity of agricultural

    products have declined over these years as several factors have inﬂuenced the
    crop productivity both

    directly and indirectly. Some major factors that aﬀect the crop production are
    climatic changes, global

    warming, and water scarcity [2]. The agricultural land’s productivity is aﬀected
    by the direct and indirect

    changes in climate [3,4]. The crop growth has been already aﬀected by the changes
    in climate incurred by

    global warming. The nutrition quality of soil, ground water level, sea, and ocean
    are aﬀected by the

    modiﬁcations in average temperature, rainfall, and extreme weather conditions
    such as hail storms, dust

    storms, heatwaves, etc. due to global warming [5,6]. Degradation of soil is primarily
    created by various

    methods including 93.7% by water erosion, 9.5% by wind erosion, 5.9% by salinity
    and alkalinity, etc.

    Further changes in climate would inﬂuence adversely the crop production [7]. Since
    water is an indispen-

    sable requirement for plants and cultivation, the high level of soil is eroded
    and thereby the fertility is also

    declined. Due to the ever-changing climate, water scarcity has become a huge problem.
    Drought-like

    conditions is already formed in several areas and thereby the present and conventional
    farming practices

    are not suitable. New and unique environment preserving techniques are the need
    of the hour [8].

    The conventional approaches in agriculture are enhanced by the advent of several
    advancements in

    technology [9]. These new improved methodologies ensure optimized utilization
    of resources, accurate

    forecast of water needs and environmental parameters, reduction of human intervention,
    etc. [10]. Conse-

    quently, the outcomes of crops in terms of yield and quality are higher with cost-eﬀective
    methods. One

    such booming technology is the Internet of things (IoT) [11].

    IoT is the collection of components embedded in the sensor for measuring and transferring
    data via

    network devices as sensed from pumps and tractors to weather stations. Primarily,
    IoT deals with the

    transmission and reception of data related to farms through devices using the
    Internet for prediction

    and providing decisions to the farmers. IoT-based methodologies has brought a
    changeover in agricultural

    patterns and farming approaches [12]. IoT devices can gather information about
    soil moisture, chemical

    properties, dam levels, livestock health, and weather details in real time. The
    information acquired from IoT

    devices facilitates the farmers in tracking farms periodically. Farmers can save
    time and money by

    responding faster to farm conditions. Cloud computing models integrated with on-ﬁeld
    agricultural sensors

    need to be incorporated for tackling the issue of processing huge voluminous data.

    One of the major challenges of IoT is the processing of huge datasets in a sequential
    way. Some of the

    key factors that need to be focused on this process are as follows: information
    about the type and nature of

    data, the way of acquiring the data, etc. The preliminary stage comprises acquiring
    the data and ingesting

    the data to the system. Substantial cognizance of data are achieved as the data
    pass through all the

    gateways where it is cleansed and transformed before entering into the system.
    In the near future, dynamic

    prediction of soil moisture and precipitation techniques are to be developed for
    smart irrigation systems.

    Therefore, a system is developed for eﬃcient and optimal utilization of fresh
    water in irrigation along with

    drip irrigation system. It aids in ﬁnding which one of the plants fails to get
    suﬃcient water. When the water

    supply is provided the next day, this delay should not disturb the system. It
    becomes important for the

    farmers to understand the optimal usage of water and fertilizers to bring out
    sustenance in the agricultural

    industry. Therefore, processing must be done for analyzing the data, so that patterns
    can be analyzed and

    planning can be done for the long term, accordingly. Hence, it gives a broad vision
    in deciding where the

    processing is to be done exactly. Therefore, it is obvious that not all data are
    crucial, and it provides a clear

    view of which data need to be stored, discarded, and retained for both long-term
    and short-term purposes.

    Thus, all these challenging issues require to be addressed and that is where storage
    technologies are

    actually highlighted. The poor quality of Internet access in developing nations
    makes the implementation

    quite challenging. An applicable solution to solve this problem is through edge
    computing where the

    essential data could be oﬄoaded from the cloud over the edge of the cloud, and
    this is the exact point

    where the approach of smart sensing with edge computing gets in.

    With the purpose of broadening the potential of edge computing and using it in
    the agriculture domain,

    a novel approach using machine learning (ML) methods is proposed for analyzing
    the data acquired by the

    IoT devices deployed at the farm. Here, the data acquired from IoT components
    undergo preprocessing and

    ML models on the edge nodes to analyze and assess the appropriate results for
    providing the best instruc-

    tions for controlling the actuators (e.g., light, pumps at diﬀerent locations)
    in the farms.

    This article presents an automated system, as shown in Figure 1, to predict the
    soil moisture using the

    ﬁeld information acquired from the self-designed sensor node deployed at the ﬁeld
    and the forecast

    information of weather via Internet. A unique algorithm has been developed that
    revolves around the

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart irrigation system

    

    633

    machine learning techniques for the prediction of soil moisture. Here, many algorithms
    with the combina-

    tion of regression + clustering was estimated, and it is inferred that XGBoost
    + k-means outperforms other

    algorithmic combinations, and therefore, it is deployed for the prediction of
    soil moisture in the proposed

    work. The proposed algorithm makes eﬀective irrigation decisions with optimized
    usage of water in a more

    accurate and reliable manner. The eﬀective decision-making refers to the process
    of predicting the rainfall,

    thereby reducing the water usage in advance by the proposed algorithm in accordance
    with the predicted

    rainy days. Through this automatic decision-making, over watering is avoided by
    saving the soil. The

    server-side software is developed with node-side connectivity using the information
    for visualization and

    decision support features. This proposed algorithm is implemented in edge to prove
    the eﬃciency of the

    edge server handling the automated system better than the cloud control. The performance
    of the decen-

    tralized edge-based architecture has been evaluated for downloading the hybrid
    algorithm from cloud in

    real time execution. The performance can be enhanced by adopting edge computing
    architecture and

    measured with the help of network parameters like latency, bandwidth, and response
    time. Edge computing

    capacity is also estimated using the CPU processor and memory consumption while
    executing the proposed

    algorithm with irrigation scheduling.

    2 Related work

    In ref. [13], a smart irrigation system not aﬀected by communication disconnection
    and delay is developed

    using edge nodes deployed at the farms. Environmental parameters have an intricate
    impact on the plant

    growth. It becomes necessary for evaluating multiple AI models simultaneously
    in an actual cultivation

    environment for comparing AI models under the same conditions. Due to the working
    of existing irrigation

    systems on the cloud, communication is instable in the concurrent evaluation of
    AI models. However, the

    instability does not induce an edge node in its performance.

    The factors such as type of plant, soil, climate, humidity, temperature, and soil
    moisture need to be

    considered for the irrigation system packed with potential smart decisions. The
    nature and type of plant,

    soil, and climate are queried by ontology (branch of metaphysics dealing with
    the nature of being), whereas

    other factors such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture are sensed by the
    sensor network. The

    trained ML model predicts the watering decisions based on ontology and other factors
    as mentioned earlier.

    Smart irrigation has three modules: (i) sensor network modules that sense the
    parameters impacting the water

    requirement by using sensors DHT22, light sensor BH1750, and HL-69 hygrometer
    for sensing the temperature,

    soil moisture, light, and humidity in air. (ii) Edge and IoT server’s module to
    send and receive data through

    HTTP requests. (iii) Training module in which KNN is applied on the sample dataset
    for training and decision-

    making regarding the water needs. Based on the input values, the trained model
    categorizes the input into ﬁve

    possible classes: highly not needed, not needed, average, needed, and highly needed
    [14].

    A decentralized smart irrigation approach is proposed for strawberry greenhouses
    in contrast to con-

    ventional cloud-based solutions for keeping the agricultural data at the edge
    of the network. A full-scale

    smart irrigation system in an actual strawberry greenhouse environment is developed
    after a small-scale

    smart irrigation networking prototype system and a reference architecture targeting
    edge data distribution

    for strawberry greenhouse applications are framed. A three-step industrial approach
    is formed for

    designing, implementing, and validating a solution for smart strawberry irrigation
    in greenhouses and

    keeping the corresponding data at the edge of the network at the same time: (i)
    A small-scale smart

    irrigation prototype solution with oﬀ-the-shelf hardware and software equipment
    is tested and evaluated

    on various types of plants for gaining useful insights for deployments on a large
    scale. (ii) A reference

    network architecture is designed for targeting smart irrigation and edge data
    distribution speciﬁcally for

    strawberry greenhouses. (iii) A large-scale system in an actual strawberry greenhouse
    environment is

    developed in Greece, incorporating the proposed reference architecture [15].

    Edge computing is proposed for addressing the issues by taking advantage of computing
    resources in

    the edge of the network. The issues such as an edge mobile device make it easier
    to achieve low end-to-end

    latency, high bandwidth, and low jitter to services located on the edge network.
    An edge can enforce the

    privacy policies of its owner prior to the release of the data to the cloud through
    edge analytics. If a cloud

    service becomes unavailable due to network failure, cloud failure, or a denial-of-service
    attack, a fallback

    service on a nearby edge can temporarily mask the failure. Cloud services, partial
    analysis, and control

    functions are extended to the edge nodes from the cloud data center. Edge nodes
    facilitate the timely

    monitoring of sensors in smart farming by the reduced latency and enhanced data
    transmission. Due to

    these factors, edge computing is applied through farming [16,17]. A three-tier
    open-source software plat-

    form we proposed by authors, and the platform enhanced the precision agriculture
    by introducing edge

    computing and fog computing. An network functions virtualization (NFV)-based approach
    is deployed for

    performing the local operational decisions at the edge level for mitigating the
    inﬂuence of network failures

    while using cloud data centers [18]. For control processing in smart farming,
    a platform enabling cost-

    eﬀective sensor/actuator network based on IoT, utilizes edge computing [19,20].

    The authors in ref. [21] predicted the soil moisture using a mathematical model
    that measures the

    values given by a sensor matrix on the ground. Due to the huge interval in measurements
    (10 minutes), the

    model presented estimated error by more than 10%. This methodology has incorporated
    the online

    approach by making the sensors to send data every minute to edge devices without
    time-based interruption.

    The authors of ref. [22] applied a combinative approach of using ﬁeld sensor network’s
    data along with

    weather forecast station’s data for the management of optimality in water conditions
    for the enhanced

    growth of grapes. The generated data are forwarded to a web server, which displays
    graphics without

    statistical analysis of such data. The analysis must be performed a posteriori
    by the user.

    The watering mechanism for a plant via IoT methodology is devised by the proposed
    smart irrigation

    model without acquiring any pre-processed data. A prototype application is developed,
    which gets adapted

    to the parameters needed in irrigation after a couple of human-made irrigations.
    With the usage of various

    ML algorithms, several tests are devised for manual and automated irrigations
    for the performance evalua-

    tion. After the evaluation using four diﬀerent ML algorithms such as logistic
    regression (LR), K-nearest

    neighbors (KNN), Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB), and gradient boosting regression
    trees (GBRT), it is found

    that GBRT outperforms other algorithms. To analyze the overall performance, a
    test bed for the sensor edge,

    mobile client, and the decision service on the cloud is established. Two diﬀerent
    indoor species are selected

    as test items for the prototype, namely, Peace lily and Sardinia. The outcomes
    were quite good, and it is

    inferred that the prototype has learned the patterns of irrigation and making
    decisions automatically with a

    high rate of accuracy [23].

    The authors from ref. [24] adopted the deep learning methodology for detecting
    the type and the

    category of the plant using an automated plant irrigation system. The water necessity
    of the plant is

    determined using the recognition of predeﬁned set of plant images and data set
    acquired from farm. It

    utilizes the database for fetching the irrigation information after the recognition
    process is completed.

    Modeling the training processes are time consuming as voluminous set of images
    needs to be stored.

    The authors in refs [25,26] incorporated ML methods in the irrigation decision
    support model using a

    pre-processed irrigation data set. A model is developed for learning the irrigation
    needs of any plants

    progressively rather than using a readily available dataset. Several ML algorithms
    are evaluated with their

    precision for concluding the irrigation decisions. Manual irrigations are performed
    two times before making

    precise decisions. Due to the dynamicity in model, data processing is done progressively,
    and it can be

    applied to several plants having varying irrigation conditions. There is a need
    for the learning model that

    can be trained by itself using a comparatively lighter learning process using
    environmental parameters that

    do not need larger storage in the system but need higher computation. From the
    aforementioned survey for

    making a precise decision with instant computation locally, edge computing needs
    to be integrated into the

    irrigation system. This article is directed towards presenting a platform that
    implies IoTs and edge com-

    puting in monitoring soil moisture via sensors, data communication between sensors
    and edge devices, and

    an Analytics-as-a-Service cloud. It analyzes the collected data in the form of
    a density map of soil moisture

    for denoting the areas in need of greater or lesser frequency of irrigation. Here,
    density map does not refer to

    the geographical point data by satellite mapping, and it actually denotes the
    point of dry area and watery

    area through soil moisture detection point. This point is averaged among areas
    of irrigation to be done and

    the irrigation process is controlled with prediction of rainfall using the proposed
    system.

    3 The proposed system

    The proposed learning model for irrigation is implemented in a prototype IoT system
    that has four compo-

    nents: (i) Edge node layer – This layer consists of sensors, actuator, and two
    microcontrollers. In this layer,

    edge node acquires the sensor data from the surroundings and controls the actuator
    for actuating water

    pumps to start irrigation. (ii) Edge server layer – This layer consists of Raspberry
    Pi that act as edge server

    and capable of multitask processing. Here, edge server controls the edge nodes
    for sending signal and

    receiving data at regular interval of time. It is also connected to the cloud
    server for receiving developed and

    trained machine learning model to be deployed and make irrigation decision for
    controlling edge nodes.

    (iii) Edge service layer – This layer is deployed in the edge server and it is
    responsible for controlling the

    whole system through a developed web dashboard. The dashboard has live feed data,
    control of edge

    nodes, and cloud services access. This service layer also has the control access
    of the proposed machine

    learning model. (iv) Cloud server layer – This layer composed of cloud services
    and cloud storage where its

    role is to train the machine learning model and store the data in database. It
    sends the trained proposed

    model to the edge server for decision-making regarding irrigation scheduling.
    The comprehensive inter-

    connections in the system are shown in Figure 2. The proposed IoT-based smart
    irrigation system includes

    ﬁve major components: ﬁeld deployed module, Web-based interface, Web API weather
    input, soil moisture

    prediction mechanism, and edge communication model.

    3.1 Field deployed module

    In the ﬁeld requirements, a wireless sensor network of the sensor nodes needs
    to be deployed as shown in

    Figure 3. Here, ﬁeld data collection device accommodates four diﬀerent sensors:
    Capacitive Soil Moisture

    Sensor V2.0, DS18B20 Water Proof Temperature Sensor Probe for soil temperature,
    ultraviolet (UV) Light

    Radiation, DHT11 – Temperature and Humidity Sensor Module, and GYML8511 Analog
    Output Ultra-Violet

    Light Sensor Module. An Arduino Mega connected to Raspberry Pi 4 Model-B read,
    the output of these

    sensors where the program is developed in Python for the Pi model to fetch the
    hourly data from sensors

    and store the data in MongoDB [27] database. It is then synchronized with the
    server database using the

    developed web service. A Wi-Fi-enabled Arduino controls the water pump connected
    to a relay switch.

    

    637

    For the real time monitoring, a trigger is made for controlling the web service
    from the responsive web-

    based interface. The irrigation decisions are checked periodically by the proposed
    model performed in the

    server. The water pump is actuated, and irrigation process is started only if
    the server makes any irrigation

    decision. A wireless sensor network (WSN) [28] scenario with ZigBee [29] technology
    can be implemented

    for a large farming area in which several sensor nodes can be aﬃxed in the speciﬁed
    area and every sensor

    node possesses sensors similar to a standalone device. Then, the Arduino Mega
    reads the sensor output

    connected to ZigBee for transferring data to Gateway Node for aggregating the
    received data and storing it

    in MongoDB locally and also for transferring the data via web service to the edge
    server.

    3.2 Web-based interface

    The proposed framework consists of a web-based application to allow farmers visualize
    the growing data

    and interacting with the garden in real time. In addition, users can also be able
    to examine and analyze the

    historical growing data, if needed, through functionalities such as irrigation
    control, motor control predic-

    tion model deployment, and manual data entry implemented in this web application.
    Here, Node.js was

    chosen for developing the web application [30,31], while MongoDB [27] was utilized
    as the database system.

    Data stored in the database, which is deployed in the cloud, will be used for
    further data analysis in the

    future. The web application’s functions are designed following a software design
    pattern called model-

    view-controller (MVC) as shown in Figure 4. In the frontend, ChartJS is used to
    represent data through

    dynamic charts. The web application is also used as an interface to manage all
    the physical devices/

    actuators in the garden. To deploy the web-server to the cloud, a cloud platform
    as a service (PaaS), namely,

    Heroku, had been utilized. Heroku is a cloud platform that provides platform as
    a service (PaaS), facilitates

    the creation of applications and deploying these online rapidly [32,33]. It also
    enhances scalability and

    functionality by integrating several add-on services. The ﬁeld data are sent to
    the server by Raspberry Pi

    using this web service. This web service manages the network outage/ﬂuctuation
    during data synchroniza-

    tion from the ﬁeld device to the server by taking the help of ﬂag settings at
    the database level. The interface

    facilitates the scheduling of irrigation along with visualizing real time sensors
    and predicted soil moisture

    for upcoming days and precipitation information. By using the denoted threshold
    value of soil moisture

    suggested by agronomists, the irrigation can be scheduled by the user. The system
    maintains the threshold

    value depending on the predicted pattern of soil moisture and precipitation information.
    The process of

    irrigation is initiated automatically and stopped after the speciﬁed threshold
    value generated from the

    proposed algorithm of soil moisture when it is reached.

    3.3 Web API weather input

    The weather prediction data are collected by a web service developed in Python.
    The forecast data such as

    humidity, temperature, ultra violet index, precipitation, and cloudiness of web
    forecasting portals like

    Open Weather API are aggregated by the developed web service [34]. These portals
    provide the forecasted

    information in HTML, XML, or JSON format. The predicted data with JSON format
    are read by the developed

    web and stored in database at the edge server, which is concerned in the prediction
    algorithm. Also, these

    data are utilized as testing dataset in the ML model for predicting the soil moisture.

    3.4 Soil moisture prediction mechanism

    An algorithm for predicting the soil moisture based on data derived from ﬁeld
    sensors and weather fore-

    casting using the combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning
    techniques has been

    developed underpinned by regression algorithms and k-means clustering for estimating
    the diﬀerence/

    change in soil moisture owing to weather conditions. Many regression algorithms
    are compared against

    each other and infusing each of them with k-means to check the preciseness in
    mean square error (MSE),

    R2, accuracy and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for prediction of soil
    moisture of upcoming days

    with the help of sensor data and weather forecasting days. The information about
    soil moisture for the

    upcoming days and suggestions for irrigation in accordance with the prescribed
    levels of soil moisture and

    predicted precipitation values, thereby saving energy and water, is presented
    by the algorithm. The infor-

    mation generated from the device and the predicted values from the algorithm soil
    moisture prediction

    hybrid algorithm (SMPHA) are stored in the server.

    3.5 Edge communication model

    The communication protocols in the proposed framework are ﬂexible and transparent
    in nature for

    accepting both wired and wireless methodologies. For the maximum utilization of
    potentiality in edge

    computing components, the communication among various components in the edge-IoT
    system requires

    intense probing by using the versatility among the devices in network edges. For
    transferring the data

    gathered from pivot sensors, a communication technology such as Zigbee [35] is
    needed for the irrigation

    systems. Therefore, the communication component in the proposed work is classiﬁed
    into three main areas

    as shown in Figure 5. The Message Query Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol is
    used for the

    Figure 5: Proposed edge communication model.

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart irrigation system

    

    communication in the proposed system. The analysis in ref. [36] presented seven
    IoT messaging protocols

    (MQTT, CoAP, XMPP, AMQP, DDS, REST-HTTP, and WebSocket) as communication protocols
    that play a

    major role in smart farming. The authors have concluded that MQTT proved to be
    the most secure protocol

    after probing all the protocols with respect to latency, energy and bandwidth
    requirements, throughput,

    reliability, and security. Moreover, MQTT is secure in both end-to-end architecture
    and gateway server

    architecture. In an MQTT setup, a MQTT server termed as MQTT broker executes on
    the IoT solution [37].

    Under a common identiﬁer, a “publisher” and a “subscriber” link among themselves
    to this broker. In the

    IoT solution, publishers and subscribers are the IoT devices and IoT hubs or control
    devices, respectively.

    When the publishers have new data for recording, the data are published to the
    broker. The broker then

    ﬂags that it has new publisher data, and the corresponding data are read by the
    subscriber. Then, the

    subscriber analyzes the data and reacts accordingly.

    The ﬁrst level accomplishes with connecting the end users to system with the help
    of mobile or web-

    based applications through the Internet. The next level (cloud computing server)
    deals with the connection

    of web server and MQTT broker for directing the user requests and other components
    at the edge landscape

    or from the farms to the right cloud-based services like displaying the real time
    status of the farm for the

    users, triggering a new deployment of the updated ML model to the corresponding
    edge node. The third

    level (farming area) is directed toward the deployment of sensors and IoT devices
    (actuators) for commu-

    nicating with other components in the entire system.

    4 Deployment of soil moisture prediction hybrid algorithm

    The watering mechanism of the plant has diﬀerent approaches in the proposed model.
    Primarily, the system

    is trained with manual irrigations datasets during the process of learning with
    respect to suggestions

    deﬁned by agronomists. The model is trained to learn the needs of irrigation in
    the ﬁrst level of deployment

    in cloud without the inclusion of pre-processed data. After acquiring the required
    data and training, the

    proposed system is initiated to grasp the plant’s watering needs by undergoing
    plenty of manual irrigations.

    Thereafter, manual irrigation is not required and the system makes automated decisions
    in watering using

    the gathered data and the application of ML methods. The proposed model then decides
    the irrigation

    strategies automatically using ML methods without the need including collected
    datasets in the automatic

    irrigation process. The proposed model can be improved through the learning process
    when the number of

    precise irrigation inputs is provided to the model at each stage of training.

    The decision-making procedure is developed with two modules for irrigation strategies
    according to the

    soil moisture prediction for upcoming days. The ﬁrst module deals with training
    the model in cloud with

    manual irrigation datasets through steps such as data collection, data preprocessing,
    training, and model

    development. The system acquires values of air temperature (TH), soil temperature
    (SMT), soil moisture

    (SM), humidity (HU), and ultraviolet rays (UV) periodically from the physical
    environment in the data

    collection stage, which is essentially required for arriving at the watering decisions.
    Also, the time of

    performing the manual irrigation is recorded in the database. These data are timestamped
    and stored in

    as datasets to aid in making decisions for knowing the time of irrigation. In
    the next step of pre-processing,

    inconsistencies are eliminated and outliers caused by sensor errors are detected
    from the irrigation dataset,

    thereby helping in the removal of broken data. The training stage involves the
    application of supervised

    machine learning (ML) algorithms. Here the regression algorithms such as support
    vector regression (SVR),

    multiple linear regression (MLR), lasso regression (LR), decision tree regressor
    (DTR), random forest

    regressor (RF), and XG-boost regressor (XB) techniques are used for the deployment.
    The regression algo-

    rithms are trained using the collected datasets. Finally, through training, regression
    models are created,

    namely, SVR model, MLR model, LR model, DTR model, RF model, and XB model that
    are been combined

    with the second module for decision-making.

    The second module caters to the prediction of irrigation for upcoming days by
    infusing the weather data

    as an input to the regression trained models. The live datasets from the weather
    API for future prediction of

    640

    

    S. Premkumar and AN. Sigappi

    soil moisture variable are used. The dependent variables from weather forecast
    data like temperature (TH),

    humidity (HU), ultraviolet (UV), and precipitation (PC) are tested in the aforementioned
    model for soil

    moisture prediction. Then, the regression trained model is evaluated and deployed
    using the weather

    testing data for the prediction of soil moisture in accordance with the precipitation.
    After the prediction

    of data for the upcoming days, these developed regression models are combined
    with unsupervised ML

    algorithm named k-means clustering for estimating the changes incurred in soil
    moisture prediction due to

    the impact of weather conditions. Further, each regression models with k-means
    algorithm are evaluated

    for performances in terms of irrigation decision-making process as shown in Table
    1. The combined algo-

    rithms are estimated through MAPE, MSE, R2, execution speed, power consumption,
    and accuracy. The

    estimation and computation of these parameters are detailed by the authors in
    ref. [38].

    XGBoost + k-means (XB+k-means) approach provides more accuracy with less MSE comparatively
    and

    also the R2 with 98% in soil moisture prediction using combined approach is given
    in Table 1. It is evident

    that the proposed combination performs better when compared to other regression
    + k-means-based

    approaches. XB + k-means-based hybrid machine learning algorithm is applied in
    irrigation planning

    module on account of aforementioned performance metrices of ML. Although it performs
    moderately in

    terms of execution time and power usage, it is selected for the deployment in
    edge computing as it has

    better performed in terms of accuracy, R2, MSE, and MAPE metrices. It is observed
    that the prediction of soil

    moisture for the upcoming days from the proposed algorithm (XB+k-means) is nearer
    to the actual value as

    shown in Table 2, and hence, XB+k-means is selected for the implementation of
    SMPHA in edge-based

    irrigation scheduling.

    4.1 Hardware setup

    IoT system is crucial to handle, collect, and transfer the data to the computing
    nodes at the edge or in the

    cloud. These devices are connected to the edge nodes through wireless communication
    protocols like

    ZigBee. It is used in reducing the latency and loss of data. An Arduino micro-control
    unit controls the

    combined IoT sensors and actuators at the same part of a ﬁeld into a cluster,
    each connected to a Raspberry

    Pi that acts as an edge node in processing the gathered data and controlling the
    actuators. For example,

    Figure 2 shows an edge architecture with a Raspberry Pi connected to two components:
    Arduino Uno and

    Arduino Mega units via ZigBee connection. The ﬁrst Arduino Mega node is responsible
    for collecting data

    from sensors and the second one is for controlling the actuators in the ﬁeld.
    Depending on the sensor type

    with collecting Arduino unit, the sensors are connected via analog or digital
    PWM pins while controlling

    Arduino uno joins with actuators in the ﬁeld and controls (turn on/oﬀ) them in
    accordance with upper

    layers (from the edge web server). The trained (cloud) and deployed ML model in
    edge nodes provides the

    necessary instructions to the edge nodes.

    4.2 Web layer setup

    The deployment of web server assists the user in planning and managing the irrigation
    system. It visualizes

    the crucial information of factors like temperature of air and soil, UV, humidity,
    and soil moisture in live

    irrigation with real time updates in the form of various charts. In accordance
    with the selected ﬁeld, the web

    application redirects the user to the ﬁeld’s dashboard as shown in Figure 4. The
    dashboard consists of ﬁeld

    parameters as well as control signals for activating all the physical devices/actuators
    at the garden layer.

    These signals are denoted as switch buttons, and each switch controls (turn on/oﬀ)
    a particular kind of

    actuator (for instance, water pump to start and stop the irrigation). The user
    interface facilitates remote

    controlling of the ﬁeld by just clicking on the buttons as shown in Figure 4.

    4.3 Edge layer setup

    The edge node acts as a computing center where incoming data are analyzed and
    fed as the input vector to

    the ML model for processing and to return the control signals for activating or
    deactivating the actuators

    placed at the farm. Edge node processes the physical data (real time) at every
    end device such as the

    collected and processed data via the Raspberry Pi nodes presented in the proposed
    scheme. The prediction

    model is designed using TensorFlow API and trained, tested on Google Colab in
    this work. Amazon Web

    Service (AWS) oﬀers a library named Boto3 having many APIs to upload and download
    objects. After the

    development of model, it is transferred to Amazon S3, a service provided by AWS.
    The edge node utilizes the

    trained model from S3 for analyzing the sensed data acquired from garden’s sensors.
    The decision is

    delivered based on real time data analysis at the edge node and transmitted to
    Arduino nodes in the ﬁelds

    landscape immediately for controlling the actuators. In another ﬂow, the data
    collected from sensors are

    ﬁltered so as to keep only the modiﬁed data at the edge node before being sent
    back for mitigating the

    communication cost to the database in the cloud. These data are used in the updation
    of the ML model to

    enhance its eﬃciency.

    4.4 Analytics setup

    The main goal of this experiment lies in gathering the various physical parameters
    of a farming land via

    sensors and utilizing the fetched data along with weather forecast information
    for developing an algorithm

    using hybrid machine learning approach to infuse higher accuracy in predicting
    the soil moisture for the

    upcoming days. As discussed in Section 4, for the proper planning and provisioning
    of optimal irrigation,

    the algorithm provides a predictable estimate of soil moisture with the assistance
    of various statistical

    measures as shown in Table 1. The measures are adopted for estimating the appropriateness
    and error rate

    of the proposed algorithm. It is inferred from the experiment that, optimal irrigation
    is feasible using a good

    642

    

    S. Premkumar and AN. Sigappi

    estimation (close to the actual value) of the soil moisture (Table 2), with the
    support of ﬁeld data and

    forecast information, thereby utilizing the natural rain eﬃciently.

    The SMPHA ML model is interdependent on dynamic changes in weather environment
    where the

    models deployed on edge nodes need to change the controls accordingly after model
    gets trained con-

    tinuously. For the process of retraining, the trained model needs to be updated.
    The parameters such as TM,

    HU, ST, UV, SM about grown plants are logged for the training purpose, and these
    generated datasets are

    recorded from the already developed manual mode system [39]. The growth of the
    Indian Mundu Chilli [40]

    is taken for the observation from the ﬁrst stage to the last grown stage for 95
    days. While retraining the

    model, the training is carried in cloud without causing eﬀect to the functionalities
    at edge nodes. A signal is

    transferred to the corresponding edge server for triggering the task of updating
    the SMPHA model from the

    web server. At that time, the newly trained model is downloaded to replace the
    existing one at the con-

    sidering edge server. From then, the ML model at the edge server is called to
    be updated with the real-world

    knowledge and is ready for its garden controlling tasks (to apply in the next
    farming season).

    4.5 Work ﬂow

    The ﬂowchart in Figure 6 depicts the working of the proposed system based on the
    decision support system

    that is beneﬁcial for irrigation needed for the growth of vegetables. The chilli
    plant is grown in a growbag

    attached with sensors and Pi as shown in Figure 3 and monitored for 95 days of
    data collection. To bring out

    optimality in the irrigation system, features relating to climate, soil, crop,
    and ﬁeld infrastructure are to be

    considered. To provide several recommendations in the production of vegetables,
    decision support systems

    (DSSs) are designed, which process voluminous information [39]. This proposed
    work is the extension of

    soil moisture diﬀerences (SMD) model [41] developed for soil moisture prediction.
    The threshold values of

    soil moisture are used in the SMD model where the system schedules the irrigation
    date based on the

    predicted soil moisture and weather forecast (precipitation) information automatically
    using SVR+ k-means

    modeling. Therefore, in the extension of the aforementioned work, further more
    number of sensors are used

    to log soil moisture value, which is averaged in the proposed model. This model
    is developed in two

    divisions of ﬂowchart as shown in Figure 7, where both are interconnected. It
    is observed that the prediction

    of XB + k-mean approach provides better results as presented in Table 2.

    The ﬁrst phase of the ﬂowchart describes the hybrid algorithm for the soil moisture
    prediction (SMPHA)

    using the combination of XB + k-means algorithm. During the data collection step,
    the sensor data for the

    parameters, namely, TM, HU, ST, UV, and SM, are collected. During preprocessing,
    null values and outliers

    are removed and the preprocessed data are used to train the XG-Boost model. The
    developed model is then

    trained with variables of live weather features (TM, HU, UV, PC) obtained from
    Weather API for the

    prediction of SM data. These data are given as input to k-means clustering algorithm
    to predict the soil

    moisture, which is deﬁned as SMPHA value to be infused in the next phase of the
    ﬂowchart. The second

    phase of the ﬂowchart deﬁnes the automatic irrigation planning setup. The setup
    starts obtaining the soil

    moisture maximum (SMMax) and soil moisture minimum (SMMin) values in the dashboard
    for setting the

    maximum and minimum level of soil moisture. Then, the current soil moisture (CuSM)
    is sensed and

    compared against the threshold SMMin. If the resulting value is less than SMMin,
    the process proceeds

    with SMPHA. On the contrary, it stops the irrigation process by sending 0 to the
    relay. In SMPHA, the

    nearest precipitation date is selected and it is assigned to the predicted soil
    moisture (PSM). The SMMax is

    decided by ﬁnding the minimum of (PSM + SMMin, SMMax), and the predicted SMMax
    is further checked

    against CuSM with a condition if SMMax is greater the CuSM then it sends 1 to
    the relay as a signal to start

    irrigation. If the condition fails, then it sends 0 to stop irrigation. The process
    of automatic irrigation ends

    by forecasting the irrigation schedule in accordance with the live weather parameters.

    5 Experimental setup and evaluation

    The test bed is developed and deployed, and the data are collected for the analysis
    in irrigation manage-

    ment. Here, Heroku cloud platform is used to deploy the cloud web server. The
    same cloud is also installed

    at a local edge that is at two Raspberry Pi units equipped with Wi-Fi 802.11n
    connections to denote the edge

    nodes. JMeter application is used to get sequential accesses to the web page from
    various users for eval-

    uating the network parameters. The speciﬁcation of these servers is given in Tables
    3 and 4.

    We evaluated the performance of the proposed IoT-based smart farm on two diﬀerent
    platforms,

    namely, in the cloud and on the local computer to show the feasibility and the
    beneﬁt of the edge com-

    puting scheme. Further many parameters are considered for evaluation and discussed
    in the next section to

    show that edge deployment is better than cloud.

    5.1 Evaluation

    A hybrid machine learning methodology is used in evaluating the ﬁrst stage of
    the proposed model. The

    predicted value of the soil moisture is better in terms of their accuracy and
    error rate. From the comparison

    of the other ML algorithms as shown in Table 2, XB + k-means performs better and
    taken further to be

    deployed in edge and cloud to check its eﬃciency with each other. Therefore, for
    analyzing the eﬃciency of

    the edge server in accordance with the proposed hybrid algorithm SMPHA is evaluated
    in terms of the time

    taken to train the ML model in edge and cloud. In this experiment Raspberry Pi
    is used to train the SMPHA

    model with 196,400 rows, that is, input data sample size and takes around 1,710,000
    ms (approximately

    28.5 min). The same model when it is trained in Google Colab cloud environment,
    it takes 204,000 ms

    (approximately 3.4 min) as depicted in Table 5. The main purpose is to run the
    trained model on edge not to

    train the model at edge. So due to the lack of computing capability at the edge,
    it takes more time to train

    the model, but it can be ignored as it does not aﬀect the purpose of the proposed
    model. Here, edge is

    introduced to obtain the task of computing from the cloud (i.e., oﬄoading the
    task) by making the system

    more edge-oriented deployment. It can be accomplished rapidly as it requires only
    14 s to download a

    trained SMPHA model from the cloud to the edge node with a size of 3,101 kb as
    given in Table 5. The time to

    download varies according to the size of the trained model. So, from this process
    it can be inferred that

    downloading the trained model saves time when compared to training the model at
    the edge. Through this

    in real time, deployment of the trained SMPHA model in edge is better compared
    to deployment in cloud

    services. Furthermore, network parameters like latency, throughput, bandwidth,
    and response time are

    adopted to measure the performance improvements in edge computing.

    The performance metrices taken into account are latency, bandwidth, and response
    time [42]. The

    latency of an application is the product of two factors: computing latency and
    transmission latency. The

    time spent on data processing and transmission between end devices to cloud servers
    is termed as com-

    puting latency and transmission latency, respectively. The computational capacity
    of the system decides

    the computing latency as the network servers possess a considerable amount of
    capacity to make the data

    processing faster, whereas the sensors come with limited computing capacity. The
    latency in transmission

    is increased by the end devices and cloud servers. Bandwidth: As large number
    of sensors are deployed in

    IoT, data generated would be huge that consumes an intense range of bandwidth
    and leads to several

    problems such as delay in transmission and loss of packets. It becomes unacceptable
    for the data to be

    transferred directly to cloud servers without applying compression. Therefore,
    data preprocessing and

    aggregation are needed for IoT gateways before redirecting them to remote cloud
    servers. Then, the issue

    to be confronted is to control the traﬃc ﬂow by migrating data processing and
    aggregation tasks optimally

    to decrease the bandwidth needs of the end users while maintaining the data quality.
    Response time: The

    total response time is calculated by adding up transmission and processing time.
    The local deployment of

    the proposed model for controlling IoT-based irrigation are deployed on two modes:
    (i) Cloud mode: The

    developed SMPHA model is implemented in the cloud communicating with IoT sensors
    nodes directly to

    manage the irrigation process. The data are stored and processed at the cloud
    server itself where it uses

    Heroku platform. (ii) Edge mode – Raspberry Pi is deployed as an edge server that
    involves in processing of

    the SMPHA model controlling the IoT sensor nodes. Here, the data are stored and
    processed locally within

    the edge servers. This SMPHA model from both the edge and cloud does the job of
    controlling the actuators

    to initiate and quit the working of water ﬂow motors. Through this deployment
    in both the environments,

    performance of edge server and cloud server can be checked in terms of latency,
    throughput, bandwidth,

    and response time is shown in aforementioned graphs in Figures 6, 8, and 9. This
    performance metrices is

    not feasible to calculate while deploying in real time, so the aforementioned
    scenarios of two modes are

    virtually created by generating many request and response threads between the
    servers. This sampling,

    load test, and distributed testing are conducted through JMeter application [43]
    and also veriﬁed with

    Wireshark [44] in cloud servers. The test scenario is created here by data of
    sending and receiving sampling

    data between cloud to IoT sensors and between Edge to IoT sensors. The sampling
    data considered in this

    work refer to the approximate number of requests generated by Arduino to cloud
    and Arduino to Raspberry

    Pi that are calculated in real time. The test scenario is divided into 10 days
    of sampling data collected for

    each day. The evaluation results are depicted for latency and response times in
    10 days perspective. In

    latency parameter, edge service has decreased by an average of 77.85% time compared
    to the with cloud. In

    the same manner, the response time of edge service is also decreased by 74.09%
    time compared to cloud

    service. In throughput calculation, sampling data are calculated for an hourly
    basis for the 10 hours data in

    a day. From the hourly comparisons of throughput value, edge outperforms with
    67.17% high Mbps usage.

    Through this analysis as shown in Table 6, it is evident that the proposed edge
    computing methodology

    deployed in Raspberry Pi or in local computers outperforms the cloud-oriented
    approach.

    Finally, to illustrate the eﬃciency of resource management in edge computing,
    CPU and memory

    utilization are considered for the analysis as both factors rely on the service
    execution model and the

    computational needs of the services being ﬁred from oﬀ-loaders. Figure 10 depicts
    the utilization of CPU

    and RAM on the Raspberry Pi acting as an edge node in two cases: with and without
    the deployment of

    SMPHA model on it. As shown in Figure 10, the SMPHA model aﬀects the CPU of the
    Raspberry Pi node

    signiﬁcantly as it consumed around 41.2% of the CPU compared to only 3.5% when
    it does not host the

    SMPHA model. However, the memory (RAM) utilization in both the cases (with and
    without deployment of

    an SMPHA model) is nearly the same which is around 31%. Comparatively RAM utilization
    does not have

    much diﬀerence in with and without SMPHA. It is worthwhile to note that, the CPU
    utilization is still much

    lower than the 50% of total CPU capacity in Raspberry Pi. Therefore, it becomes
    feasible for adopting edge

    server implementation in the proposed irrigation system.

    6 Conclusion

    This article proposed a novel approach to edge-based irrigation system to facilitate
    decision-making on

    watering the plants on scheduled time. The proposed approach applying IoT with
    an edge computing

    framework enables the farming system to adapt to the changes in environmental
    conditions automatically

    and eﬃciently. The process of automatic irrigation regulates irrigation according
    to the live weather para-

    meters for forecasting the irrigation process. Soil moisture prediction was performed
    using major regression

    algorithms that are again combined with k-means clustering for estimating the
    changes incurred in soil

    moisture prediction. These techniques were compared through metrics such as MAPE,
    MSE, speed, and

    power consumption from which XB + k-means was found to perform better. The XB
    + k-means algorithm

    was further used for the implementation of decision mechanism on the developed
    edge computing model.

    The proposed edge model saves the data communication cost and reduces the response
    time of IoT services.

    It can be deployed on existing devices on the network edges serving as edge nodes,
    thereby reducing the

    overall implementation cost of a large-scale IoT system. The edge-based approach
    was found to perform

    better than the cloud-based approach in terms of response time, latency, throughput,
    and bandwidth

    usage. Finally, the edge model was analyzed through CPU and memory usage while
    running with and

    without the algorithm. In both cases, the memory utilization is almost lower to
    total available resource of

    the edge device. From this, edge device can allocate its remaining resource for
    other computing services,

    which increases the eﬃciency of edge computing device. The number of end edge
    nodes can be increased

    according to the ﬁeld area and then to check the potency of the system.

    1. Introduction \nIn recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor\
    \ Networks (WSN) have become \nincreasingly essential [1] in agriculture. IoT\
    \ is having abundant applications like agriculture, \nhealthcare, smart cities,\
    \ commerce, home automation, education, and the environment. These \napplications\
    \ [2] are developed by the IoT sensor cloud-enabled, edge computing, cloud \n\
    computing, and WSN.  \nAgriculture and soil monitoring is based on environment\
    \ and soil parameters. These have come \nfrom animal health, crop health, plant\
    \ health, soil health, soil ecosystem, climate balance, and \nhuman health. We\
    \ came to know about animal health by tracking movement. For proper \nirrigation,\
    \ there should be nutrients, fertilizers, and water requirements that lead to\
    \ better crop \nhealth, soil health, and plant [3] health. Weather assessment\
    \ comes under the climate balance and \nthe soil ecosystem is associated with\
    \ soil fertility and quality. Human health also plays a major \nrole in the agriculture\
    \ workplace as shown in Fig. 1.  \nA. Smart Agriculture Monitoring (SAM) \nIoT\
    \ can provide automation in agriculture monitoring systems with help of sensors,\
    \ actuators \nembedded hardware platforms, and cloud-enabled technologies like\
    \ big data and cloud \ncomputing. Generally, the IoT role in agriculture has been\
    \ transformed [4] to different domains \nsuch as water and soil management, crop\
    \ monitoring, etc. WSN also enables automation in the \nfield of agriculture with\
    \ energy harvested [5] nodes, hardware cost-effectiveness, and scalability. \n\
    \ \nFig. 1 Overview of the smart agriculture parameters \nB. Remote Monitoring\
    \ Systems using IoT \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a promising approach for\
    \ remote monitoring and \ninterconnectivity of the proposed system in this scenario,\
    \ thanks to communication protocols, an \nopen-source cloud platform for experiment\
    \ results based on Application Programming Interface \n(API), visualization dashboards,\
    \ and [6] web development tools. \n2. Related Work \nEmerging technologies are\
    \ playing a crucial role in smart agricultural monitoring systems, \nprecision\
    \ agriculture, and smart irrigation with complete automation and design implementations\
    \ \nin the current scenario. Some of the existing works are discussed below. \
    \   \nNestor Michael Tiglao et al. [7] proposed an Agrinex system, which is used\
    \ for smart irrigation \nwith a low-cost design and has a mesh-based topology\
    \ framework. It consists of hardware like \nRF module (NRF24L01), sensors (Temperature\
    \ and Humidity, soil moisture), actuator (servo \nmotor), and embedded boards\
    \ (Arduino and raspberry pi). Sensor's data processed and \ntransmitted through\
    \ the ATMEGA328P microcontroller and then via a gateway (sink node) to \nthe server\
    \ or cloud with the help of internet connectivity. The user can able to access\
    \ the sensor \ndata from the cloud and also developed a web application for remote\
    \ accessing and visualizing \nthe sensor data in online mode. \nRaul Morais et\
    \ al. [8] explained the mySense concept which means that data handling of \nenvironment\
    \ for developing the agriculture practices. In this article, four-layered architecture\
    \ \nshows the systematic data collection towards the precision agriculture issues\
    \ is discussed. This \narchitecture is made of four important components such\
    \ as input components (sensors) and input \ncomponents (actuators), gateway (Arduino\
    \ Uno, Raspberry pi) and wireless sensor network, web \nand cloud services, and\
    \ applications of end-user. It enables the hardware platforms with cost-\neffective\
    \ design end products to monitor the agriculture applications. \nUélison Jean\
    \ L. dos Santos et al. [9] represented the agriculture prediction model which\
    \ gives \ninsight on anticipate problems and improves the production of crops.\
    \ This model has three major \ncomponents like LoRa module, the Time series model,\
    \ and ARIMA predictive model. With the \nhelp of this model, to eradicate the\
    \ crop defects and notifications are sent to the farmers \nregarding their filed\
    \ information. In this model, sensors data acquisition with time series to \n\
    provide accurate results in agriculture production to the farmers.    \nShadi\
    \ AlZu’bi et al. [10] proposed an internet of multimedia things in smart agriculture\
    \ \napplications. This article, mainly focussed on smart farming for the optimized\
    \ process of \nirrigation. Internet of multimedia things having three important\
    \ components like image \nprocessing, IoT sensors, and machine learning techniques,\
    \ these techniques are used in the \ndecision-making system for proposed irrigation.\
    \ In this project deep learning is also state of the \nart for achieving the optimal\
    \ decision-making smart irrigation system. \nKhalid Haseeb et al. [11] demonstrated\
    \ an IoT and WSN based energy efficient framework for \nsmart agriculture applications.\
    \ In this paper, IoT and WSN are used to perceive the crop \nconditions and precision\
    \ agriculture automation by using different IoT sensors and these IoT \nsensors\
    \ deployed in the field of agriculture. To improve crop yield production over\
    \ the smart \nfarming decision-making system and acquire sensor data about the\
    \ crops and plant. This \nproposed system concentrated on few important metrics\
    \ like communication range, SNR, system \nthroughput, power consumption, and packet\
    \ drop ratio.   \nSanjeevi et al. [12] focussed on smart farming and agriculture\
    \ monitoring using cloud \ncomputing, the Internet of Things, and wireless sensor\
    \ network. In this article, the proposed \nmethodology gives insight into network\
    \ efficiency, low latency, high SNR, MSE, and more \ncoverage area. Based on the\
    \ sensor data, the receiver module has performed the action regarding \nmotor\
    \ on/off operations for proper water usage to agriculture monitoring. Different\
    \ types of \nsensors and other components have been used in the hardware implementations\
    \ for the smart \nagriculture monitoring system. \nTable 1 shows the IoT and WSN\

    \ stored. \n Transmission Unit (TU) \nIt helps in data transmission and reception\
    \ by establishing a connection between the sensor node \nand the WSN. In this\
    \ unit, we are having a transceiver. \n Transceiver \nIt is a device that is\
    \ capable of transmitting and receiving information through a transmission \n\
    medium. \n Location finding system \nIt is an external device that is used to\

    \ \nwith the help of different required hardware components [27] for making the\
    \ system efficient and \nintelligent. The hardware components are classified into\
    \ five types: \n3.1 Field sensors \nIn various applications of agriculture, the\
    \ environment sensors (DHT11 [28] means air \ntemperature and air humidity) and\
    \ deployment sensors (soil temperature and soil moisture) are \nplays a very significant\

    \ technologies and Protocols \nIn this study, wireless communication technologies\
    \ and protocols are used for data transmission \nfor short and long-range distances.\
    \ IoT is having many wireless communication technologies as \nwell as protocols.\
    \ Apart from that some of them have been discussed for sending the data to a \n\
    cloud server. The wireless communication technologies like Wi-Fi, NRF24L01 are\
    \ used to \nnetwork connectivity to a range of about 100 m and 200m through a\
    \ router (wireless access \npoint) respectively, and as well as protocols like\
    \ MQTT, CoAP for providing the communication \nbetween the machine to machine\
    \ (M2M) and messages are sent to cloud.  \n3.4 NRF24L01 module \nNRF24L01 Module\
    \ consists of two libraries like RF24 and RF24Network for providing all \npackages\
    \ into the Arduino sketch. It acts as both transmitter and receiver to send the\
    \ data over \nthe network at a 200m distance. It has operated at 2.4GHz and the\
    \ data rate ranges from 250 \nKbps, 1-2 Mbps. The wireless transceiver NRF24L01\
    \ module is having an in-built Wi-Fi SoC \nantenna and a total of 8 input and\
    \ output pins. \n3.5 Field actuators \nIn the field of agriculture applications,\
    \ field actuators have been provided the controlling \nfunctions of devices. In\
    \ this scenario, filed actuators are like the Reay module, Motor module, \nand\
    \ LED indicator module. Based on sensor data, the action will be performed by\
    \ a particular \nactuator with an LED indicator. Field actuators are having few\
    \ important specifications \ndiscussed in table 4. \nTable 4 Shows the different\

    4. Proposed Architecture \nThe proposed architecture of a self-powered, real-time,\
    \ nrf24l01 IoT based-cloud enabled service \nfor smart agriculture decision-making\
    \ system consists of two sections such as Transmitter \nsection (Tx) and Receiver\
    \ section (Rx) as shown in below Fig. 4 and the wireless connection \nbetween\
    \ AWMU to WAMU as shown in below Fig. 5.  \nThe transmitter section (Tx) is responsible\
    \ for monitoring the agriculture field to get information \n(agriculture parameters)\
    \ from environmental sensors and deployment sensors (agriculture \nsensors). So\
    \ the physical layer comes into the picture and it senses all agriculture parameters\
    \ \nthrough sensors like temperature, humidity, moisture, and so on. It sends\
    \ the digital signal to \nanother above level. Data acquisition is a collection\
    \ of data from sensors deployed in the \nagriculture field. Once got completion\
    \ of the data collection process and will be processed the \ndata, the term is\
    \ called data processing which comes under hardware embedded platforms (IoT \n\
    gateway) along with wireless communication technologies for IoT, based on the\
    \ conceptual and \ncommunication layers. Through communication protocols like\
    \ MQTT and CoAP, only the \nmessages are transmitted from client to server based\
    \ on a set of rules for data in formats such as \nXML, JSON, CSV, and so forth.\
    \ These things have happened while the Internet is available at \nfarmers' place\
    \ and it comes under the Internet layer.    \nThe receiver section (Rx) is to\
    \ take care of the agriculture field information which is stored in the \ncloud\
    \ server repository (IoT-cloud) with the help of IoT security like API key (Application\
    \ \nProgramming Interface). So that data access from the cloud repository through\
    \ preconfigured \ndevices like mobile phones, laptops, and so forth. The accessing\
    \ layer is responsible for access \nthe data from the cloud through a farmer’s\
    \ mobile phone regarding agriculture data. The \napplication layer is built to\
    \ do completely automatic visualization through graphical \nrepresentation, monitoring\
    \ for real-time applications, and statistical analysis for data. IoT cloud \n\
    itself data storage and data analysis is done in it. By using some of the machine\
    \ learning \nalgorithms are used in IoT applications for data analysis. Finally,\
    \ IoT cloud platforms are \nproviding cloud services for data storage and analysis.\
    \ These cloud platforms are associated with \nthe architecture of IoT for providing\
    \ cloud services. \n \n \n \n \nFig. 4 Proposed architecture for the smart agriculture\
    \ decision-making system \n \n \nFig. 5 Wireless connection between AWMU to WAMU\
    \ architecture \n4.1 Agriculture Wireless Monitoring Unit (AWMU) \nAgriculture\
    \ Wireless Monitoring Unit (AWMU) is deployed in the field of agriculture. It\
    \ consists \nof environment sensors, agriculture sensors, hardware platform (Arduino),\
    \ energy harvesting \ncapability circuit for power supply, and wireless transmitter\
    \ module (NRF24L01). The sensors \nlike DHT11 (temperature and humidity sensor),\
    \ soil temperature, soil moisture sensors, and \nNRF24L01-Tx module are connected\
    \ to the microcontroller. The AWMU has transmitted the \ninformation to other\
    \ devices through wireless communication over a network with good internet \n\
    connectivity. In the agriculture field, each AWMU is communicated through Wi-Fi\
    \ connectivity. \nFinally, the filed information is sent through the IoT gateway\
    \ from AWMU to the receiver \nmodule.  \n4.2 Wireless Actuator Monitoring Unit\
    \ (WAMU) \nWireless Actuator Monitoring Unit (WAMU) is deployed in the field of\
    \ agriculture. It has 4 \nmodules such as 1. Relay module 2. Motor module 3. LED’s\
    \ indicator module 4. NRF24L01-Rx \nmodule and hardware platform (Arduino Uno),\
    \ energy harvesting capability circuit for power \nsupply. Based on sensor data,\
    \ which is coming from the AWMU then actuators are responded \naccordingly through\
    \ wireless communication over a network. Once it reaches the field \ninformation\
    \ to WAMU and it again sends to the server or cloud. In the agriculture field,\
    \ the \nWAMU is communicated through wireless communication connectivity to the\
    \ cloud. \n \n4.3 Field Estimation for Deployment Sensors  \nThe proposed system\
    \ consists of environment and deployment sensors that are employing in the \n\
    agriculture field and each sensor covers the different coverage area. To achieve\
    \ [30] the better \nconnectivity means more coverage area (above 1 acre) with\
    \ no data loss and long-range \ncommunication as shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. And\
    \ also if the length (L) of the sub-field is low \nthen received sensor data is\
    \ more accurate, which means rises monitoring of agriculture field and \nreducing\
    \ the cost-effective of sensor deployment. So total agriculture field is dividing\
    \ into five \nsub-fields based on wireless connectivity of sensors in Eq. 1 and\
    \ each sub-field is having three \nAgriculture Wireless Monitoring Nodes (AWMN).\
    \ And also each AWMN contains 4 sensors \nthat are deployed in the agriculture\
    \ field. So that number of sensors selected in a particular \nagriculture sub-field\

    \ \nHeat Index (HI) is defined as the combination of air temperature (T) and air\
    \ humidity (H) values \nto regulate the equivalent temperature experienced by\
    \ plants or crops. In this process, the DHT11 \nsensor is connected to a microcontroller\
    \ (Arduino Uno) and it gives the sensors values like \ntemperature and humidity\
    \ (Environment parameters). Based on the sensor values, heat index \nmeasurement\
    \ [31] is calculated from Eq. 3 and it is used to good environmental conditions\

    \ \nIn this section, hardware implementation is discussed. The proposed system\
    \ consists of two parts \none is the transmitter part and the other one is the\
    \ receiver part. The transmitter and Receiver \ncircuits are connected wirelessly.\
    \ NRF24L01 module is used for wireless communication. The \nDHT11 sensor, soil\
    \ moisture sensor, soil temperature sensors, and NRF24L01 Transmitter \nmodule\
    \ are connected to the Arduino board at the Transmitter section. The receiver\
    \ circuit \nconsists of an NRF24L01 receiver module and a submersible pump (motor)\
    \ that is connected to \nArduino Uno. The soil moisture and soil temperature sensors\
    \ are deployed in the soil. The data \ncollected by this DHT11 sensor, soil moisture,\
    \ and soil temperature sensors are transmitted to the \nreceiver side circuit.\
    \ Some Threshold value is set at the receiver side microcontroller. If the \n\
    sensor received is below the threshold value then the motor will be in OFF condition\
    \ and if the \nreceived sensor is above the threshold value then the motor will\
    \ be turned ON and automatically \nirrigates the field. So, Depending on the data\
    \ received and threshold values, the submersible \npump (motor) will ON/OFF operations\
    \ accordingly as shown in Fig. 9, Fig. 10, and Fig. 11.  \n \nFig. 9 a demonstration\

    \ in the proposed agriculture \nmonitoring system. There are 2 modes: active and\
    \ low power. The sensor data will be delivered \nto the monitoring system through\
    \ remotely (WAMU) in the agriculture field once every second. \nFor each reading\
    \ consists of sixty four samples, which are sent as packets to the ThingSpeak\
    \ \ncloud platform. The data must be transmitted in 567.6 x10-6 seconds. So, for\
    \ the time being, the \nAWMU will be in a power-saving mode (idle). Because the\
    \ device operates on batteries, this will \nimprove power efficiency. Eq. 4, 5,\

    IoT investigates the agricultural field's quality to increase the crop yields,\
    \ boost efficiency, and \nlower the costs. The proposed Self-Powered, Real-Time,\
    \ NRF24L01 IoT based-cloud enabled \nservice for smart agriculture decision-making\
    \ system contributes to agricultural technology by \nenhancing the monitoring\
    \ and irrigation management schedules on a time-to-time basis. Since it \nis based\
    \ on IoT, field conditions can be monitored in real-time through remote location.\
    \ \nAdditionally, the system has some flaws, such as a limited coverage area.\
    \ Incompetence and data \nloss are caused by the surface area of sensors inserted\
    \ into the device. The proposed system is \nsupposed to solve the issues of existing\
    \ systems. As a result analysis, farmers can choose the best \nstrategy for healthy\
    \ agriculture practices with cost-effective hardware is used. The proposed \n\
    approach increases accuracy and reduces data loss with enabling of long-distance\
    \ monitoring \noption, low power consumption, wireless connectivity, and link\

    Abstract

    In this paper, we delve into the captivating integration of Italy''s rich architectural
    heritage with the cutting-

    edge implementation of smart home technologies. Our study embarks on a meticulous
    journey through

    Italian history, systematically exploring the seamless fusion of enduring architectural
    principles and

    contemporary technological advances. By unraveling the aesthetic paradigms that
    have de¦ned

    traditional Italian dwellings, we unveil the methodological process of assimilating
    novel technologies into

    the cultural framework. Through compelling case studies, we shed light on the
    delicate balance achieved

    between classical design ethos and progressive, environmentally-sustainable technologies,
    culminating

    not only in structural transformations but also in the radical rede¦nition of
    domestic lifestyles. We

    meticulously dissect challenges, critically appraise successes, and cogently extrapolate
    future directions,

    presenting a visionary outlook on the prospective era of Italian domesticity—a
    realm where e¨ciency and

    elegance harmoniously coexist. Going beyond mere empirical analysis, our scholarly
    synthesis offers

    profound insights into the evolution of Italian living spaces, where historical
    context and modern

    innovation converge to create environments imbued with functionality, aesthetic
    grace, and intellectual

    sophistication. Join us as we witness the Italian renaissance of smart homes,
    an enthralling journey that

    epitomizes the symbiotic relationship between tradition and technology in contemporary
    living.

    1. Introduction

    In an age characterized by relentless technological advancement, the concept of
    smart homes has

    emerged as a transformative paradigm that is reshaping the way people live, interact,
    and think about

    their living spaces [1]. Smart homes refer to residential environments that incorporate
    intelligent systems,

    automated controls, and advanced communication technologies, all designed to enhance
    comfort,

    e¨ciency, and sustainability [2]. Unlike traditional houses, smart homes are imbued
    with interconnected

    devices that can be controlled remotely, allowing residents to manage everything
    from lighting and

    heating to security and entertainment through simple commands or even autonomously.

    The integration of these technologies represents a profound shift from conventional
    housing models,

    merging the realms of digital innovation with everyday domestic life. The implications
    of this

    transformation are far-reaching, touching various aspects of society, economy,
    and culture [3].

    Particularly in countries with rich architectural traditions, such as Italy, the
    integration of smart

    technologies within the housing landscape presents unique challenges and opportunities.
    This

    juxtaposition of the time-honored principles of design with cutting-edge technological
    solutions offers a

    fascinating exploration of how tradition can be reinterpreted and revitalized
    through modern innovation.

    The emergence of smart homes is not just a technological phenomenon; it represents
    a societal shift that

    re§ects changing attitudes towards energy consumption, personal convenience, security,
    and even the

    broader philosophy of living. With global trends leaning towards sustainability
    and technological

    responsiveness, the evolution of smart homes becomes a critical subject of study
    that links technology,

    design, functionality, and human behavior.

    Page 3/19

    In this paper, we will delve into the multifaceted concept of smart homes with
    a particular focus on Italy''s

    housing landscape. We will explore how this nation, with its rich architectural
    heritage, is navigating the

    path from tradition to transformation, weaving smart home technologies into the
    very fabric of its cultural

    identity. The study will examine the economic, social, and architectural implications
    of this integration,

    providing insights that are not only relevant to Italy but also contribute to
    a broader understanding of how

    smart homes are rede¦ning our contemporary living experience.

    2. Methodology

    This research employs a mixed-methods approach to comprehensively investigate
    the integration of

    smart home technologies within Italy''s housing landscape [4]. Initially, a systematic
    literature review was

    conducted to gather existing knowledge from primary research articles, books,
    conference papers, and

    industry reports. This review enabled the identi¦cation of key technological trends,
    challenges, and

    opportunities related to smart home adoption [5]. Following the literature review,
    quantitative data were

    collected through a nationwide survey targeting homeowners, architects, and technology
    providers. This

    survey was designed to assess attitudes, perceptions, and practical applications
    of smart home

    technologies in various Italian regions [6]. Additionally, qualitative data were
    gathered through in-depth

    interviews with experts and stakeholders, aiming to provide nuanced insights into
    the economic, social,

  explanation: 'Precision farming approaches enable farmers to detect crop stress
    at an early stage by leveraging IoT and machine learning techniques. In this paper,
    the authors introduce a system that integrates these technologies to provide farmers
    with a comprehensive monitoring platform.


    The system consists of two modules. The first module is a wireless sensor network
    that collects data on environmental factors such as soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity. This data is then transmitted to a cloud server for analysis.


    The second module utilizes a low-altitude remote sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral
    imagery of the crops. This imagery is used to calculate vegetation indices, which
    can be used to assess crop health and identify areas that require attention.


    The system has been tested in a real-world setting and has been shown to be effective
    in detecting crop stress at an early stage. This information can then be used
    to implement targeted interventions to improve crop yields.'

    \ of Things (IoT)-based automation of agricultural events can change the agriculture\n\
    sector from being static and manual to dynamic and smart, leading to enhanced\
    \ production with\nreduced human efforts. Precision Agriculture (PA) along with\
    \ Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are the\nmain drivers of automation in the agriculture\
    \ domain. PA uses speciﬁc sensors and software to ensure\nthat the crops receive\
    \ exactly what they need to optimize productivity and sustainability. PA includes\n\
    retrieving real data about the conditions of soil, crops and weather from the\
    \ sensors deployed in the\nﬁelds. High-resolution images of crops are obtained\
    \ from satellite or air-borne platforms (manned\nor unmanned), which are further\
    \ processed to extract information used to provide future decisions.\nIn this\
    \ paper, a review of near and remote sensor networks in the agriculture domain\
    \ is presented\nalong with several considerations and challenges. This survey\
    \ includes wireless communication\ntechnologies, sensors, and wireless nodes used\
    \ to assess the environmental behaviour, the platforms\nused to obtain spectral\
    \ images of crops, the common vegetation indices used to analyse spectral\nimages\
    \ and applications of WSN in agriculture. As a proof of concept, we present a\
    \ case study\nshowing how WSN-based PA system can be implemented. We propose an\
    \ IoT-based smart solution\nfor crop health monitoring, which is comprised of\
    \ two modules. The ﬁrst module is a wireless sensor\nnetwork-based system to monitor\
    \ real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low altitude\nremote\
    \ sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further processed\
    \ to classify\nhealthy and unhealthy crops. We also highlight the results obtained\
    \ using a case study and list the\nchallenges and future directions based on our\
    \ work.\nKeywords: smart agriculture; precision agriculture; vegetation index;\
    \ Internet of Things\n1. Introduction\nThe rapidly-growing human population has\
    \ increased food demands for human survival on\nthe Earth. Meeting the food requirements\
    \ with limited resources of the planet is a big challenge [1].\nSeveral state-of-the-art\
    \ technologies are being incorporated in the agriculture domain to enhance\nthe\
    \ productivity to cope with this challenge. Precision Agriculture (PA) is comprised\
    \ of near and\nremote sensing techniques using IoT sensors, which help to monitor\
    \ crop states at multiple growth\nlevels. PA involves the acquisition and processing\
    \ of a large amount of data related to crop health.\nMultiple parameters are involved\
    \ in plants health, including water level, temperature and others.\nPA enables\
    \ a farmer to know precisely what parameters are needed for healthy crop, where\
    \ these\nparameters are needed and in what amount at a particular instance of\
    \ time. This requires collecting\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796; doi:10.3390/s19173796\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n2 of 25\nmassive information\
    \ from different sources and different parts of the ﬁeld such as soil nutrients,\
    \ the\npresence of pests and weeds, chlorophyll content in plants and some weather\
    \ conditions. All collected\ninformation needs to be analysed to produce agronomic\
    \ recommendations. For instance, given the\ndevelopmental stage of plants, their\
    \ level of greenness (chlorophyll content) reveals the nutrients\nneeded. This\
    \ information is combined with the characteristics of the soil where the plant\
    \ is located\nalong with weather forecast. All collected information is further\
    \ used to determine how much of a\ncertain fertilizer should be applied to that\
    \ plant on the next day. The delivery of agronomic information\non the right time\
    \ to farmer and ensuring that he/she applies these recommendations are key to\n\
    enhancing the yields.\nThe foremost driver of PA is a WSN, which is a network\
    \ of multiple wireless nodes connected\ntogether to monitor the physical parameters\
    \ of environment. Each wireless node is comprised of a\nradio transceiver, a micro-controller,\
    \ sensor(s), an antenna, along with other circuitry that enables it\nto communicate\
    \ with some gateway to transmit information collected by the sensor(s) [2]. Sensors\n\
    measure the physical parameters and send the collected information to the controller,\
    \ which further\ntransmits this information to the cloud or a portable device.\
    \ The agriculture sector has multiple\nrequirements comprised of soil statistics,\
    \ crops’ nature, weather conditions, fertilizer types and water\nrequirements.\
    \ Crops have diverse requirements depending on different crops on the same land\
    \ and the\nsame plant on different lands with different weather conditions. Sensors\
    \ monitor the varying behaviour\nof these crop parameters. Due to rapid advancement\
    \ in WSN technologies, the size and the cost of\nsensors have reduced, which make\
    \ it feasible to implement them in many sectors of life including\nagriculture.\
    \ The most common sensors used in the agriculture domain that capture environmental\n\
    parameters related to crops [3] are listed in Table 1.\nIn general, a WSN consists\
    \ of one or more wireless nodes that are further connected with sensors.\nThese\
    \ nodes are tiny devices that are responsible for collecting data. Nodes are divided\
    \ into two types,\na source node that collects the data, and the other is sink\
    \ or gateway node, which receives data from the\nsource nodes. A sink node has\
    \ more computational power compared to a source node. However, there\nare energy,\
    \ memory, power, size, data rate and price constraints when choosing wireless\
    \ nodes. Table 2\nshows a comparison of wireless nodes along with their common\
    \ speciﬁcations [3]. Among all wireless\nnodes presented in Table 2, MICA2 is\
    \ considered to be more suitable as compared to others because of\nits large number\
    \ of expansion connectors, which makes it suitable to connect with several sensors.\n\
    Many applications using WSN have been proposed since the last decade to monitor\
    \ crops’ health\nremotely. In [4], a cyber-physical system was presented for monitoring\
    \ of a potato crop. Cyber physical\nsystems can be expressed as smart systems\
    \ that are comprised of software, hardware and physical\ncomponents, integrated\
    \ together to sense the varying states of the real world. The proposed system\n\
    consists of three layers: the ﬁrst layer is the physical layer, in which all sensory\
    \ data are collected;\nthe second layer is the network layer in which data are\
    \ transmitted to the cloud; the third layer is\nthe decision layer in which the\
    \ data are analysed and processed to make decisions according to the\nobservations.\n\
    There are several challenges in IoT-based systems due to exponential increasing\
    \ devices. As in\na typical IoT network, every node transmits data to the remote\
    \ cloud, which results in cloud\ncongestion, and the main challenges underlying\
    \ the IOT-based system are latency with minimum\npower requirements, better usage\
    \ of bandwidth and intermittent Internet connectivity. Fog computing\nand edge\
    \ computing are the state-of-the-art techniques to overcome these issues; which\
    \ reduce the\ncomputational burden of cloud. The main goal of fog computing is\
    \ to conserve energy and bandwidth,\nwhich helps to increase the quality of service\
    \ to the end users. In [5], an energy-efﬁcient architecture of\nthe Fog of Everything\
    \ was presented, which was comprised of six layers. The ﬁrst layer was an Internet\n\
    Of Everything (IOE) layer, where things (could be ﬁxed, mobile or nomadic) functioned\
    \ under multiple\nspatially-distributed clusters. The second was a wireless access\
    \ network that supported Thing to Fog\n(T2F) and Fog to Thing (F2T) communication\
    \ over the wireless channel. In the third layer, the connected\nfog nodes behaved\
    \ such as a virtualized cluster. There was an inter-fog backbone in the fourth\
    \ layer,\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n3 of 25\nwhich was responsible for connectivity\
    \ among fog nodes. The next layer was the virtualization layer,\nwhich provided\
    \ each connected thing with the ability to augment its limited resource set, exploiting\n\
    the computation capability at the virtual clone. In the last layer, there was\
    \ an overlay inter-clone\nvirtual network that empowered Peer to Peer (P2P) communication.\
    \ Then, a protocol stack for FOE\nwas presented, which was further tested by creating\
    \ a small prototype named as V-FOE and simulated\non the iFogsim toolkit. The\
    \ results provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework\
    \ and more energy efﬁciency with reduced failure rate and delay.\nTable 1. Wireless\

    The energy efﬁciency is the most serious consideration while developing any fog\
    \ architecture.\nIn [6], an energy-efﬁcient protocol for a fog-supported wireless\
    \ sensor network was presented, which\nmaximized the lifetime of the network by\
    \ uniformly distributing the energy among connected nodes.\nThe performance of\
    \ the proposed algorithm was compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n4 of 25\nin MATLAB. The results showed that the proposed\
    \ algorithm was highly energy efﬁcient with a\nprolonged network lifetime.\nRegardless\
    \ of all the advancements in the IoT domain, the adoption of PA has been limited\
    \ to\nsome developed countries. Because of the lack of resources, remote sensing-based\
    \ techniques to\nmonitor crop health are not common in under-developed countries\
    \ such as Pakistan, which results in\na loss of yield. Pakistan is an agricultural\
    \ country due to is large arable land and climatic variations,\nwhich make it\
    \ suitable to cultivate multiple types of crops. Despite all these natural resources,\
    \ Pakistan\nis still unable to produce massive yields [7]. The main reason behind\
    \ the low production is traditional\nfarming practices, which are used for crop\
    \ health monitoring and yield estimation. These techniques\nare completely based\
    \ on farmer’s intuition and experience. Farmers visit the ﬁelds in order to monitor\n\
    the crop, which is very laborious and quite challenging in the case of large arable\
    \ land. In this case, the\narea under insect/pest attack is inaccurately measured,\
    \ which can result in over spraying of insecticide\nand pesticide, which adversely\
    \ affects the nutrition in crops.\nKeeping in mind all these issues, our motivation\
    \ is to provide the industry and research\ncommunities with a survey of technologies,\
    \ metrics and current practices concerning communication\ndevices, sensors and\
    \ platforms used to monitor and analyse multiple sources of data (spectral images,\n\
    IoT, etc.) used in environmental and agriculture applications. As the main contribution,\
    \ we generated\na technological taxonomy for PA, which was driven by an IoT-based\
    \ architecture to monitor the crops’\nhealth. The developed system had two modules\
    \ including wireless sensor network-based crop heath\nmonitoring in which multiple\
    \ sensors were used to get the real-time heath status of crop; the other\none\
    \ was NDVI-based analysis of spectra images captured by a drone to assess the\
    \ chlorophyll content,\nwhich was further used to monitor the health of the crop.\n\
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the most common\
    \ wireless\ncommunication technologies used in the agriculture domain; Section\
    \ 3 explains the spectral\nimage-based remote sensing techniques, platforms and\
    \ vegetation indices; Section 4 describes remote\nsensing applications in the\
    \ agriculture sector; Section 5 presents a case study on IoT-based and\nUAV-based\
    \ PA; Section 6 explains the experiments and results; challenges are discussed\
    \ in Section 7;\nand conclusions and future directions are presented in Section\

    \ protocols have been introduced in the last few decades due to the rapid\nincrease\
    \ in IoT devices and WSN technologies. Each protocol has its own speciﬁcations\
    \ depending on\nthe bandwidth, number of free channels, data rate, battery timing,\
    \ price and other factors [8]. The most\ncommonly-used protocols for wireless\
    \ communication in IoT-based applications in agriculture are:\nSensors 2019, 19,\
    \ 3796\n5 of 25\n2.1. Cellular\nCellular technology is most suitable for applications\
    \ that require an extraordinary data rate.\nIt can utilize GSM, 3G and 4G cellular\
    \ communication capabilities by providing reliable high-speed\nconnectivity to\
    \ the Internet, requiring higher power consumption.\nIt requires infrastructure\
    \ to\nbe deployed and operation cost and back up staff for it with a centralized\
    \ managed authority.\n4G cellular technology requires more battery power, but\
    \ cellular technology is a good option in\nunderground wireless sensor networks,\
    \ such as security systems in smart home projects and agriculture\napplications\
    \ [9]. A smart irrigation systems was presented in [10], in which several soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors were deployed in the ﬁeld in the ZigBee mesh network. The\
    \ reading captured from the ﬁelds\nwere transmitted over the cloud using the cellular\
    \ 4G LTE network.\n2.2. 6LoWPAN\n6LoWPAN is an IP-based communication protocol,\
    \ which was the ﬁrst protocol used for IoT\ncommunication. 6LoWPAN is also low\
    \ cost because of the low bandwidth and low power consumption.\n6LoWPAN supports\
    \ multiple topologies such as star and mesh topologies. To handle interoperability\n\
    between IPv6 and IEEE 802.15.4, there is an adaptation layer between the network\
    \ layer and the\nMAC layer [8]. The applications for 6LoWPAN are monitoring the\
    \ health equipment, environment\nmonitoring and in security and home automation\
    \ systems. In [11], a 6LoWPAN-enabled wireless sensor\nnetwork was presented to\
    \ monitor the soil properties of crops. The 6LoWPAN system architecture\nfor precision\
    \ agriculture application was discussed in [12] where the performance evaluation\
    \ of this\nprotocol was discussed with several baud rates and power constraints.\n\
    2.3. ZigBee\nZigBee is a wireless communication protocol widely used in precision\
    \ agriculture to monitor\nenvironmental conditions related to crops’ health [13].\
    \ It is based on the wireless 802.15.4 standard.\nBasically, it was developed\
    \ for personal area networks by the ZigBee alliance [8]. It has a ﬂexible\nnetwork\
    \ structure, long battery life, supports mesh, star and tree topology with multi-hop\
    \ data\ntransmission, is easily installed and supports large nodes. It has a short\
    \ range with limited data speed\nand is less secure compared to Wi-Fi-based systems.\
    \ ZigBee is very common in smart agriculture\napplications such as smart green\
    \ houses and smart irrigation systems [14]. In [15], a smart irrigation\nsystem\
    \ was presented based on the ZigBee communication protocol. This system consisted\
    \ of two\nnodes, i.e., a sensor node and an actuator node. The sensor node was\
    \ comprised of soil moisture\nsensors, which monitored the water level in the\
    \ soil. The actuator module was responsible for taking\nactions according to the\
    \ water level of the soil. All communication was carried out by means of\nZigBee\
    \ protocol.\n2.4. BLE\nBLE is as famous as the Bluetooth smart technology, which\
    \ is a suitable protocol for IoT\napplications including agriculture [16]. It\
    \ is particularly designed for low bandwidth, low latency and\nshort range for\
    \ IoT applications. The main advantages of BLE over typical Bluetooth include\
    \ lower\nsetup time, lower power consumption and unlimited support for nodes in\
    \ a star topology. It has a\nvery limited range of 10 meters. However, the drawbacks\
    \ are that it can only provide communication\nbetween two devices, it presents\
    \ low security, and it can lose connection during communication. In [17],\na BLE-based\
    \ infrastructure was presented to collect the sensors’ data. The proposed system\
    \ utilized a\nsmart phone to collect the data of sensors using BLE, where sensors\
    \ were deployed in the plants, i.e.,\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature\
    \ sensor.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n6 of 25\n2.5. RFID\nRFID systems consist of\
    \ a reader and a transponder, which have a very small radio frequency,\ncalled\
    \ the RF tag. This tag is programmed electronically with distinctive information\
    \ that has a reading\ncharacteristic. RFID has two technologies for the tag system\
    \ the ﬁrst is the active reader tag system,\nand the other is the passive reader\
    \ tag. Active reader tag systems are more expensive, as they utilize\nmore battery\
    \ power and use high frequencies. However, passive reader tag systems are low\
    \ powered.\nSome IoT applications using RFID include smart shopping, healthcare,\
    \ national security and smart\nagriculture applications. An IoT-based smart irrigation\
    \ system based on RFID was presented in [18].\nThe system was comprised of soil\
    \ moisture and soil temperature sensors along with a water control\nsystem, so\
    \ it collected the reading of the sensors and sent these readings to the cloud\
    \ using RFID\ncommunication protocols, where the user controlled a water pump\
    \ based on the water level of the soil.\n2.6. Wi-Fi\nWi-Fi is the most common\
    \ communication protocol that enables devices to communicate over\na wireless\
    \ signal. Wi-Fi provides Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) connectivity to millions\
    \ of\nlocations, i.e., homes, ofﬁces and public locations such as cafes, hotels\
    \ and airports with high speed.\nThe Wi-Fi protocol supports IEEE 802.11, 802.11a,\
    \ 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n. Wi-Fi is widely used\nin IoT-based applications\
    \ including agriculture systems, i.e., smart irrigation, crop health monitoring\n\
    and greenhouses. In [19], an infrastructure was presented to monitor environmental\
    \ parameters\ninside the greenhouse such as temperature, light intensity and soil\
    \ moisture level. This platform\nwas comprised of sensors that collected the data\
    \ related to the environmental variation and sent to\nthe cloud using Wi-Fi. Similarly,\
    \ another smart agriculture system based on Wi-Fi communication\nprotocols was\
    \ presented in [20]. This last one consisted of a Raspberry Pi connected with\
    \ multiple\nsensors, which collected the data. The collected data were further\
    \ transmitted to the cloud using Wi-Fi\ncommunication protocols.\n2.7. LoRaWAN\n\
    LoRaWAN operates on the LoRa network. LoRaWAN deﬁnes the system architecture and\n\
    communication protocol of the network, while the physical layer of LoRa enables\
    \ the link for\nlong-range communication. LoRaWAN manages the frequencies in communication,\
    \ data rate and\npower consumption for all devices. LoRaWAN is common in agricultural\
    \ applications because of\nits large coverage area and low power consumption [21].\
    \ In [14], a smart irrigation system based on\nLoRaWAN was presented. Table 3\
    \ shows the comparison of all mentioned wireless communication\nprotocols [8].\
    \ Among all wireless communication technologies, 6LoWPAN and ZigBee are considered\n\
    to be more suitable for PA application because both are based on mesh networking,\
    \ which makes them\nsuitable to cover large area.\nTable 3. Wireless communication\

    \ Image-Based Remote Sensing\nRemote sensing has been widely used in PA to monitor\
    \ crops’ health for the last two decades.\nRemote sensing is a phenomenon in which\
    \ physical conditions of the Earth are observed remotely by\ncalculating the emitted\
    \ and reﬂected radiation from some distance. There are special cameras that\n\
    are used to capture images for further analysis to ﬁnd the characteristics of\
    \ a speciﬁc area. Multiple\nplatforms are used to mount these cameras that capture\
    \ images of the objects.\n3.1. Spectral Image Platforms\nRemote sensing platform\
    \ considerations for spectral images are airborne-based, satellite-based\nand\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based [22]. Each platform has its own coverage\
    \ range, which\nis determined by three factors: (i) Ground Sampling Distance (GSD),\
    \ which is computed in terms of\nspatial resolution, (ii) data collection rate\
    \ or frequency and (iii) average distance between the object\nand sensor. Apart\
    \ from coverage range, several factors [23] affect the performance of platforms,\n\
    as mentioned in Table 4.\nTable 4. Key differences between spectral image platforms.\n\

    \ are considered to be the most stable platforms among\nall others. These platforms\
    \ consist of satellites, rockets and space shuttles. Space borne platforms are\n\
    categorized based on the orbits and timing. The advantages of satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing include\nhigh spatial resolution, which makes it promising to\
    \ extract extensive time-series data. The images\nobtained by satellite platforms\
    \ cover large area and are stable without noise, which is normally induced\ndue\
    \ to interference while image capturing. However, the main problem with satellite-based\
    \ platforms\nis their high cost in the case of high spatial resolution images.\
    \ The second problem is their strictly ﬁxed\ntime schedule, so data cannot be\
    \ collected at critical timings. The re-visitation times vary from twice\nin one\
    \ day to 16 days, depending on the orbit of the satellite. The other big problem\
    \ is that satellite\nplatforms are highly sensitive to weather conditions, so\
    \ if the weather is cloudy, the captured image will\nhave less detailed information.\
    \ Table 5 shows the main types of satellites with their speciﬁcations [22].\n\
    Among all satellite platforms presented in Table 5, some satellite data are freely\
    \ available,\nwhile others provide a commercial solution. The commercial solutions\
    \ such as Pleiades-1 provide\nimages with a high resolution and a revisit time\
    \ of one day. QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel are\nfrequently-used satellite\
    \ platforms used to obtain hyperspectral imagery. QuickBird was launched\nin 2001\
    \ by USA. The Panchromatic (PAN) and four Multi-Spectral (MS) imagery sensors\
    \ are used in\nQuickBird with a GSD of 0.7 × 0.7–2.6 × 2.6 m with a revisit time\
    \ 1–3.5 days. QuickBird provides a\nsmall revisit time, but it is a commercial\
    \ solution. In contrast to QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel\nprovide free solutions.\
    \ Landsat-8 was launched in 2013 by the USA. Landsat-8 provides a GSD of\n16 days\
    \ with PAN and 11-MS imagery sensors. Though revisit time of Landsat-8 is much\
    \ higher\ncompared to QuickBird, but it provides images with 11 different multi-spectral\
    \ bands.\nSentinel is another broadly-used satellite launched by the EU. It currently\
    \ has three missions,\ni.e., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. These missions\
    \ provide images with 21 MS bands with\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n8 of 25\nrevisit\
    \ times of 5–10 days depending on which Sentinel mission is used. However, Sentinel-2\
    \ is a\ncommonly-used platform in precision agriculture as it provides data freely\
    \ at a 10-m spatial resolution\nand covers a swath width of 290 km. By combining\
    \ Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, the revisit time is\nfurther reduced to ﬁve days,\
    \ which helps in change detection. The complete details of all satellite\nplatforms\
    \ with their speciﬁcations are listed in Table 5, where other platforms such as\
    \ SAT, MODIS\nand WordView are also considered.\nTable 5. Satellite platforms\

    much smaller than satellite-based ones, but relatively greater than the UAV platforms.\

    \ a vibrant alternative to satellite and airborne, which are quite ﬂexible and\
    \ cost\neffective. A typical UAV platform consists of a communication and navigation\
    \ system that incorporates\na set of sensors mounted on it. Among UAV platforms,\
    \ there are mainly ﬁxed-wing platforms. and\nmultirotor options are available.\
    \ The ﬂying time is based on the payload weight. In general, a longer\nﬂying time\
    \ is achieved by ﬁxed-wing systems, which demands lighter weight payloads. For\
    \ example,\nhigh-deﬁnition cameras weighing less than 300 grams as the payload\
    \ of a ﬁxed-wing UAV allow it to ﬂy\nfor around two hours using currently available\
    \ battery power [24]. On the contrary, battery-powered\nmultirotor UAV with higher\
    \ payload capacity have a reduced ﬂying time, i.e., around 15–25 min.\nTable 7\
    \ shows UAV platforms commonly used in the agriculture domain and concretely to\
    \ monitor\nthe health of crops remotely [22]. Among these platforms, DJI/Phantom-2\
    \ is a more suitable choice\nfor intermediate agricultural land because of its\
    \ low cost and ease of use. The other advantage of this\nplatform is that it provides\
    \ support for mounting multiple cameras, which helps to monitor the crop in\n\
    multiple electro-magnetic bands. The American Aerospace/RS-16 is also an option\
    \ because of its ﬂight\ntime and large are coverage, but due to its high cost,\
    \ this platform is not common.\nIn [25], the ESAFLY A2500_WH helicopter was used\
    \ to implement the platform of the UAV\nwith Tetra cam ADC Micro as the camera\
    \ to capture hyper-spectral images of two different types of\ncultivation, i.e.,\
    \ vineyard and tomato. The images captured by the UAV platform are very high in\n\
    resolution, so more information can be extracted as compared to satellite images.\
    \ To assess the health\nof a crop, three types of Vegetation Index (VI) maps have\
    \ been computed.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n10 of 25\nTable 7. UAV platforms for\

    Camera\n3.2. Vegetation Indices\nUsing multi-spectral images from the remote sensors\
    \ described above, a series of Vegetation\nIndices (VIs) can be computed. Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) obtained from remote sensing-based canopies\nare effective algorithms\
    \ for quantitative and qualitative evaluations of vigour, vegetation cover and\n\
    growth dynamics, among other applications [26]. Hitherto, no uniﬁed mathematical\
    \ expression exists\nthat deﬁnes all VIs due to the complexity of the several\
    \ light spectra combinations, instrumentation,\nresolutions and platforms used.\
    \ In particular, this section focuses on vegetation indices NDVI, GDVI\nand SAVI,\
    \ as they are widely used in PA.\n3.2.1. NDVI\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI) is the most popular VI that is extensively\nused to ﬁnd the content\
    \ of green in PA applications [27,28]. It uses Red (R) and Near Infrared (NIR)\n\
    channels to compute the NDVI index. More NIR light is absorbed by healthy vegetation;\
    \ however,\nabsorption ratio is very small for red light. NDVI is computed by\
    \ Equation (1) and returns a value\nbetween −1 and 1 [29].\nNDVI = NIR − R\nNIR\
    \ + R\n(1)\nHigher NDVI value indicate healthy vegetation, while smaller values\
    \ of NDVI show that vegetation is\nvery small at that speciﬁc region. There is\
    \ another form of NDVI, i.e., the Green Normalized Vegetation\nIndex (GNDVI),\
    \ which uses the green channel instead of red. GNDVI is computed by Equation (2):\n\
    GNDVI = NIR − G\nNIR + G\n(2)\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n11 of 25\n3.2.2. Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index\nThe DVI was proposed to reduce the effect of soil reﬂectance,\
    \ which is not covered by NDVI [30].\nDVI is different between the reﬂectance\
    \ of the NIR band to the reﬂectance of the red band. DVI is also\ncomputed with\
    \ the green band, i.e., GDVI. Both DVI and GDVI are computed by Equations (3)\
    \ and (4):\nDVI = NIR − R\n(3)\nGDVI = NIR − G\n(4)\n3.2.3. SAVI\nNDVI and DVI\
    \ do not compensate the background effect of soil. Therefore, many vegetation\n\
    indices were introduced to compensate the effect of soil reﬂectance. The Soil\
    \ Adjusted Vegetation Index\n(SAVI), the Green Soil Adjusted vegetation Index\
    \ (GSAVI), the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation\nIndex (OSAVI), the Green Optimized\
    \ Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OGSAVI) and the Modiﬁed\nSoil Adjusted Vegetation\
    \ Index (MSAVI) [31–33] are common among them, which are computed by\nEquations\
    \ (5)–(9):\nSAVI =\n1.5(NIR − R)\n(NIR + R + 0.5)\n(5)\nGSAVI = 1.5(NIR − G)\n\
    NIR + G + 0.5\n(6)\nOSAVI =\n(NIR − G)\nNIR + R + 0.16\n(7)\nGOSAVI =\n(NIR −\
    \ G)\nNIR + G + 0.16\n(8)\nMSAVI = 0.5[2(NIR + 1) −\nq\n(2NIR + 1)2 − 8(NIR −\
    \ R)]\n(9)\n3.2.4. NR and NG:\nNormalized Red (NR) and Normalized Green (NG) are\
    \ two other famous vegetation indices being\nused in PA [33]. NR focuses on the\
    \ part of spectrum where radiation is absorbed by chlorophyll, while\nNG focuses\
    \ on the part of the spectrum where radiation is absorbed by other pigments, excluding\n\
    chlorophyll. NR and NG are computed by Equations (10) and (11):\nNR =\nR\nNIR\
    \ + R + G\n(10)\nNG =\nG\nNIR + R + G\n(11)\n4. Wireless Sensor Network Applications\
    \ in Agriculture\nMultiple applications of wireless sensor networks are being\
    \ utilized today in the agriculture sector.\nSome very common applications are\
    \ smart irrigation, smart fertilization, smart pest control and green\nhouse monitoring.\n\
    4.1. Smart Irrigation Systems\nSmart irrigation is an artiﬁcial irrigation application\
    \ that controls the quantity of water by making\na decision about where water\
    \ is needed. It is the most signiﬁcant constituent in agriculture, which has\n\
    a great impact on crops’ health, cost and productivity. One major aspect of smart\
    \ irrigation is to avoid\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n12 of 25\nthe wastage of water\
    \ since most countries in the world are facing water scarcity problems. A smart\n\
    irrigation system was presented in [34] in which a Raspberry Pi was used along\
    \ with two sensors:\na soil moisture sensor was used to assess the water level\
    \ in the soil, while a temperature and humidity\nsensor was used to monitor the\
    \ environmental condition. The Raspberry Pi was connected to these\nsensors and\
    \ the water supply network. A mobile application was developed for remote monitoring\n\
    and remote water ﬂow control enabling both manual and automatic water ﬂow control.\
    \ In automatic\nmode, water ﬂow was automatically turned ON/OFF based on the water\
    \ level of the soil without\nhuman intervention. In manual mode, the user was\
    \ able to monitor the soil moisture level. An alert\nwas generated when the water\
    \ level of soil was getting below a speciﬁc threshold, and the user turned\nit\
    \ ON/OFF using a mobile application.\nPower is a big concern in IoT-based platforms,\
    \ so many researchers have developed power-\nefﬁcient systems. A power-efﬁcient\
    \ water irrigation system was presented using solar power [35]\nin which the controller\
    \ was connected to the soil sensor and water supply valve. The water valve\nwas\
    \ turned ON/OFF based on the water level monitored by the moisture sensor. The\
    \ power was\nsupplied by the solar panel, so the system was independent of any\
    \ external power module. Another\nsensor-based IoT system for water irrigation\
    \ was presented in [36] in which the controller controlled\nthe opening and closing\
    \ of a solenoid valve based on the water level of the soil. In addition, a series\
    \ of\nweather alerts were sent to the user via a mobile application to update\
    \ the temperature and humidity of\nthe environment, which had a direct inﬂuence\
    \ on the water level of the soil. In [37], an energy-efﬁcient\nirrigation system\
    \ for cultivated crops was presented using a wireless sensor network in which\
    \ water\nwas effectively controlled based on environmental conditions. This system\
    \ estimated the quantity of\nwater needed for normal irrigation based on the humidity,\
    \ temperature and wind speed collected by\nsensors along with historical data.\n\
    In [38], an IoT-based irrigation system was presented using soil moisture sensors\
    \ controlled by\nATMEGA 328P on an Arduino UNO board along with a GPRS module.\
    \ The data collected from the\nsensors were sent to the cloud, i.e., Things Speak,\
    \ where graphs were generated to visualize the data\ntrends. A web portal was\
    \ also designed where the farmer was able to check the status of water, if it\n\
    was ON/OFF. Similarly, a real-time prototype for an irrigation system was presented\
    \ in [39] in which\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature sensors were used\
    \ to assess the water status of the soil.\nRFID was used to transmit data to the\
    \ cloud for further data analysis. Using ATMEGA 328, a water\nsprinkler system\
    \ for smart irrigation was presented in [40] using temperature, humidity and soil\n\
    moisture sensors. The water sprinkler was controlled based on the soil moisture\
    \ level to save water\nand reduce human effort. In [41], a cost-effective drip\
    \ irrigation system for a home was proposed in\nwhich a Raspberry Pi, Arduino,\
    \ electronic water control valve and relay were used. ZigBee protocols\nwere used\
    \ for communication. The user turned ON/OFF the water valve by sending commands\
    \ to the\nRaspberry Pi, which further processed the commands through the Arduino.\n\
    The sensors placement is a big issue that affects the accuracy of sensors. A detailed\
    \ discussion of\nsoil moisture positioning in the ﬁeld and their accuracy was\
    \ presented in [42]. For real-time irrigation\nsystems, complete software and\
    \ hardware requirements, problems and challenges and advantages\nwere discussed\
    \ in [43] where a big picture of the complete system was provided.\n4.2. Smart\
    \ Fertilization System\nFertilizer is an artiﬁcial or natural substance having\
    \ some chemical elements used to enhance\nthe growth and productivity of plants.\
    \ Manual spraying is a common technique used for fertilization.\nHowever, the\
    \ optimal way of fertilization requires sensing capabilities to ﬁnd the exact\
    \ place where\nfertilizer is needed, which chemical components are missing and\
    \ the amount of fertilizer needed.\nIt is important to provide fertilizers in\
    \ a very precise amount in order to improve productivity [44].\nMultiple fertilization\
    \ techniques have been presented by researchers since the last decade using WSN\n\
    and IoT.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n13 of 25\nAn automated fertilization system\
    \ was presented in [45] using real-time sensors to measure the\nsoil fertility.\
    \ The system consisted of three modules including input, output and decision support.\n\
    The decision support module measured the optimal amount of fertilizers needed\
    \ for the growth of the\nplants based on the real-time sensory data captured by\
    \ the sensors. A mechanical sensor named the\n“Pendulum Meter” was introduced\
    \ in [46], which was used for optimal fertilization. This sensor was\nmounted\
    \ on the tractor to measure the density of the crop, so the corresponding fertilizer\
    \ spreader\nwas controlled based on the readings of this sensor. The IEEE 802.11\
    \ Wi-Fi module was used for\ncommunication along with GPS. Real-time data of soil\
    \ were collected by several sensors, i.e., soil\nmoisture, temperature, conductivity,\
    \ NO2, CO2, etc. A Geographical Information System (GIS) server\nwas used to interpolate\
    \ sensory data.\n4.3. Smart Pest Control and Early Disease Detection System\n\
    Pest attacks are the root cause of low productivity in the agriculture sector.\
    \ These pests result in\nseveral serious diseases in plants that affect the plant’s\
    \ growth. However, disease prediction provides\nearly warning to the farmers,\
    \ which enables them to make appropriate decisions to control the disease\non\
    \ time. Pest control systems are comprised of electronic devices that enable humans\
    \ to identify traps\nin a speciﬁc range of these electronic devices [47]. These\
    \ electronic devices are sensors capable of\ncalculating the environmental parameters\
    \ for further analysis.\nMuch research has been done in the agriculture sector\
    \ for early disease detection and pest control\nsystems using more advanced and\
    \ sophisticated technologies [48,49]. Multiple imagery sensors have\nbeen used\
    \ by different researchers to collect imagery data, such as: RGB sensors, ﬂuorescence\
    \ imagery\nsensors, spectral sensors and thermal sensors [50]. The thermal sensors\
    \ are used to measure the water\nstatus in the plant by measuring the temperature,\
    \ since this parameter has a direct inﬂuence on the\nwater level in the plants.\
    \ RGB images have three colour channels, i.e., red, green and blue, which\ncan\
    \ be used to perceive the biometric effect in the plants. Multi- and hyper-spectral\
    \ sensors capture\nimages containing the spatial information of objects in multiple\
    \ wavebands. The spatial resolution is\ndependent on the distance between the\
    \ object and the sensor. That is why satellite images contain less\nspatial resolution\
    \ as compared to low altitude platforms such as drones. The ﬂuorescence sensors\
    \ are\nused to distinguish the photosynthetic activities in the plants. Various\
    \ image processing techniques\nare applied to these imagery data to identify the\
    \ diseases in plants.\nIn [50], an IoT-based plants disease and pest prediction\
    \ system was presented to minimize the\nexcessive use of fungicides and insecticides.\
    \ Weather condition monitoring sensors, i.e., temperature,\ndew, humidity and\
    \ wind speed, are used to monitor weather parameters to ﬁnd a correlation between\n\
    pest growth with weather. The sensors have been deployed in orchards, and data\
    \ collected from these\nsensors are sent to the cloud. The farmer is informed\
    \ about the alarming condition of the pest attack\non the crops.\nFrom a different\
    \ point of view, hyper-spectral images are used to analyse crops’ health and pest\n\
    attack using manned or unmanned vehicles on which spectral cameras are mounted.\
    \ The captured\nimages are analysed in depth using machine learning techniques\
    \ to identify the disease in the plants.\nAdvance Neural Networks (ANNs) are more\
    \ common for processing imagery data due to their ability\nto learn complex structures\
    \ and patterns. Using hyper-spectral images, a system was presented [51] to\n\
    identify disease or pest attack in crops. The proposed system for disease detection\
    \ used an ANN with\nmultiple layers.\nEarly disease detection in sugar beet plants\
    \ was presented in [52]. For early detection, four\nsupervised classiﬁcation algorithms\
    \ were applied on spectral images. Spectral images were then\ncollected for each\
    \ image, and multiple vegetation indices were calculated to be used in predictive\n\
    and perspective analysis. The vegetation indices used were NVDI, SR, SIPI, PSSRaand\
    \ PSSRb, ARI,\nREP, mCAIand RRE. These vegetation indices values were used as\
    \ features in the dataset. Support\nVector Machine (SVM), ANN, and decision tree\
    \ were used for classiﬁcation. A comparative analysis\nwas performed which, showed\
    \ that SVM outperformed other classiﬁers for disease detection with an\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 3796\n14 of 25\naccuracy of 97.12%. In [53], a data mining technique\
    \ was applied on the already collected dataset of\ntwo types of crops, i.e., wheat\
    \ and paddy (rice), in India. For dimension reduction, Sammon’s mapping\nwas used\
    \ for multi-dimension scaling, i.e., to reduce the dimension also for unsupervised\
    \ learning.\nFor high dimensional data, dimension reduction is required prior\
    \ to performing further data analysis\nfor better data visualization and accuracy,\
    \ since redundant dimensions reduce the effectiveness of\nany data analysis algorithms.\
    \ Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a very often-used technique\nalong with\
    \ Sammon’s mapping. Data from multi-dimensions were reduced to two or three dimensions.\n\
    Then, the Self-Organized Maps (SOM) algorithm for clustering was used to ﬁnd correlations\
    \ between\nthe data. The accuracy comparison of SOM and Sammon’s mapping was presented,\
    \ which showed\nthat SOM performed better on a large dataset, while Sammon’s mapping\
    \ was suitable for small ones.\nSmart phones played important role in data acquisition,\
    \ which were further used to monitor the crops’\nhealth. In [54], the health of\
    \ wheat crop was monitored using near surface imagery captured by a smart\nphone.\
    \ The crop was classiﬁed as healthy or unhealthy based on the green level by computing\
    \ Gcc.\nMost of the applications in PA have been either IoT-based in which multiple\
    \ sensors are used to\nassess the health of the crop or remote sensing-based in\
    \ which crop health is assessed by performing\nsome computation on spectral images.\
    \ We can compare crop health monitoring application based\non some attributes\
    \ such as which sensors are used in particular applications, whether web or mobile\n\
    services are provided or not, etc. The comparative analysis of some existing crop\
    \ health monitoring\napplications is presented in Table 8 based on some attributes.\n\
    To precisely monitor the crop health, both IoT-based techniques and remote sensing\
    \ techniques\nshould be used together to provide more reliable and accurate information\
    \ about the crop. As a\nproof of concept, we present a case study in which a crop\
    \ health monitoring system based on IoT and\nremote sensing techniques is proposed.\
    \ We provide a complete end-to-end solution in the agriculture\ndomain by facilitating\
    \ the agricultural user with web and mobile services so that he/she could be\n\
    informed about the latest condition of the crop in a timely manner. In this way,\
    \ remedy actions could\nbe performed in time, which will result in enhanced production.\n\

    N\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n16 of 25\n5. A Case Study on UAV-Based and IoT-Based\
    \ Precision Agriculture\nWe developed a complete solution for crop health monitoring\
    \ based on IoT and remote sensing.\nIn the proposed system, crop health is monitored\
    \ using data collected from multiple IoT sensors,\nas well as NDVI mapping of\
    \ spectral images captured by a drone. The architecture of the proposed\nsystem\
    \ is shown in Figure 1, which was designed according to two main modules. The\
    \ ﬁrst module\nwas a wireless sensor network-based system in which multiple wireless\
    \ nodes were developed. Each\nwireless node was comprised of a soil moisture sensor\
    \ used to monitor the water level of the soil,\na soil temperature sensor used\
    \ to check the temperature of the soil and air temperature and humidity\nsensors.\
    \ These nodes were deployed across the ﬁeld in a star topology fashion where the\
    \ master node\ncollected readings from all slave nodes and transmitted the captured\
    \ reading to the back-end server for\nfurther processing. The master node acted\
    \ as a gateway node, which received data from all slave nodes\nusing NRF communication\
    \ module. After performing initial processing, the master node transmitted\nthe\
    \ data to the cloud using GSM communication technology. In the case of the unavailability\
    \ of the\nGSM network, this node stored the captured data and transmitted to the\
    \ cloud upon the availability\nof network.\nThe second module was used to monitor\
    \ crop health using multi-spectral imagery, which was\ncollected by a multi-spectral\
    \ camera mounted on a drone. The NDVI was computed using Equation (1)\nto classify\
    \ between healthy and unhealthy plants by measuring the chlorophyll content in\
    \ the crops,\nwhich was further used to localize the area under stress precisely.\n\
    All collected data were sent to the cloud where further analysis was performed.\
    \ The web portal\nwas designed to help the farmer monitor the crop proﬁle over\
    \ the whole life cycle. Currently, we are\nmonitoring soil moisture, soil temperature,\
    \ air moisture and air temperature readings in real time\nalong with NDVI mapping\
    \ of spectral imagery. Multiple web services were provided on the web\nportal\
    \ including historical/real data visualization using graphs, weather monitoring,\
    \ NDVI mapping\nand the correlation among measured parameters. Figure 2 shows\
    \ the snapshots of the web portal\nalong with different services.\nFigure 1. System\
    \ architecture.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n17 of 25\nFigure 2. User interface of\
    \ the web portal.\nFor portability and remote monitoring, a mobile application\
    \ was also developed to facilitate the\nfarmer/agronomist/landlord with all the\
    \ web services that are available on web portal. The alerts\nare generated when\
    \ an abnormal behaviour is observed in the crop, which help the farmer to take\n\
    remedy actions in a timely manner. The user interfaces of the mobile application\
    \ are shown in Figure 3.\nTherefore, the web portal along with mobile applications\
    \ provides a complete solution, which enables\nagricultural users monitor the\
    \ current status of the crop, as well as previous details.\nFigure 3. User interface\
    \ of the mobile application.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n18 of 25\n6. Results and\
    \ Discussion\n6.1. Analysis of the Data Collected by IoT Nodes\nThe developed\
    \ IoT nodes were deployed across the wheat ﬁelds of an area of 1.4375 hectare.\n\
    The selected area was located in Islamabad, Pakistan. The wheat ﬁelds are shown\
    \ in Figure 4 along\nwith the IoT node and sensors. We deployed the system across\
    \ the wheat ﬁeld in March 2019 when\nwheat was in the grain ﬁlling and grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 4. System deployed across the wheat ﬁelds.\nWe collected the\
    \ sensors’ readings such as air temperature, air humidity, soil temperature and\n\
    soil moisture. We compared the observed crop parameters with the ideal wheat temperature\
    \ proﬁle\nas shown in Figure 5. Extreme variation in the weather of Islamabad\
    \ was observed in that particular\ntime period, which can be seen by how the actual\
    \ temperature for wheat crop deviated from the ideal\ntemperature proﬁle of the\
    \ wheat crop.\nFigure 5. Deviation of observed temperature from the ideal temperature\
    \ proﬁle.\nAdditionally, we performed linear regression to ﬁnd the correlation\
    \ between observed parameters,\nwhich provided insight into how changes in one\
    \ parameter can effect the other parameter. The linear\nregression found a relation\
    \ between the two parameters by ﬁtting the equation of the line using the\nobserved\
    \ dataset [69]. Equation (12) represents an equation of the line where mrepresents\
    \ the slope of\nline, while c indicates the y-intercept. The variables m and c\
    \ were learned from the data.\ny = mx + c\n(12)\nFigure 6A shows the correlation\
    \ between the observed air temperature and air humidity, which showed\nthat both\
    \ were negatively correlated. The correlation between air temperature and soil\
    \ temperature is\nshown in Figure 6B, which shows that both were positively correlated.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n19 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\nFigure 6. (A) Correlation b/wair temperature\
    \ and air humidity. (B) Correlation b/w air temperature\nand soil temperature.\n\
    The rise in air temperature caused the air humidity to reduce, while it resulted\
    \ in an increase in\nsoil temperature and vice versa.\n6.2. Analysis of Multi-spectral\
    \ Images Captured by Drone\nTo collect multi-spectral imagery, we used the DJI-Phantom\
    \ Pro Advanced drone with the Sentera\nMulti-spectral-imaging sensor. The drone\
    \ had its own optical camera, while the multi-spectral camera\nwas mounted on\
    \ it to obtain spectral images. Multiple ﬂights of the drone were carried out\
    \ at the\nspeciﬁc growing stages of the crop, i.e., grain ripening and grain ﬁlling\
    \ stage. After collecting these\nimages, they were transferred to the cloud for\
    \ NDVI mapping. Figure 7A shows the optical image\nthat was captured on 16 May\
    \ 2019 when wheat was in the harvesting stage, while Figure 7B is its\nspectral\
    \ image, and Figure 7C is the NDVI mapping. Since wheat was at a mature stage,\
    \ its NDVI\nshould be very small, i.e., ideally there should be no green region\
    \ in the ﬁeld. However, in NDVI\nmapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal\
    \ behaviour of the crop. The green region was\ndue to naturally growing plants.\
    \ This information can be visualized on the web portal.\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure\
    \ 7. Wheat crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\nThe\
    \ same process was performed in a maize ﬁeld when maize was in the grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 8A shows the optical image that was captured on 24 July 2019\
    \ when maize was in the grain\nripening stage, while Figure 8B is its spectral\
    \ image, and Figure 8C is the NDVI mapping. The same\nbehaviour can be observed\
    \ with the maize crop, i.e., there should be a minimal green region in the\nﬁeld.\
    \ However, in NDVI mapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal behaviour\
    \ of the crop.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n20 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure 8. Maize\
    \ crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\n7. Challenges\n\
    PA has been used since the last few decades to enhance crops’ yield with reduced\
    \ costs and\nhuman effort, although the adoption of these novel techniques by\
    \ farmers is still very limited owing to\nthe following reasons or challenges.\n\
    7.1. Hardware Cost\nPA relies mostly on hardware such as sensors, wireless nodes,\
    \ drones, spectral imaging sensors,\netc., which are used to assess multiple parameters\
    \ in real time. These sensors have multiple limitations\nincluding high development,\
    \ maintenance and deployment cost. Some systems in PA are cost effective\nand\
    \ are suitable for small arable land, i.e., smart irrigation systems that require\
    \ low-cost hardware\ncomponents and sensors. However, drone-based systems for\
    \ crops’ health monitoring are feasible for\nlarge arable land due to high installation\
    \ cost.\n7.2. Weather Variations\nEnvironmental variation is one of the major\
    \ challenges that affects the accuracy of data collected\nby sensors. Sensor nodes\
    \ deployed in the ﬁeld are sensitive to environmental variations, i.e., rain,\n\
    ﬂuctuation in temperature, wind speed, sun light, etc. Communication between wireless\
    \ nodes\nand the cloud can be interrupted due interference induced in wireless\
    \ communication channels by\natmospheric disturbance. The satellite, air borne\
    \ and drone platforms are also sensitive to weather\nvariations. Imagery acquired\
    \ by these platforms is affected by contamination of clouds and other\nnatural\
    \ aerosols. The development of advanced techniques for atmospheric correction,\
    \ cloud detection\nand noise interpolation is a current open challenge, which\
    \ requires hard efforts from the research\ncommunity.\n7.3. Data Management\n\
    The sensors in PA constantly generate data. To ensure the integrity of data, some\
    \ data security\nmeasures needs to be in place, which will in turn enhance the\
    \ cost of the system. The readings from\nthe sensors have to be accurate in order\
    \ to take appropriate actions precisely when and where required.\nAn intruder\
    \ can corrupt the readings, and false readings will adversely reduce the effectiveness\
    \ of\nthe system. PA systems generate immense amounts of data, which require enough\
    \ resources to\nperform data analysis. Real-time data collected from sensors deployed\
    \ across the ﬁelds after a few\nminutes and spectral imagery acquired from high-altitude\
    \ or low-altitude platforms produce the bulk\nof the data, which increase the\
    \ storage and processing requirements. New software platforms and\nfacilities\
    \ for scalable management of Big Data sources are demanded. In this regard, the\
    \ generation\nof software-as-a-service solutions is focused on merging data management\
    \ and IoT thorough cloud\ncomputing platforms.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n21 of\
    \ 25\n7.4. Literacy Rate\nLiteracy is an important factor that inﬂuences the adoption\
    \ ratio in PA. In developing countries\nwhere the illiteracy rate is high, farmers\
    \ grow crops based on their experience. They do not utilize the\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technologies in agriculture, which results in loss of production. Farmers need\
    \ to be\neducated in order to understand the technology or they have to trust\
    \ a third party for technical support.\nTherefore, in underdeveloped areas where\
    \ the literacy rate is not high, PA is not very common due to\nthe limitations\
    \ of resources and education.\n7.5. Connectivity\nNext-generation 5G networks\
    \ can be 100-times faster than 4G ones, making communication\nbetween devices\
    \ and servers much quicker. 5G can also carry much more data than other networks,\n\
    which makes it an ideal technology for transmitting information from remote sensors\
    \ and drones, key\ntools that are being tested in PA environments. The adoption\
    \ of new communication networks based\non 5G is a must in current applications\
    \ where secure and rapid data transfer enables real-time data\nmanagement and\
    \ support for decision making.\n7.6. Interoperability\nOne of the biggest problems\
    \ PA faces is the interoperability of equipment due to different digital\nstandards.\
    \ This lack of interoperability is not only obstructing the adoption of new IoT\
    \ technologies\nand slowing down their growth, but it also inhibits the gain of\
    \ production efﬁciency through smart\nagriculture applications. New methods and\
    \ protocols to integrate different machine communication\nstandards to unlock\
    \ the potential of efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and data sharing\n\
    between machines and management information systems are required in the current\
    \ scenario of PA.\n8. Conclusion and Future Directions\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ is a modern practice used to enhance crops’ productivity using latest\ntechnologies,\
    \ i.e., WSN, IoT, cloud computing, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning\n\
    (ML). Most of the research done so far indicates that PA-based practices have\
    \ a great inﬂuence on\nsustainability and productivity. The objective of PA is\
    \ to provide decision support systems based\non multiple parameters of crops,\
    \ i.e., soil nutrients, water level of the soil, wind speed, intensity of\nsunlight,\
    \ temperature, humidity, chlorophyll content, etc. However, several challenges\
    \ are involved\nin the development and deployment phase of these systems. This\
    \ article was aimed at providing a\nsurvey of modern technologies involving current\
    \ PA platforms, with the goal of supporting industry\nand research communities\
    \ on the development of modern applications for smart agriculture. A case\nstudy\
    \ was presented to prove the effectiveness of the PA in the agriculture domain.\n\
    Since the main objective of precision agriculture is to produce surplus yield\
    \ by optimizing the\nresources such as water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc., for\
    \ resource optimization, prescription maps play\nan important role, which enables\
    \ farmers to quantify resources required for healthy crops at any\nparticular\
    \ growth stage. Most of the research accomplished in the agriculture domain focuses\
    \ on the\nremote sensing platforms to collect imagery, which reﬂects only Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) such as NDVI.\nThe prescription maps cannot be generated by only\
    \ using VIs; instead, multiple other factors need to\nbe considered such as soil\
    \ properties, soil moisture level, meteorological behaviour, etc.\nFunding: This\

    conference paper PDF 1 Introduction The main factor for the agriculture is to
    predict the weather, climatic changes and also mainly to predict that when the
    atmosphere conditions are going to change. Here, both the automated irrigation
    system and the IoT is employed for the irrigation monitoring. It will be helpful
    for us when to irrigate the crop or field at what conditions will the crop be
    able to sustain and also the other environment and also the other changes. To
    monitor the weather and climatic conditions which are varying with the time and
    space, so the use of these electrical devices in the agriculture has been increasing
    rapidly. So the use of these WSN technology is applied to the irrigation systems,
    and it automatically removes high risk to the cable line due to the automatic
    operations of the machines [1]. Due to the high cost of the WSN system modules,
    we are not using these type of technology and also it requires high energy for
    the data transmission between the client and server. So we will use the IoT and
    with the help of the IoT we are employing the several systems in the different
    crop fields by naming it as the clients and this clients, which is getting reported
    every time to the server about the status of the crop, climatic changes of the
    temperature, humidity, and also the moisture of the certain place. So that the
    watering and also the when the pesticides can be served based on the conditions
    on the field. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the literature
    survey. Section 3 explains the proposed system in which the environmental changes
    are controlled using IoT through simple message transfer protocol (SMTP) and message
    queue telemetry transport protocol (MQTT). Section 4 mentions about the hardware
    description. In Sect. 5, results are discussed. Finally, conclusion in Sect. 6.
    2 Literature Survey Wireless sensor network and GPRS module are used in automatic
    irrigation system as shown in Fig. 1. A wireless sensor network in which the required
    parameter sensors are placed in the root zone of the crops. To transmit the information
    received through sensors, it has gate way unit and trigger acculators [2]. To
    know the required amount of water starting values of soil moisture and temperature
    are taken into consideration and algorithm is developed. It uses photovoltaic
    panel and cellular internet communication link for data transference and irrigation
    check. First and foremost, it uses expensive and complex algorithms to get the
    required information. Secondly, it doesn’t help to control the environmental changes
    and low-communication speed. Fig. 1 GPRS module in automated irrigation system
    Full size image 2.1 Smart Phone Irrigation Taking agricultural crops into consideration,
    irrigation sensor was designed. The camera captures the images of the soil and
    roots of the crop to estimate the requirement of water. To estimate the wet and
    dry area of the crop using antireflective glass window an android app was developed
    so that this app activates the device to capture the images. A Wi-Fi connection
    is also needed to control the irrigation as in Fig. 2. This model addresses a
    lot of issues like having a smart phone with a Wi-Fi connection resulting in battery
    issues of phone, poor signal and time consuming. Fig. 2 Smart phone irrigation
    Full size image 2.2 Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) To get the best crop conduction,
    increase the productivity WSN is used as in Fig. 3. Many environmental parameters
    are sensed using sensors which continuously sends the data about water shortage.
    The soil conditions, need of water and climatic changes are known by using a Bluetooth
    device [3, 4]. This Bluetooth is used to transfer the information from sender
    to the receiver. Though this model is of low cost and gives the output results,
    it cannot recollect the old data, and it is less secure weather forecasting cloud
    technologies are not used. Fig. 3 Wireless sensor network Full size image 2.3
    IoT in Agriculture IoT has the ability to rule the world in many industries, smart
    cities and especially when it comes to agricultural sector it has a great wallop.
    The conventional based farming approach is too difficult when compared to smart
    farming based IoT [5, 6]. It has great advantages like less water usage, control
    over environment and updated input treatments. It makes stock man and farmers
    to get the useful data, making the farmers understand the process by installing
    the necessary smart ways to increase the productivity as in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 IoT
    in agriculture Full size image 2.4 Drone Applications of IoT in Agriculture It
    is one if the best application of today’s growing technology. It handles crop
    health, irrigation, crop records, crop spraying and soil field analysis. Drones
    get the data by insight monitoring and observations [7]. To select a ground resolution
    farmer, enter the data so that plant height measurement, yield prediction and
    so on can be identified. It is used by many organizations and one of the most
    recognized application of IoT agricultural division. It utilizes various sensors,
    control systems, robotics, automated hardware, free vehicles [8]. It adopts high-speed
    internet, mobile devices and low-cost satellites are few technological trends.
    The chance of crops being damaged will be reduced if accuracy of weather is high.
    It is used for food production and safety. Agriculture IoT not only concentrates
    on increasing the productivity of the crop and control of weather conditions but
    also takes responsibility about food security like storage transportation, etc.
    Shipping time, storage temperature and cloud-based records are monitored by this
    system. 3 Proposed System In the present system, we are using the crop field algorithm.
    So the resulting data is having the high accuracy about the environment, and also
    mainly we are using the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) instead of
    using the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is MQTT is very much faster than the WSN.
    We are using this message queuing telemetry transport to transfer all the information
    about the climatic conditions are processed automatically, like if there is any
    possibility of rain in the weather cloud, then the climatic conditions and also
    the upcoming possibilities of the rain data log and also the current image of
    the environment will also be sent to the users mail. 3.1 Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT) Message queuing telemetry transport is a feather weight ISO standard
    publisher-subscriber messaging protocol specially designed for the internet of
    things. Internet of Things is creating the massive machine to machine network
    so that all of the devices like sensors, systems and also the actuators can connect
    to and communicate on the internet and with they need a communications protocol
    so that they can understand each other one of those protocols is message queuing
    telemetry transport. Message queuing telemetry transport is a TCP/IP protocol
    based on subscribe and publish messaging protocol designed for light weight machine-to-machine
    communications. MQTT has built the QoS to deliver the message. QoS 0: Once in
    a time “fire and forget,” if the device is online, it sends the message, and it
    gets delivered or if the device is offline it can’t be delivered it will be thrown
    away. QoS 1: Atleast once. QoS 2: Exactly once, 2 phase commit. Both the QoS 1
    and QoS 2 have the effectively guaranteed delivery, while the QoS 2 uses the two
    phase summit guaranteeing exactly once delivery and also it can give the end-to-end
    protocol level but not within the stacks on each side of the connection these
    QoS 1 and QoS 2 are queued for clients when the user is also online but have no
    timed out. To work the message queuing telemetry transport, it has three stages
    they are called as the message queuing broker. It is like a gateway receiver or
    server and allows the clients to send and also to receive the short messages from
    the broker only if they have subscribed to any topic like weather, temperature
    and also the humidity. Here in the below diagram, the client A is the publisher
    and the remaining client B and C are the subscribers whom receives the information
    which is sent by the sensor known as the client A. And also, these two B and C
    clients subscribe to the particular topic and gets published to the broker all
    the three will have the TCP connection with the broker as in Fig. 5. The sensor
    or the publisher which is called as the client A updates the topic and publishes
    the information about the topic to the MQ broker. These clients have subscribed
    to the topic so when the new piece of information gets published to the topic
    they then get the information from the MQ broker. Fig. 5 Message queuing telemetry
    transport Full size image 3.2 Sensor/Publisher The publisher has the information
    about the topic, and also this publisher has the data about the topic which the
    subscribers have been subscribed earlier. It is connected to the broker via TCP
    connections on all the sides whenever the new data comes, it will be sent to the
    broker. And also the publishers and also the subscribers are not connected directly
    through the TCP/IP connection. And this MQTT publishers allow username and password
    for the authentication and these clients can directly log on via password. These
    passwords are sent by the MQTT via the plain text or in encrypted form. If no
    data was sent, then the publisher will be in the off mode. The subscriber receives
    the filtered messages every message is being filtered by the broker which is the
    middle of the publisher and it also knows that who will send the message and also
    who will receive the message. The subscriber is the application based. The broker
    filter the messages based on the subject and the content based and also the type
    based filtering by the broker. A user can also subscribe to the one topics or
    more topics. When subscribed to the one or more than one topics two characters
    can be used. MQTT supports disconnect and last will and testament messages in
    this they are two types: namely hash character—multi-level wildcard and plus character—single-level
    wildcard MQTT. Clients which disconnect intentionally use disconnect message as
    in Fig. 6. MQTT broker will automatically publish last will and the testament
    messages on the behalf of the clients with unintentionally terminated messages.
    It also supports the retained messages which are automatically delivered when
    a client subscribes to the topic. Fig. 6 Block diagram of MQTT subscriber/client
    Full size image The topics which we select in the MQTT are similar to the files
    in a system using the forward slash(/). In message queuing telemetry transport,
    there is no formal structure to select the topic and a publisher is free to choose,
    it’s own topic names and also the structure but it should consists atleast on
    character to be valid. There is no topics created by the broker. All topics are
    created by a subscriber and also the publisher client, are not permanent. A topic
    only exists only if a subscriber has already subscribed to it before only or a
    broker has restore the last messages stored for that topic. This is the example
    for that E.g.: School/Room/Sensor. 4 Hardware Description Raspberry pi 3 begins
    as a toy computer and ends up being a real desktop PC having an upgraded ARMv7
    multicore processor and gigabytes RAM. In general, Raspberry pi has mode B and
    B+, mode A and A+, Pi zero. This Raspberry pi mode B and B+ are the simplest and
    cheapest but B+ has a bit more improved design of embedded applications. Raspberry
    pi zero has input or output, general purpose input or output (GPIO) and Bluetooth
    capability. They mostly operate at a frequency of 800–1000 MHz, in extreme case
    they can be operated upto 1500 MHz. In this model neither USB nor ethernet ports
    are changed. GPIO are the general purpose input and output pins which are used
    to turn off and to turn the devices like LED which will be present in the Raspberry
    pi. These pins allow you to connect and also to talk to the hardware modules that
    supports the protocol. UART is the universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter.
    It receives several bytes of the data from the GPIO pins but it transmits only
    bits of the data in the sequential order. In the asynchronous transmission of
    the data, it allows the bits to be sent or transmit without the sender but it
    will send the signal like the clock signal to the receiver side. UART can be used
    between the two devices only like simplex means data transmitted on one side only
    and also the half duplex in which the data can be transmitted in the either direction
    or the Full duplex. MPC3008 is a high performed and low power 10-bit analog-to-digital
    converter (ADC). In general to know the hotness as well as the coldness of an
    object, temperature sensor is used. In this LM 35 temperature sensor, the output
    is almost equal to the temperature. It doesn’t require any amplified output rather
    provides higher output than thermocouples. It is sometimes used as a power supply,
    battery, etc. To measure the amount of water in the soil moisture sensor is used.
    Indirectly either by using electrical resistance or neutron interactions water
    volume is measured. Light dependent resistor (LDR) is a variable light control
    resistor. As the light intensity increases, the resistance of LDR decreases. It
    can be used in circuits with light and dark activation switching and also in some
    light sensitive devices. 5 Results Figure 7 shows that the sensor parameters and
    also the weather conditions like temperature, moisture, humidity and also amount
    of light which is receiving. It compares the data log with the already existing
    weather reporting conditions. It also finds whether there is any possibility of
    the rainfall then it will intimates to the user through the registered mail. It
    will also predict the parameters like thunder storms, etc., as in Fig. 7. Fig.
    7 Message queuing telemetry transport conversation/data log Full size image These
    sensor values are being sent to the clients using the cloud and MQTT protocol.
    These parameters can be checked by the client through the registered mail. 6 Conclusion
    In this system, the irrigation system becomes more simple and easy with the quick
    transmission of the weather parameters by using the MQTT protocol and sending
    this data through cloud to the cloud who has been subscribed. The main advantage
    of using these protocol is when the client is not available then the parameters
    will be sent through the mail. When the client is available with the network then
    he can able to see the data parameters and also he can compare the present data
    with the existing data which has been already sent. So that the farmer will be
    able to know the changes in the atmosphere every day. This can also be implemented
    by using the computer-based algorithm and also the data can be processed without
    any further complexity. With the other specifications, sensors are used to make
    the process better. References J. Gutiérrez, J.F. Villa-Medina, A. Nieto-Garibay,

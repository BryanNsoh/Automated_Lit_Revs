    Dimensioning of Wide-Area Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) System for IoT-Based
    Automation. Sensors, 21(18), 6040.
  data_sources: Sensor data such as water level, gas emissions (CH4), temperature,
    pressure, and humidity; Pipe and pump health parameters such as pipe pressure,
    flow rate of water in pipes, and pump electric power
  explanation: 'The proposed automated system uses a WSN consisting of sensors and
    actuators that are integrated with an IoT network to monitor and control the AWD
    irrigation system over a wide area.


    The sensors in the WSN collect field parameters such as water level, gas emissions
    (CH4), temperature, pressure, and humidity, which are then transmitted at 15-minute
    intervals. Another WSN monitors the pipe and pump health parameters, such as pipe
    pressure, flow rate of water in pipes, and pump electric power, and generates
    alarms to shut down the pump in emergency situations. The actuator network operates
    the actuators of the pipe to control the water flow through the pipe and is updated
    every 15 minutes.


    The data transmission from the sensors is controlled by a base station, which
    initiates data request messages to a specific sensor using their unique ID and
    sends an acknowledgement after successful reception of the sensor data. For the
    actuator node, the base station sends the actuator control messages to the actuator
    node, and updates the actuator nodes in the server database after receiving the
    data and from the actuator node. All of these communications between the WSN and
    the base station are performed using LoRa with messages transferred as LoRa packets.
    The base station processes the LoRa data packets and sends them to the IoT server
    as MQTT messages. The commands used to control the pumps and actuators, sent from
    the IoT server, also use MQTT.


    On the user side, a smartphone app and web interface are connected with the IoT
    server through a cloud-implemented MQTT-HTTP gateway. All of the data communication
    and AWD automation processes are performed by the sensor, base station, and cloud
    IoT server.


    The proposed automation algorithm for the sensor node is designed for the field
    trial and used to monitor field, pipe, and pump sensors to continuously monitor
    their condition. The actuator node algorithm is intended for wide-area AWD automation
    and takes all necessary actions according to certain pump operating conditions
    and control logic defined by the user during the initialization phase. The AWD
    automation control logic performed by the IoT server ascertains the irrigation
    phase (TPF or AWD) and makes phase-specific decisions, such as monitoring the
    surface water level (SWL) in terms of TPF and checking the below-surface water
    level (BSWL) for AWD to determine whether to toggle the actuators and pumps on
    or off. After toggling the actuators and pumps, the SWL is measured for both TPF
    and AWD, and then, if the SWL reaches 5 cm above the surface, the actuators and
    pumps are switched off.'
  extract_1: '"This paper presents an approach to automating a wide-area AWD system
    covering a total irrigation area of 25,000 acres. Implementation of AWD in such
    a large irrigation area has not been reported in the existing literature. It is
    imperative that such a large system uses automation instead of the traditional
    manual operation and monitoring approach. The automation can be achieved by integrating
    three essential and intricate wireless sensor networks (WSN): a mechanical subsystem
    comprised of pumps, actuator networks, and a water distribution network, and an
    IoT system that runs the automation algorithm and issues control commands. The
    data from the WSN, along with other operating parameters, are processed at a central
    server that decides whether to activate the pumps and the actuator valves. The
    system is scalable and the algorithm can be adjusted for irrigation areas with
    different sizes within a practical limit. The required set of equations to support
    the design and operation of the overall system is provided in this paper. The
    hardware for the system is presented and described in order to facilitate the
    implementation of the automation system. The communication protocol and automation
    algorithm have also been presented in sufficient detail. A sample study on a small-scale
    field trial is presented as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the effectiveness
    of the proposed system. An analysis of the proposed system''s expected performance
    is discussed by comparing it with manual and automated AWD systems in the existing
    literature. The analysis highlights the large irrigation area and the complete
    automation aspect of the proposed system."'

    area adoption [25] is feasible and economically viable. The proposed wide-area
    AWD system allows for continuous monitoring and real-time decision making along
    with a fair distribution of water amongst the farmers. The authors are optimistic
    that, with the adoption of the proposed system, wide area AWD will be implemented

  explanation: 'This paper presents an energy-efficient and secure IoT-based WSN framework
    for the monitoring and production of agricultural land. The proposed framework
    aims to optimize network lifetime with stable routing and data delivery performance.
    The framework incorporates several key approaches: (1) it selects suitable cluster
    heads based on a multi-criteria decision function that considers residual energy,
    distance to the base station, and signal-to-noise ratio; (2) it establishes a
    single-hop transmission mechanism to reduce network bottlenecks and latency; and
    (3) it implements a secure data transmission mechanism based on secret keys generated
    using the recurrence of the linear congruential equation to ensure data integrity
    and confidentiality. The paper evaluates the proposed framework through simulations
    and compares its performance with existing solutions. The results demonstrate
    that the proposed framework significantly improves network throughput, reduces
    packet drop ratio and network latency, and optimizes energy consumption while
    maintaining a secure and reliable data transmission channel.'

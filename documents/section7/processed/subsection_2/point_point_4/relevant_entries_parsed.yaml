  explanation: 'The study entitled "IRRISENS: An IoT Platform Based on Microservices
    Applied in Commercial-Scale Crops Working in a Multi-Cloud Environment" evaluates
    an IoT platform for monitoring soil, crop, and atmospheric parameters in commercial-scale
    agriculture. The platform utilizes microservices for data sensing, cloud interaction,
    irrigation planning, scheduling, and control. The main objective of the study
    was to identify the requirements and assess the performance of an IoT platform
    in a real-world commercial farming scenario.'
  extract_1: '"The proposed IoT platform was evaluated during one growing season at
    four commercial scale farms on two different broadacre irrigated crops with very
    different water management requirements (rice and cotton)."'
  extract_2: '"The results showed that the microservice approach followed in the platform
    is robust against both intermittent and critical failures in the field that could
    occur in any of the monitored sites. Further, processing or storage overload caused
    for any reason at one farm did not affect the performance of the platform regarding
    the other monitored farms."'
  inline_citation: (Maia et al., 2020)
  key_findings: The study found that the IRRISENS platform is scalable, flexible,
    heterogeneous, robust to failure, and secure. The platform was able to handle
    intermittent and critical failures in the field, and it was not affected by processing
    or storage overload at one farm. The microservice approach allowed the platform
    to address the data heterogeneity issue when monitoring crops with different management
    requirements.

    (two), so the findings may not be generalizable to all commercial farming scenarios.
    The authors also acknowledge that the platform has not been tested in extreme
    weather conditions or with a large number of sensors and cameras.
  main_objective: The main objective of the study was to evaluate the performance
    and requirements of an IoT platform for monitoring soil, crop, and atmospheric
    parameters in commercial-scale agriculture.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper is highly relevant to the specific point under focus,
    which is transmitting sensor and camera data to cloud-based platforms using protocols
    like MQTT, CoAP, or AMQP. The study describes the implementation of the IRRISENS
    platform, which uses MQTT to transmit data from sensors and cameras to cloud-based
    platforms like AWS IoT, Google Cloud IoT, and Microsoft Azure IoT. The authors
    discuss the benefits of using microservices for data sensing and cloud interaction,

    model for smart irrigation system. Journal of Intelligent Systems, 31(6), 632–650.
  data_sources: Environmental parameters and weather forecasts
  explanation: This paper aims to help with the efficient irrigation management of
    an agricultural system. It explores a model for predicting soil moisture in real
    time that will enable more precise irrigation, thereby saving water and other
    valuable resources. The model is designed for an edge computing framework, which
    will enable on-the-fly analysis of IoT sensor data without having to upload everything
    to a cloud system, reducing latency and costs. Moreover, the model can be deployed
    to edge nodes, which are small, low-power devices placed close to the sensors
    in the field, enabling real-time decision-making based on highly up-to-date data.
  extract_1: '-Soil moisture prediction hybrid algorithm (SMPHA) has been developed
    that revolves around the

    decision-making techniques with live environmental parameters including weather
    parameters for the

    prediction of soil moisture through the impact of precipitation.'

    are estimated, and it is inferred

    that XGBoost + k-means outperforms other algorithmic combinations that is deployed
    in edge model.'
  inline_citation: (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022)
  key_findings: '1) The proposed model can efficiently predict soil moisture in real
    time using edge computing.

    2) The model can be deployed on low-power edge devices, enabling real-time decision-making
    based on highly up-to-date data.'
  limitations: '1) Data is transferred over the network to an edge computing device
    and then to a cloud platform

    for processing, which may introduce latency and reliability concerns, especially
    in areas with

    unreliable network connectivity.

    2) The system relies on sensors to collect data, which may be prone to noise and
    other inaccuracies.'
  main_objective: To present a novel approach to edge-based irrigation system to facilitate
    decision-making on watering the plants on scheduled time.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper is highly relevant to the point in this literature
    review addressing transmitting data to cloud-based platforms for remote data analysis.
    The model presented in the paper not only addresses this point directly, but is
    also designed to do so in a very efficient manner using edge computing. While
    cloud-based systems are often preferred for their theoretically near-unlimited
    storage and compute capacity, these benefits are often outweighed by latency and
    cost concerns, especially when dealing with large data volumes and real-time demands.
    The edge computing approach used in this paper is an elegant and parsimonious
    solution to this problem.

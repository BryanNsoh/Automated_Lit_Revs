    network algorithm for soil moisture prediction from sentinel-1 SAR images. Remote
    Sensing, 13(24), 4964.
  explanation: 'Remote sensing using Sentinel-1 images is a promising method for soil
    moisture monitoring. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are powerful machine
    learning tools that have been successfully applied to image analysis. In this
    study, the authors propose a CNN architecture for predicting soil moisture content
    over agricultural areas from Sentinel-1 images. The CNN architecture uses dual-polarization
    Sentinel-1 images (VV and VH) as input and is trained using in-situ soil moisture
    measurements from the OZNET and WEGENERNET soil moisture monitoring networks.


    The authors found that their proposed CNN architecture outperforms other methods
    for predicting soil moisture from Sentinel-1 images. The CNN architecture achieves
    a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.8664, a mean absolute error (MAE) of
    0.0144, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0274. The authors also found
    that VV polarization is more sensitive than VH polarization for soil moisture
    retrieval, and that the combination of VV and VH polarization improves the prediction
    accuracy.


    This study demonstrates the potential of CNNs for soil moisture retrieval from
    Sentinel-1 images. The proposed CNN architecture can be used to generate high-resolution
    soil moisture maps over large areas, which can be valuable for a wide range of
    applications, such as precision agriculture, water resource management, and drought
    monitoring.'

    IoT based smart farming system is built for monitoring soil nutrients and soil
    moisture using sensors. ML algorithms are explored for determining the optimum
    amount of fertilizers required for soils before the sowing of crops. Drones are
    revolutionizing the agriculture industry. These drones are cameras enabled and
    are used for different applications such as field and crop monitoring, spraying
    of pesticides, and drip irrigation.'

    of farmers. Drip irrigation using drones is an efficient AI-empowered irrigation
    system which is basically trained on weather pattern and can effectively reduce

    crops at a much faster pace and in large volumes. Robots can reduce human labour
    to a large extent and can be used along with drones for monitoring the field.
    Livestock management is another major concern for farmers. IoT based sensors can
    be deployed in the field for health monitoring of cattle. This information can
    be utilized for protecting the bunch of cattle from diseased cattle. NLP based
    virtual assistant applications like chatbots can update the farmers with the latest
    advancement in technologies for agriculture. Farmers can finds solutions for their
    problems and incorporate the latest technology in their farming for improving
    their field productivity.

- explanation: The study focuses on integrating various automated systems in real-time
    irrigation management. It proposes a system that combines the advantages of different
    sensors, data fusion techniques, and methodologies while emphasizing interoperability
    and standardization. The integrated system has the potential to enhance irrigation
    efficiency and crop productivity by continuously monitoring and adjusting to changing
    environmental conditions.
  extract_1: A major hurdle in the practical implementation of data integration is
    that this requires a complex system architecture to handle the various types of
    data from heterogenous sources, and to unify and process them in one place. It
    requires an efficient (wireless) communication system that prevents data collision
    (which results in data loss) and also prevents transmissions of redundant data
    (Firner et al., 2010, Khaleghi et al., 2013). The use of Internet of Things (IoT)
    technologies supports data management by connecting sensors, controllers, operators
    and objects to communication technologies such as local networks or the internet
    to form an information-based, automatic, and intelligent network (Zhang et al.,
    2021). This provides the opportunity to remotely handle and integrate data from
    multiple sources through data fusion (Zhang et al., 2021).
  extract_2: IoT technology is a central component of “smart farming”, which uses
    cloud-based platforms to analyse data from multiple sources and provide decision
    support (Akbar et al., 2020, Fountas et al., 2020). The main components of data
    processing in smart farming are data collection, data preparation, data processing,
    decision making and the provision of services to the end user (Amiri-Zarandi et
    al., 2022).

  relevance_evaluation: This paper presents a detailed overview of the current state
    and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management
    systems, specifically focusing on how automated, real-time irrigation management
    systems can contribute to the efficient use of water resources and enhance agricultural
    productivity. While the review intention does not explicitly mention sewer pipe
    defect detection, it is reasonable to assume that sewer pipe defect detection
    could play a role in optimizing irrigation management systems by ensuring the
    efficient delivery of water to crops and reducing water loss due to leaks or other
    defects in the pipes. Overall, this paper provides a valuable overview of the
    current state and future potential of real-time, automated irrigation management
    systems and their potential benefits for agricultural productivity and water resource

- explanation: 'The authors first develop a computer vision and cyber-physical system-based
    data collection process for mapping truck weights to real-time bridge response
    data with the aim of supporting the real-time assessment of bridge health condition.
    They develop a method for identifying and tracking trucks as they traverse a highway
    segment using traffic camera data, leveraging a YOLOv3-based object detector to
    detect trucks and comparing the most significant bounding box of the detector’s
    prediction with a set of lane boundaries. Trucks are tracked through space and
    time allowing them to link data collected at different sensor locations as a truck
    moves down the highway, effectively enabling the calculation of an input-output
    relationship between truck weights and the bridges’ response. They find that the
    trigger-based data collection strategy significantly outperforms the use of a
    schedule-based approach, leading to a 24.5% increase in data collection efficiency
    and conclusion that the majority of trucks observed in the corridor are captured
    under the new protocol.


    The authors connect the data collected through the computer vision and cyber-physical
    system to a series of models that analyze the data to determine the usefulness
    of the proposed approach. They present three major contributions using the data
    collected: 1) a demonstration of a correlation between the maximum strain response
    measured by bridge sensors and the corresponding gross weight of the trucks responsible
    for generating the strain; 2) a demonstration of a correlation between the maximum
    strain responses measured by two different bridges to the same truck loads; and
    3) a demonstration of the effectiveness of the computer vision and cyber-physical
    system approach for automatically identifying trucks on traffic images with an
    AP0.5 = 96.65% average precision. The authors conclude the approach is highly
    scalable, has proven abilities to automate the identification of trucks, map their

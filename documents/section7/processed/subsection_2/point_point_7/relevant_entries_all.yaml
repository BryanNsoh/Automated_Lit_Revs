  description: Leaf Area of Index (LAI) refers to half of the total leaf area of all
    crops per unit area. It is an important index to represent the photosynthetic
    capacity and biomass of crops. To obtain LAI conditions of summer maize in different
    growth stages quickly and accurately, further guiding field fertilization and
    irrigation. The Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) multispectral data, growing degree
    days, and canopy height model of 2020-2021 summer maize were used to carry out
    LAI inversion. The vegetation index was constructed by the ground hyperspectral
    data and multispectral data of the same range of bands. The correlation analysis
    was conducted to verify the accuracy of the multispectral data. To include many
    bands as possible, four vegetation indices which included R, G, B, and NIR bands
    were selected in this study to test the spectral accuracy. There were nine vegetation
    indices calculated with UAV multispectral data which were based on the red band
    and the near-infrared band. Through correlation analysis of LAI and the vegetation
    index, vegetation indices with a higher correlation to LAI were selected to construct
    the LAI inversion model. In addition, the Canopy Height Model (CHM) and Growing
    degree days (GDD) of summer maize were also calculated to build the LAI inversion
    model. The LAI inversion of summer maize was carried out based on multi-growth
    stages by using the general linear regression model (GLR), Multivariate nonlinear
    regression model (MNR), and the partial least squares regression (PLSR) models.
    R² and RMSE were used to assess the accuracy of the model. The results show that
    the correlation between UAV multispectral data and hyperspectral data was greater
    than 0.64, which was significant. The Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI),
    Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), Plant
    Biochemical Index (PBI), Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI), CHM
    and GDD have a higher correlation with LAI. By comparing the models constructed
    by the three methods, it was found that the PLSR has the best inversion effect.
    It was based on OSAVI, GDD, RVI, PBI, CHM, NDVI, and WDRVI, with the training
    model’s R² being 0.866 3, the testing model’s R² being 0.710 2, RMSE was 1.1755.
    This study showed that the LAI inversion model based on UAV multispectral vegetation
    index, GDD, and CHM improves the accuracy of LAI inversion effectively. That means
    the growing degree days and crop population structure change have influenced the
    change of maize LAI certainly, and this method can provide decision support for
    maize growth monitoring and field fertilization.

  description: Information on crop yield is important for food security, in particular
    under the conditions of climate change and growing population worldwide. We developed
    a new fully distributed, high spatial resolution, model of biomass accumulation
    and crop yield applicable to a highly heterogeneous desert-oasis agroecosystem.
    The bulk of required input data is obtained by retrieving pixel-wise biogeophysical
    variables from a suite of very diverse satellite data. Both temperature and water
    stress conditions at field-scale are given full consideration, while the model
    was designed to strike a balance between model applicability and satisfactory
    characterization of the heterogeneous desert-oasis system to estimate field-scale
    yield. The development of this model relies on three main innovations. First,
    the start and end of the growing season were estimated for each pixel by calibrating
    the high spatial and temporal resolution observations of Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI) by Sentinal-2 (S2) MSI (Multi-Spectral Instrument) against
    limited local phenological information. Second, to monitor crop water stress,
    account taken of irrigation, a process-based water and energy balance model was
    applied to estimate the actual evapotranspiration (ET). This requires knowledge
    of soil water availability, which is characterized by downscaling the ASCAT (Advanced
    SCATterrometer) soil moisture data product. To capture the dominant features of
    the eco-hydrological conditions in the desert and oasis agroecosystem, ET was
    further downscaled from the 1 km resolution. Third, likewise the water stress
    indicator, the air temperature stress indicator was mapped after characterizing
    the thermal contrast and heterogeneity of the desert-oasis system, by generating
    time series of air temperature at 1 km spatial resolution using the MODIS (Moderate
    Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Land Surface Temperature (LST) data product.
    In the temporal dimension, gaps were mitigated by applying time series analysis
    techniques to reconstruct cloud-free time series of LST, NDVI, fAPAR and albedo.
    These innovations add up to a high resolution characterization of crop response
    to the geospatial variability of weather and climate forcing in the desert-oasis
    agroecosystem. The model was applied to the dominant crops, i.e., spring wheat,
    maize, sunflower, and melon, in the oases of the Shiyang River Basin (northwestern
    China) characterized by a rather fragmented land use. The high resolution of pixel-wise
    ecohydrological parameters, i.e., crop phenology, temperature stress and water
    stress factors successfully reflect differences of crops with different phenology
    and location in the oases. The relative errors for wheat and maize yields compared
    to the census data are less than 5% at district level. At the county level, the
    relative errors of wheat yields of Liangzhou, Minqin, Gulang, Jinchuan, and Yongchang
    equal to 0.87%, 24.2%, 9.7%, 12.5%, and 7.2%. For maize, the dominant crop, the
    error on estimated yields was less than 5%, except in Gulang. The relative error
    on estimated yield for sunflower was less than 10% compared to agricultural census
    data. The relative error on estimated melon yield was 16%. This performance highlights
    the applicability of the model to estimate field-scale yields in agroecosystems
    characterized by fragmented land use.

    of biomass and yield. The model was applied in the Shiyang River Basin (SRB),
    China, and validation was conducted based on the census data and field observations.
    The model achieved satisfactory accuracy in estimating crop yield and could be
    valuable for supporting monitoring of agroecosystem services towards water and

    yields of Liangzhou, Minqin, Gulang, Jinchuan, and Yongchang equal to 0.87%, 24.2%,
    9.7%, 12.5%, and 7.2%. For maize, the dominant crop, the error on estimated yields
    was less than 5%, except in Gulang. The relative error on estimated yield for
    sunflower was less than 10% compared to agricultural census data. The relative
    error on estimated melon yield was 16%. This performance highlights the applicability
    of the model to estimate field-scale yields in agroecosystems characterized by
    fragmented land use. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    agroecosystem 1. Introduction The growing world population applies tremendous
    pressure on agriculture production and natural environmental resources, especially
    in developing regions. The global population is expected to reach 9.8 billions
    by 2050 (UNDESA, 2017). To meet the demands of population growth and the projected
    changes in dietary patterns in the future, global food production must increase
    by 70%−100% (Wart et al., 2013). Therefore, given such a dramatic requirement,
    both expansion of cultivated land and increased agricultural intensity will be
    needed, with further impact on the natural environment. The changing climate intensifies
    the risks of droughts and floods, which pose a significant threat to food production.
    Information on crop yield under limiting environmental conditions, such as due
    to water availability and quality, is therefore important for food security and
    environmental studies under the conditions of climate change and fast-growing
    population. Modeling is a vital tool to obtain crop yield information at regional
    and global scales, especially because it allows to assess the expected performance
    of agroecosystems under changing climate and crop management conditions. The dynamic
    crop growth models, e.g., DSSAT (Decision-Support System for Agro-technology Transfer),
    WOFOST (WOrld FOod STudies), APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator),
    and AquaCrop (FAO crop growth model) (Hijmans et al., 1994; Jones et al., 2003;
    Steduto et al., 2008; Holzworth et al., 2014), built upon crop biophysical processes,
    usually can achieve high accuracy in reproducing field-scale crop development
    and estimate yield, provided model parameters can be estimated accurately. To
    describe a specific crop or variety, these models require a detailed set of plant
    parameters to model e.g., phenology, assimilation, and partitioning of assimilates,
    which typically must be based on field trials on the crop or variety of interest.
    Applications at the regional/global scale, however, are hampered by the limited
    availability of a wide range of agronomic input data needed by such models and
    uncertainties are also associated with the parameterization of biogeochemical
    processes. Literature documents advances in blending satellite remote sensing
    data with dynamic crop growth models by e.g., data assimilation to improve the
    regional performance (de Wit and van Diepen, 2007; Jin et al., 2018; Huang et
    al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019). However, data assimilation is usually designed for
    only one or two state variables, e.g., soil moisture, leaf area index or Land
    Surface Temperature (LST), and uncertainty remains significant. In addition, when
    applied to regions with fragmented land uses and complex cropping patterns, a
    high spatial resolution model configuration is needed, which requires large computing
    resources. Various satellite remote sensing observations can provide information
    reflecting the spatial and temporal features in the crop pattern and conditions,
    e.g., crop type, crop phenology and health condition. An alternative way is using
    a remote-sensing-data-driven model yet with a robust bio-physical basis. In these
    models, biomass accumulation is estimated by applying the Light Use Efficiency
    (LUE) concept, according to Monteith (1972), through the crop growing season,
    while parameterizations are applied to estimate crop yield from biomass. LUE is
    defined as the biomass produced by photosynthesis per unit of absorbed radiant
    energy. The LUE-based method combines the solar Photosynthetically Active Radiation
    (PAR), the intercepted fraction of PAR (fAPAR: the fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically
    Active Radiation by vegetation) and the PAR utilization efficiency to determine
    the daily biomass accumulation. In theory, the LUE-based method is consistent
    with detailed biophysical models of photosynthesis under the reasonable hypothesis
    that multiple biochemical processes combine to determine optimal photosynthesis
    (Haxeltine and Prentice, 1996). In practice, the actual PAR utilization efficiency
    in the LUE-based models is expressed as the product of an optimal LUE with a number
    of stress factors. The main difference in the LUE-based models is the definition
    and estimation of the parameters being used to down-regulate the optimal biomass
    accumulation rate to the actual rate, since the bio-geochemical controls on LUE
    are still poorly understood. For example, the CASA (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach)
    (Potter et al., 1993) takes into account the variation of LUE with seasons and
    biomes. Field et al. (1995) further improved the LUE-based modeling by considering
    limitations due to temperature and water deficit. The GLO-PEM2 (GLObal Production
    Efficiency Model) and MODIS-PsN (MODIS - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer,
    Daily Photosynthesis) adopted Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) to express the water
    stress (Goetz et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 2005). LUE-based models have been implemented
    as a core element of systems for large area monitoring of biomass and crop yield
    estimations taking advantage of remote sensing data (Gower et al., 1999; Veroustraete
    et al., 2002; Bastiaanssen and Ali, 2003; Zwart et al., 2010; Teixeira et al.,
    2013). Such systems are also being operated in an operational context, such as
    in the MARSOP (Monitoring Agriculture through Remote Sensing techniques) system
    (http://www.marsop.info) and in the Global Land component of the GMES (Global
    Monitoring for Environment and Security) Initial Operations (GIO-GL) (Van Hools
    and Eerens, 2015). Notwithstanding these successful experiences, challenges still
    exist and were addressed in this study. In a highly heterogenous desert-oasis
    agroecosystem with fragmented land uses and complex crop patterns, crop conditions
    must be characterized as a spatial resolution adequate to capture both the heterogeneity
    within the oases and the contrast with the surrounding desert area. Hydrological
    conditions must be monitored at a spatial resolution consistent with such variability
    to understand the crop response to weather and climate forcing. Specifically,
    this applies to crop phenology and related biophysical variables, to soil water
    availability and to thermal conditions. On the other hand, in practice, the retrieval
    of information on hydrological conditions and surface temperature obtained from
    infrared and microwave observations is frequently hampered by low spatial resolution.
    Besides, optical and thermal remote sensing observations are often contaminated
    by weather conditions, with considerable impacts on the estimation of fAPAR, NDVI,
    albedo, and land surface temperature (LST). Time series reconstruction is therefore
    needed to obtain gap-free essential variables to estimate crop biomass accumulation
    at high temporal resolution. The innovations we deployed to address these challenges
    add up to a high resolution model characterizing the crop response to the geospatial
    variability of weather and climate forcing in the desert-oasis agroecosystem.
    The development of this model relies on three main innovations. First, the start
    and end of the growing season were estimated for each pixel by calibrating the
    high spatial and temporal resolution observations of NDVI by Sentinal-2 (S2) MSI
    (Multi-Spectral Instrument) against limited local phenological information. The
    high temporal frequency of S2 / MSI makes it possible to retrieve directly the
    temporal evolution of relevant biophysical variables related to crop phenology
    without using an approximate method such as the application of temperature sums.
    Second, to monitor crop water stress, account taken of irrigation, we use a process-based
    water and energy balance model, ETMonitor (Hu and Jia, 2015; Cui and Jia, 2021;
    Zheng et al., 2022), to estimate the actual evapotranspiration (ET), which requires
    knowledge of soil water availability, monitored by using satellite observations
    of soil moisture. To mitigate the gap in spatial resolution with the field-scale
    information on crop conditions, soil moisture was estimated using the ASCAT (Advanced
    SCATterrometer) soil moisture data downscaled to MODIS LST resolution. The relationship
    between the downscaled soil moisture and the predictors, i.e., LST, NDVI, albedo,
    DEM (Digital Elevation Model), and location, was constructed using a machine learning
    model. To capture the dominant features of the eco-hydrological conditions in
    the desert and oasis agroecosystem, the ET was further downscaled from the 1 km
    resolution. Third, likewise the water stress indicator, the air temperature stress
    indicator was mapped after characterizing the thermal contrast and heterogeneity
    of the desert-oasis system, by generating time series of air temperature at 1
    km spatial resolution using the MODIS LST data product. In the temporal dimension,
    gaps were mitigated by applying time series analysis techniques to reconstruct
    cloud-free time series of LST, NDVI, and albedo. 2. Study area and data 2.1. Study
    area The Shiyang River Basin (SRB) is one of the three inner drainage river basins
    in Hexi Corridor, northwestern China, located between 101°41′E and 104°16′E, 36°26′N
    and 39°27′N (Fig. 1). It originates from the cold and semi-arid Qilian Mountains
    in the south and ends in the temperate and arid desert-oasis region in the north,
    occupying an area of 41,600 km2. The SRB covers the main areas of Liangzhou, Minqin,
    Jinchang, Yongchang, and Gulang Counties. The river water supply primarily comes
    from rainfall and glacier and snow melting in the Qilian mountain area. Download

    map of the SRB (a), landcover (b) and crop classification (c); examples of full
    10 m resolution crop maps (d) and (e). The oases in the SRB play a vital role
    in the water and food security of northwestern China. The growing season is April
    to October. The annual precipitation in the agricultural area varies from 100
    to 300 mm, while the potential ET is 1200 to 2000 mm (Wang et al., 2012). Thus,
    local agriculture heavily relies on irrigation. To keep the pace with the local
    economic development, the water and land resources have been over-exploited mainly
    for agriculture, which induced a severe ecosystem crisis. Water conflicts arose
    between ecosystem preservation and agriculture and between different sub-regions
    (Li et al., 2007; Xue et al., 2015). The agricultural area of the SRB is characterized
    by fragmented land use and complex cropping pattern (Xue et al., 2015). The dominant
    food crops are spring wheat and maize, and local high-value crops are sunflower
    and melon. Crop yield and ET estimates can provide meaningful spatial and temporal
    information for a comprehensive understanding of the water productivity of the
    region and support effective decision-making. 2.2. Remote sensing data The remote
    sensing data applied in this study (Table 1) include the S2 / MSI surface reflectance
    (SR) data products, MODIS land surface products of LST, NDVI, and albedo, ASCAT
    surface soil moisture saturation products, SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission)
    DEM, and a predefined crop classification map. Table 1. Remote sensing dataset
    used in this study. Variables Products Temporal resolution Spatial resolution

    in 2015 by ESA (European Space Agency) to service wide-swath, high spatial and
    temporal resolution, and multi-spectral land monitoring. The MSI can provide observations
    with 10 m spatial resolution in four spectral bands, i.e., the three classical
    RGB bands and a Near Infra-Red (NIR) band. The S2 system is designed for global
    crop growth monitoring with a 5-day revisiting interval. In this study, we specifically
    adopted the S2 / MSI level-2 Bottom Of Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance data product
    (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/) in Band 4 (Red band, with central wavelength ∼665
    nm) and Band 8 (Near Infrared band, with central wavelength ∼833 nm) to estimate
    NDVI and fAPAR during the growing season of 2019 in the study area. The MODIS
    land surface products (http://lpdaac.usgs.gov/), including MOD11A1 (Land Surface
    Temperature), MOD13A2 (NDVI), and MCD43A3 (albedo) in 2019 were selected for air
    temperature and ET estimation. The MCD43A3 data were resampled to 1 km by linear
    interpolation to match the other MODIS data products before further processing.
    The daily ASCAT dataset (https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/swi) of surface
    soil moisture saturation at 0.1° was also used as input to the ET estimation model,
    i.e., ETMonitor. When applying the ETMonitor model, the 0.1° ASCAT dataset was
    first downscaled and projected to the same spatial resolution of 1 km MODIS data
    (see Sect. 3.5). A 10 m crop classification map for 2019 (Fig. 1) was generated
    by applying a machine learning method to the multi-spectral and multi-temporal
    S2 / MSI surface reflectance data. The validation based on ground observations
    shows that the overall classification accuracy is 90% (Yi et al., 2020). 2.3.
    Reanalysis meteorological data The gridded daily meteorological data required
    to estimate ET and Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (APAR) conditions,
    i.e., surface pressure, wind speed, relative humidity, precipitation, downward
    shortwave radiation, and downward longwave radiation, were extracted from the
    ERA5 reanalysis dataset (http://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/) of ECMWF (European Centre
    for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts). The ERA5 dataset has an original spatial
    resolution of 0.25° and was downscaled to 1 km using SRTM DEM (Stahl et al., 2006;
    Gao and Giorgi, 2008; Hu and Jia, 2015). 2.4. Ground measurements To estimate
    the temperature stress factors regulating the biomass accumulation, we used the
    daily mean air temperature measured at three meteorological ground stations (Table
    2) in the oasis. The data collected in the period from March to November 2019,
    covering the main growing season of Shiyang river basin, were applied to parameterize
    the relationship between LST and the mean daily air temperature. The locations
    of ground sites are shown in Fig. 1c. Table 2. Meteorological ground stations

    is officially reported in the Gansu Development Yearbook 2020 (Gansu Development
    Yearbook Editorial Committee, 2021). 3. Methods Model overview. In the proposed
    model to estimate crop biomass accumulation, both temperature and water limitations
    were given full consideration to adjust the optimal crop growth rate to the actual
    rate. The timely and spatially detailed biophysical information needed to model
    biomass accumulation and yield formation, i.e., crop type, phenological development,
    APAR, air temperature stress, and water stress was retrieved by addressing the
    challenges identified in the Introduction. To this end, a remote sensing data
    driven framework to ingest S2 / MSI at-surface spectral reflectance, MODIS land
    surface products, ASCAT surface soil moisture saturation data, SRTM DEM, and ERA5
    reanalysis meteorological data was developed. Remote sensing multi-spectral information
    was combined to capture the pixel-wise real crop growth status related to crop-specific
    properties, environmental constraints, and the field management. The model was
    designed to strike a balance between model applicability and satisfactory characterization
    of the heterogeneous desert-oasis system to estimate field-scale yield. The proposed
    model (see Fig. 2) to estimate biomass accumulation and crop yield at high spatial
    resolution includes the following elements: (1) Time series reconstruction of
    remote sensing data; (2) Crop phenology estimation; (3) APAR estimation; (4) Estimation
    of air temperature stress factor; (5) Downscaling of soil moisture; (6) Estimation
    of ET and Rn and water stress; (7.1) Estimation of biomass by LUE model and (7.2)

    image Fig. 2. Workflow of the high resolution modeling system to estimate biomass
    accumulation and crop yield. The following paragraphs describe in detail the seven
    elements of the model. 3.1. Time series reconstruction of remote sensing observations
    In the proposed method, the pixel-wise crop emergence and harvest dates and the
    fAPAR, were estimated using the time series of S2 / MSI NDVI, taking advantage
    of the high spatial and temporal resolution. The daily water stress condition
    was estimated from the daily ET, which requires time series of MODIS NDVI and
    albedo. The daily air temperature stress was estimated from 1 km LST using the
    method by Alfieri et al. (2013), in which time series of MODIS LST is required.
    The NDVI, albedo, and LST derived from satellite observations are often contaminated
    by clouds, which hampers their application to observe terrestrial vegetation properties.
    To obtain a spatially and temporally continuous NDVI, albedo, and LST dataset,
    the method of Harmonic Analysis of Time Series (HANTS) was applied to the S2 /
    MSI NDVI and MODIS NDVI, albedo, and LST products to remove the cloud influence
    (Menenti et al., 1993; Verhoef, 1996; Roerink et al., 2000; Hadipour, 2021; Zhou
    et al., 2021). The HANTS method decomposes a time series into several frequency
    components based on the concept of a discrete Fourier transform. Considering that
    albedo and NDVI change gradually driven by vegetation phenology, we applied four
    frequencies with periods equal to 360 days, 180 days, 120 days, and 90 days, respectively,
    in HANTS, to capture the seasonal variation of NDVI and albedo in the study area.
    Besides the four frequencies reflecting seasonal variability, to reconstruct the
    LST time series, we added two more frequencies with periods equal to 30 days and
    15 days to capture the short-term variability due to possible fluctuations of
    atmospheric/weather conditions. Cloud-contaminated observations are identified
    by HANTS as outliers and assigned a lower weight prior to a new iteration in the
    reconstruction of the time series. The analyst needs to specify whether outliers
    are positive or negative anomalies relative to the current reconstruction of the
    time series. Cloud-contaminated observations give negative values of NDVI and
    LST, so outliers in NDVI and LST time series are defined as negative anomalies.
    Given the high albedo of clouds, outliers in albedo are defined as positive anomalies
    and lower weights are given to the higher outliers, which is contrary to the situation
    of NDVI and LST. Zhou et al. (2016) evaluated the accuracy of HANTS in the reconstruction
    of noisy and cloud-contaminated observations in comparison with four other methods
    and documented the generally good performance of HANTS. 3.2. Crop phenology estimation
    The crop emergence and harvest dates identify the period of time available for
    biomass accumulation during the growing season and then obtain the final yield.
    In the proposed model, the pixel-wise crop emergence and harvest dates, were estimated
    by applying crop-specific thresholds to the gap-free time series of S2 / MSI NDVI.
    This was made possible by the high spatial and temporal resolution. First, local
    knowledge indicated typical emergence and harvest dates applicable to the entire
    area (Table 3). Second, the NDVI values at these typical emergence and harvest
    dates were extracted for each crop from the spatially averaged NDVI temporal profiles
    - NDVI (t) (Fig. 3). Third, these NDVI values were applied as thresholds to the
    pixel-wise annual NDVI temporal profile to estimate the emergence and harvest
    dates for each crop and for each pixel. This method considers the specific characteristics
    of different crops and makes effective use of limited local phenological knowledge
    to determine the NDVI thresholds at the emergence and harvest dates in the growing
    season, valid for the entire study area. This solution was feasible because of
    the relative uniformity of local climate and of farming practices, i.e., leading
    to limited variability in the emergence and harvest dates. Table 3. The typical
    emergence and harvest dates applied to estimate the phenological NDVI thresholds
    for each crop in the study area. Crop type Wheat Maize Sunflower Melon Emergence

    on local knowledge (Table 3); the NDVI values at these dates were applied to the
    pixel-wise NDVI(t) to estimate the pixel-wise emergence and harvest dates. 3.3.
    APAR estimation The photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the vegetation
    APAR (MJ/m2/day), defined as: (1) where PAR (MJ/m2/day) is the solar irradiance
    in the spectral range between 0.4μm and 0.7 where the absorption bands of photosynthetic
    pigments are located. We followed the generally accepted approximation that on
    average daily PAR is 48% of the daily at-surface downward shortwave irradiance
    (between 0.4μm and 2.5 ) (McCree, 1972). The solar energy absorption by leaf pigments
    in the red band and high reflectance in the NIR band make the NDVI an appropriate
    indicator to estimate fAPAR. A wealth of studies explored the relationship between
    fAPAR and NDVI (Daughtry et al., 1992; Myneni and Williams, 1994; Chen, 1996;
    Gitelson et al., 2014). We use the linear equation proposed in Bastiaanssen and
    Ali (2003) as applicable to multiple crops: (2) 3.4. Estimation of temperature
    stress factor Air temperature ( ) is an important parameter influencing the activity
    of key enzymes in photosynthesis, which is reflected by the temperature stress
    factor ( ). The temperature stress factor includes two terms ( and ) here: (3)
    (4) (5) where (°C) denotes the temperature when photosynthetic efficiency reaches
    the maximum value and Tmon (°C) is the monthly mean air temperature. reduces crop
    growth rate in very cold and hot habitats, and reflects a seasonal depression
    of crop growth rate when temperature departs from the optimal temperature. Field
    et al. (1995) proposed to estimate as the mean air temperature in the month when
    NDVI reaches the maximum value. In a desert and oasis landscape, thermal heterogeneity
    of the land surface and the local variation of air temperature is not negligible.
    For regional-scale applications, the gridded is usually obtained by interpolating
    data collected at meteorological ground stations or provided by reanalysis datasets
    (with grid resolution at 0.1 - 0.5°). Application of such data will smooth out
    the main thermal heterogeneity, given the sparseness of the stations and the coarse
    grid of reanalysis datasets, especially for small, fragmented regions like the
    SRB. In this study, the mean daily air temperature at 1 km resolution was applied
    to estimate biomass and yield at 10 m spatial resolution, assuming meteorological
    conditions over 1 km extent did not change dramatically. The 1 km daily mean air
    temperature was estimated based on daily observations of LST (MOD11A1, 1 km) using
    the approach proposed by Alfieri et al. (2013). A linear relationship (Eq. (6))
    between LST and the daily mean measured at ground stations is established and
    further applied to obtain the gridded daily mean air temperature at the same resolution
    of the remotely sensed LST (i.e., 1 km, much higher than that of reanalysis datasets),
    (6) where m and n are coefficients. For areas within the same climate zone, m
    and n can be applied for an entire region. In this study, the gap-free LST time
    series generated from the MODIS LST product and observations from three meteorology
    stations in the oasis area for the whole year in 2019 were used to establish the
    relationship described in Eq. (6). Thus gap-free daily at 1 km resolution were
    obtained for the entire SRB and aggregated to estimate the monthly temperature
    stress factors and . The 10 m and were obtained through linear interpolation to
    match the grid size of the other input data. 3.5. Downscaling of soil moisture
    As regards the estimates of ET and the water stress indicator, one of the significant
    uncertainties is the low spatial resolution and discontinuous soil moisture data.
    At present, ASCAT soil moisture dataset is a long-term dataset with a relatively
    high spatial resolution (0.1 Degree) and is publicly available. Thus, in this
    study, a spatially continuous soil moisture dataset at high spatial resolution
    (1 km) was generated by downscaling the ASCAT soil moisture data utilizing multi-source
    remote sensing data and the Random Forest (RF) machine-learning model (Breiman,
    2001). The covariance matrix to apply RF machine-learning model includes LST,
    NDVI, albedo, DEM, longitude, and latitude. The spatial patterns of the soil moisture
    in this arid/semi-arid region are mainly driven by precipitation and agricultural
    activities, which are related to the geographical location, elevation, temperature,
    and vegetation characteristics. These facts provide a good physical basis to downscale
    the soil moisture by applying the RF machine-learning model with the selected
    covariates. First, the 1 km, gap-filled MODIS LST, NDVI and albedo, DEM, longitude,
    and latitude were aggregated to the ASCAT grid scale. Then, the RF model was trained
    to obtain the relationship between the ASCAT soil moisture and the covariates.
    Finally, the trained RF machine-learning model was applied to the covariates at
    high spatial resolution (1 km) to obtain a spatially continuous soil moisture
    dataset with 1 km resolution. 3.6. Estimation of ET and Rn and the field-scale
    water stress factor The indicator of water stress (dimensionless) is set equal
    to the Evaporative Fraction (EF) which better reflects the water availability
    to crops than vapor pressure deficit (VPD): (7) where (W/m2) is the bulk latent
    heat flux of the soil-vegetation unity, (J/kg) is the latent heat of ET (mm),
    (W/m2) is the total net radiation flux, and (W/m2) is the conductive heat flux
    from soil surface to deeper soil layer. In this study, a water and energy balance
    model, ETMonitor (Hu and Jia, 2015; Cui and Jia, 2021; Zheng et al., 2022), was
    used to estimate the daily ET. The inputs of ETMonitor include key surface properties,
    i.e., soil moisture, NDVI, albedo, and land cover, and atmospheric variables,
    i.e., air temperature, wind speed, air humidity, pressure, precipitation and at-surface
    downward shortwave and longwave radiations. The model equations and detailed description
    can be found in Hu and Jia (2015) and Cui and Jia (2021). Retrievals of actual
    ET by ETMonitor based on remote sensing data can capture the effects of irrigation,
    thus reflecting the actual irrigation water depths to some extent when lacking
    ancillary in-situ data. The performance of ETMonitor to derive actual ET over
    nearby irrigated oases of the Heihe river basin, which has a similar climate and
    land cover, had been evaluated based on the eddy covariance data (Hu and Jia,
    2015). The results show that ETMonitor provides satisfactory ET estimates with
    R2 (the square of the correlation coefficient) and RMSE (the root mean square
    error) equal to 0.92 and 0.59 mm/day, respectively. The pixel-wise daily Rn was
    estimated on the basis of the land surface radiation balance: (8) where (W/m2)
    and (W/m2) are the at-surface downward solar radiation and downward thermal radiation,
    of which the daily values can be calculated by integrating the hourly ERA5 data,
    is the surface albedo, is the land surface emissivity, is the Stefan-Boltzmann
    constant (5.67 10−8 W/m2/K4), (K) is the daily mean surface temperature, which
    was assumed equal to the daily mean air temperature with soil surface heat flux
    equal to zero at daily scale. In this study, the daily time series of ET and Rn
    at 1 km spatial resolution was estimated by applying the ETMonitor model with
    the reconstructed NDVI, albedo, downscaled ASCAT soil moisture, and the ERA5 meteorological
    reanalysis data. For a heterogeneous region like the study area, the 1 km EF is
    still insufficient to capture the wetness conditions at the field scale. The ET
    and Rn can widely vary between cropland and the surrounding desert and crops with
    different phenology. Thus, a linear unmixing method was further applied to downscale
    the ET and Rn to 10 m, i.e., at the same spatial resolution as the crop map. The
    linear unmixing procedure to downscale ET and Rn is based on the 10 m crop classification
    map. The 10 m classification map is used to define the endmembers. The procedure
    contains three general steps: (1) calculate the fractional abundance of each land
    use and crop (defined as endmembers) using the classification in each coarse grid
    (1 km); (2) obtain the ET and Rn of each endmember in the coarse grid data by
    linear unmixing (least square fit) within a moving window including 11 × 11 coarse
    grids as the first prediction of the 10 m ET and Rn of each endmember; (3) distribute
    homogeneously the coarse grid residual and update the ET and Rn estimation for
    each endmembers. The basic assumption of the linear unmixing method is that the
    ET and Rn of each coarse grid is the weighted sum of the values of each endmember
    within the same grid: (9) where is the number of endmembers, is the areal fraction
    of class i within a coarse pixel, and is the value of class i. This unmixing approach
    captures the general differences in ET and Rn between crops and the surrounding
    desert and among crop types with distinctive phenological characteristics, mixed
    in one coarse grid. On the other hand, it ignores the variability within the same
    crop types within the 11 × 11 coarse grids applied to solve Eq. (9). In other
    words, we assume that the spatial variability of ET and Rn within the nearby 11
    × 11 coarse grids is only determined by the spatial variability of the fractional
    abundance of each land cover and crop type. Improvement in the results is expected
    by retrieving LST and estimating ET with satellite data at higher spatial resolution,
    such as Landsat 8/9 TIRS and SDGSAT-1 thermal infrared images in future work (Hair
    et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2022a). 3.7. Estimation of biomass and yield The daily
    biomass (g/m2/day) production is the result of the effective use of the absorbed
    solar energy, and limited by temperature and water stress: (10) where (g/MJ) is
    the maximum light use efficiency for biomass production, the value of which can
    be safely assumed to differ only between C3 and C4 crops according to Monteith
    (1972). In this study, we set to 2.5 g/MJ for C3 crops (i.e., wheat, sunflower,
    and melon) and 3 g/MJ for C4 crops (i.e., maize), based on literature, summarized
    in Bastiaanssen and Ali (2003). The crop yield is formed through the partition
    of the total accumulated biomass of a plant to the marketable (yield related)
    plant parts. A simple description of this conversion is by applying the harvest
    index and the water content of the yield-related component to the estimated dry
    biomass so that the yield can be expressed as: (11) where H (dimensionless) is
    the harvest index, i.e., the fraction of the biomass accumulated during the growing
    season allocated to the yield-related plant organ, (dimensionless) denotes the
    water content in the yield-related plant organ, e and h represent the crop emergence
    and harvest date, respectively. The harvest index and the water content are usually
    set to crop-specific values estimated on the basis of field experiments documented
    in literature (Bastiaanssen and Ali, 2003; Zwart et al., 2010). In this study,
    for spring wheat, maize, and sunflower, the harvest index was set to 0.35, 0.36,
    and 0.30 (Table 4), respectively, based on biomass measurements and growth analysis
    on plant samples conducted in the same study area (Chen et al., 2022b). The harvest
    index of melon was set to 0.64 based on the study of Huang et al. (2012). The
    grain water content of spring wheat and maize was set to 12.5% and 14%, respectively,
    according to the national moisture content standard for grain storage (Standardization
    Administration of the People''s Republic of China, 2008, 2018). The local practice
    is to trade sunflower seeds after drying a few days after harvest, when the water
    content is reduced to around 25%. The water content of the local melon varieties
    is more variable (85%−90%) than that of cereals. In this study, the water content
    of sunflower and melon is set to 25% and 87%, respectively, as an approximation.

    As illustrated in Fig. 3, clear differences exist in the estimated emergence and
    harvest dates of spring wheat, maize, sunflower, and melon, while the corresponding
    NDVI values (Table 5) are rather similar. This is, apparently due to the similar
    fractional ground cover associated with emergence and harvest, but attained at
    different moments in time. Our analysis showed the spatial variability in the
    NDVI temporal profiles for each crop was rather limited, thus supporting the method
    to estimate the NDVI threshold according to the typical emergence and harvest
    dates in the entire area. The north – south pattern in Fig. 4 is explained to
    a large extent by the spatial distribution of the main crops. Spring wheat, mainly
    located on the south of the oasis, shows the most distinctive phenology features
    with the earliest start of the growing season. The emergence date of wheat is
    generally in early April, as shown in Table 6. The harvest date for spring wheat
    is between late July to mid-August. For maize and sunflower, the emergence date
    is generally mid to late May. Maize has a longer growing season and a later harvest
    date than sunflower, which is generally till October. Among the four crops, melon,
    mainly located in the downstream desert-oasis region, shows the latest emergence
    date at the beginning of June. This is related to the relatively higher temperature
    requirement for the seed gemination of melon plants (Saberali and Shirmohamadi-Aliakbarkhani,
    2020). Generally, the spatial variability in the emergence and harvest dates of
    each crop is moderate (Table 6), while the local phenological knowledge does not
    give any spatial variability on crop phenology. Table 5. NDVI thresholds to determine

    value of fAPAR is linearly related to NDVI (Eq. (2)) and gradually changes during
    the growth of vegetation. Fig. 5 displays the fAPAR values for the spring wheat,
    maize, sunflower, and melon on days from mid of April to September as an example.
    For spring wheat, fAPAR reaches the maximum value in mid-June. The fAPAR maximum
    is in July for sunflower and August for maize and melon. In the peak month, when
    green vegetative parts are fully developed, fAPAR was around 0.8 for spring wheat,
    maize, and sunflower, and 0.6 for melon. The lower peak for melon is caused by
    the lower planting density and limited vertical plant development. Download :

    PAR estimated using the ERA5 meteorological hourly data. The upper envelope of
    the PAR time series (Fig. 6) suggests a potential seasonal trend under clear sky
    conditions. In the middle of the growth cycle, the daily value of PAR under clear
    sky can reach 160 W/m2, equivalent to 13.8 MJ/m2/day. In the SRB, in summer, drier
    air, higher solar radiation, longer sunshine duration, and larger daily amplitude
    of air temperature are favorable conditions for high yield agriculture. The troughs
    in Fig. 6 correspond to cloudy conditions, where the value of PAR can decrease
    to 40 W/m2, equivalent to 3.45 MJ/m2/day. Because of such a big gap, daily PAR
    is required to estimate the accumulated biomass and the final yield. Download

    4.3. Air temperature stress factor The daily mean , required to determine and
    , is estimated as described in Sect. 3.4. We established a linear relationship
    between Ta and LST for each station separately and for all stations together.
    The results (Table 7) show that MODIS LST and observations are linearly related
    with R (the correlation coefficient) varying between 0.77 to 0.87. The m, n, and
    R in Eq. (6) in the relationships for each specific station and the ones for all
    stations did not differ significantly. This implies the possibility of using a
    single equation for the whole study area. Adopting the same relationship for the
    entire area only leads to an increment of RMSE on estimated air temperature between
    0.3% and 5.2%, with MAE between 0% and 9.2% (Table 8). Because of these results,
    the relationship for all stations in Table 7 (m = 0.94 and n = -13.38) was applied
    over the whole study area to estimate the pixel-wise daily mean . Table 7. Statistics

    the distinctive thermal characteristic of different land covers and terrain elevation
    in the SRB. The cold mountain region shows the lowest , i.e., < 10 °C even in
    summer for most of the region. Most important, the map captures rather well the
    finer details of the temperature variability within the oases and within the desert,
    in addition to the broad desert-oasis temperature pattern. The lower air temperature
    of narrow irrigated patches is clearly observable in the 1 km map. In the desert
    area, daily mean can be larger than 35 °C. In the oasis region, under the influence
    of irrigation, is significantly lower than the surrounding desert, i.e., between
    15 °C and 25 °C in the growing season. Download : Download high-res image (364KB)

    show that the mean in the cropland in the SRB is as high as 0.98 – 1.0 with a
    standard deviation of less than 0.02, which indicates that the local climate is
    suitable for agriculture. The temperature stress factor (Eq. (5)) parameterizes
    how a plant adapts to the local climate. With the application of , the LUE is
    reduced when the air temperature is either lower or higher than the local optimal
    temperature. The for wheat, maize, sunflower, and melon during April to September
    (Fig. 8) is always larger than 0.91 (the deviation less than 0.06) with a seasonal

    factor As described in Sect. 3.5, an RF machine-learning model was applied to
    obtain a spatially continuous soil moisture dataset with high spatial resolution
    using the gap-filled MODIS LST, NDVI, and albedo, SRTM DEM, longitude, and latitude
    as covariates. The trained RF model is well calibrated with a low RMSE of 0.06
    and a high R2 of 0.92. In the original ASCAT map (e.g., Fig. 9a), the spatial
    details of soil moisture are clearly blurred. However, the main differences in
    soil moisture among oases, desert, and mountain vegetation are observable. Moreover,
    the comparison of Fig. 9a and 9b reveals that the downscaled soil moisture is
    consistent with the details of desert-oasis pattern. Within the south oasis, clear
    differences in soil moisture were observable and explained by the crop pattern.
    ET and Rn were further downscaled based on the method introduced in Sect. 3.6
    and used to estimate the water stress factor. Fig. 9d gives an example of the
    water stress factor on 16th Aug, indicating a range between 0.3 and 1.0. Generally,
    water stress is more serious in the north SRB than the south due to less water
    availability, as indicated by the downscaled soil moisture. In addition, the wheat
    area (refer to Fig. 1c) shows more severe water stress, since, in August, most
    of wheat had been harvested already. The observed differences in downscaled soil
    moisture and water stress indicator between the northern and southern oasis are
    consistent with the allocation of irrigation water, which tends to favor the southern
    oasis. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size

    2019. 4.5. Accumulated biomass and yield estimation Accumulated biomass in the
    maize-producing region (Fig. 10) exhibits higher values compared with the other
    crops. The biomass of wheat (Fig. 11) grows up earlier, consistently with the
    early growing season. The stage of rapid increase in biomass, i.e., higher photosynthesis
    rate, is from May to June for wheat, and June to August for the other crops. For
    C3 crops, i.e., wheat, sunflower, and melon, the mean value of accumulated biomass
    is between 1000–1500 g/m2. The relatively lower biomass accumulation of melon,
    compared with wheat and sunflower, is related to its shorter growing season and
    lower planting density. For maize, as a C4 crop type with a higher LUE, the mean
    biomass increases more rapidly and can reach over 2000 g/m2 at the end of the
    growing season. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download full-size

    (black line with dot, right axis) of wheat (a) and maize (b) at county level in
    the SRB, 2019; fractional areas are fractions of the total area of each crop in
    the five counties. By specifying the harvest index and moisture content (see Sect.
    3.7) for each crop type, the accumulated biomass can be converted to the final
    yield (Fig. 13). At basin level, the estimated yields of wheat and maize are 6.87
    and 8.53 t/h, respectively, which are very comparable with the officially reported
    data in the Gansu Development Yearbook 2020. The relative errors for the two main
    grain crops compared to the census data are less than 5% (Table 9). At the county
    level, the estimated wheat yields of Liangzhou, Minqin, Gulang, Jinchuan, and
    Yongchang are 6.07, 5.20, 5.40, 5.55, and 6.95 t/ha, respectively, with relative
    errors equal to 0.87%, 24.2%, 9.7%, 12.5%, and 7.2% (Fig. 12). For maize, the
    estimated yields in Liangzhou, Minqin, Jinchuan, Yongchang, and Gulang are 8.86,
    7.18, 8.87, 8.25, and 8.22 t/ha. The relative errors for maize yield compared
    with the census data in Liangzhou, Minqin, Jinchuan, and Yongchang are less than
    5%. In Gulang, the relative error is up to 40%. The exact reason for the gap in
    Gulang has not been found. There is no sign that the growth of maize in Gulang
    county is under higher stress from remote sensing signals (e.g., the value of
    NDVI). The Gulang census data for maize yield is more variable during 2014 – 2019,
    ranging from 5.98 to 9.95 t/ha. Accordingly, this gap may be partly due to a poorer
    representativeness of the samples used in the census data and the unsuitable setting
    of the local harvest index in the model. To evaluate the estimated yield of sunflower,
    which is missing in the official census data, yield data from field interviews
    in Minqin county has been used. These fields have received a better nutrient and
    water supply. The relative error of the estimated sunflower yield (6.38 t/ha)
    deviates by 5% from the real yield (6.0 t/ha). Since only the regional total yield
    of melon and other fruits has been recorded in the officially reported data, the
    validation of melon yield has been done only in the Minqin county, where fruits
    other than melon only account for a very small portion. The relative error of
    the estimated melon yield (52.24 t/ha) is 16%, compared with the officially reported
    yield (44.93 t/ha). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    approach developed in this study was conceived to describe the response of highly
    heterogeneous desert-oasis system to climate variability and land and water management.
    The issues to be addressed were: a) the spatial variability in crop phenology;
    b) the spatial variability in crop conditions and their impact on absorption of
    photosynthetic light; c) the larger contrast in thermal conditions between desert
    and oases and within the oases; d) the spatial variability of available soil water
    and its dependence on irrigation; e) the temporal and spatial variability, modulated
    by soil and growth conditions, of crop response to available soil water and f)
    the relationship between biomass and marketable yield. 5.1. Crop phenology In
    crop-growth dynamic models, the phenology, namely the emergence and harvest dates,
    is usually determined by a set of temperature sums (thermal times), associated
    with each phenological stage (Hijmans et al., 1994). To calculate temperature
    sums, a reference (baseline) temperature must be known for each crop, likewise
    the values of temperature sums associated with each phenological stage and each
    crop. This approach is difficult to apply in the case of the desert-oasis agroecosystem
    addressed by this study for a two-fold reason: the extreme sparseness of the meteorological
    stations in the oases and the absent knowledge on the baseline temperature and
    the thermal times. Accordingly, we explored an alternate approach: see Sect. 3.2
    for a detailed description. This method considers the specific characteristics
    of different crops and makes effective use of limited local phenological knowledge
    to determine the NDVI thresholds at the emergence and harvest dates in the growing
    season. The core assumption is the spatial variability in the temporal NDVI profiles
    does not modify completely their shape, so that the thresholds estimated on the
    average NDVI profiles are applicable to the pixel-wise profiles. If local phenological
    observations were available, the emergence and harvest dates could be estimated
    on the basis of the temperature sums applying to each phenological stage, then
    the corresponding NDVI values would retain the spatial variability of the temperature
    sums. This would lead to an even finer description of crop phenology, avoiding
    the use of the same NDVI threshold in the entire area. 5.2. Absorption of photosynthetic
    light (fAPAR) The efficiency of the absorption of the PAR is determined by the
    concentration and type of leaf pigments, which vary significantly depending on
    varieties, fertilization, and more in general crop conditions. This spatial and
    temporal variability is hard to capture, without the support of multi-spectral
    remote sensing, although it is an essential element of LUE-based modeling of biomass
    accumulation and crop yield. To this purpose, we applied multi-spectral images
    at high spatial resolution. A wealth of studies explored the relationship between
    fAPAR and NDVI (Daughtry et al., 1992; Myneni and Williams, 1994; Chen, 1996;
    Gitelson et al., 2014). We use the linear equation proposed in Bastiaanssen and
    Ali (2003), as applicable to multiple crops including the ones in the SRB. Quantitative
    remote sensing measurements can be interpreted with the support of radiative transfer
    modeling in vegetation canopies to obtain generalized relationships between spectral
    reflectance and fAPAR (Goward and Huemmrich, 1992). Field-scale experiments by
    Tedeschi et al. (2011) and Tedeschi et al. (2017) showed that the melon crop yield
    under saline-sodic stress, will be reduced due to the decreasing leaf area and
    biomass production. These studies imply that the estimation of fAPAR can be further
    improved by considering field-scale soil conditions. 5.3. Thermal conditions In
    a desert and oasis landscape, thermal heterogeneity of the land surface and the
    local variation of air temperature is not negligible, as a consequence of the
    large variability in hydrological conditions between the desert and the oases
    and within the oases. Proper characterization of spatial and temporal variability
    of thermal conditions is a critical aspect of a broad range of ecosystems. For
    regional-scale applications, air temperature is usually interpolated from the
    meteorological ground stations or provided by reanalysis datasets (with grid resolution
    at 0.1 - 0.5°). Neither of these solutions would capture the details of water
    related thermal conditions in the oases of the SRB. Land surface temperature is
    a measure of the local equilibrium in heat fluxes in response to water conditions.
    This leads to using LST as a predictor of air temperature, as done in this study.
    The estimation of air temperature is affected by not negligible errors (Table
    8), but still relatively small compared with the large difference between oases
    and desert, i.e., 15–25 °C as noted (Fig. 7). Possible improvements in future
    studies include the use of additional periodic components in the HANTS time series
    reconstruction or the use of the different method for this purpose, and the use
    of a denser network of weather stations if available. 5.4. Available soil water
    In the SRB, as in any irrigated area, the soil water is largely determined by
    irrigation. Accurate and detailed data on actually applied irrigation water are
    rarely available and the use of remote sensing retrievals of soil water content
    is gaining support (Zaussinger et al., 2019). In the SRB, serious water conflicts
    exist between ecosystem preservation and agriculture and between different irrigation
    zones. In the oases, water availability varies and irrigation time is different
    for crops with different phenology. Thus, in this study, we applied remotely sensed
    soil moisture to account for the application of irrigation water. The extraction
    of information from microwave data, capturing the water conditions, is frequently
    hampered by low spatial resolution, i.e., 10 km – 25 km. Such kind of resolution
    cannot capture the heterogeneity in soil water conditions within the oases and
    the sharp contrast at the oasis-desert boundary. This is then a two-fold problem:
    a) soil water content must be estimated at a spatial resolution consistent with
    the heterogeneity of the irrigated oases and b) the root zone soil water content
    must be estimated. The latter issue is addressed in the next paragraph in relation
    to the ETMonitor system. To address the first issue, we first evaluated candidate
    soil water condition data products to conclude that in 2019 only the ASCAT data
    product could capture the main features of the pattern in soil water determined
    by irrigation in the oases (Fig. 10). To downscale the ASCAT data product, we
    identified multiple candidate covariates to develop a multi-dimensional machine-learning
    model. The covariates are the drivers of the spatial pattern of soil moisture,
    i.e., vegetation, soil surface temperature, albedo, and elevation (see Sect. 3.5).
    As shown in Sect. 4.4, this model could be accurately calibrated, and delivers
    estimates of soil water content at 1 km spatial resolution, which is sufficient
    to distinguish soil water conditions in the broad irrigated and not irrigated
    patches within the oases (Fig. 9b). 5.5. Crop response to available soil water
    Soil water availability determines the rapid crop response through the regulation
    on the stomatal conductance and therefore efficiently influence the carbon assimilation
    efficiency. This response is determined by soil conditions, canopy characteristics,
    and the meteorological conditions expressed by the difference between actual and
    potential ET. Actual ET was estimated with ETMonitor (Sect. 3.6) using a suite
    of remote sensing observations, including soil available water as described above.
    In this way, actual ET includes the contribution of irrigation water, i.e., it
    reflects the actual irrigation water depths. This is done by estimating the root
    zone soil water content using a parameterization based on the top soil water content
    (see Sect. 3.5) and NDVI (Hu and Jia, 2015). The accuracy of ETMonitor has been
    documented against eddy covariance measurement of ET at a number of sites worldwide,
    to yield an overall RMSE equal to 0.93 mm/day and R equal to 0.75, applying to
    multiple cropland sites (Zheng et al., 2022). The downscaling procedure described
    (Sect. 3.6) assumes that the actual ET of each crop type does not change within
    each moving window (11 х 11 km2). This notwithstanding, the higher resolution
    ET captures correctly the differences between irrigated and not irrigated patches,
    as for example between wheat and maize fields in the southern oasis on Aug. 16th
    (Fig. 9d). A different solution to obtain high resolution estimates of available
    soil water and actual ET will be offered by a new version of ETMonitor, which
    uses land surface temperature rather than microwave radiometry to characterize
    soil and water conditions. This version makes use of LST observations at higher
    spatial resolution such as Landsat 8/9 TIRS and SDGSAT thermal infrared images
    (Hair et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2022a). 5.6. Biomass and marketable yield Harvest
    index and the maximum LUE are the most significant calibration parameters. For
    each crop, both harvest index and maximum LUE are relatively well known to vary
    within a certain range (Bastiaanssen and Ali, 2003; Zwart et al., 2010). For grain
    crops, it is usually accepted that the harvest index within the same climate zone
    is fairly stable for a specific crop due to the high heritability, unless severe
    stresses from nutrient, extreme weather, and water occur (Hay, 1995). The well-simulated
    wheat and maize yields prove the rationality of the fixed harvest index in the
    study area. For melon, the harvest index is more variable between different melon
    varieties and environmental stress can reduce the potential harvest index. Huang
    et al. (2012), in the same study area, showed that the melon harvest index can
    increase significantly with increasing salinity of irrigation water. This influence
    should be further studied. As regards the limitations in growth rate, besides
    temperature and soil water stress, various models integrate the dependence on
    vapor pressure deficit, atmospheric CO2 concentration, diffuse radiation ratio,
    etc. (Running et al., 2000; Veroustraete et al., 2002; He et al., 2013; Zhang
    et al., 2016). These models are designed to better account for climate forcing,
    plant physiology, and canopy structure in vegetation productivity but have rather
    demanding data requirements. In the SRB, water security depends largely on melt
    water from the Qilian mountains, while food security and sustainable development
    in the region require equitable water allocation between the southern and northern
    oasis. The model described in this study could be useful to support monitoring
    of agroecosystem services towards water and food security. It should be noted
    that the issues discussed above apply to a broad range of agroecosystems, particularly
    the fragmentation of land use and the resulting heterogeneity of crop and water
    conditions. The solutions we developed and applied in this study of the SRB, therefore,
    are relevant to a broader range of land and water systems than the desert-oasis
    in the SRB. Particularly, the procedures applied to replace detailed local data
    on crop conditions, soil water availability, and crop response to water stress
    are effective solutions to take advantage of the information conveyed by remote
    sensing observations. This concept fits neatly in the argument of Jones et al.
    (2017), who emphasized that data scarcity is even more important than theory limitations
    in agricultural monitoring and forecast. 6. Conclusions The modeling approach
    developed in this study was conceived to describe the response of highly heterogeneous
    desert-oasis system to climate variability and land and water management. The
    modeling system at high spatial resolution is applicable to a broad range of agroecosystems,
    particularly to deal with the fragmentation of land use and the resulting heterogeneity
    of crop and water conditions. The solutions we developed and applied in this study
    of the SRB, therefore, are relevant to a broader range of land and water systems
    than the deser-oasis in the SRB. Particularly, the procedures applied to replace
    detailed local data on crop conditions, soil water availability, and crop response
    to water stress are effective solutions to take advantage of the information conveyed
    by remote sensing observations. Crop yield estimation in heterogeneous regions
    is challenging due to the gaps in local data. The problems of both data continuity
    in space and time and the scaling issue were considered. In general, the continuous
    change of crop conditions at field scale during the growing season has been well
    captured. As regards soil properties, soil moisture, and environmental conditions,
    e.g., the air temperature, the data gaps are mitigated by applying data fusion
    and downscaling. The evaluation of estimated crop yield against official census
    data and field interviews proves the reliability of the LUE based model and the
    data processing we applied. Knowledge on soil type and conditions, especially
    on soil salinity, would improve the estimation of crop response to water in water
    limited region. CRediT authorship contribution statement Qiting Chen: Conceptualization,

  description: 【Objective】Precision agriculture needs a rapid diagnosis of water and
    nutrient deficits, which is challenging at large scales in the field. Taking maize
    as an e ample, this paper proposes to estimate nitrogen content in maize canopy
    using remote sensing data.【Method】The study was carried out at Hetao Irrigation
    District using UAV multi-spectral imagery data measured in 2020. A variety of
    vegetation indices e tracted from the imageries were used to calculate nitrogen
    content in the canopy when the crop grew to different stages. The model was validated
    against ground-truth data and was then used to evaluate critical nitrogen concentration
    and potential nitrogen pollution at different growth stages.【 esult】The planted
    area of maize in Hetao Irrigated District in 2020 was 275 000 hm2. The suitable
    vegetation indices for calculating canopy nitrogen varied with growing stages;
    the canopy nitrogen at elongation, early and late tasseling stage and flowering
    stage was best estimated by,,, and, respectively. It was found that nitrogen concentration
    in the canopy was low at the flowering stage, and high at the elongation and later
    tasseling stage, during which nitrogen pollution could occur. Analysis showed
    that the risk of nitrogen pollution was rade 4 in early tasseling stage and zero
    in flowering stage. 【Conclusion】The UAV multispectral image data can be used to
    estimate nitrogen content in plant and assess the potential of nitrogen pollution
    at different growing stages at large scales in the field. It can help improve
    fertilization and reduce the potential of non-point source pollution.

    water storage anomaly (TWSA), soil moisture anomaly (SMA), and groundwater storage

    in the distribution and growth of vegetation. In this paper, multi-source remote

    of water storage, ecology and environment from 2002 to 2020. The numerical results
    showed the TWSA and GWSA in the study area had a declining trend and the rates
    were −7.512 mm yr-1 and −8.268 mm yr-1, respectively. On the contrary, the SMS
    showed an increasing trend, and the rate was 0.840 mm yr-1. By trend variation
    and correlation analysis, we found GWSA is the main part in the variation of TWSA.
    By further analysis, it was found that the climate factors are not the major factors
    causing the variation of GWSA, but coal mining and artificial irrigation activities,
    which are especially clear in the Taihang Mountains in eastern Shanxi Province.
    The ecology and environment have been improving, and water storage and climate
    factors have played a different role in different regions. The warm climate conditions
    and the increased 0–40 cm of soil water have promoted the growth of vegetation
    and the improvement of the ecology and environment. The research results are helpful
    to understand the impacts of water storage on the ecology and environment in high-intensity
    coal mining areas. 1 INTRODUCTION Located on the Loess Plateau, Ordos, northern
    Shaanxi (Shanbei), and Shanxi Provinces constitute an important energy base in
    China, which ha been proved to contain more 100 kinds of underground minerals,
    especially coal (Liu et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2021). The coal reserves are 167.6
    billion tons, 157.1 billion tons, and 270.9 billion tons for the three sub-regions,
    respectively, and their total annual coal output exceeds 2 billion tons. The areas
    are regarded as high-intensity coal mining localities (Chen et al., 2020). Damage
    to the ground structure has been caused by long-term and high-intensity coal mining
    activities, resulting in the destruction of underground aquifers, and uneven distribution
    of water resources, which in turn affects the terrestrial water balance system
    and regional ecosystem (Feng et al., 2020; Li et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019).
    Studies have shown that the groundwater in the above-mentioned areas shows a significant
    downward trend due to coal mining in recent years (Chen et al., 2020). This region
    is also characterized by sparse vegetation, frequent drought, little precipitation,
    and strong evaporation (Chen et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2018). Although many ecological
    restoration measures have been taken, such as the Grain-for-Green Program (1999-ongoing),
    which have also increased the water consumption of vegetation (Han et al., 2020).
    Arid climatic conditions and large water consumption can easily lead to the destruction
    of vegetation and a sharp decline of biodiversity in the region (Cao et al., 2015).
    We seek to provide a theoretical basis for the sustainable utilization of water
    resources and the sustainable development of the environment in coal mining areas
    by studying the spatial–temporal distribution pattern of water storage and its
    impacts. Terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA), soil moisture anomaly (SMA),
    and groundwater storage anomaly (GWSA) are important measures relating to the
    distribution and growth of vegetation (Zhang et al., 2016). The traditional water
    storage monitoring methods, which include hydrological monitoring stations and
    monitoring wells, are distributed in a limited number and are easily affected
    by topography and landforms, making them unsuitable for measuring water storage
    on a large-scale and long term (Moiwo et al., 2009; Robock et al., 2000). With
    the advances in remote sensing technology, credible and spatial–temporal continuous
    monitoring methods the gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) and global
    land data assimilation system (GLDAS) can be used to monitor and medium and long
    scale TWSA, SMA, and GWSA (Velicogna & Wahr, 2006; Geng et al., 2021). GLDAS takes
    satellite and ground-based observations and uses land surface modelling and data
    assimilation techniques to obtain surface water estimates, which includes soil
    moisture, snow water equivalent, canopy surface water, and so forth. GRACE was
    jointly developed by the United States and Germany, and was successfully launched
    in March 2002, providing important and useful information for the study of terrestrial
    water resource changes (Chen et al., 2018). GRACE measures the Earth''s time-varying
    gravity field and converts it into the equivalent mass change on the Earth''s
    surface, which is the Earth''s TWSA (Wei et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021). GWSA
    can be derived by combining GRACE and GLDAS. The study areas for water storage
    that have been completed now includes the Arab region (Saber et al., 2020), the
    Tibetan Plateau (Xiang et al., 2016), the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau (Long et al.,
    2014), the Tarim River basin (Xu, Wang, et al., 2019), the Yellow River basin
    (Li, Zhang, et al., 2020), the China Mainland (Xu, Chen, et al., 2019), etc. In
    regional ecological assessment of mining areas, many indices derived from remote
    sensing also play an important role (Shang et al., 2015; Zhu, Chen, et al., 2020).
    The main indices of ecological and environmental evaluation include the ecological
    environment index (EI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the
    enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI)
    (Shan et al., 2019; Xu, Wang, et al., 2018). Coupled with four indicators of greenness,
    wetness, heat, and dryness, RSEI is more representative and has been more commonly
    applied to ecological and environmental assessment of cities and mining areas
    (Li, Wang, & Qin, 2020; Karimi Firozjaei et al., 2021; Li, Liang, et al., 2021).
    Areas that have had RSEI applied now include the mining lands around Nansi Lake
    (Liu et al., 2021), the Yangquan Coal Mine (Nie et al., 2021), some mining localities
    of Hancheng City (Pan et al., 2022). The impacts of water storage on the ecology
    and environment are very significant, and the distribution of water resources
    is important for sustainable development. In the Mu Us Sandy Land of China, the
    growth of vegetation has led to the reduction of groundwater (Zhang et al., 2020).
    In Badain Jaran, the growth of irrigated vegetation has led to the reduction of
    groundwater (Zhang et al., 2018). In the Three-River Source Region of the Tibetan
    Plateau, the effects of TWSA and SMA on NDVI are considerably greater than the
    effects of climate factors (Xu, Kang, et al., 2018). In the Xiliao River basin,
    NDVI is mainly limited by hydrological elements (Zhu, Luo, et al., 2020). Previous
    research mainly focuses on plateaus and watersheds, and there is a lack of studies
    in high-intensity coal mining areas. Firstly, this is mainly because it is difficult
    to explore the changes of TWSA in coal mining areas, where TWSA includes not only
    changes in water storage quality but also changes in coal quality that are not
    negligible (Li et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2018). Secondly, a single ecological
    assessment index (e.g., EVI, NDVI) is inadequate and unrepresentative for exploring
    the spatial–temporal changes of those environments. Lastly, there is always a
    lag between water storage and environmental change, which is ignored by most scholars.
    Accordingly, we chose RSEI as the ecological assessment index, and deduced the
    impact of coal mining on TWSA, and then fully analyzed the spatial–temporal changes
    and correlations between water storage and the ecology environment in high-intensity
    coal mining areas over the long term. In this study, we used multi-source remote
    sensing data and related statistics to reveal and quantify the spatial–temporal
    relationship between water storage and the ecology and environment in Ordos, Shanbei,
    and Shanxi Provinces. This includes: (1) using GRACE data, GLDAS data, and raw
    coal production data to study the trend variation of TWSA, SMSA, and GWSA; (2)
    using MODIS data to assess the changing trend of RSEI; (3) quantifying the impacts
    of water storage on the ecology and environment and analyzing this phenomenon
    in combination with natural conditions and current land use. This study can help
    provide land dgeradation countermeasures and suggestions for the sustainable development
    of water resources management in high-density coal mining areas. 2 MATERIALS AND
    METHODS 2.1 Study area The study area consists of three sub-regions: Ordos (Inner
    Mongolia Autonomous Region), Shanbei (Shaanxi Province), and Shanxi Province.
    It is located at 106°28′-114°31′ E, 34°35′-40°52′ N, and covers an area of about
    324,000km2, most of which is higher than 1000 m above sea level. It has a temperate
    semiarid continental climate characterized by an average annual precipitation
    of 500 mm, mainly concentrated in July–September. The annual average temperature
    and annual evaporation is 0°C–10°C and above 2000 mm, respectively. It can be
    seen from Figure 1a that the Yellow River runs through the whole study area, which
    is dominated by grassland, woodland, and cultivated land. In addition, the area
    of agricultural planting in this region is large and highly dependent on water,
    especially in Shanxi Province, where the water consumption for irrigation accounts
    for about 54% of social water consumption. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Schematic map of the study area and raw coal production (Coal mine county means
    the county has an annual raw coal output greater than 10 million tons) [Colour
    figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] The study area is rich in coal
    resources, which are mainly distributed in Shanxi Province and its surrounding
    areas (Figure 1a). There are dozens of large mining areas such as Shendong, Wanli,
    Huodong and Huangling. As can be seen from Figure 1b, the coal mining volume in
    the study area has shown a linear growth trend from 2002 to 2020, and the coal
    production in 2020 has increased by about 562.1% compared with 2002. From the
    point lines in different colours, it can be seen the coal production of Shanxi
    Province is higher than the other two sub-regions in each year. 2.2 Data The RL06
    Mascon solution from 2002 to 2020, released by the Space Research Center (CSR)
    of the University of Texas, is utilized in this study. To eliminate the influence
    of the solid Earth mass, the monthly GRACE data is subtracted from the monthly
    average value from 2004 to 2009 to obtain a change value of terrestrial water
    storage (unit: cm). For the missing data of 33 months due to the bad GRACE observation
    data and blank area between GRACE-FO and GRACE (Sun et al., 2020), the high-precision
    product produced by Li et al. is used in this study (Li, Kusche, et al., 2021).
    The changes in the Earth''s mass are provided by the GRACE data product. For high-intensity
    coal mining areas, the obtained mass changes include not only the changes in water
    storage but also the changes in coal. Therefore, in the process of calculating
    changes in TWSA and GWSA, the mass changes caused by coal mining should be removed.
    The specific formula is as follows (Xie et al., 2018): (1) (2) Where: is water
    storage obtained by the Mascon solution, represents water storage obtained by
    removing coal, represents mass changes caused by coal mining activities, is the
    groundwater storage anomaly, represents 0–200 cm soil moisture anomaly, represents
    snow water equivalent anomaly, represents canopy water storage anomaly. can be
    acquired from GLDAS (Chinnasamy et al., 2015). To unify the unit, the mass changes
    caused by coal mining activities can be converted into the equivalent water height,
    and the specific formula is as follows: (3) Where: is the equivalent water height
    of changes caused by coal mining (unit: mm), indicates regional raw coal production
    (unit: kg), represents the area of area (unit: m2), is the density of water (unit:
    kg m-3). The equivalent water height of changes caused by coal mining are shown
    in Figure S1. The monthly precipitation (P) data are derived from the TRMM satellite.
    Compared with most precipitation data, TRMM precipitation data not only has higher
    resolution, but also has better applicability in mid-latitude areas. Nevertheless,
    since TRMM only provides the precipitation dataset from 1998 to 2019, we use Climate
    Research Unit (CRU) precipitation data to complement the 2020 precipitation data.
    The evapotranspiration (ET) data and temperature (T) data were downloaded from
    the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center, which were validated by using 496 independent
    observation station data and proven to have a significant effect in the study
    area (Peng et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2019; Ding & Peng, 2020). The RSEI contains
    four indicators, including NDVI, WET, normalized difference impervious surface
    index (NDBSI), and land surface temperature (LST), which are derived from the
    MOD13A1 dataset, the MOD09A1 dataset, the MOD09A1 dataset, and the MOD11A2 dataset,
    respectively. NDVI, WET, NDBSI, and LST represent regional greenness, wetness,
    dryness, and heat, respectively (Zhu, Chen, et al., 2020). After principal component
    analysis of the above datasets, which are filtered cloud cover and clipped, we
    extracted the quarterly RSEI data from 2002 to 2020 through the remote sensing
    cloud platform. The specific formulas for calculating these four indicators can
    be found in Zhu, Chen, et al. (2020). Based on the above-mentioned data, the RSEI
    can be synthesized. Note that the RSEI index is synthesized in seasonal units,
    that is, spring - from March to May, summer - from June to August, autumn - from
    September to November, and winter - from December to February. The synthetic formula
    is as follows: (4) Where: stands for principal component analysis. The land cover
    types are derived from the annual China Land Cover Dataset (CLCD) (Yang & Huang,
    2021). The ecology and environmental quality data comes from the China ecological
    quality index (CHEQ) (Xu, Yang, et al., 2021). The R2 between the CHEQ products
    and EI, proposed by the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection, is 0.71,
    indicating CHEQ can effectively assess regional ecology. The raw coal production
    data comes from the statistical yearbooks of each province, city, and autonomous
    region. The above remote sensing data are all sampled to 0.25°. Table 1 shows
    specific information about the data. TABLE 1. Brief description of datasets Data

    Method 2.3.1 Latitude weighting method The latitude weighting method is based
    on the geographic location of the grid points to obtain the mean value of water
    storage (Herman et al., 2013; Ulrich & Tran, 2013). The specific formula is as
    follows: (5) Where: represents the mean value of changes in water storage; indicates
    the number of grids in the area; and are the longitude and latitude of a point,
    respectively; indicates the water storage value. 2.3.2 Least squares spherical
    harmonics The ecological and hydrological processes not only have obvious periodicity
    in time changes, but are also easily affected by natural, human, and other factors,
    resulting in non-periodic changes, which affect the accurate analysis of time
    series. Consequently, the least square spherical harmonic function was adopted
    as the seasonal decomposition method of time-series to explore the amplitude,
    phase, and linear trend of water storage and RSEI periodic changes. It is shown
    as the following formula (Jin & Feng, 2013; Pawlowicz et al., 2002): (6) Where:
    represents time (unit: month), and are the trend term and constant term of the
    linear function, respectively, are semi-annual and annual terms, respectively,
    is the residual term. 2.3.3 Coefficient of variation (CV) CV is a statistic used
    to measure the variation degree of each RSEI pixel in time-series (Guo et al.,
    2013). The formula is as follows: (7) Where: represents the standard deviation
    of RSEI, is the mean of RSEI, is the coefficient of variation of RSEI, the greater
    the value, the greater the degree of variation, vice versa. 2.3.4 Hurst index
    The rescaled range analysis method is proposed by Hurst to establish the Hurst
    index when studying the relationship between the flow and storage of the Nile
    River, which is used to measure the long-term dependence of time-series information
    (Jiang et al., 2017). We define the mean sequence for a time sequence (8) (9)
    (10) (11) Where: indicates the number of the subseries , is the time-series of
    , is the time step, represents the cumulative deviation, is the extreme deviation
    sequence, is the standard deviation. (12) Where: indicates the average rescaled
    range, is a constant, n is the sequence length, H indicates the Hurst index and
    the value is between 0 and 1. If , it means that RSEI has no autocorrelation;
    if , it means that RSEI has inverse persistence; if , it means that RSEI has long-term
    memory. 3 RESULTS 3.1 Spatial–temporal analysis of water storage The monthly variation
    of TWSA, SMA, and GWSA from 2002 to 2020 for the study area and three sub-regions
    were counted and shown in Figures 2, S2, and S3, respectively. It can be seen
    from the left panel of Figure 2 that the TWSA of the whole study area appeared
    to have a decreasing trend with a decline rate of −7.416 mm yr-1. According to
    the analysis of each area, the change rates of TWSA were −1.032 mm yr-1, −4.080 mm
    yr-1 and −12.540 mm yr-1, and the fluctuation range were −73.327–36.712 mm, −140.992–93.109 mm,
    and −311.640–163.441 mm for Ordos, Shanbei and Shanxi Province, respectively.
    Figure S2 showed that the SMA of the whole study area appeared to have an increased
    trend with a change rate of 0.840 mm yr-1. The change rates of SMA were 0.456 mm
    yr-1, 1.044 mm yr-1, and 0.972 mm yr-1, and the fluctuation range were −27.157–64.978 mm,
    −45.252–112.605 mm, and −56.248–116.987 mm for Ordos, Shanbei and Shanxi Province,
    respectively. Figure S3 showed that the GWSA of the study area appeared to have
    a decreased trend with a change rate of −8.268 mm yr-1. The change rates of GWSA
    were −1.488 mm yr-1, −5.148 mm yr-1 and −13.512 mm yr-1, and the fluctuation range
    were −86.325–29.521 mm, −168.181–28.753 mm, −324.271–74.905 mm for Ordos, Shanbei
    and Shanxi Province, respectively. By analyzing the correlation between water
    storage in the study area, we found TWSA is highly consistent with GWSA, showing
    a correlation coefficient of over 0.887. Through the variation trend and correlation
    analysis between water storage and GWSA, we found GWSA is the main factor causing
    the decline of TWSA, which is consistent with the study of Xie et al. (2019).

    c, e, and g represent TWSA in Ordos, Shanbei, Shanxi Province, and the whole region,
    respectively, b, d, f, and h represent TWSA in corresponding regions after detrending)
    [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] A detrend analysis was
    performed on the study area to effectively eliminate the time complexity of water
    storage. It can be seen from the right panels of Figures 2, S2, and Figure S3
    that the TWSA, SMA, and GWSA in Shanbei and Shanxi Province showed obvious periodic
    changes, and the change trends were basically the same. In addition, the water
    storage in the study area showed an obvious increased trend in the second half
    of 2003, and the reason was that the runoff in this area was low in the first
    half of 2003. After entering the flood season in the second half of the year,
    the precipitation in this area increased, and the runoff also increased, so the
    phenomenon changed from negative to positive during this time (Xie et al., 2019).
    The intra-annual variation characteristics of water storage were shown in Figure
    3. The intra-annual change trends of water storage in Ordos in spring were adverse,
    as SMS increased, TWSA and GWSA decreased. The intra-annual variation trends of
    water storage were basically consistent in Shanbei and Shanxi Province, but different
    on the time scale. On the time scale, increases in SMA were concentrated mainly
    from June to September, and other months showed a declining trend. TWSA increased
    from January to March and from June to September, but experienced a decline from
    March to June and from November to December, which is consistent with GWSA. FIGURE

    c, and d represent the monthly mean values of Ordos, Shanbei, Shanxi Province,
    and the study area, respectively) [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
    Based on the least square spherical harmonics, the change rates and periodic characteristics
    of the water storage were obtained in each pixel. For the pixel-based TWSA in
    the study area, it had a decreasing trend in the past 20 years, and the trend
    became larger from northwest to southeast (Figure 4a). The R2 in the study area
    was generally high, among which Ordos, northern Shanbei, and northern Shanxi Province
    were better than southern Shanxi Province and southern Shanbei. The semi-annual
    cycle amplitude showed an increasing trend from northwest to southeast, which
    was consistent with the change trend of TWSA, while the annual cycle amplitude
    appeared to increase from north to south. For the pixel-based SMA, it had an increased
    trend in the northeast of Shanxi Province and the southwest of Shanbei, and the
    south of Shanxi Province and the north of Ordos showed a decreased trend (Figure
    S4a). The R2 in the study area was generally low, among which the southern and
    northern parts of the study area were better than the central part. The semi-annual
    cycle amplitude and the annual cycle showed an increasing trend from north to
    south. For the pixel-based GWSA, the change trend, R2, and semi-annual cycle amplitude
    showed the same trend as TWSA (Figure S5). The annual cycle amplitude of a large
    value can be seen in the southeast and southwest of the study area. The largest
    decrease and cycle amplitude of GWSA were observed in the Taihang Mountains in
    the eastern part of Shanxi Province, which is an area with intensive coal mining
    and agricultural irrigation activities, which is consistent with existing research
    (Feng et al., 2013). FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint TWSA time-series
    decomposition results [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
    3.2 Spatial–temporal analysis of RSEI To ensure the accuracy of the RSEI data,
    the CHEQ of different cities in the study area in 2015 was selected to conduct
    the comparison. It can be seen from Figure 5a that the coefficient of determination
    reached 0.362, indicating that the RSEI used in this study is feasible. In addition,
    we performed correlation analysis between RSEI and four indicators (LST, NDBSI,
    NDVI, and WET) based on the seasonal scale, and the coefficients of determination
    were 0.586, 0.129, 0.747, and 0.251, respectively (Figure 5). RSEI was correlated
    with all four indicators and had the highest coefficient of determination with
    NDVI, which indicated that RSEI could be used to assess the ecology and environment
    of the study area. FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint RSEI verification
    results [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] Figure 6 shows
    the seasonal variation characteristics of RSEI in the study area and the three
    sub-regions. It can be seen from Figure 6a that the RSEI in the study area appeared
    to have an increased trend with a rate of 0.0035. For Shanxi Province, Ordos,
    and Shanbei, the variation value and mean value of the RSEI were 0.0025/0.508,
    0.0038/0.270, and 0.0052/0.438, respectively. In the study area, the best time
    for the ecology and environment was the summer of 2018, and the worst time for
    the ecology and environment was the spring of 2006. FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint RSEI statistics quarter by quarter [Colour figure can be viewed at
    wileyonlinelibrary.com] It appeared to have the same characteristics in seasonal
    variation of RSEI in the study area and the three sub-regions, that is, a unimodal
    distribution trend with the highest in summer and the smallest in spring and winter
    (Figure 6b). A big difference can be observed in RSEI for different regions, for
    example, Shanxi Province had the largest change and Ordos had the smallest change
    in the four seasons. The RSEI of Shanxi Province was obviously better than that
    of Shanbei and Ordos, and the RSEI of Shanbei was obviously better than that of
    Ordos in all four seasons. To better analyze the year-to-year changes of RSEI
    in the study area, according to existing research, we divided the RSEI into 5
    grades, excellent (0.8–1), good (0.6–0.8), moderate (0.4–0.6), fair (0.2–0.4),
    and poor (0.0–0.2) (Xu, Wang, et al., 2018). Figure S6 shows the year-by-year
    classification results of different levels of RSEI from 2002 to 2020. The ecology
    of the study area was improving year by year (p < 0.01), especially after 2010
    when the rate of change of RSEI became faster. The area occupied by fair and poor
    ecological grades was decreasing, while the area occupied by excellent grades
    was increasing. Combining the land cover types from 2002 to 2020 in Figure S7,
    we found an increase in grassland, forest land, and urban construction areas and
    a decrease in cultivated land and bare land. The reason for the changes in land
    structure may be that the country''s project of returning farmland to forests
    and grasslands in the north has achieved important results (Han et al., 2020;
    Zhang & Wu, 2020). Based on the least square spherical harmonic, the result of
    the RSEI time-series decomposition was shown in Figure S8. In the northeastern
    and southwestern parts of Shanbei, an obvious increase could be observed for RSEI,
    while it decreased in the northern part of Ordos and the southeastern part of
    Shanxi Province. The mean value of R2 was 0.752, indicating a good fit. The areas
    with high R2 were mainly distributed in Shanxi Province and the southern part
    of Shanbei, while the areas with low R2 were mainly located in the northwest of
    Ordos. For the semi-annual cycle amplitude, values below 0.1 were distributed
    in most areas. Moreover, the annual cycle amplitude of RSEI showed an increasing
    trend from northwest to southeast, which was consistent with the annual cycle
    amplitude of TWSA. The year-to-year stability and persistence of RSEI were calculated
    by using CV variance analysis and Hurst index analysis, and the results were shown
    in Figure 7. The coefficient of variation ranged from 0.029 to 0.293 with a mean
    value of 0.082, which illustrates a stable situation in the study area. The Hurst
    index ranged from 0.242 to 0.835. By the distribution of the Hurst index, we can
    know that 30.6% of the pixels in the study area will show the same change trend
    in the future, and they are mainly located in the central area of Ordos and in
    southern Shanxi Province. Meanwhile, 69.4% of the pixels will show the opposite
    trend in the future, and they are mainly located in the central area of the study
    area. FIGURE 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Year-by-year RSEI coefficient
    of variation and Hurst index [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
    4 DISCUSSION 4.1 Attribution of changes of GWSA Our results from GRACE and GLDAS
    gave us an overview of water storage from 2002 to 2020 in the coal mining area.
    According to the above analyses of water storage, we found TWSA decreased quickly
    in the study area and GWSA was the main part of TWSA. We used climate factors
    (e.g., precipitation, evapotranspiration, temperature) and human activities (e.g.,
    coal mining), which are regarded as important factors in the GWSA, to analyze
    the phenomenon. We explored the correlation and lag between GWSA and climate factors
    in different regions (Table 2). Under the premise of considering the hysteresis,
    the correlation coefficients between GWSA and P, ET, and T in Ordos were −0.370,
    −0.273, and −0.243, respectively, indicating a low relationship. Moreover, the
    correlation coefficients between GWSA and ET precipitation did not pass the significant
    test in Shanbei and Shanxi Province, indicating climate factors are not the main
    reason for the rapid decline in GWSA. TABLE 2. Correlation between GWSA and climate
    factors GWSA and P GWSA and ET GWSA and T All seasons Lag season 1 Lag season

    −0.088 −0.030 0.027 0.017 −0.019 0.015 0.021 * p < 0.05; ** p< 0.01. According
    to previous studies, coal mining water and agricultural irrigation water account
    for more than 70% of the total water consumption in the region (Chen et al., 2020;
    Xie et al., 2018). Previous studies have also shown that 0.87m3 of groundwater
    is consumed for every 1 ton of coal mining, which results in a large amount of
    groundwater consumption in the study area (Li et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2018).
    By calculation, coal mining water consumption in the study area in 2020 reached
    1.9712 billion m3, which was 1.6735 billion m3 higher than that in 2002. To further
    quantify this relationship, we analyzed the correlation between GWSA and coal
    mining water consumption and the correlation coefficient were −0.831, −0.488,
    −0.789, and −0.764 for the study area, Ordos, Shanbei, and Shanxi Province, respectively.
    In addition, it can be seen from Figure 1a that, relative to Ordos, Shanxi Province
    has a large area of arable land, which requires a large amount of water for agricultural
    irrigation. And through the statistical yearbook of water conservancy, the agricultural
    irrigation water in Ordos was about 27.4% of that in Shanxi Province. Under the
    dual effects of agricultural irrigation water and coal mining activities, the
    decline rate of GWSA in Shanxi Province is larger than that in Ordos, which is
    consistent with the study by Chen et al. (2020). According to our results, in
    the case of small fluctuations in climate factors in the study area, coal mining
    and agricultural irrigation are the main reasons for the continuous decline of
    groundwater, especially in the Taihang Mountains of eastern Shanxi province, which
    is consistent with the relevant studies (Chen et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2013).
    4.2 Impacts of water storage on ecology and environment To further understand
    the impacts of water storage on the ecology and environment, we examined the relationships
    and lag between RSEI and water storage in different regions on a seasonal scale
    (Table 3, Table 4, Table 5). In Ordos, SMS was significantly correlated with RSEI
    (r = 0.386), while GWSA had a negative correlation with RSEI (r = −0.419). In
    Shanbei, TWSA and GWSA had a negative correlation with the ecology and environment,
    and the correlation coefficients were −0.459 and −0.370 with 1 season and 2 seasons
    of delay, respectively. In Shanxi Province, the correlation coefficients between
    water storage and RSEI were low and did not pass the significant test. The results
    also showed TWSA, SWA, and GWSA could be important parameters in the study area
    in summer. According to Han et al. (2020), the negative correlation between GWSA
    and RSEI in the study area indicated that the growth of vegetation can also consume
    a large amount of groundwater when returning farmland to forest. TABLE 3. Correlation

    water source for the environment, soil moisture storage is closely related to
    vegetation growth, photosynthesis, and transpiration (Xu, Chen, et al., 2021).
    Nevertheless, the correlation coefficient between SMS and RSEI was low from the
    perspective of the study area (r = 0.128). Considering that SMA is a composite
    variable that includes 0–10, 10–40, and 40–100 cm, 100-200 cm soil moisture storage,
    and a previous study showed the 0–40 cm soil moisture had an important role in
    vegetation growth in arid regions (Zhang & Wu, 2020). Therefore, we extracted
    the 0–40 cm SMA through the GLDAS hydrological model. As can be seen from Figure
    S9, the 0–40 cm SMA showed an increasing trend with change rates of 0.180, 0.120,
    0.240, and 0.180 mm yr-1, and the correlation coefficients between the 0–40 cm
    SMA and RSEI on a seasonal scale were 0.537, 0.569, 0.483, 0.411 for the study
    area, Ordos, Shanbei, Shanxi Province, respectively. Previous studies have proved
    that precipitation can provide shallow soil moisture, which promotes vegetation
    growth in dryland ecosystems, which is consistent with the findings of this paper
    (Jiao et al., 2017). Above results showed that relative to TWSA and GWSA, the
    increase of 0-40 cm of soil water contributed to the growth of vegetation and
    further improved the ecology and environment. To evaluate the effects of water
    storage on RSEI in space, we further explored the correlation between water storage
    and RSEI on the seasonal scale based on pixels. The average correlation coefficient
    of the study area with RSEI were −0.202, 0.348, −0.231 and the significant pixels
    of the corresponding variable accounted 51.3%, 50.3%, and 54.2% for TWSA, 0–40 cm
    SMA, and GWSA in the study area, respectively. The regions with a positive correlation
    between SMA and RSEI were mainly concentrated in the southeast area of Ordos and
    the northern areas of Shanbei and Shanxi Province, where TWSA and GWSA had a negative
    influence on these regions (Figure 8). In recent years, this area has been a key
    area for returning farmland to forests and grasslands, and Figure 6 also shows
    that the ecology has improved significantly, and the area of grasslands and forests
    has increased, thus there is a large demand for water storage. FIGURE 8 Open in

    factors on ecology and environment Climate conditions have an inevitable impact
    on the ecology and environment (Chen et al., 2014). Tables 6–8 showed the relationship
    and lag between climate factors and RSEI in different regions on a seasonal scale.
    P, ET, and T had a positive influence on the RSEI in the three sub-regions. By
    comparing the correlation coefficients, we found that precipitation had the greatest
    impact on RSEI in Shanbei and Shanxi Province, and the correlation coefficients
    were 0.735 and 0.856, respectively. T had the greatest impact on RSEI in Ordo
    (r = 0.503), with 1 season of delay. In addition, climate factors and RSEI showed
    different relationships in different seasons in the study area. P had a strong
    relationship with RSEI in the summer, while T and ET had a strong relationship
    with RSEI in the spring. Studies have shown that the impacts of climate factors
    on the ecology and environment are stronger in spring and summer than in other
    seasons (Jiang et al., 2017). TABLE 6. Correlation between P and RSEI Spring Summer

    climate factors and RSEI on the seasonal scale were carried out based on pixels
    (Figure S10). The average correlation coefficients of the study area with RSEI
    were 0.560, 0.333, and 0.389 for P, T, and ET, respectively. And the significant
    pixels of the corresponding variable accounted for 90.9%, 79.0%, and 83.6%, respectively.
    P, ET, and T had a positive correlation with RSEI in the north of Shanxi Province
    and south of Shanbei, where TWSA and GWSA showed low correlation with RSEI, indicating
    climate factors are crucial for the improvement of the ecology and environment
    in this area. In addition, P, ET, and T had a negative influence on RSEI in the
    northwest of Ordos. The main land cover in this area is desert, accounting for
    about 40% of the City''s area, and the annual precipitation growth rate is slow,
    about 0.314 mm yr-1. In this area, the precipitation has evaporated before replenishing
    the vegetation root zone soil, so the ecological impact is small (Zhong et al.,
    2017). 5 CONCLUSIONS The high-intensity coal mining activities in Ordos, Shanbei,
    and Shanxi Province for many years have resulted in an uneven distribution of
    water resources and an extremely fragile ecology and environment, which is an
    important problem facing the region at present. In this paper, we analyzed the
    TWSA, SMA, and GWSA variation characteristics in the above three sub-regions from
    2002 to 2020. The TWSA of the whole study area appeared to have a decreased trend
    with a rate of −7.416 mm yr-1 and the change rates of TWSA were −1.032, −4.080,
    and −12.540 mm yr-1 for Ordos, Shanbei, and Shanxi Province, respectively. The
    SMA in the study area showed an increased trend with a rate of 0.840 mm yr-1 and
    the change rates of SMA were 0.456 mm yr-1, 1.044 mm yr-1, and 0.972 mm yr-1,
    respectively. The GWSA of the whole study area appeared to have a decreased trend
    with a rate of −8.268 mm yr-1 and the change rates of GWSA were −1.488, −5.148
    and −13.512 mm yr-1, respectively. According to the variation trend and correlation
    analysis of water storage, GWSA is the main part in the changes of TWSA. Therefore,
    we explored the possible causes of GWSA change and found climate factors are not
    the main causes of the change in GWSA in the coal mining area, but the high-intensity
    coal mining activities and artificial irrigation activities, especially in the
    Taihang Mountains in eastern Shanxi Province. To study the ecological status of
    the region more comprehensively, we chose RSEI as the evaluation of the ecological
    environment for the coal mining area and verified it in two ways and found RSEI
    to be believable. The RSEI in the study area appeared to have an increased trend
    with a rate of 0.0035. The change rates of RSEI were 0.0025, 0.0038, and 0.0052
    for Shanxi Province, Ordos, and Shanbei, respectively. RSEI had obvious seasonal
    variation characteristics, showing a unimodal distribution trend with the highest
    in summer and the smallest in spring and winter. We explored the impacts of water
    storage on the ecology and environment through correlation analysis and found
    although the TWSA and GWSA showed a decreasing trend in high-intensity coal mining,
    the 0-40 cm soil moisture storage showed an increasing trend, which has played
    a pivotal role in promoting vegetation growth on a seasonal scale. In addition,
    precipitation, evapotranspiration, and temperature also played a key role in the
    improvement of the ecology and environment, especially in the north of Shanxi
    Province and the south of Shanbei. Meanwhile, we found water storage and precipitation
    had a strong relationship with RSEI in summer, while T and ET had a strong relationship
    with RSEI in spring. Based on multi-source remote sensing data, this paper can
    effectively explore the relationship between water storage, the ecology and environment
    in high-intensity coal mining areas. However, due to the large temporal and spatial
    resolution of GRACE data and MODIS data, the analysis of small areas needs further
    research. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS Jinbao Jiang and Fei Yang conceived and designed

  description: 'Soil moisture is a key parameter for the circulation of water and
    energy exchange between surface and the atmosphere, playing an important role
    in hydrology, agriculture, and meteorology. Traditional methods for monitoring
    soil moisture suffer from spatial discontinuity, time-consuming processes, and
    high costs. Remote sensing technology enables the non-destructive and efficient
    retrieval of land information, allowing rapid soil moisture monitoring to schedule
    crop irrigation and evaluate the irrigation efficiency. Satellite data with different
    resolutions provide different observation scales. Evaluating the accuracy of estimating
    soil moisture based on open and free satellite data, as well as exploring the
    comprehensiveness and adaptability of different satellites for soil moisture temporal
    and spatial observations, are important research contents of current soil moisture
    monitoring. The study utilized three types of satellite data, namely GF-1, Landsat-8,
    and GF-4, with respective temporal and spatial resolutions of 16 m (every 4 days),
    30 m (every 16 days), and 50 m (daily). The gray relational analysis (GRA) was
    employed to identify vegetation indices that selected sensitivity to soil moisture
    at varying depths (3 cm, 10 cm, and 20 cm). Then, this study employed random forest
    (RF), Extra Tree (ETr), and linear regression (LR) algorithms to estimate soil
    moisture at different depths with optical satellite data sources. The results
    showed that the accuracy of soil moisture estimation was different at different
    growth stages. The model accuracy exhibited an upward trend during the middle
    and late growth stages, coinciding with higher vegetation coverage; however, it
    demonstrated a decline in accuracy during the early and late growth stages due
    to either the absence or limited presence of vegetation. Among the three satellite
    images, the vegetation indices derived from GF-1 exhibited were more sensitive
    to vegetation characteristics and demonstrated superior soil moisture estimation
    accuracy (with R2 ranging 0.129–0.928, RMSE ranging 0.017–0.078), followed by
    Landsat-8 (with R2 ranging 0.117–0.862, RMSE ranging 0.017–0.088). The soil moisture
    estimation accuracy of GF-4 was the worst (with R2 ranging 0.070–0.921, RMSE ranging
    0.020–0.140). Thus, GF-1 is suitable for vegetated areas. In addition, the ETr
    model outperformed the other models in both accuracy and stability (ETr model:
    R2 ranging from 0.117 to 0.928, RMSE ranging from 0.021 to 0.091; RF model: R2
    ranging from 0.225 to 0.926, RMSE ranging from 0.019 to 0.085; LR model: R2 ranging
    from 0.048 to 0.733, RMSE ranging from 0.030 to 0.144). Utilizing GF-1 is recommended
    to construct the ETr model for assessing soil moisture variations in the farming
    land of northern China. Therefore, in cases where there are limited ground sample
    data, it is advisable to utilize high-spatiotemporal-resolution remote sensing
    data, along with machine learning algorithms such as ETr and RF, which are suitable
    for small samples, for soil moisture estimation.'

  explanation: This study combined multi-source remote sensing (Landsat-8, GF-1, and
    GF-4) data and machine learning algorithms to predict soil moisture at various
    depths, ranging from 3 cm to 20 cm. The authors evaluated the performance of these
    algorithms based on accuracy metrics and the ability to capture soil moisture
    dynamics across a growing season. Random forest (RF), extra trees (ETR), and linear
    regression (LR) algorithms were employed, with ETR emerging as the most suitable
    for predicting soil moisture. The authors identified GF-1 as the optimal satellite
    data source due to its high resolution and suitability for vegetated areas, and
    suggest that integrating GF-1 data with ETR or RF algorithms can provide accurate
    soil moisture estimates in farming regions with limited ground sample data.

    remote sensing; machine learning; farming land 1. Introduction Soil moisture is
    an essential parameter in the fields of hydrology, meteorology, and agricultural
    science. It plays a crucial role in controlling surface evapotranspiration and
    vegetation photosynthesis, and serves as a link between the groundwater, surface
    water, and atmospheric water in the hydrological cycle [1,2]. It has significant
    implications in global water cycle, energy balance, and climate change research.
    Therefore, the timely and accurate monitoring of soil moisture is of great importance
    for agriculture, the water cycle, and related aspects. The real-time monitoring
    of soil moisture at large regional scales is an essential indicator in modern
    agriculture. Comprehensive soil moisture monitoring plays a crucial and guiding
    role in crop yield, drought assessment, and precise irrigation decision making
    [3]. The measurement of soil moisture poses challenges due to its pronounced spatiotemporal
    variability [4]. Conventional techniques employed for soil moisture monitoring,
    such as the gravimetric method, time domain reflectometry, and neutron probe,
    are limited to capturing singular or localized measurements. The methods, as a
    result, demonstrate spatial discontinuity, necessitate time-consuming procedures,
    entail substantial expenses, and are susceptible to the influence of external
    conditions on measurement accuracy [5]. Remote sensing technology encompasses
    real-time monitoring, extensive coverage, and cost-effectiveness, endowing it
    with indispensable utility in the domain of soil moisture assessment. Currently,
    soil moisture retrieval using remote sensing methods can be broadly classified
    into two categories based on the data sources employed: microwave remote sensing
    and optical remote sensing. Microwave remote sensing employs microwave equipment
    to detect and capture the electromagnetic radiation and scattering characteristics
    of a target object within the microwave frequency range, facilitating the identification
    of distant objects, and possesses the capability to penetrate through vegetation
    and effectively detect subsurface targets. Despite its independence from cloud
    cover, the limited spatial and temporal resolution of microwave remote sensing
    poses challenges for its widespread application in precision agriculture. Optical
    remote sensing exhibits high spatial and temporal resolution, and can detect the
    differences in absorption characteristics between soil and water in the visible
    and near-infrared bands, and uses this difference to monitor soil moisture [6],
    which presents significant advantages in the domains of agricultural irrigation,
    crop growth monitoring, and yield prediction. But optical remote sensing is susceptible
    to weather. In a recent investigation conducted by Fan et al. [7], the scholars
    employed the triple collocation analysis approach, with GLDAS data as the reference,
    to discern the accuracy of soil moisture products derived from microwave remote
    sensing datasets, namely SMOS, SMAP, AMSR2, and FY-3C. Yao et al. [8] employed
    the Optical Gradient Model (OPTRAM) for soil moisture retrieval and generated
    irrigation district maps for the arid and semi-arid regions in northwest China
    spanning the past 30 years. Microwave remote sensing presents notable advantages,
    including high temporal resolution and broad swath coverage. Nevertheless, its
    utility is impeded by its coarse spatial resolution, exemplified by AMSR-E with
    a resolution of 5 km and SMOS with a resolution of 50 km [9]. Active microwave
    sensors, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), exhibit spatial resolutions ranging
    from 10 to 100 m, but they have a relatively low spatial resolution [10]. Optical
    remote sensing overcomes the limitations of traditional soil moisture monitoring
    in terms of low efficiency and high cost. It also provides higher spatiotemporal
    resolution, and thus it is increasingly applied in regional-scale soil moisture
    monitoring [11,12,13]. Nie et al. [6] calculated PDI, MPDI, and VAPDI using GF-1
    and Landsat-8 satellites to construct a soil moisture inversion model for the
    0–30 cm depth. The results showed that NIR-R spectral indices exhibited greater
    sensitivity to surface soil moisture. Liu et al. [13] utilized random forest (RF)
    regression to optimize the sensitivity of Sentinel-2 spectral bands to soil moisture
    at the 0–5 cm depth and constructed SMMI and PDI in different feature spaces.
    The outcomes demonstrated that Sentinel-2 effectively estimated surface soil moisture
    at the 0–5 cm depth in complex agricultural environments. The soil moisture content
    within the root zone (0–15 cm) exerts a profound influence on crop physiological
    states. Theoretically, it can be indirectly assessed through the analysis of crop
    canopy reflectance or vegetation indices [14,15]. The relationship between soil
    moisture content and vegetation spectra is intricate, posing challenges for classical
    regression methods in achieving unbiased and effective parameter estimation [16,17].
    The machine learning method has significant advantages in addressing complex relationships
    such as nonlinearity and heteroscedasticity, and it has been widely applied in
    remote sensing. This method has emerged as a pivotal research focus within agricultural
    remote sensing, showcasing remarkable performance in modeling and inversion studies
    [18,19,20,21]. Cheng et al. [22] explored the performance of soil moisture inversion
    at different soil depths and vegetation cover levels based on Landsat-8 satellite
    data and the RF algorithm. The results showed that soil moisture inversion reaped
    optimal outcomes specifically beneath low-density grassland cover. Adab et al.
    [23] used Landsat-8 data to establish SVM, ANN, EN, and RF soil water inversion
    models on land utilization categories in semi-arid Iran, and the results indicated
    that the RF model had the highest accuracy in estimating soil moisture at a depth
    of 5 cm. Owing to its superlative predictive and classificatory prowess, the RF
    model has been widely adopted for unraveling non-linear associations across an
    array of disciplines. Machine learning has been effectively employed for soil
    moisture prediction based on remote sensing data. However, there are still some
    special cases of interest in terms of using machine learning in remotely sensed
    soil moisture estimation. The accuracy of soil moisture estimation by machine
    learning is influenced by the size of the sample and the optimization of machine
    learning hyperparameters. In addition, evaluating the accuracy of estimating soil
    moisture using open and freely accessible satellite data, as well as exploring
    the comprehensiveness and adaptability of different satellites for temporal and
    spatial observations, is an important research focus in current soil moisture
    monitoring. Currently, there is an increasing availability of free high temporal-spatial
    resolution satellite data. However, limited research has been conducted on the
    utilization of diverse satellite data for constructing soil moisture models, evaluating
    model estimation accuracy, and comprehensively assessing the spatiotemporal coverage
    and applicability of satellites in soil moisture assessment. The accurate and
    rapid estimation of regional soil moisture enables the elucidation of spatial
    and temporal heterogeneity, thereby enhancing our understanding of the regional
    water cycle process. It is also serves as a valuable reference for implementing
    agricultural management strategies, making informed decisions regarding agricultural
    irrigation, and effectively managing regional water resources. Multispectral satellites
    have high spatiotemporal resolution. There have been few studies on harnessing
    the potential of these satellites to cultivate machine-learning-driven soil moisture
    inversion models. In this study, a variety of vegetation indices were calculated
    based on the reflectance of different remote sensing satellites (GF-1, Landsat-8
    and GF-4). Then we employed Gray Correlation Analysis (GRA) to select sensitive
    vegetation indices for soil moisture at different depths in the study area. And,
    we utilized the RF, ETr, and linear regression (LR) machine learning algorithms
    to construct soil moisture estimation models at different depths. The objective
    of this study was to analyze the adaptability of freely available satellite images
    for soil moisture estimation, evaluate the accuracy performance of different machine
    learning algorithms in estimating soil moisture, investigate the temporal and
    spatial distribution patterns of soil moisture in Shandian River basin, and validate
    the potential application of domestic remote sensing satellite data in precision
    agriculture. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area The Shandian River Basin
    is located in northern China, originates from the northern foothills of the Bayan-Gol-Tu
    Mountains in Hebei Province, and is situated within the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
    Region (115.5°E–116.5°E, 41.5°N–42.5°N). Serving as a vital water source conservation
    area in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, it exhibits a pronounced agricultural-pastoral-forestry
    ecotone. The study area is relatively flat with an altitude of 1300~1400 m, belonging
    to the temperate continental climate. The average annual precipitation in most
    areas is 300~500 mm, and the rainfall is mostly concentrated from July to September.
    Referred to as a typical seasonal frost region, this area is characterized by
    arid and cold winters. The dominant land cover types include croplands, grasslands,
    and forests, with minor extents of shrubs and bare land [24]. The study area was
    depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1. Shandian river basin and ground measured sites.
    2.2. Data Sources and Processing 2.2.1. Ground Data This study utilized the soil
    temperature and moisture wireless sensor network observation dataset of the Shandian
    River Basin (2019) [25]. The dataset includes in situ measurements of soil moisture,
    soil temperature, and precipitation from 34 stations in the Shandian River Basin.
    The monitoring network encompasses an extensive area of approximately 10,000 km2
    (115.5°E–116.5°E, 41.5°N–42.5°N) and was strategically deployed within the basin
    using an optimized deployment approach. The soil volumetric moisture content and
    soil temperature at five measured depths (3 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm, and 50 cm)
    were continuously monitored at each site using Decagon 5TM soil moisture sensors
    (Austria, Pessl Instruments, Weiz, Austria). The HOBO rain gauge was used to monitor
    rainfall. The Shandian River Basin, where the sensors were deployed, is characterized
    by a predominantly flat topography and is primarily covered by grasslands and
    croplands. Once the measurement data stabilized, soil samples were collected periodically
    for each soil layer at each station. These samples were analyzed for parameters
    such as gravimetric/volumetric water content, bulk density, and soil texture to
    calibrate the raw measurement data. In this study, the soil moisture data from
    the surface layer at depths of 3 cm, 10 cm, and 20 cm were selected as the ground
    truth measurements. 2.2.2. Satellite Data and Preprocessing GF-1 is the first
    high-resolution satellite for Earth observation in China, equipped with a panchromatic/multispectral
    camera (PMS sensor) and a multispectral camera (WFV sensor). It offers a revisit
    cycle of 4 days, capturing multispectral images with 4 bands at a spatial resolution
    of 16 m [26]. Landsat-8, the eighth installment of the renowned Landsat program
    by the United States, carries an Operational Land Imager (OLI) and a Thermal Infrared
    Sensor (TIRS). Its revisit cycle spans 16 days, with OLI data consisting of 8
    bands at a spatial resolution of 15 m for panchromatic images and 30 m for multispectral
    images [27]. GF-4, a Chinese geostationary orbit remote sensing satellite, employs
    a push-broom imaging technique, providing the advantages of high temporal resolution
    and relatively higher spatial resolution. It carries a multispectral camera and
    a thermal infrared camera. The PMS multispectral data of GF-4 consists of 5 bands
    with a spatial resolution of 50 m [28]. These satellite datasets can be freely
    accessed and downloaded (GF-1 and GF-4 data download address: https://data.cresda.cn,
    accessed on 30, June 2022, Landsat-8 data download address: http://glovis.usgs.gov/,
    accessed on 22, July 2022). Table 1 presents the band information for each satellite
    sensor. To prepare the satellite imagery for analysis, several preprocessing steps
    are necessary, including radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, orthorectification,
    and image registration, as illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2. Flowchart of the
    soil moisture retrieval based on GF-1, Landsat-8, and GF-4. Table 1. Satellite
    data used in this study. This study selected cloud-free remote sensing images
    from GF-1, Landsat-8, and GF-4 satellites. Four remote sensing images were selected
    for each satellite according to the 4 growth stages of the plants and the underlying
    vegetation (Table 2) [29]. The study area primarily comprises agricultural land
    and grassland, encompassing crops such as carrots and potatoes. Due to the differences
    in phenology among different kinds of vegetation, the growth cycle of vegetation
    can be categorized into four stages: the early growth stage indicates the seedling
    phase, middle growth stage signifies rapid growth, late growth stage represents
    maturity, and end growth stage denotes completion. Table 2. Image selection of
    GF-1, Landsat-8, and GF-4 satellite. 2.2.3. Remote Sensing Vegetation Indices
    This study calculated soil moisture spectral indices at different growth stages
    and depths, eliminating the influence of vegetation growth, based on a total of
    18 different bands from GF-1, Landsat-8, and GF-4. Representative spectral indices
    (20 in total) that are correlated with soil moisture were selected. The specific
    calculation formulas could be found in Table 3. Table 3. Vegetation index summary.
    2.3. Methodology 2.3.1. Gray Relational Analysis Gray Relational Analysis (GRA)
    serves as a valuable tool for assessing the correlation and strength of association
    between variables. It provides an effective approach for analyzing, modeling,
    and predicting systems with limited information, thereby reducing the need for
    a large number of samples [49,50]. The basic idea is to identify the primary and
    secondary relationships among factors in the system by calculating the degree
    of association between variables, thus determining the most influential factor.
    To ensure precise outcomes, the data are subjected to mean normalization prior
    to computing the correlation coefficient, thereby mitigating errors arising from
    disparate dimensions [51]. The main steps involved in calculating gray correlation
    degree (GCD) are as follows: Given that the reference sequence X0 = {x0(k), k
    = 1, 2, …, n}, and the compared sequence is Xi = {x0(k), k = 1, 2, …, n}. The
    formula for calculating the GCD between X0 and Xi is as follows: 𝐺𝐶𝐷= 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑖=1
    𝑛 𝛾( 𝑥 0 (𝑘),  𝑥 𝑖 (𝑘)) (1) 𝛾( 𝑥 0 (𝑘), 𝑥 𝑖 (𝑘))= min 𝑖  min 𝑘 | 𝑥 0 (𝑘)− 𝑥 𝑖
    (𝑘)|+𝜌 max 𝑖  max 𝑘 | 𝑥 0 (𝑘)− 𝑥 𝑖 (𝑘)| | 𝑥 0 (𝑘)− 𝑥 𝑖 (𝑘)|+𝜌 max 𝑖  max 𝑘 | 𝑥
    0 (𝑘)− 𝑥 𝑖 (𝑘)| (2) where ρ is the resolution coefficient, taken as 0.5. 2.3.2.
    Machine Learning Algorithms Machine learning has significant advantages in handling
    intricate relationships, including non-linearity and heteroscedasticity. Ensemble
    learning, by constructing and combining multiple machine learning models, aims
    to obtain a more comprehensive and robust supervised model with better learning
    accuracy [52,53]. In this study, we have employed bagging models, namely random
    forest (RF) and Extra Trees (ETr), in conjunction with the widely utilized linear
    regression (LR) algorithm, to establish the estimation model. The RF and ETr both
    rely on decision tree algorithm. The RF algorithm is a non-parametric machine
    learning algorithm that utilizes multiple decision trees trained on samples and
    integrates their predictions. It achieves this by randomly sampling observations
    and feature variables from the modeling dataset. Each sampling generates a tree,
    and each tree generates rules and decision values that are specific to its own
    characteristics. The random forest algorithm combines the rules and decision values
    from all decision trees in the forest to achieve regression [16]. For this study,
    n_estimators and max_depth were set to 200 and 50, respectively. (1) By employing
    bootstrap resampling, a set of n training samples was generated, which is equivalent
    in size to the original dataset. Subsequently, n regression trees were constructed
    {h (x, θn), n = 1, 2, …, N}, The formula is as follows: ℎ(𝑥)= 1 𝑄 ∑ 𝑛=1 𝑁 ℎ(𝑥,
    𝜃 𝑛 ) (3) where θn is an independent equally distributed random variable; n represents
    number of regression trees; and h(x) represents regression trees. (2) The process
    of regression tree growth involves each split node randomly selecting a feature
    subset consisting of variables from the entire set of variables, and pruning is
    not required during the splitting process. (3) During each bootstrap resampling,
    the unsampled data were utilized to estimate the internal error and determine
    the significance. Taking xp (p = 1, 2, 3, 4) as input data, the importance score
    of the q-th tree is as follows: 𝐼( 𝑥 𝑝 )= ∑ 𝑛=1 𝑁 𝐼 𝑛 ( 𝑥 𝑝 )/𝑁 (4) where xp represents
    input variable; I(·) represents discriminant function. The ETr algorithm, similar
    to random forests, demonstrates high randomness. It incorporates stochastic features
    and random thresholds for node partitioning in decision trees, thereby introducing
    greater and more diverse variations in the architecture of each tree. It has few
    key parameters and utilizes reasonable heuristic methods for parameter configuration.
    Each decision tree in ETr uses the original training set, resulting in faster
    training speed and stable results in the presence of outliers and noise in the
    training data [54]. ETr not only enhances the randomness of decision trees but
    also improves the accuracy of suboptimal solutions and the flexibility of solution
    computation [55]. The algorithm utilizes the training data sample as the input
    for each base classifier, and employs the Gini coefficient to select optimal features
    for node splitting until a decision tree is constructed. The final decision is
    obtained by iteratively constructing a multitude of decision trees. For this study,
    n_estimators and max_depth were set to 150 and 10, respectively. The formula is
    as follows: 𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑖=1− ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑝 2 𝑛 (5) 𝑦= argmax 𝑖=1,2,…,𝑛 ∑ 𝑚=1 𝑀 𝜆( 𝑦 𝑚 =𝑖) (6)
    where pn represents the probability that the selected sample belongs to category
    n. ym = i means that the output result of the fault classification of the m-th
    decision tree is i. The LR algorithm is the simplest and most foundational form
    of supervised learning in machine learning, which can be divided into simple linear
    regression and multiple linear regression. By analyzing the loss function or utility
    function associated with the problem, the LR algorithm strives to determine the
    optimal model through the optimization of said function. Traditionally, the least
    squares method is employed to minimize the loss function [56]. Nevertheless, the
    least squares method encounters limitations when applied to large datasets. Its
    loss function is as follows. In this study, we opted for the gradient descent
    method to minimize the loss function within the LR algorithm, offering an effective
    alternative. (𝑤*,𝑏*)=arg min (𝑤,𝑏) ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 (𝑤 𝑥 𝑖 +𝑏+ 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 (7) where w and
    b are the parameters of the first order equation; yi represents true value. 2.3.3.
    Model Evaluation In this study, the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean
    square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) were employed as evaluation
    metrics to assess the accuracy of the model. The specific expressions are as follows:

    the total number of data points. The higher R2 is close to 1, the better models
    perform; the closer RMSE and MAE are to 0, the smaller the models’ simulation
    error. 3. Results 3.1. Sensitive Vegetation Index Selection of Soil Moisture Based
    on GRA In this study, GRA was conducted to explore the relationship between vegetation
    indices derived from multi-source satellite data (GF-1, Landsat-8 and GF-4) and
    soil moisture at varying depths of 3 cm, 10 cm, and 20 cm. The GCD values were
    used to assess the correlation between vegetation indices and soil moisture at
    different depths. The top five vegetation indices ranked by GCD were selected
    as input variables for modeling. The GCD between vegetation indices from different
    stages of GF-1, Landsat-8, and GF-4 satellites and soil moisture at different
    depths was shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. Heat map of gray correlation degree between
    soil moisture and different vegetation indices based on different satellites.
    (a–c) show the heat maps of GF-1, Landsat-8, and GF-4. Figure 3a illustrated a
    ranked GCD heatmap derived from a GF-1 satellite. Table 4 presents the vegetation
    indices that exhibited high sensitivity to soil moisture at different depths,
    as determined by the GCD analysis using GF-1 data. From Figure 3a and Table 4,
    it can be observed that the GCD between vegetation indices and soil moisture varied
    across each growth period. Overall, NR, IPVI, and GLI showed a higher correlation
    with soil moisture in the early stage, while EVI exhibited good correlation with
    soil moisture at different depths in the middle of the growth stage. On the other
    hand, RI, VARI, and WDRVI exhibited lower correlation rankings across all time
    periods. Table 4. Screening results of VIs variables based on GRA. In Figure 3b,
    the heatmap illustrated the ranking of the GCD between Landsat-8 vegetation indices
    and soil moisture across different growth stages. In the middle growth stage,
    there was a significant difference in the GCD ranking between vegetation indices
    and soil moisture at different depths. This could be attributed to the vigorous
    growth of crops during this period, resulting in substantial variations in soil
    moisture at different depths due to their heightened water uptake efficiency.
    In the early growth stage, WDRVI and NR derived from Landsat-8 exhibited good
    correlation with soil moisture at different depths. However, during the peak growth
    period in August, these vegetation indices showed significant differences in sensitivity
    to soil moisture at different depths. Towards the late stages of plant growth,
    GLI demonstrated a stronger association with soil moisture at different depths,
    while the WDRVI ranked lower in terms of correlation. Figure 3c displays the heatmap
    depicting the GCD rankings between GF-4 vegetation indices and soil moisture at
    different depths. Table 4 presents the curated selection of soil-moisture-sensitive
    vegetation indices derived from GF-4 data. During the vigorous growth stage of
    plants, RVI derived from GF-4 exhibited good correlation with soil moisture at
    different depths. In the late growth stage, GLI demonstrated heightened sensitivity
    to soil moisture. However, EVI, RI, TVI, and VARI consistently exhibited lower
    GCD rankings across different growth stages and soil depths, indicative of their
    diminished responsiveness to soil moisture variations. In conclusion, it could
    be concluded that the correlation between vegetation indices derived from the
    three satellite and soil moisture varied during different periods. RI and VARI
    consistently ranked lower in GCD during all growth stages. The spectral characteristics
    of plant leaves are determined by their internal cellular structure, which accounts
    for this phenomenon. The multiple reflections between the cell walls and cell
    gaps result in high reflectance in the near-infrared band. Due to the absence
    of the NIR band in RI and VARI, their responsiveness to the water content of vegetation
    is weakened. As a result, these indices demonstrated relatively low sensitivity
    to variations in soil moisture. 3.2. Estimation of Soil Moisture at Different
    Depths Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data and Machine Learning Methods The
    results of soil moisture estimation in early, middle, late, and end growth stages
    are presented in Table 5, Table 6, Table 7 and Table 8. The soil moisture estimation
    model based on GF-1 was the most accurate (with R2 ranging 0.129–0.928, RMSE ranging
    0.017–0.078), followed by Landsat-8 (with R2 ranging 0.117–0.862, RMSE ranging
    0.017–0.088), while the soil moisture estimation model based on GF-4 showed relatively
    lower accuracy (with R2 ranging 0.070–0.921, RMSE ranging 0.020–0.140). For the
    three machine learning models, both the ETr model and the RF model displayed similar
    accuracy (the R2 of ETr model ranged from 0.117 to 0.928, RMSE ranging from 0.021
    to 0.091; The R2 of RF model ranged from 0.225 to 0.926, RMSE ranging from 0.019
    to 0.085), while the LR model was the least accurate (R2 ranging from 0.048 to
    0.733, RMSE ranging from 0.030 to 0.144). The accuracy of soil moisture estimation
    models varied across different soil depths, with the optimum performance observed
    at a depth of 3 cm. Table 5. Soil moisture estimation model in early growth stage.
    Table 6. Soil moisture estimation model in middle growth stage. Table 7. Soil
    moisture estimation model in late growth stage. Table 8. Soil moisture estimation
    model at end of the growth stage. In the early growth stage, the soil moisture
    estimation models based on Landsat-8 and GF-4 exhibited inadequate accuracy and
    instability at different depths. This could be attributed to the lower spatial
    resolution of these two satellites compared to GF-1, as well as the relatively
    limited vegetation coverage in the early growth stage, which resulted in restricted
    spectral reflectance capabilities and the overfitting of the estimation models.
    In the middle growth stage, the underlying vegetation experiences vigorous growth,
    resulting in higher vegetation coverage and stronger spectral reflectance. Consequently,
    the models demonstrated better estimation accuracy and stability compared to other
    growth stages. In the late growth stage, the vegetation reached the later growth
    phase, resulting in reduced vegetation coverage compared to the peak growth phase,
    which led to the decreased accuracy and stability of the models. At the end growth
    stage, the soil moisture estimation models based on three satellites showed noticeable
    instability. As the depth increased, both the accuracy and stability of the models
    deteriorated. Due to the decrease in plant coverage at the end of the growing
    stage and weak spectral reflectance, there was a decline in the correlation between
    vegetation index and soil moisture. Additionally, the soil moisture estimation
    models based on Landsat-8 and GF-4 satellites exhibited significant overfitting,
    possibly due to their lower spatial resolution, which resulted in model instability.
    In conclusion, the GF-1 satellite had better spatial resolution than Landsat-8
    and GF-4; it had better accuracy and stability in soil moisture estimation models
    in four different stages, and it was suitable for vegetated areas. The accuracy
    of RF was close to that of the ETr model, but the RF model exhibited a poorer
    stability and was more prone to to overfitting. The models performed best in estimating
    soil moisture at a depth of 3 cm, while their accuracy decreased and instability
    increased at a depth of 20 cm. Additionally, compared to GF-1 and Landsat-8 satellite
    imagery, the retrieval results based on the GF-4 satellite were inferior due to
    its lower resolution. Moreover, as the vegetation coverage decreased, the accuracy
    of machine learning models in inverting soil moisture was significantly decreased.
    3.3. Comprehensive Evaluation of Soil Moisture Estimation Accuracy Based on Different
    Remote Sensing Imagery and Machine Learning Models Figure 4 shows the R2 for soil
    moisture estimation at depths of 3 cm, 10 cm, and 20 cm using different satellites.
    It can be observed that at a depth of 3 cm, the modeling and validation R2 values
    for GF-1, Landsat-8, and GF-4 were generally higher for all models when vegetation
    coverage was relatively high. The models with GF-1 had good fitting results at
    different depths. As the depth increased, the R2 for both training and testing
    stages declined, accompanied by an increase in RMSE. Moreover, the models were
    prone to overfitting in the testing phase, leading to diminished stability. Therefore,
    machine learning models based on vegetation indices performed well in estimating
    surface soil moisture (3 cm and 10 cm depths) in the periods of high vegetation
    coverage. Figure 4. R2 of 3 cm, 10 cm, and 20 cm soil moisture estimation based
    on different satellites. (a) R2 of 3 cm depth based on GF-1, (b) R2 of 3 cm depth
    based on Landsat-8, (c) R2 of 3 cm depth based on GF-4, (d) R2 of 10 cm depth
    based on GF-1, (e) R2 of 10 cm depth based on Landsat-8, (f) R2 of 10 cm depth
    based on GF-4, (g) R2 of 20 cm depth based on GF-1, (h) R2 of 20 cm depth based
    on Landsat-8, and (i) R2 of 20 cm depth based on GF-4. Figure 4 and Table 5, Table
    6, Table 7 and Table 8 show that the ETr model based on GF-1, Landsat-8, and GF-4
    generally outperformed the RF and LR models in terms of R2 at different depths.
    Additionally, the ET model displays relatively smaller RMSE. Although the RF model
    demonstrated comparable R2 and RMSE in training stage, it tended to experience
    heightened instances of overfitting in the testing stage, resulting in lower model
    stability. The LR model showed good generalization ability at different depths
    and periods, but its predicting accuracy was relatively low. In conclusion, the
    ETr model had good estimation accuracy and stability. What’s more, the models
    based on the three satellites had similar RMSEs in different stages. However,
    the R2 values of Landsat-8 and GF-4 were lower than those of GF-1. Specifically,
    all models showed signs of overfitting based on Landsat-8 when vegetation coverage
    was low. The acquisition time of the three satellite images were close in the
    latter two growth stages, so we analyzed the accuracy of each model. The results
    showed that GF-4 had the poorest estimation accuracy because it had the lowest
    resolution, and the models were overfitting at each soil depth. Conversely, GF-1
    exhibited the highest estimation accuracy, albeit with a relatively mild degree
    of overfitting. GF-1 was suitable for vegetated areas, and had high resolution,
    high accuracy and strong model stability in different levels of vegetation coverage,
    so it was suitable for retrieving soil moisture at a depth of 3 cm and 10 cm.
    3.4. Spatial and Temporal Distribution of Soil Moisture in Shandian River Basin
    This study found that the ETr model based on GF-1 exhibited good accuracy in estimating
    soil moisture at different depths in the farming land of northern China. Therefore,
    the ETr model constructed by GF-1 was employed to simulate the spatial distribution
    of soil moisture at various depths in the basin (Figure 5). The study area spans
    from the southwest to the northeast, encompassing diverse surface types including
    wetlands, crops, grasslands, and woodlands. As can be seen from Figure 5, regions
    characterized by higher soil moisture were predominantly concentrated in the central
    and southern parts of the study area during the early, middle, and late growth
    stages. The main land use types in these regions are farmland and grassland, characterized
    by a high vegetation cover and a well-developed water system, so these regions
    are the main agricultural production area of the Shandian River basin. Furthermore,
    crops in these growing stages would have the corresponding irrigation measures,
    resulting in higher soil moisture levels. In the end growth stage, the high values
    of soil moisture were mainly concentrated in the northern region, while the low
    values were mainly distributed in the southern farmland region. This was because
    the land use type in the northern region is grassland and wetland, which had a
    good soil water retention capacity. Additionally, as crops in the southern region
    entered the late growth stage without corresponding irrigation measures and with
    a decline in vegetation coverage, soil moisture was relatively impacted by surface
    evapotranspiration, resulting in lower levels of soil water during this period.
    In summary, the study area exhibited significant spatiotemporal variation in soil
    moisture, which was closely associated with land use types. Figure 5. Spatial
    and temporal distribution of soil moisture at different depths in farming land
    of northern China based on GF-1 data and ETr model. Moreover, the spatial distribution
    of soil moisture at depths of 3 cm, 10 cm, and 20 cm exhibited significant differences
    during the same period, while there was little difference in the spatial distribution
    of soil water between depths of 10 cm and 20 cm. The soil moisture at depths of
    3 cm, 10 cm, and 20 cm exhibited lower values during the early and middle growth
    stages, reached its peak in the late growth stage, and declined to its lowest
    level towards the end of the growth stage. This was attributed to the higher water
    demand during the early and middle stages of vigorous crop growth resulting in
    low soil water content. In the late growth stage, water requirements decreased
    as crops reach maturity, and precipitation occurred prior to image acquisition,
    so the soil moisture was relatively high. At the end of the growth stage, no irrigation
    measures were implemented in the study area, and considering the approaching winter
    season, arid climate with reduced rainfall, soil moisture was relatively low with
    insignificant spatial distribution differences compared to the other growth stages.
    4. Discussion 4.1. The Sensitive Vegetation Indices of Different Screening Periods
    Are Obviously Different In this study, we used R, G, B, and NIR bands of GF-1,
    Landsat-8, and GF-4 to calculate vegetation indices at different time periods.
    Then, we employed GRA to select the vegetation indices that were sensitive to
    soil moisture at different depths. The COSRI index derived from GF-1 exhibited
    robust correlation with soil moisture at different depths in different periods,
    showing high accuracy in the estimation of soil moisture. However, Landsat-8 and
    GF-4 satellites showed different sensitive vegetation indices in different periods.
    The estimation models of these satellites showed overfitting issues in April and
    October when vegetation coverage was relatively low. The selection of sensitive
    vegetation indices varied among different periods due to the factors influencing
    the reflectance of green plant leaves, which differ significantly in the visible
    and NIR bands. The water demand of crops varies during different growth stages,
    and changes in underlying surface conditions also impact soil moisture. Therefore,
    the trends and magnitudes of reflectance changes in different spectral bands do
    not align perfectly, resulting in significant differences in vegetation indices
    constructed based on different spectral bands in different periods [5,57]. Additionally,
    the vegetation coverage of the underlying surface varies within the growth stages.
    Vegetation began to grow in April, and gradually withered into the seasonal frozen
    soil period at the end of October. In two stages, vegetation coverage is relatively
    low, making it challenging to accurately retrieve vegetation reflectance information,
    particularly when the spatial resolution of the imagery is low. Consequently,
    the accuracy and stability of estimation models in these periods deviate significantly.
    4.2. Multisource Remote Sensing Data and Machine Learning Model Had Significant
    Differences in Soil Water Estimation Accuracy at Different Depths Soil moisture
    is a crucial parameter for reflecting regional water resource changes and agricultural
    soil moisture conditions. There are many factors that affect soil moisture, and
    many researchers have conducted relevant studies on soil moisture estimation [13,14,58].
    This study found differences in the accuracy of remote sensing soil moisture estimation
    at different growth stages of crops. Overall, under the same coverage, the GF-1
    image had the highest estimation accuracy, followed by Landsat-8, and GF-4 had
    the lowest estimation accuracy. This discrepancy can be attributed to the varying
    spatial resolutions of the satellites: GF-1 has a resolution of 16 m, Landsat-8
    has a resolution of 30 m, and GF-4 has a resolution of 50 m. This indicates that
    resolution has a significant impact on soil moisture estimation accuracy [6,59].
    Therefore, GF-1 was suitable for vegetated areas and can monitor temporal and
    spatial changes in soil moisture. Machine learning algorithms have been widely
    studied in the field of remote sensing and have shown excellent performance in
    solving nonlinear relationship problems [60]. Machine learning algorithms such
    as RF and SVM have been extensively applied to soil moisture prediction due to
    their high accuracy and stability [61,62]. He et al. [63] integrated the “trapezoid”
    model and multiple learning techniques (RF and XGBoost) to estimate soil moisture
    on the Tibetan Plateau based on MODIS data. The results showed that the ensemble
    model outperformed the separate model. Hence, machine learning algorithms offer
    significant advantages for soil moisture estimation. Zhao et al. [64] selected
    the features extracted from Sentinel-1/2 and Radarsat-2 remote sensing data and
    constructed a soil moisture inversion model based on the RF, RBFNN, GRNN, SVM,
    GBPNN, and ELM algorithms. The experimental results showed that among the six
    models, the random forest model had a higher inversion accuracy, with an R2 of
    0.6395 and RMSE of 0.0264. Cheng et al. [65] evaluated the SMC-estimation accuracy
    provided by multimodal data fusion and four machine learning algorithms: PLSR,
    KNN, RF, and BPNN, which showed that the RF algorithm provided more accurate SMC
    estimates than the other three algorithms. It was found that the RF algorithm
    demonstrates exceptional performance for soil moisture estimation because it is
    relatively resistant to overfitting problems [66]. The RF algorithm demonstrates
    robustness in handling high-dimensional data with a high degree of fault tolerance,
    and can also be applied to small sample data sets [67]. The neural network algorithm
    requires a large amount of sample data for effective learning, and its performance
    is contingent upon the network structure and sample complexity. In situations
    where the sample size is limited, overfitting may occur in the neural network
    algorithm [68]. Additionally, several studies have indicated that the utilization
    of small sample data sets may not be enough for the optimal training of the SVM
    algorithm, so it is difficult to estimate soil moisture well [16,68]. In this
    study, the ETr, RF, and LR algorithms, which are suitable for small samples, were
    used to construct estimation models for soil moisture at different depths. The
    ETr and RF models exhibited high estimation accuracy, while the LR model performed
    relatively poorly. But, the ETr and RF models were prone to overfitting when the
    vegetation coverage was low, which may be due to the poor correlation between
    spectral information and soil moisture in that period. Both RF and ETr models
    are based on decision trees, and the RF model obtains the best splitting attribute
    within a random subset, while the ETr model randomly selects partition points
    for feature values rather than optimal ones. Consequently, the generated decision
    trees of the ETr model are generally larger than those of RF, resulting in lower
    model variance. Thus, the ETr model tends to yield better results and generalization
    capabilities to some extent [69,70]. Considering accuracy and stability, the ETr
    model can be considered the optimal model for soil moisture estimation in the
    Shandian River Basin. The findings of this study demonstrate that the spatial
    resolution of remote sensing imagery significantly influences the accuracy of
    soil water estimation. Moreover, various machine learning algorithms exhibit distinct
    levels of accuracy based on different sample sizes. In summary, in cases of limited
    soil water sample data, the integration of ETr or RF algorithms with high-resolution
    spatial and temporal imagery can accurately estimate regional-scale soil water
    content. Due to limited data and other constraints, this study considered the
    relationship between vegetation indices and soil moisture to construct the estimation
    model. In subsequent research, the influence of surface temperature, meteorological
    factors, and other factors on soil moisture will be considered. Additionally,
    the retrieval of soil water by the fusion of multi-source remote sensing data
    is also a hot research topic at present. Negahbani et al. [71] used ESTARFM, which
    combines Landsat8 and MODIS data, to obtain the daily surface SM with a spatial
    resolution of 100 m. The outcomes of the study indicated the high ability of the
    proposed fusion approach for achieving accurate and consistent SM monitoring by
    using the specified ESTARFM model. Thus, we will estimate soil moisture by fusing
    multi-source satellite remote sensing data and evaluate its inversion accuracy
    in the follow-up study. At the same time, we will consider higher-resolution remote
    sensing images (such as Sentinel-2, GF-1 PMI), and use data assimilation algorithms
    to couple high spatial-temporal resolution remote sensing data with hydrological
    models which can predict the changes in soil moisture at different temporal scales
    and provide relevant references for the optical remote sensing estimation of soil
    moisture. In this study, the GF-4 satellite offers a wide swath of 400 km and
    a high temporal resolution (with a revisit period of 20 s), but relatively lower
    spatial resolution (50 m). In future research, data fusion methods will be considered
    to improve the spatial resolution of GF-4 and achieve the efficient and continuous
    monitoring of soil moisture at a large regional scale. 5. Conclusions In this
    study, three satellites (GF-1, Landsat-8, and GF-4) with different resolutions
    were used to the vegetation indices sensitive to soil moisture by using GRA. Three
    different machine learning algorithms (Extra Tree, random forest, and linear regression)
    were employed to build soil moisture models at different depths (3 cm, 10 cm,
    and 20 cm). The goal was to explore the accuracy of soil moisture estimation based
    on different satellite images and machine learning algorithms in order to obtain
    the optimal estimation model for soil moisture in the farming land of northern
    China. The results indicated that the selection of sensitive vegetation indices
    by using the GRA varied in different periods. This phenomenon arose due to the
    significant differences in water consumption intensity during the various growth
    stages of the crops, resulting in the disparate utilization of soil moisture.
    Furthermore, the reflectance properties of crop leaves undergo transformations
    because of their growth, further contributing to the dynamic correlation between
    vegetation indices constructed from different spectral bands and soil moisture
    levels. However, vegetation indices predominantly containing near-infrared bands
    exhibit higher sensitivity to moisture. Among three satellite datasets, the higher-resolution
    GF-1 imagery had the best soil estimation accuracy, followed by Landsat-8. The
    soil moisture estimation accuracy of GF-4 was the worst. Therefore, GF-1 is suitable
    for estimating soil moisture in vegetated areas. Among the three machine learning
    models, both the ETr model and RF model exhibited similar accuracy, whereas the
    LR model demonstrated relatively inferior accuracy. Overall, the ETr model showed
    superior prediction accuracy and stability in estimating soil moisture. Due to
    the influence of surface reflectance, different satellites exhibited optimal accuracy
    for soil moisture estimation at a depth of 3 cm, thereby highlighting the significant
    potential of optical remote sensing imagery in monitoring surface soil water.
    In this study, the ETr model based on GF-1 had the best accuracy in soil moisture
    estimation at different growth stages (with an R2 of 3 cm depth ranging from 0.601
    to 0.928, with an R2 of 10 cm depth ranging from 0.518 to 0.913, with an R2 of
    20 cm depth ranging from 0.496 to 0.879). It is recommended to utilize GF-1 WFV
    data to construct the ETr model for monitoring surface soil moisture (3 cm and
    10 cm) in the farming land of northern China. Therefore, in cases where there
    are limited ground sample data, it is advisable to utilize high-spatiotemporal-resolution
    remote sensing data along with machine learning algorithms such as ETr and RF,
    which are suitable for small samples, for soil moisture estimation. Author Contributions

  description: 'In order to explore the actual evapotranspiration and its spatial
    distribution characteristics during the growth period of regional crops to provide
    a basis for the evaluation of regional water-saving potential, this study combined
    multi-source data (planting structure, remote sensing data, meteorological data,
    etc.) and remote sensing land surface evapotranspiration inversion method to obtain
    the actual crop evapotranspiration (ET), and estimated ET in the period when remote
    sensing data were missing according to the change characteristics of crops in
    different growth stages and combined with meteorological data. The results showed
    that : ① Based on remote sensing data and SEBAL model, the daily evapotranspiration
    at the spatial scale of the basin could be accurately retrieved, and the average
    errors of the initial and middle growth stages were 11.49% and 6.22%, respectively.
    From May to July, daily evapotranspiration gradually increased and reached the
    peak in July. Daily evapotranspiration gradually decreased from August to October,
    and showed a large decreasing trend in September and October. ②There were significant
    differences in ET among different crops in the growth period, in the order of
    beet > potato > corn > wheat, respectively 619.72 mm, 558.67 mm, 492.51 mm and
    456.58 mm. Variation range of ET during crop growth period was 476.02~795.73 mm,
    405.41~684.84 mm, 345.11~683.35 mm and 313.34~604.62 mm, respectively. ③Due to
    the different irrigation systems, the ET of the same crop growth period was spatially
    different. Influenced by the uneven rainfall between north and south of the basin,
    ET in the growth period of the four main crops showed an obvious decreasing trend
    from south to north. The ET of wheat near the northern lake was higher than that
    of other areas because of the higher soil water content. It can be concluded that
    in view of the obvious difference of ET spatial distribution in crop growth period
    and the serious over extraction of groundwater in some regions in Chahanuoer Basin,
    it is particularly important to adjust the planting structure and irrigation system
    in the basin.'

  description: The aim of this study was to explore the spatial distribution pattern
    and driving mechanism of agricultural carbon emissions of different townships
    and irrigation modes, and to reveal the regional differences of agricultural water
    and energy resources consumption combination characteristics, so as to provide
    necessary references for agricultural irrigation mode optimization, water and
    energy resources conservation and low-carbon agricultural sustainable development.
    【Method】The irrigation carbon emission intensity and its spatial distribution
    of winter wheat at township level were calculated by using multi-source data,
    including remote sensing data, statistical data, meteorological data, and agricultural
    irrigation survey data. In addition, the geographical detector was employed to
    discuss the influencing factors of carbon emission intensity under different irrigation
    modes (Irrigation mode with rain-fed agriculture as the primary method, PI mode;
    Irrigation mode with surface water irrigation as the primary method, SWI mode;
    Irrigation mode with diversion and irrigation projects as the primary method,
    WDI mode; Irrigation mode with groundwater irrigation as the primary method, GI
    mode). 【Result】(1) In 2018, the average carbon emission intensity of winter wheat
    irrigation at the township level in Henan Province was 15.05 kg·t-1, which showed
    a west-to-east decreasing trend in the longitudinal direction and a north-high-south-low
    spatial distribution pattern in the latitudinal direction. The mean value of mean
    carbon emission intensity at township level was 15.05 kg·t-1. The high value townships
    was concentrated in the western mountainous region, while the lower gathered in
    the southeast region. (2) By comparing four irrigation modes, the irrigation mode
    with highest carbon emission intensity was the irrigation mode with rain-fed as
    the primary method (PI mode, 22.22 kg·t-1), while the irrigation mode with groundwater
    irrigation as the primary method was the least ideal (SWI mode, 11.05 kg·t-1).
    (3) The average elevation and effective precipitation explained 49% and 39% of
    the spatial differentiation pattern of carbon emission intensity, respectively,
    which were key factors influencing the carbon emission intensity of winter wheat
    irrigation. The effect of the same driving factor under different irrigation modes
    was variable. The influence of energy consumption on the spatial differentiation
    pattern of winter wheat irrigation carbon emission intensity under the irrigation
    mode dominated by water diversion irrigation projects (WDI mode) was the strongest,
    and the driving effect of land input intensity under the GI mode was the most
    significant. In addition, the interaction of different drivers had double-factor
    enhancement effects and non-linear enhancement effects. 【Conclusion】There was
    spatial heterogeneity and differences in irrigation mode in the carbon emission
    intensity of winter wheat irrigation at the township level in Henan Province.
    The PI mode was the mode with the highest winter wheat irrigation carbon emission
    intensity and the WDI mode was the mode with the highest carbon emissions. The
    average elevation and effective precipitation were the main reasons for the formation
    of spatially divergent patterns of irrigation carbon emission intensity of winter
    wheat at township scale in Henan Province, while anthropogenic factors were the
    dominant forces under different irrigation patterns.

    kg·t-1，并呈现出由西向东波动下降和从北向南减少的空间分布格局。碳排放强度高（>20.64 kg·t-1）的乡镇主要集中在西部高海拔地区，碳排放强度低（<13.76
    kg·t-1）的乡镇主要分布在东南部地区。（2）4种灌溉模式中，冬小麦单位产量灌溉碳排放强度最高的是PI模式（22.22 kg·t-1），最低的是SWI模式（11.05
    kg·t-1）。（3）平均海拔与有效降水量对碳排放强度空间分异的解释力分别达到49%和39%，是影响冬小麦灌溉碳排放强度的关键因素。同一驱动因素在不同灌溉模式下的影响具有差异性，能源消耗对WDI模式下的冬小麦灌溉碳排放强度空间分异格局的影响力最强，土地投入强度在GI模式下的驱动作用最为显著。此外，不同驱动因素交互作用后具有双因子增强效应和非线性增强效应。【结论】河南省乡镇尺度冬小麦灌溉碳排放强度存在空间异质性和灌溉模式差异，PI模式的冬小麦灌溉碳排放强度最高，WDI模式的碳排放量最高。平均海拔与降水是主导河南省乡镇尺度冬小麦灌溉碳排放强度空间分异格局形成的主要原因，人为因素则是不同灌溉模式下灌溉碳排放强度空间分异的主导力量。

  description: 'Water resources have a great influence on human society, but saving
    water in irrigation still remains a challenge. This article proposes an intelligent
    irrigation system that integrates a data fusion model and a long-rang (LoRa) network
    for optimizing the watering schedule. A data fusion model is proposed, which first
    adopts the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to simulate and predict the proper
    watering demands by integrating multi-source heterogeneous data, that is, historical
    weather data, user irrigation logs, weather forecasts, and online monitoring sensor
    data. A self-powered wide-area network is implemented and deployed by using LoRa
    to facilitate multiple Internet of Things (IoT) application scenarios. It includes
    a gateway and two types of nodes: a valve node and a sensing node. The node is
    capable of energy autonomy through the scheme of waterflow-based power generation,
    thus realizing maintenance-free throughout the life cycle. A cloud platform is
    designed to provide network management, intelligent irrigation control, and the
    interface of the mobile application. The proposed system is evaluated through
    a case study of landscape watering. On average, the proposed system achieves a
    water-saving efficiency of 94.74% compared with the conventional manual setting
    solutions.'

    a data fusion model and a long-rang (LoRa) network for optimizing the watering
    schedule. A data fusion model is proposed, which first adopts the long short-term

    autonomous 1. Introduction Water resources are one of the most important resources
    on Earth but are uneven in both time and space distribution. Agriculture, as the
    foundation of human society, is by far the biggest consumer of water. Therefore,
    the use of water resources with high efficiency is an important research field
    in agricultural development. Multiple technologies have been developed to improve
    water utilization, such as soil-less culture [1], sprinkling irrigation [2], [3],
    and trickle irrigations [4]. Although recent advances in agriculture have dramatically
    improved water use efficiency, there is still a high demand for saving water to
    further improve water utilization in some dry areas. Irrigation systems have been
    effectively used in agriculture for many years. A conventional irrigation system
    requires many wires to collect sensor signals and transmit commands to control
    the solenoid valves. The high cost of cables and various accessories makes the
    entire system expensive and complex, limiting the scale of deployment. Emerging
    communication technologies, such as general packet radio service (GPRS) cellular
    networks [5], [6], ZigBee [6], [7], and Bluetooth [8], enable wireless coverage
    for farmland. However, they also have some limitations. For instance, the devices
    using GPRS always consume power, which increases the maintenance workload of battery
    replacement. In addition, they rely on the cellular network provided by telecom
    operators, which is not reliable in some rural areas. As to the solutions with
    ZigBee or Bluetooth, the communication distance is not long enough to cover the
    large area of farmland, although the low power performance of the devices can
    be guaranteed. Recently, multiple low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies
    have emerged, such as NB-IoT, SigFox, and long range (LoRa) radio technique. The
    key features of LPWAN technology include a long-distance communication, low power
    consumption, high capacity, and low cost. The LPWAN overcomes the limitations
    of conventional wireless technologies. Combined with energy harvesting, it makes
    energy-autonomous IoT nodes possible. Consequently, it is a promising technology
    to be used in wireless irrigation systems. In recent years, several IoT-enabled
    water management solutions have been developed for precision agriculture. However,
    most of them are sensing-based solutions, and the watering schedule is a predefined
    offline system. Few solutions consider the user’s experience, knowledge, and long-term
    environmental variables. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI), the long short-term
    memory network (LSTM), was introduced in the field of precision agriculture [9].
    As a special type of neural network, the LSTM is especially helpful for the time
    series analysis [10]. It inspires us to use LSTM to analyze the relationship between
    weather changes and irrigation needs set by farmers and gardeners. Further, the
    acquired models can predict the future irrigation needs for common users. In order
    to achieve the goal, an intelligent water irrigation system is proposed. The novelty
    of the work is that an intelligent irrigation system with data fusion is proposed.
    The data fusion model considers the history of local weather, irrigation logs,
    weather forecasts, and real-time sensor data; analyzes their internal relationships;
    and then forms a big data fusion system to improve water-saving efficiency. This
    article presents an intelligent irrigation system based on a LoRa network and
    a data fusion model. The following are the technical contributions of this work.
    • We explore the method of data fusion to realize intelligent irrigation. Unlike
    the conventional predefined offline system, the proposed system combines history
    logs, weather forecasts, and real-time data to predict the proper water demand
    for future irrigation. By loading knowledge from different domains, the data fusion
    model is expected to extend to more IoT application scenarios. • We implement
    a self-powered wide-area network using LoRa to facilitate multiple IoT scenarios,
    owing to its long-range communication and low-power feature. The waterflow-based
    energy harvesting scheme is designed and implemented by integrating the micro
    hydro generator. The scheme can achieve maintenance-free of battery replacement
    in the whole life cycle. The rest of the article is organized as follows. The
    related work is introduced in Section 2. Section 3 describes the architecture
    and implementation of the proposed system. Section 4 provides the details of the
    experimental results. Finally, the conclusion is presented in Section 5. 2. Related
    works 2.1. IoT-enabled intelligent irrigation The rapid development of the IoT
    has enabled irrigation systems with more new features that can effectively improve
    watering efficiency. In recent years, a variety of wireless sensor network (WSN)-based
    irrigation systems have been proposed. With sensors deployed, multiple types of
    environment information can be monitored. The irrigation system can determine
    watering actions based on the sensor data and the preset threshold by users [5],
    [7], [11], [12]. For example, Roy et al. [6] designed a real-time automated irrigation
    system for crop fields. The system sets up the WSN to sense the parameters of
    the environment using ZigBee. More recently, LoRa was introduced for various IoT
    applications [13], [14]. Zhao et al. [15] designed and implemented a smart irrigation
    system based on LoRa. The system can cover up to 8 km, while the node is self-powered
    with a water turbocharge mechanism. Another widely used water-saving technique
    is evapotranspiration (ET)-based irrigation. The concept of ET is to calculate
    the evaporation from the soil surface and the transpiration through plant canopies
    [16]. The ET-based intelligent watering controller calculates the watering demand
    based on the value of ET [17], [18]. Klein et al. [19] demonstrated a closed loop
    irrigation system that calculates the water requirement from satellite images
    and local daily weather. It achieved a 26% yield increase and a 16% increase in
    water-use efficiency. Munoz et al. [20] proposed a cloud platform for greenhouse
    crop production. It provides forecasting based on models for the climate, crop
    production, and irrigation processes, which makes it more flexible than traditional
    hard-coded approaches. The ET-certified controller usually costs a few hundred
    dollars on the market. In addition, the parameter setting is complicated, requiring
    professional weather and agronomy knowledge. In recent years, AI has emerged as
    a new technology introduced in agriculture [21]. Specifically, in the field of
    water conservation, multiple machine learning algorithms have been proposed to
    simulate the water-balancing model and predict the water demand [22], [23], [24],
    [25]. Goap et al. [22] proposed a machine learning algorithm to estimate the difference
    and changes in soil moisture due to weather conditions. Chang et al. [23] proposed
    a machine-learning-based smart irrigation system with a LoRa P2P network that
    can automatically learn the irrigation experiences from expert farmers for greenhouse
    crops. Moghadas et al. [24] proposed an algorithm for accurate characterization
    of the soil moisture from electromagnetic induction data using Bayesian inference
    and a neural network. Nie et al. [25] presented the prediction result of soil
    moisture by employing different machine learning models. 2.2. Data fusion With
    the development of the IoT and big data, the explosive growth of various types
    of data has brought great challenges to data processing and utilization. Data
    fusion, which can be explained as the process of fusing multiple records representing
    the same real-world object into a single, consistent, and clean representation,
    is used to integrate huge amounts of data from heterogeneous information systems
    [26]. Data fusion was first applied in the military [27]. It is extremely important
    to obtain all kinds of useful sensor information on the battlefield, for example,
    by evaluating battlefield situation and threats and providing tactical and strategic
    decision-making assistance for the combat forces. With the continuous development
    of data fusion, it gradually expanded to many other areas, such as cyber–physical–social
    systems [28], human activity detection and health monitoring [29], sentiment analysis
    of educational big data [30], and industrial fault detection and identification
    [31]. Multiple methodologies for cross-domain data fusion have been proposed [32].
    Dragos et al. [33] presented a method to combine soft and sensor data to create
    enhanced situation assessment for a track-and-detect application. Chen et al.
    [34] proposed a ternary data fusion model based on reinforcement learning in the
    production process of hot rolling. By merging the ternary data, faster and better
    decisions can be made. Zhao et al. [35] developed a positioning system using big
    sensor data preprocessing in multi-source fusion. The fusion technique can reduce
    the data collection amount significantly. Data fusion has also been further extended
    to the field of precision agriculture. In 2014, Mouazen et al. [36] presented
    a data fusion approach for the delineation of water-holding capacity zones for
    site-specific irrigation based on multiple sensors. More recently, Viani et al.
    [37] proposed a low-cost wireless monitoring and decision support system for water
    conservation in agriculture. The system contains a fuzzy logic theory that integrates
    the farmers’ experience, irrigation practices, soil conditions, and crop models,
    providing improved water conservation compared to the conventional threshold-based
    technique. In summary, the existing automatic irrigation systems are mostly sensing-based
    solutions. The watering demand algorithms are usually threshold-trigged, timer-based,
    soil–water balancing schemes, and ET-based, which lack the ability to dynamically
    adjust in time according to weather changes. To the best of our knowledge, few
    studies have focused on AI-based systems with data fusion. In this article, we
    propose a knowledge-based data fusion model based on big data, that is, the history
    of local weather, irrigation logs, weather forecasts, and real-time sensor data.
    The model can achieve optimization for the future watering schedule to improve
    water-saving efficiency. In addition, as we load the knowledge from different
    domains into the proposed model, the system can be extended to more IoT application
    scenarios. Download : Download high-res image (563KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Architecture of the intelligent irrigation system. 3. System architecture
    and implementation The architecture of the system is shown in Fig. 1. It consists
    of three phases, devices, cloud, and user. Various LoRa nodes are deployed in
    multiple scenarios, such as landscape watering, dust removal, and agriculture
    irrigation. The LoRa gateways are deployed as a data hub, in which the data from
    LoRa nodes are preliminarily processed and transmitted to the cloud platform.
    The IoT cloud platform hosts the LoRa network and provides services for each function
    block. The data fusion model deployed in the cloud platform optimizes the watering
    scheduler. Different domains of knowledge can be selected and input to the data
    fusion model to fit the corresponding application scenarios. Moreover, users can
    access the irrigation system either from a mobile application or a web interface
    to check and control the watering schedule remotely. 3.1. Hardware design 3.1.1.
    Gateway The LoRa gateway is the core of the LoRa network and acts as a relay between
    the LoRa nodes and the cloud platform. For irrigation in farmland, the gateway
    is usually deployed on the top of a tower or a building. It can provide signal
    coverage over the whole farmland, usually dozens of square kilometers. As for
    landscape watering in a garden, the gateway can be mounted on the wall of a house,
    depending on the ease of installation and electrical connection. Further, the
    whole LoRa gateway is packaged in a plastic box with IP-68 standards to provide
    waterproof capability. Download : Download high-res image (432KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Design of the LoRa gateway and nodes. (a) LoRa gateway.
    (b) Valve node. (c) Sensing node. (d) Micro hydro generator integration. The gateway
    consists of a microprocessor and multiple modules to realize communication, execution,
    display, and other functions. An ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller is selected as
    the core of the gateway. It can provide high performance calculation with low
    power consumption. It has rich communication interfaces such as USART, I2C, and
    SPI, which are sufficient to interact with other modules. A 2-Kb electrically
    erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM) is used as external memory to
    backup data and configurations in case of power loss. The gateway provides both
    wired and wireless connections to the valve nodes. For the wired access, the interface
    of the 12-zone 24-V AC output is designed through optoisolators. The AC output
    can connect directly to the valve nodes, controlling their working states. A programmable
    logic controller (PLC) interface is also integrated into the board, providing
    an alternative method of node connection. For wireless access, a LoRa module is
    customized based on sx1268 from Semtech. The communication distance can be as
    far as 8 km. The module supports a LoRa network with up to 72 nodes. To interact
    with the cloud platform, the gateway supports multiple communication modules for
    facilitating different scenarios, including Wi-Fi (USR-WIFI232), LTE cat −1 (WH-GM5),
    and Ethernet. Also, a 480 × 320 LCD touch screen is used to set local configurations
    and display the basic information of the gateway. The printed circuit board (PCB)
    of the LoRa gateway is depicted in Fig. 2(a). 3.1.2. LoRa node The LoRa nodes,
    both the valve node (Fig. 2(b)) and sensing node (Fig. 2(c)) are deployed in the
    farmland far away from the gateway, controlling the solenoid valves or collecting
    environment information. An ARM Cortex M0 microcontroller operating at 32 MHz
    is selected. It has 8 Kb of RAM and 64 Kb of Flash, which are sufficient for the
    program running on the LoRa node. Compared with the gateway, the peripheral modules
    are simplified. A LoRa module is integrated for communication with the gateway.
    The power-management module performs the power conversion from the battery. The
    LCD is designed for local debugging and configuration and is tiny and power efficient.
    It can be disabled after deployment. There is a slight difference between the
    two types of nodes. The valve node supports a two-zone output to switch the valve
    on and off. The output signal is a 9-V 120 ms pulse, so a power conversion circuit
    with large capacity is carefully designed to store enough power to drive the valve.
    As to the sensing node, an RS485 interface is implemented instead of the DC output.
    The RS485 module provides an interface for multiple sensors. Unlike the gateway,
    the nodes are usually in a power-constrained environment with limited access to
    electricity. For both the valve node and sensing node, a 2200-mAh Li-ion battery
    is selected to provide the power supply. In addition, a micro hydro generator
    is integrated with the valve node, as shown in Fig. 2(d). The water pipe is divided
    into two branches: One is for the irrigation and another is for electricity generation.
    This structure successfully avoids the decrease of water flow velocity caused
    by the generator. The charging current is between 200 mA and 300 mA at a fixed
    5-V output, which is much higher than that consumed by the node every day. Therefore,
    the valve node can be self-powered, forming an energy-autonomous system. The PCB
    of the node and the battery is packaged inside an IP-68 waterproof plastic box,
    with dimension of 90 mm  × 50 mm × 42 mm. The antenna, made from flexible material
    is attached to the inner side of the box, which makes the node compact. 3.2. Software
    design 3.2.1. Cloud platform A cloud platform is designed and implemented. Considering
    the high availability and load balancing, an HTTP-MQ architecture is designed
    and deployed. The core of the cloud platform is the clustered servers, in which
    RabbitMQ is installed as the middleware of the message queue. The servers provide
    both the RabbitMQ application program interface (API) and hypertext transport
    protocol (HTTP) API for different types of connections. The LoRa gateways and
    mobile applications connect to the servers through the HAProxy server via the
    message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol. Moreover, the web client
    connects the servers through the Nginx server, where HTTP requests are distributed.
    Benefiting from such an architecture, the mobile application can connect to the
    devices through the shared memory message queue. Therefore, the latency is significantly
    reduced compared with the HTTP request mechanism. To meet the requirement of storing
    heterogeneous data, a MySQL database and a backup database are implemented. 3.2.2.
    Mobile application A mobile application is developed to provide an application
    software and an interface for the users, as shown in Fig. 3. The menu interface
    (Fig. 3(a)) contains manual watering, irrigation schedule, real-time sensor display,
    system settings, smart watering, and history records. The watering time of each
    valve can be set in the manual watering interface (Fig. 3(b)). A timer-based scheduler
    (Fig. 3(c)) is available for the user to set the watering time and frequency for
    a whole week. The offset of sensitivity can be set according to the user’s experience.
    The real-time sensor data, such as soil temperature and moisture, air temperature
    and humidity, and water flow, provide online monitoring for users, as shown in
    Fig. 3(d). The data are also uploaded to the cloud platform as feedback for the
    intelligent irrigation model. The history records depict the daily and monthly
    water consumption for the user, as illustrated in Fig. 3(e). Fig. 3(f) shows the
    smart watering interface. Once it is enabled, the data fusion model is activated.
    It provides the watering adjustment by combining multi-source data. As a result,
    the watering schedule is optimized automatically. Download : Download high-res

    (e) History records. (f) Local weather information. 3.3. Data fusion model For
    conventional irrigation systems, the valve controllers are deployed in each zone
    of the garden or farmland. The controllers are usually timer-based. The users
    usually roughly set the daily watering schedule in advance according to their
    experiences. However, such a setting is inconvenient in daily life and inflexible
    for dynamic adjustment. Various factors affect the watering schedule. For example,
    the watering amount can be reduced if there is a thundershower just before watering.
    Therefore, an intelligent irrigation with watering schedule optimization is needed.
    To solve the problem, a data fusion model based on the LSTM network is implemented
    and deployed on the cloud platform, as shown in Fig. 4. The historical weather
    data and the irrigation logs are sourced from the last two years. The weather
    forecast for the next few days is also ported to the model through the API from
    the website. The real-time environment information is collected from the sensing
    nodes for feedback. Thus, the data from the past, present, and future are used
    together as the input parameters to the model. Through the fusion of multi-source
    data, the model learns the users’ irrigation experiences in the past few years,
    and then outputs the optimized irrigation schedule. Download : Download high-res
    image (198KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Data fusion framework.
    The historical weather data and user irrigation logs are exported from the database
    online. It covers as much climate information as possible in the past 2 years
    to ensure the generalization ability of the model. The 13 types of weather information
    in an hourly interval are used, including temperature, daytime, wind speed, wind
    direction, weather code, precipitation, humidity, visibility, pressure, cloud
    cover, heat index, dew point, and wind gust speed. The irrigation logs of each
    zone are also combined as an input of the network. Therefore, the whole dataset
    is a matrix with 13+2 × columns. The first 13 columns represent the weather information,
    the following columns represent the preset watering schedule of zones, and the
    last columns are the actual watering results which are set by professional gardeners.
    Each row shows the timestamps in hourly intervals. The data in each column are
    standardized to have zero mean and unit variance. An LSTM network composed of
    six layers is implemented to estimate the proper watering schedule. The sequence
    input layer receives the data in hourly intervals. Then the LSTM layer with 200
    hidden units learns the correlation of time series and the watering schedule.
    A dropout layer is used with a dropout probability of 0.5 to prevent overfitting.
    Also, two fully connected layers are added to achieve the conversion of different
    dimensions. Finally, the regression layer outputs the estimated results for the
    watering schedule. The action commands are sent to the valves through the watering
    scheduler. In this scenario, the online monitoring data are further used as feedback
    for the watering scheduler. Thus the closed loop of the irrigation system is built.
    It monitors the irrigation process conditions, such as the soil moisture content,
    to avoid any unexpected over-irrigation. 4. System evaluation and analysis Three
    scenarios of intelligent irrigation are deployed in this work. The first is a
    signal coverage test in an urban area. The second is the irrigation of apple seeding
    in a greenhouse located in Shaan Xi Province, China. In this scenario, the mist
    spray in the greenhouses is frequently switched on/off every few tens of seconds
    to maintain the optimal air humidity for apple seeding. Thus, the system’s real-time
    performance is assessed. The final scenario is landscape watering in a private
    home garden where we pay more attention to intelligent irrigation as well as low
    power consumption. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    rate: 2.4k bps. 4.1. Case I: Urban signal coverage The signal coverage test is
    conducted in an urban area. The LoRa gateway is placed on top of a building. The
    detailed parameters are listed in Table 1. During the test, the LoRa node is placed
    on a moving car and slowly moved far away from the gateway. The position and received
    signal strength indication (RSSI) are recorded and displayed on the map, as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Two types of tests with different transmission speeds are carried out.
    For the baud rate of 50.78 bps, the communication distance is as far as 8 km,
    and the receiving sensitivity can be lower than −120 dBm. For the baud rate of
    2.4 kbps, the communication distance is a bit lower, around 5.6 km. The results
    show that the signal coverage decreases with the increase of the transmission
    rate, which is a tradeoff during deployment. Download : Download high-res image

    is deployed on farmland composed of several greenhouses. The gateway is installed
    in a metal box (Fig. 6(a)). The LoRa nodes are placed in the greenhouses, connected
    to the valves and sensors (Fig. 6(b)). The distance between the gateway and each
    node is less than 1.5 km. Also, there is no obvious obstruction for the radio
    transmission, so, the signal coverage can be well guaranteed. Download : Download

    40 m Antenna Isotropic, 3 dBi Baud rate 50.78 bps/ 2.4 kbps Packet length 15 Bytes
    Moving speed <10 km/h The system latency is a critical issue in this scenario,
    as the valves should be controlled in real-time. An experiment on the transmission
    latency between the LoRa gateway and the LoRa nodes is conducted. The gateway
    broadcasts the packet with 10 bytes periodically. The system latency is recorded
    as soon as the packet is received by the node. As illustrated in Fig. 7, with
    the increase of the transmission speed, the receiving latency is significantly
    reduced. The curve flattens out when the transmission speed exceeds 10 kbps. To
    ensure a latency meets real-time demands, a transmission speed of at least 2.4
    kbps is required, and then, the latency can be less than 300 ms. 4.3. Case III:
    Landscape watering We also deploy a LoRa network at a private garden, in Mission
    Viejo, California, USA. The garden is divided into four zones. A valve node is
    deployed in each zone to control the watering. Unlike the greenhouse, the low-power
    and smart watering performance is of greater concern in this scenario. Download

    The battery-powered nodes are deployed in the garden. The wireless solution can
    reduce the cost of deployment compared with the wired controllers, in which the
    power cable accounts for a large proportion. A detailed analysis of energy consumption
    is carried out. The analysis is assumed in a daily use scenario. The irrigation
    system works once a day, and the valve is switched on for 1 min. The LoRa module
    consumes a considerable amount of current; so an experiment is conducted to observe
    the power consumption under different conditions. The module is configured in
    sleep state. It wakes up at regular intervals to listen for any packets to receive.
    The experiment result is shown in Fig. 8. It is obvious that with the increase
    of the wake-up interval, the average current decreases significantly, especially
    when the wake-up time is less than 2500 ms. Besides, a lower speed transmission
    rate consumes more current, as it takes more time for the RF module to transmit
    the same length of data. Considering the balance between power consumption and
    response time, as well as the signal coverage, a wake-up period of 2 s is selected
    with a transmission speed of 2.4 kbps. The total power consumption of the LoRa
    node consists of five parts in different working states. For each state the current
    is carefully measured, as shown in Table 2. Then, the amount of battery power
    consumed is determined using the following equations: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) where:
    is the power consumption of the main board in sleeping mode; is the power consumption
    of the LoRa module in standby mode; is the power consumption of the main board
    in working mode; is the power consumption of the LoRa module in data transmitting
    mode; and is the power consumed to switch the valve on and off. hence, the energy
    consumed everyday can be calculated as follows: (6) The number of days can be
    obtained as follows: (7) In this sense, a battery-powered valve node can work
    for approximately 18 months at a frequency of switching valve eight times every
    day. In some real deployment environments, the frequency of valve action is lower
    than the calculated assumption, so, the battery life cycle can be further extended.
    In addition, the microhydro generator is integrated in some application scenarios.
    In this case, the battery is charged when the valve is on. According to the previous
    assumption, the valve is switched on four times for 1 min each time. The generated
    electricity is determined by using the following equation: (8) It is obvious that
    can cover the energy consumption, . This indicates that an average of 1 min of
    charging can fulfill the node’s daily energy consumption. In fact, the irrigation
    time can be larger in some actual deployments. Therefore, the node can be self-powered,
    achieving an energy-autonomous system. 4.3.2. Intelligent watering performance
    There is a dry season and a rainy season in Mission Viejo, California, as shown
    in Fig. 9. From June to October, there is almost no rain (less than 5 mm). The
    rainy season is from November to April, in which the rainfall is always larger
    than 60 mm. Therefore, there is a strong correlation between the local weather
    and watering amount. For the sake of sightseeing, it is necessary to ensure the
    normal growth of flowers and grass. Owing to the lack of water, the use of a smart
    controller is incentivized by law to avoid over-irrigation in California, especially
    as rainfall is abundant some days. Download : Download high-res image (357KB)

    the proposed data fusion system, the predicted results are compared with the watering
    records of gardeners, as shown in Fig. 10. The predicted results from the model
    are similar to the manual watering schedules in all zones. Table 3 lists the output
    of data fusion model in terms of the total watering amount, average amount, and
    root-mean-square error (RMSE). The RMSE of all zones is close to zero, indicating
    that the deviation between the predicted results of the model and the actual watering
    amount is small. Therefore, it is believed that the model learns the user experience
    from the multiple input data sets. A case study on general users followed, and
    30 days’ data were selected independently of the training samples. The predicted
    watering amount was delivered to the valve nodes to replace the original timer-based
    watering schedule. As shown in Fig. 11, the predicted values are dynamically adjusted
    according to the changes of weather conditions. The predicted value is slightly
    lower in zone 1, zone 3, and zone 4. For zone 2, there are approximately 100 s
    longer than the original watering schedule, which is still acceptable in the daily
    watering. The detailed results of each zone are presented in Table 4. The landscapes
    in the four zones are grow well during this month; so, we believe that the predicted
    watering schedule generated by the LSTM network is reasonable. The watering efficiency,
    defined by the predicted value over the scheduled value, is 94.74% within the
    last 30 days. The advantages of the intelligent irrigation model over other approaches
    are its simple deployment and self-learning capability. Conventional irrigation
    devices, such as timer-based or ET-based devices always require complicated parameter
    setting, which requires professional weather and agronomy knowledge. As to the
    proposed system, it can learn the user’s watering experience and provide optimizations;
    so, it is more user-friendly and convenient for deployment. 5. Conclusion In this
    article, we have presented an intelligent irrigation system based on data fusion.
    The system explores LPWAN techniques, which provide a wireless, low-power, low-cost,
    easy-to-deploy, and intelligent solution over conventional irrigation systems.
    The cloud platform provides a data fusion model that combines multiple types of
    information, enabling an optimized decision for the watering schedule. The user-friendly
    mobile application allows users to set watering schedules remotely, as well as
    check the real-time sensor data for monitoring. Table 5 presents the comparison
    of the proposed work with other state-of-the-art systems. Our work has demonstrated
    a promising IoT-enabled intelligent irrigation system for precision agriculture.

    will be considered. Computation-resource-consuming tasks, such as data processing,
    and model training can be run on the cloud platform. Moreover, the pre-trained
    model can be offloaded to the edge devices, such as the LoRa gateways. Leveraging
    edge computing, the system can be made more flexible to adapt to different application
    scenarios, and the response can also be further improved in some latency critical
    scenarios. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have

  description: Remotely sensed (RS) evapotranspiration (ET) data sets have been widely
    evaluated and applied at regional scale. However, the research is relatively insufficient
    on inland basins. RS global ET data sets were evaluated in 19 major inland basins
    around the world in this study. Monthly ET was estimated by using water balance
    (ET_WB), as well as multi-source precipitation and total water storage anomaly
    data sets from each basin. The main attributes of the ET changes were identified
    in each basin. The accuracy of 10 ET products was evaluated by monthly ET_WB series
    over the entire study region and at the basin scales. Results showed that precipitation
    changes were the main cause of ET changes in most basins (i.e., 11/19). The impacts
    of human activities, mainly because of increased irrigation diversion, dominated
    the ET changes in the five basins located in the western and northern regions
    of the Eurasian inland basin. Accurate estimated ET series in inland basins with
    a regular unimodal or U distribution of mean monthly ET were also obtained; this
    was not the case for basins with irregular seasonal ET variations. In general,
    ET products exhibited accurate monthly ET estimates in most inland basins, but
    their accuracy was reduced at the Helmand River, Iranian inland rivers, Qaidam,
    and Turpan Basins. All products tended to underestimate ET, except for the Penman–Monteith–Leuning
    product. Overall, the global land surface satellite and global land evaporation
    Amsterdam model products performed the best in inland basins, while the moderate
    resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS; MOD16A2) and surface energy balance
    system (SEBS) products performed relatively poorly. In addition, all products
    except SEBS and MOD16A2 could capture the spatial ET distribution in inland basins,
    and the spatial correlation coefficient ranged between 0.83 and 0.93. In general,
    an ensemble of optimized ET products could improve the accuracy of simulated monthly
    ET and reduce the uncertainty of the simulated series over the entire study region
    and at the basin scales.

  explanation: This study evaluated ten global remotely sensed (RS) evapotranspiration
    (ET) datasets from inland river basins around the world. Precipitation and ET
    trends were analyzed, and the main factors influencing these trends were identified
    as either natural (precipitation changes) or anthropogenic (e.g., increased irrigation).
    The accuracy of the RS ET products was assessed using monthly ET simulated by
    the water budget (WB) method as a reference. The GLASS and GLEAM products performed
    the best overall, while MOD16A2 and SEBS performed the worst.
  extract_1: The GLASS and GLEAM products performed the best in inland basins, while
    MOD16A2 and SEBS performed relatively poorly.
  extract_2: Monthly series of precipitation products exhibited relatively higher
    consistency for the basins close to the ocean.

    TOOLS SHARE Abstract Remotely sensed (RS) evapotranspiration (ET) data sets have
    been widely evaluated and applied at regional scale. However, the research is
    relatively insufficient on inland basins. RS global ET data sets were evaluated
    in 19 major inland basins around the world in this study. Monthly ET was estimated
    by using water balance (ET_WB), as well as multi-source precipitation and total
    water storage anomaly data sets from each basin. The main attributes of the ET
    changes were identified in each basin. The accuracy of 10 ET products was evaluated
    by monthly ET_WB series over the entire study region and at the basin scales.
    Results showed that precipitation changes were the main cause of ET changes in
    most basins (i.e., 11/19). The impacts of human activities, mainly because of
    increased irrigation diversion, dominated the ET changes in the five basins located
    in the western and northern regions of the Eurasian inland basin. Accurate estimated
    ET series in inland basins with a regular unimodal or U distribution of mean monthly
    ET were also obtained; this was not the case for basins with irregular seasonal
    ET variations. In general, ET products exhibited accurate monthly ET estimates
    in most inland basins, but their accuracy was reduced at the Helmand River, Iranian
    inland rivers, Qaidam, and Turpan Basins. All products tended to underestimate
    ET, except for the Penman–Monteith–Leuning product. Overall, the global land surface
    satellite and global land evaporation Amsterdam model products performed the best
    in inland basins, while the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS;
    MOD16A2) and surface energy balance system (SEBS) products performed relatively
    poorly. In addition, all products except SEBS and MOD16A2 could capture the spatial
    ET distribution in inland basins, and the spatial correlation coefficient ranged
    between 0.83 and 0.93. In general, an ensemble of optimized ET products could
    improve the accuracy of simulated monthly ET and reduce the uncertainty of the
    simulated series over the entire study region and at the basin scales. 1 INTRODUCTION
    Evapotranspiration (ET) is a critical and unique bridge connecting the hydrological
    and carbon cycles with the surface energy balance (Jasechko et al., 2013; Lian
    et al., 2018). Accurate ET estimates are the basis for realistic simulations of
    hydrologic processes, crop growth, and ecosystem water efficiency (Liu et al.,
    2019a; Ponce-Campos et al., 2013). However, in situ ET observations are capital-
    and labour-intensive (Jaksa et al., 2013), and usually do not meet the spatial
    accuracy requirements. In recent decades, global remotely sensed (RS) ET data
    sets, generated by various remote sensing techniques and satellite equipment,
    have become increasingly available (Trambauer et al., 2014). The main advantage
    of global ET products is the broad spatial extent at various temporal scales,
    which facilitates their use at spatial and temporal scales required for various
    purposes, while reducing the reliance on available in situ data sets and the need
    for conducting additional time-consuming in situ observations (Panahi et al.,
    2021). Global products use different methods for ET estimation based on different
    data sources and might have varied accuracy at regional scales. Therefore, it
    is necessary to evaluate ET products before applying them on a regional scale.
    In general, worldwide evaluations show that all ET products adequately represent
    the expected mean values and seasonality (Elnashar et al., 2021; Miralles et al.,
    2016); however, the ET products optimized using these evaluations were different.
    For example, the global land evaporation Amsterdam model (GLEAM) performed better
    than other ET products at basin scale using the water balance (WB) method (Liu
    et al., 2016; Miralles et al., 2016), whereas Penman–Monteith–Leuning (PML) V2
    was the best ET product evaluated by eddy covariance measurements (Elnashar et
    al., 2021). The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS; MOD16A2)
    also exhibited better performance than other products in the Amazon, Awash and
    Yellow River basins (Baker et al., 2021; Li et al., 2017); however, it exhibited
    the largest discrepancy with reference ET data sets for catchments in Australia
    and the Tibetan Plateau (Khan et al., 2020; Li et al., 2019). The GLEAM was found
    to be the closest to eddy covariance measurements and WB-based ET in Australia
    and the Tibetan Plateau, respectively (Khan et al., 2020; Li et al., 2019); however,
    Xu et al. (2019) and Wu et al. (2020) found that the accuracy of the GLEAM is
    lower than that of other ET products in the USA and Amazon basin, respectively.
    Regarding the evaluation of ET products at special land surfaces, there were conflicting
    results. A global evaluation showed that ET products were more accurate in dry
    basins than in energy-limited wet basins (Liu et al., 2016). Better performance
    of ET products in arid than in humid regions was also found at regional scales,
    for example, over Iran (Panahi et al., 2021); however, another global evaluation
    showed that ET products have pronounced dissimilarities during dry conditions
    (Miralles et al., 2016). The evaluation of ET products by eddy covariance measurements
    over Europe also led to similar conclusions (Hu et al., 2015). Khan et al. (2018)
    evaluated three ET products by eddy covariance measurements over Asia and found
    that all ET products involved relatively greater uncertainties for low vegetation
    than the errors of tall canopies. Wu et al. (2020) also found that the accuracy
    of ET products at forest sites was higher than that at grassland sites in the
    evaluation by five flux towers over the Amazon basin; however, the evaluation
    of ET products by two flux towers in the Korean peninsula showed that they were
    more accurate at cropland than forest land-cover sites (Liaqat & Choi, 2017).
    Therefore, evaluations of ET products still needs further study. ET products can
    be evaluated using in situ data from eddy covariance flux towers; this is known
    as site-pixel-level evaluation, owing to the spatial resolution of the two data
    sets. The FLUXNET dataset has been widely used to evaluate global ET products
    (Elnashar et al., 2021; Liu, 2021). Various ET products have been evaluated in
    the Amazon basin (Wu et al., 2020), the Korean Peninsula (Liaqat & Choi, 2017),
    the United States (Xu et al., 2019), China (Bai & Liu, 2018; Ma et al., 2019),
    Australia (Khan et al., 2020), Africa (Weerasinghe et al., 2020), Europe (Hu et
    al., 2015), and globally (Elnashar et al., 2021) using FLUXNET towers; however,
    there are only a limited number of flux towers worldwide, and the density of sites
    does not meet the required spatial accuracy in large basins (Liu et al., 2019a).
    The observational WB method is a basic approach used to produce ET data series
    and is usually considered as reference for evaluating ET products at the basin
    scales (Bai & Liu, 2018; Baker et al., 2021; Koppa et al., 2021; Li et al., 2019;
    Schoups & Nasseri, 2021). Some studies have evaluated ET products on an annual
    scale to ignore the variation in water storage (Koppa et al., 2021; Xu et al.,
    2019). Satellite remote sensing, particularly the gravity recovery and climate
    experiment (GRACE) mission, can accurately estimate monthly total water storage
    changes in basins that are larger than ~200 000 and 100 000 km2 at low and high
    latitudes, respectively (Rodell et al., 2018), thereby enabling the evaluation
    of ET products on a monthly scale (Bai & Liu, 2018; Baker et al., 2021; Chao et
    al., 2021; Li et al., 2019; Schoups & Nasseri, 2021). In generally, previous research
    has largely evaluated ET products in exorheic basins by the WB method and requires
    runoff data, which is not easy to obtain in inland basins. Unlike exorheic basins,
    which include ET and runoff in hydrological losses, inland basins (also referred
    to as endorheic basins) only include ET, that is, the hydrological budget in inland
    basins may be simplified as precipitation, ET, and changes in water storage on
    land surfaces. As such, the WB method is more suitable for the simulation of ET
    in inland basins; however, relatively few studies have focused on ET evaluation
    in inland basins. In generally, inland basins are among the most sensitive to
    climate change and human activities (Huang et al., 2016; Liu, 2022; Wang et al.,
    2018). In recent years, global data sets of precipitation, water-storage change,
    and ET have been developing rapidly, providing sufficient data sources for the
    study of catchment WBs on global scale. This study focuses on the major global
    inland basins to achieve three key objectives: (1) To simulate monthly ET series
    of each inland basin from public multi-source precipitation and total water storage
    anomaly (TWSA) data sets using the hydrological budget method; (2) to detect ET
    trends and identify the main attributes of ET changes in each basin; and (3) evaluate
    the accuracy of global RS ET products at the basin scales. This study is expected
    to provide a scientific basis for water resources management in inland basins
    and be useful for investigation of hydrological processes in areas with poor data
    availability. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Study area Inland basins with large
    areas are mainly located in Eurasia, Africa, and Oceania and include the Eurasian
    inland basin (EIB), Lake Chad (LCB) and Okavango River (ORB) basins in Africa,
    and the Lake Eyre basin (LEB) in Oceania. The EIB is the largest inland basin
    in the world, accounting for more than one-third of the global inland basin area,
    spanning 20 countries, and including the Aral Sea (ASB), Caspian Sea (CSB), Issyk-Kul
    Sarysu (ISB), Gansu Hexi Corridor (GHCB), Helmand River (HRB), inner Mongolia
    Plateau (IMPB), Iran inland rivers (IIRB), Junggar (JB), Lake Balkhash (LBB),
    Monglia Plateau lakes (MPLB), Monglia Plateau inland river (MPIRB), Qaidam (QB),
    Qiangtang Plateau (QPB), Tarim River (TaRB), Turgay River (TuRB), and Turpan (TB)
    basins. Inland basins are generally characterized by low precipitation and high
    evaporation; hence, the hydrology and ecosystems of inland basins are sensitive
    to changes in precipitation, water storage, and ET. Overall, 19 inland basins
    were evaluated in this study, comprising a total area of 1.69 × 107 km2. 2.2 Data
    2.2.1 Global gridded precipitation data sets Seven global gridded precipitation
    data sets were used in this study (Table 1), including three gauge-based, two
    RS, and two reanalysis products. The three gauge-based products were obtained
    from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (NOAA) physical sciences
    laboratory. The products were integrated from gauge observations and various satellite
    estimates. Gauge observations were from over 17 000 stations. TABLE 1. Global

    global precipitation measurement (GPM) integrated multi-satellite retrievals (IMERG)
    version 6 are level 3 precipitation products (Huffman et al., 2019a, 2019b). The
    products are gridded global multi-satellite precipitation estimates with quasi-Lagrangian
    time interpolation, using multiple precipitation-relevant passive-microwave satellite
    sensors. The algorithm was combined with precipitation gauge analyses, microwave-calibrated
    infrared satellite estimates, and other precipitation estimators at a finer spatial
    resolution. The modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications
    (MERRA-2) and global land data assimilation system (GLDAS-2.1) are two reanalysis
    products. MERRA-2 is a global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced
    by the national aeronautics and space administration (NASA) global modelling and
    assimilation office using the Goddard Earth observing system model version 5.12.4.
    The GLDAS-2.1 precipitation product is a combination of modelling and observations,
    including the NOAA/global data assimilation system atmospheric analysis and the
    global precipitation climatology project (GPCP) precipitation fields (Beaudoing
    & Rodell, 2020). The data series used in this study spanned from June 2000 to
    December 2020. 2.2.2 GRACE TWSA data sets Several versions of TWSA products have
    been released by several agencies. In this study, we utilized the RL06 (version
    3) GRACE liquid water-equivalent thickness anomaly data series from the Center
    for Space Research (CSR) of the University of Texas (Austin, United States), the
    Geoforschungs Zentrum Potsdam (GFZ), and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),
    with a spatial resolution of 1° × 1°. In addition, the GRACE Mascon solutions
    from CSR (RL06-v2) (Save, 2020), JPL (RL06-v2) (Watkins et al., 2015), and the
    NASA Goddard space flight center (GSFC) (RL06-v.1) (Loomis et al., 2019) were
    also used; the spatial resolutions of these products were 0.5° × 0.5°, 1° × 1°,
    and 1° × 1°, respectively. These six GRACE products are abbreviated as CSR.V3,
    GFZ.V3, JPL.V3, CSR.M, JPL.M, and GFSC.M, respectively. The spherical harmonic
    coefficients solution was used in three version 3 products, while the Mascon solution
    was used in the CSR.M, JPL.M, and GFSC.M products. Post-processing filters were
    applied to reduce correlated errors. These solutions provide accurate surface-based
    gridded information, which can be applied to hydrology studies (Loomis et al.,
    2019; Save et al., 2016; Watkins et al., 2015). Additional descriptions of data
    processing are provided by Loomis et al. (2019), Save et al. (2016), and Watkins
    et al. (2015). A monthly series from April 2002 to December 2020 was used in this
    study. 2.2.3 RS global ET data sets Ten RS global ET data sets were evaluated
    in this study (Table 2). The breathing Earth system simulator (BESS) product is
    produced using the simplified process-based BESS model, which couples atmosphere
    and canopy radiative transfers, canopy photosynthesis, ET, and energy balance
    (Jiang & Ryu, 2016). FluxCom products are generated by machine learning to merge
    energy flux measurements from FLUXNET eddy covariance towers with RS and meteorological
    data (Jung et al., 2019; Tramontana et al., 2016); they include two setups: (1)
    Using RS MODIS data exclusively and (2) using RS and meteorological data. Global
    land surface satellite (GLASS) products are produced using a Bayesian model averaging
    method to improve the ET estimation by merging five process-based algorithms (Liang
    et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2014). The GLEAM products divide ET into canopy transpiration,
    interception loss, soil evaporation, snow sublimation, and open-water evaporation
    (Martens et al., 2017; Miralles et al., 2011). The MOD16A2 product was estimated
    using the Penman–Monteith method from MODIS and meteorological data sets (Mu et
    al., 2011). The numerical terradynamic simulation group (NTSG) product estimates
    canopy transpiration and soil evaporation using the Penman–Monteith method with
    biome-specific canopy conductance determined from the normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) and quantifies open-water evaporation using the Priestley–Taylor
    approach (Zhang et al., 2015). The PML product is produced using the PML method,
    which divides ET into transpiration, soil evaporation, and interception loss (Zhang
    et al., 2010). Surface energy balance system (SEBS) products are produced from
    MODIS land surface temperature, NDVI, global forest height, and albedo (Chen et
    al., 2019). The operational simplified surface energy balance (SSEBop) product
    estimates transpiration and soil evaporation using the SSEBop model (Senay et
    al., 2013). Water, energy, and carbon with artificial neural networks (WECANN)
    products are produced using a statistically based method from RS observations
    (Alemohammad et al., 2017). TABLE 2. RS global ET data sets Product Version Spatial

    budget method for simulating monthly ET The hydrological budget (also called WB)
    method is an effective tool for simulating ET at the basin scales (Liu et al.,
    2014). For a closed inland basin, the monthly ET may be simulated as follows:
    (1) (2) where , , and are the ET, precipitation, and water storage changes, respectively,
    within a month for a closed basin in mm. i is the month. in the next month and
    in the previous month represent water storage at the end and the beginning of
    the simulated month, respectively. The monthly precipitation and TWSA series of
    each basin were averaged from multiple products. The mean and SD approach was
    applied to detect outliers (Liu et al., 2019b). For the gridded precipitation
    and TWSA data, the average data series of each closed basin was calculated based
    on the area weighing of each grid in the basin. For grids covered by the basin
    boundary, the area weighing of the boundary grid was represented by the proportion
    of the area within the basin boundary. This area weighing was necessary to improve
    the accuracy of gridded data sets at basin scale, especially for gridded data
    sets with a coarse spatial resolution (Figure S1). For example, without area weighing,
    the total area of gridded CMAP precipitation data is 2.42 × 107 km2, which is
    43% larger than the area of inland basins. The overestimation of precipitation
    in inland basins was approximately the same. 2.3.2 Trend detection and main attribution
    identification The non-parametric Mann–Kendall (MK) test and trend-magnitude method
    (Hirsch et al., 1982) were applied to detect precipitation and ET trends. Further
    details regarding the MK test are provided by Xu et al. (2010). Based on the WB,
    the main factors causing ET changes were identified. According to the water source
    consumed by ET, the change in ET was attributed to changes in precipitation and
    consumption of other water supply sources. It can be described as (Liu, 2022):
    (3) where ΔET, ΔP and ΔOthers are changes in ET, precipitation and other water
    supply sources (e.g., irrigation from ground water or glacier melt water). Precipitation
    and potential ET have positive and negative effects on ET; this means that an
    increase or decrease in precipitation may prompt an increase or decrease in ET,
    respectively, while an increase or decrease in potential ET may trigger a decrease
    or increase in ET, respectively. Based on these analyses, the main attribution
    of ET changes was identified at the basin scale. The contribution of precipitation
    and other factors to ET changes was semi-quantified by analysing the magnitude
    of the trend between ET and precipitation. 2.3.3 Evaluation criteria The accuracy
    of ET products was evaluated using the ET series estimated by WB (ET_WB) for each
    basin. The criteria used to evaluate these methods included relative error (RE),
    Pearson''s correlation coefficient (CC), index of agreement (IOA), Kling–Gupta
    efficiency (KGE), and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) (Gupta et al., 2009; Nash
    & Sutcliffe, 1970; Willmott et al., 2012). The spatial CC was calculated based
    on observed and modelled long-term means for each individual basin (i.e., sample
    size of 19). The RE represent bias deviation from the observed values, while the
    IOA, KGE, and NSE are indicative of the goodness-of-fit of the simulated and observed
    data series. The best fit value was 1.0, while the goodness-of-fit deteriorated
    with increasing deviation from 1.0. The evaluation criteria were calculated as
    follows: (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) where and are the ith values of the modelled
    and observed ET time series, respectively; n is the time series length; and are
    the mean of the modelled and observed ET, respectively, and and are the SDs of
    the modelled and observed ET, respectively. 3 RESULTS 3.1 Cross validation of
    precipitation and TWSA products Figure 1 shows the mean annual values of seven
    precipitation and six TWSA products for the inland basins. All precipitation products
    were able to capture this characteristic, as the mean annual precipitation of
    all products was generally less than 200 mm for these basins. The mean annual
    precipitation of each product showed little difference in arid areas, with the
    SD of all products being less than 50 mm. In general, consistency was significantly
    higher for TWSA than for precipitation products. The mean values of the TWSA products
    obtained using the spherical harmonic coefficient solutions were significantly
    different from those of the Mascon solutions. The absolute value of the TWSA of
    the latter was generally higher than that of the former, indicating that the TWSA
    varied more in Mascon solutions; however, there was little difference among the
    three spherical harmonic coefficient products or the three mascon products. The
    SDs of the mean values of TWSA products were ~0.2 and 0.4 cm, respectively. FIGURE

    (b) total water storage anomaly (TWSA) products for each inland basin Figure 2a–d
    shows the cross-validation results of the seven precipitation products in each
    basin. The mean values of NSE, KGE, IOA, and CC of each precipitation product
    cross-validated in each basin were 0.49, 0.56, 0.84, and 0.87, respectively, indicating
    that the precipitation products were consistent at the basin scales. In general,
    the monthly series of precipitation products exhibited relatively higher consistency
    in the basins close to the ocean (including GHCB, HRB, IIRB, IMPB, QB, QPB, LEB,
    LCB, and ORB), with the NSE, KGE, IOA, and CC of each basin greater than 0.60,
    0.60, 0.85, and 0.90, respectively. Consistency was even higher for the GHCB,
    IMPB, QPB, LEB, and LCB, with the corresponding NSE, KGE, IOA, and CC being >0.80,
    >0.70, >0.90, and 1.0, respectively. Relatively lower consistency was exhibited
    for the inland basins (including ASB, CSB, ISB, JB, LBB, MPIRB, MPLB, TaRB, TB,
    and TuRB), especially for the CSB, ISB, and TuRB, which were characterized by
    even negative NSE values. Consistency for the entire region was lower than that
    for most basins. Precipitation series of the same type of products have relatively
    higher consistency, especially for gauge-based and reanalysis products. The mean
    values of NSE, CC, and IOA were 0.65, 0.90, and about 0.90, respectively. FIGURE

    The cross-validation results of the six TWSA products for each inland basin are
    shown in Figure 2e–h. The mean values of the NSE, IOA, and CC of the TWSA products
    cross-validated in all basins were 0.69, 0.90, and 0.87, respectively. Consistency
    was higher for the TWSA than for the precipitation products. In contrast to precipitation
    products, the consistency of the TWSA products for the entire region was higher
    than those for most individual basins. The mean NSE of the entire region was 0.88,
    and the corresponding CC and IOA exceeded 0.96. The TWSA products also exhibited
    high consistency in most basins, with the NSE, CC, and IOA of the TWSA products
    cross-validated in each basin being >0.70, >0.90, and >0.90, respectively. However,
    the monthly series of TWSA products showed weak consistency in the GHCB, MPIRB,
    and QPB, with corresponding NSE <0.4. The TWSA series of the same type of products
    also have relatively higher consistency, with the mean values of NSE, CC, and
    IOA being >0.80, >0.90, and >0.90, respectively. 3.2 ET trends and main ET attributions
    in each basin Although there was a high consistency among the data series of each
    precipitation or TWSA product, there were also some differences among the products.
    In order to take full advantage of each product, monthly ET_WB series were simulated
    based on the ensemble-mean series of precipitation and TWSA products in each basin.
    Figure 3 shows the annual precipitation and ET trends for each basin. According
    to the main attribution identification method described in Section 8, the main
    factors affecting ET changes were precipitation changes or human activities. Basins
    in which precipitation changes dominated the ET changes can be categorized as
    follows: (1) Basins in which both precipitation and ET exhibited increasing trends,
    and the ET increase was less than that of precipitation, indicating that the ET
    increase was mainly caused by the precipitation increase. This category included
    LCB, MPLB, MPIRB, and QPB. (2) Basins in which both precipitation and ET exhibited
    decreasing trends, and the ET decrease was less than that of precipitation, thereby
    indicating that the ET decrease was mainly caused by the precipitation decrease.
    This category included LEB, ORB, and TuRB. (3) Basins in which both precipitation
    and ET increased, and the precipitation increase was close to the ET increase.
    This category included IMPB, GHCB, QB, and HRB. Increased precipitation accounted
    for more than 70% of the ET increases in these four basins, especially in the
    three former basins, where this proportion exceeded 85%. This indicated that the
    main factor affecting the AET increase in these basins was increased precipitation.
    This category could also be called natural factors, which were the main causes
    of ET changes. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Trends of annual precipitation
    (P) and evapotranspiration (ET) in each basin. Mango indicates increasing trends
    and the ET increase was greater than that of precipitation. Yellow indicates precipitation
    decrease and concurrent ET increase. Rose quartz indicates decreasing trends,
    and the ET decrease was less than that of precipitation. Sodalite blue indicates
    increasing trends and the ET increase was less than that of precipitation Basins
    in which ET changes were dominated by human activities were categorized as follows:
    (1) Basins where precipitation decreased while ET increased. The ET increase could
    be attributed to human activities in cases of decreasing precipitation. The main
    form of human activity is the artificial groundwater extraction for irrigation.
    This category included IIRB and LBB. (2) Basins in which both precipitation and
    ET exhibited increasing trends, and the precipitation increase was much smaller
    than the ET increase. This category included JB, ASB, and CSB. The proportion
    of precipitation increase that contributed to the ET increase was <30%, and the
    proportion was even <15% for the former two basins. This indicates that the increased
    precipitation only made a relatively small contribution to the ET increase. The
    increase in consumption of other water sources dominated the increasing ET, which
    might have been caused by increased irrigation diversion. In the remaining three
    basins, that is, ISB, TaRB, and TB, the contributions of human activities and
    precipitation to ET changes were roughly equal, with precipitation increase accounting
    for 50 ± 5% of the ET increase and indicating that the increase in precipitation
    and the consumption of other water resources contributed to approximately half
    of the ET changes. 3.3 Accuracy of ET products in simulating monthly ET series
    Figure 4 presents the accuracy of 10 RS ET products in simulating monthly series
    in each inland basin. The performance of each product in simulating the mean value
    of the whole region shows that all products tend to underestimate ET, except for
    the PML. The underestimation of most products was generally within 20%. The GLASS
    and NTSG products demonstrated the best performance regarding the mean values,
    where the underestimation was within 5%. The BESS and SEBS products exhibited
    the greatest underestimation (i.e., >30%). In terms of 190 evaluations at the
    basin scales (i.e., 19 basins × 10 products), more than 60% of RE values were
    within ±30%, while ~17% of them exceeded ±50%. There was also a tendency to underestimate
    ET in most basins, except for the basins in the Tibetan Plateau (i.e., QPB, QB,
    TaRB, and TB), Mongolian Plateau (i.e., MPIRB and MPLB), and ORB. The RMSE evaluation
    results were consistent with those of RE. For the entire region, the GLASS and
    NTSG products also exhibited the best performance, where the RMSE was within 6.0 mm/month,
    while the SEBS product showed the largest RMSE. FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Accuracy of remotely sensed (RS) evapotranspiration (ET) products while
    simulating monthly series in each basin There was a strong correlation between
    monthly ET_WB and RS ET products. The CC of all products was >0.75 for the whole
    region; the CC of most products (i.e., 6/10) was >0.85. According to the intra-annual
    ET distribution, monthly ET for the whole region exhibited a relatively regular
    unimodal distribution (see Figure 5a), with the peak value being approximately
    three times the low value. In terms of evaluations at the basin scales, more than
    60% of the CC values were >0.7. Almost all products were strongly correlated with
    ET_WB (i.e., CC >0.65), except for the MOD16A2 and NTSG products in some basins.
    There was also a strong correlation with ET_WB in most basins, especially LCB,
    ORB, MPLB, CSB, and LBB, while the mean CC value was close to 0.85 in each basin.
    Monthly ET in these basins also exhibited a relatively regular unimodal distribution,
    with a large difference between the peak and low values (Figure 5c,j,l,s,t); however,
    the correlation between the products and ET_WB values was weak in HRB, IIRB TB,
    and QB, with <0.35 mean CC value. Monthly ET in these basins exhibited a bimodal
    distribution with limited seasonal variation (Figure 5e,f,m,p). FIGURE 5 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Monthly mean values of evapotranspiration (ET) products
    in each basin. (a) Is for the whole basin; (b)–(t) Represent the ASB, CSB, GHCB,
    HRB, IIRB, IMPB, ISB, JB, LBB, MPIRB, MPLB, QB, QPB, TaRB, TB, TuRB, LEB, LCB,
    and ORB basins, respectively The IOA of each product for the entire region was
    >0.70, with 0.85 average. NTSG, GLASS, FluxCom, and PML performed the best, with
    IOA >0.9, while the SEBS and WECANN performed relatively poorly, with IOA <0.80.
    In terms of evaluations at the basin scales, performance was relatively better
    in most basins (i.e., 15/19), with a 0.80 average IOA; however, the performance
    was poor for HRB, IIRB, QB, and TB, with only 0.57 average. The KGE of most products
    (i.e., 7/10) was >0.60 for the whole region. The NTSG, GLASS, and FluxCom performed
    the best, with KGE values of 0.88, 0.83, and 0.81, respectively. PML, SEBS, and
    MOD16A2 performed relatively poorly (i.e., KGE <0.5). The performance at the basin
    scales was much lower than that for the entire region, with only 33% of KGE values
    >0.60. The GLEAM exhibited the best performance at the basin scales, and the KGE
    was >0.6 in most basins (i.e., 12/19), with 0.64 average. The FluxCom, GLASS,
    and WECANN also performed relatively better, and the number of basins with KGE
    >0.6 ranged from 8 to 11, with the mean values being >0.52. The MOD16A2, SEBS,
    and PML performed poorly, and their mean KGE values were all <0.35. According
    to NSE evaluations, the NTSG, GLASS, and FluxCom also exhibited the best performance
    for the whole region, with NSE values of 0.80, 0.72, and 0.63, respectively, which
    were consistent with the KGE evaluation results. The PML was second, with NSE
    = 0.52. The other six products performed poorly, with NSE <0.30. In terms of evaluations
    at the basin scales, only 32% of NSE values were >0.5, which was also consistent
    with that of KGE. The GLEAM exhibited the best performance at the basin scales,
    and the KGE was >0.5 in most basins (i.e., 12/19). The GLASS also showed relatively
    better performance, and the number of basins with NSE >0.5 was 10. The performance
    of other products was not satisfactory; especially the MOD16A2, SEBS, and PML
    products at basin scales performed relatively poorly, with NSE >0.5, in only a
    few basins. Figure 6 shows the evaluation results for the 21 ET products in different
    versions. Most of the products (i.e., 17/21) showed strong correlation with ET_WB
    values at basin scales, and the median CC of all basins were >0.75 within the
    corresponding products. The SD of these median values was 0.03. The median IOA
    was also >0.80 for most products (i.e., 17/21), with 0.03 SD. The median values
    of CC and IOA were >0.60 in almost all products, except for MOD16A2. According
    to the KGE and NSE evaluation results, only four versions of the GLASS and GLEAM
    products exhibited satisfactory performance, with the corresponding median KGE
    and NSE values being higher than 0.6 and 0.55, respectively. The median KGE and
    NSE values of other products were below 0.6 and 0.5, respectively, indicating
    that the performance of these products was unsatisfactory in most basins. FIGURE
    6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Accuracy of 21 different versions of evapotranspiration
    (ET) products in each basin. (a), (b), (c), and (d) represent CC, IOA, KGE, and
    NSE, respectively Overall, all versions of the GLASS and GLEAM products performed
    the best in the NSE, KGE, and IOA evaluations; however, MOD16A2, SEBS, PML, and
    SSEBop performed relatively poorly, especially MOD16A2 and SEBS_1. It noted that
    the PML exhibited relatively better performance in the CC evaluation, while the
    other three products still performed relatively poorly. MOD16A2 performed the
    worst in all evaluations because its monthly series were not able to capture the
    seasonal characteristics of ET_WB at basin scales (Figure 5). The performance
    of ET products varies among different types; however, there is relatively smaller
    difference for different versions of the same type of products. In general, the
    version of RS_METEO in the FluxCom products performed better than RS according
    to the CC, IOA, and NSE evaluations; the version of BNU in the GLASS products
    performed better than that of Maryland for all four indexes; the version of SEBS_2
    performed better than SEBS_1 for all four indices. 3.4 Evaluation of ET products
    in capturing spatial characteristics The spatial distributions of annual mean
    ET_WB and ET products at the basin scales are shown in Figure 7. The ET distribution
    was consistent with the precipitation at the basin scales. The annual ET was also
    between 200 and 450 mm in semi-humid and semi-arid basins, including the semi-humid
    CSB and ORB, semi-arid LCB, LEB, and basins in north-western EIB, while it was
    generally below 200 mm in the arid basins of the eastern EIB. All products except
    SEBS and MOD16A2 could capture the spatial ET distribution in inland basins, and
    the spatial CC ranged from 0.83 to 0.93; however, none of them accurately reflected
    the spatial ET characteristics in the region. For example, the mean annual ET
    was higher than 400 mm in the CSB and ORB, and most products could not capture
    this feature. Although the NTST and PML products could capture this feature, their
    results were significantly different from the ET_WB values for other basins. FIGURE
    7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Spatial distributions of annual mean ET_WB
    and evapotranspiration (ET) products in the basin scales 3.5 Evaluation of ensemble-mean
    series of all and the optimized ET products When multiple products are available,
    an ensemble—or its mean series—is typically used in applications. In this study,
    the accuracy of the ensemble-mean series of the optimized and all ET products
    were compared (Figure 8). Outliers were deleted when calculating the ensemble-mean
    series. The ensemble-mean series of all ET products exhibited satisfactory performance
    in the entire study region, with RE, NSE, and KGE of −16%, 0.61, and 0.76, respectively.
    In terms of the basin scales, however, the ensemble-mean series tended to underestimate
    ET in all products, with the mean RE value being −13%. The performance of simulating
    monthly ET_WB was not satisfactory and the mean NSE and KGE values were 0.45 and
    0.57, respectively. FIGURE 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Accuracy of the
    ensemble-mean series for all and the optimized evapotranspiration (ET) products
    The accuracy of the ensemble-mean series of the optimized ET products was significantly
    improved, with the mean RE, NSE, and KGE values for each basin increased to −4%,
    0.58 and 0.69, respectively. The RE value was within ±20% in all basins except
    MPIRB, while it was even within ±10% in most of the basins (i.e., 13/19). There
    were 13 basins with NSE values >0.60, of which nine exhibited NSE values greater
    than 0.70. KGE values were greater than 0.70 in most (i.e., 12/19) basins. Figure
    9 shows the comparison of the ET_WB series for the entire study region with ensembles
    based on all and the optimized ET products. There was high uncertainty (i.e.,
    range) of the ensemble series from all products owing to the pronounced differences
    among ET products. For example, the mean uncertainty for the monthly ensemble
    ET series was 17.0 mm during the 2002–2015 period, which had relatively complete
    temporal coverage. This accounted for more than 60% of the mean ET_WB value. The
    mean uncertainty was greater than 30 mm in summer (JJA), accounting for nearly
    80% of the mean summer ET_WB value. Compared with the ensemble series of all ET
    products, the ensemble series of the optimized products greatly reduced the mean
    uncertainty to 3.7 mm. Even for the relatively higher uncertainty in summer, the
    uncertainty of the optimized products was generally ~5 mm. In addition, the comparisons
    of the ensemble series of all and of the optimized ET products in the basin scales
    were similar to those for the whole study region (not shown). FIGURE 9 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Ensemble series for all and the optimized evapotranspiration
    (ET) products compared to ET_WB series over the whole study region 4 DISCUSSION
    Evaluation of multiple precipitation products showed that gauge-based products
    generally underestimated the annual precipitation in inland basins. This might
    be since the inland basins are generally located in relatively remote hinterlands
    of the continent. In situ monitoring is relatively scarce in these regions, especially
    in mountainous areas where precipitation is relatively high. In situ observations
    from these regions were not able to accurately represent regional precipitation;
    however, the RS and reanalysis products were closer to the actual value of regional
    precipitation. This is consistent with the findings of Miralles et al. (2016).
    In other words, the reliability of RS and reanalysis precipitation products is
    higher than that of gauge-based products in inland basins. Monthly basin scale
    ET simulated by the WB method was compared with site scale ET observed from three
    FLUXNET flux towers (Figure S2), which located on the edge region of the ORB and
    IMPB. Although these sites might be poorly representative of such large basins,
    the RE between the WB_ET and measurements from flux towers is −1.3%, 7.7%, and
    −35.4% at three sites. Calculated accuracies of precipitation and ET products
    were opposite for the entire study region and the basin scales. The performance
    of precipitation products for the entire study region was worse than that for
    the basin scales, which might be due to the relatively homogeneous climate within
    a single basin. For example, precipitation in a basin may be influenced mainly
    by monsoons. Therefore, monthly precipitation exhibits strong and regular seasonal
    variation characteristics. It is easier for precipitation products to capture
    this feature. However, the 19 studied basins involve multiple climate zones, and
    the seasonal regularity of monthly precipitation in the whole region is weak,
    which is not easily captured by precipitation products. The performance of ET
    products for the entire region was significantly better than that for the basin
    scales. This might be since ET for the whole region exhibited a relatively regular
    seasonal variation (Figure 5), which could be easily captured by ET products.
    This was verified by evaluations at the basin scales. Performance was better for
    basins with a regular unimodal or U distribution of mean monthly ET than for basins
    with irregular seasonal ET variation. This is consistent with the results of Liu
    (2021). In addition, some studies have found that the larger the study area, the
    better the performance of ET products (Burchard-Levine et al., 2021; Soltani et
    al., 2021); however, this was not found in the evaluations of the 19 basins in
    this study. Overall, the accuracy of precipitation and ET products was mainly
    affected by regional climate characteristics. In general, the performance of ET
    products varies in different regions. For example, the NTSG, which exhibited the
    best performance for the whole region, was not optimal at the basin scales, and
    even exhibited relatively poor performance in the evaluations of the IOA and KGE
    indices. Overall, the GLASS and GLEAM products exhibited the best performance
    in inland basins, while the MOD16A2 and SEBS products exhibited relatively poor
    performance. This is consistent with the results of other studies. For example,
    based on evaluations by the WB at global basin scales, Liu et al. (2016) found
    that the GLEAM was better than FluxCom and NTST, and Miralles et al. (2016) found
    that GLEAM was better than MOD16A2. However, PML, SSEBop, MOD16A2, SEBS, and NTSG
    were the sequences of their performances when evaluated by global eddy covariance
    measurements at the site scale (Elnashar et al., 2021). Several products (e.g.,
    BESS, FluxCom, and MOD16A2) have a large number of null values in inland basins
    (Figure S3), resulting in the under-representation of ET in many basins. This
    would have a negative effect on the accuracy evaluations, and too many null values
    limit their applicability in inland basins. Nevertheless, there were few null
    values in the other regions and the null-value problem is limited in the worldwide
    application of ET products, especially for exorheic basins. Being the earliest
    global ET product, MOD16A2 did not perform as well as most other products for
    inland basins, which might be due to the improvement of data sources and model
    parameterizations (Liu et al., 2016). This indicates that these improvements in
    models have a positive impact on the accuracy of ET products, and there is still
    need for further improvements in the future. There were also some issues regarding
    the evaluation indices of the IOA and KGE. The calculated IOA values were generally
    high, with little variation for each ET product. Therefore, it is difficult to
    distinguish the differences in simulation accuracies of different products. The
    KGE was not suitable for evaluating the accuracy of variables whose observed mean
    value was close to zero, for example, GRACE TWSA. If the mean value of the observed
    series is close to zero, the term in the calculation of KGE (Equation 7) might
    be extremely large, resulting in biased accuracy evaluation. In addition, the
    selection of indices influences significantly the evaluation results. There were
    a few evaluations with the same results for different indices. The optimal ET
    products were in all evaluations and for all indices the NTSG and GLASS; nevertheless,
    more evaluation results vary by different indices. There were even opposite results
    in the evaluation of some indices. For example, the PML exhibited the highest
    accuracy in the IOA and NSE indices, but relatively poor performance in the RE
    and KGE indices. Therefore, it is recommended to evaluate the performance of ET
    products by multiple criteria at a regional scale before application, and use
    the optimized products to achieve higher accuracy. The uncertainties of the ET_WB
    simulation were mainly due to uncertainties regarding the input data and simulations.
    There was a mismatch between the basin boundary, gridded precipitation, and the
    TWSA data; this would induce a large overestimation in gridded data with spatial
    resolution lower than 1° × 1°. Area weighing of the basin in each boundary grid
    was applied to reduce the uncertainty caused by this mismatch, and showed that
    an ensemble series of the optimized ET products could reduce the uncertainty of
    the simulations. However, limited by observation conditions, there is no globally
    recognized and high-precision precipitation and TWSA data set for evaluating the
    data products used in this study. Therefore, this study used an ensemble-mean
    series of all seven precipitation and six TWSA products for simulations, causing
    uncertainties in the simulated ET_WB. The cross-validation showed that the precipitation
    and TWSA products have high consistency, indicating that these data have high
    accuracy and reliability in inland basins. Regarding the calculation of the ensemble-mean
    series, it used the mean and SD approaches to detect outliers in order to reduce
    the uncertainty caused by outliers in simulations. In the ET_WB simulations (Equation
    1), ΔS represented the change in water storage over a month (i.e., the difference
    between water storage at the end and beginning of the month). However, the GRACE
    TWSA data represented the mean water storage in a month. In this study, the difference
    between the TWSA of the previous month and the next month was used to represent
    the ΔS in the basin, which may also have caused uncertainties. It simulated the
    monthly AET series for a closed basin, in which the runoff process within the
    basin was ignored; however, for a finer temporal scale or an exorheic basin, the
    runoff process within the basin must be considered. The errors of precipitation
    and TWSA data were not considered in this study. Overall, the accuracies of the
    precipitation and TWSA data directly determine the accuracy of the related applications.
    As such, further research on precipitation and TWSA inversion is required for
    hydrology and water resource applications. 5 CONCLUSIONS This study focused on
    the evaluation of RS global ET data sets from major inland basins worldwide. Based
    on the concise hydrological budget of an inland basin, the monthly ET_WB series
    of each basin was simulated from multi-source precipitation and TWSA data sets.
    Precipitation and ET trends were detected using the nonparametric Mann–Kendall
    test. The main attributes of the ET changes were identified in each basin. The
    accuracy of 10 ET products was evaluated by the ET_WB monthly series for the entire
    region and the basin scales. Both the precipitation and TWSA products exhibited
    consistency at the basin scales by cross-validation. The consistency of the TWSA
    products was higher than that of precipitation. The monthly series of precipitation
    products exhibited relatively higher consistency for the basins close to the ocean.
    Natural factors (i.e., precipitation changes) were the main cause of ET changes
    in most basins (i.e., 11/19), including the GHCB, IMPB, QB, HRB, LCB, LEB, MPLB,
    MPIRB, ORB, QPB, and TuRB. Changes in precipitation accounted for more than 85%
    of the ET changes in the three former ones; however, the impacts of human activities,
    mainly as a result of increased irrigation diversion, dominated the ET changes
    in the IIRB, LBB, JB, ASB, and CSB. Most ET products were able to accurately simulate
    monthly ET series in the whole region, but performed relatively worse at the basin
    scales. They were also able to accurately estimate ET series in inland basins
    with a regular unimodal or U distribution of mean monthly ET, but this ability
    was reduced in basins with irregular seasonal ET variations. Most ET products
    were also able to accurately estimate monthly ET in most inland basins; however,
    they performed relatively poorly in the HRB, IIRB, QB, and TB, with the mean NSE
    value being negative. All products tended to underestimate monthly ET, except
    for the PML. Overall, the GLASS and GLEAM products performed the best in inland
    basins, while MOD16A2 and SEBS performed relatively poorly. In addition, all products
    except the SEBS and MOD16A2 could capture the spatial ET distribution in inland
    basins, and the spatial CC ranged from 0.83 to 0.93. The performance of ET products
    varies across different types. Although there were relatively smaller differences
    among different versions of the same type of products, the version of BNU in the
    GLASS, version of RS_METEO in the FluxCom, and version of SEBS_2 exhibited better
    performances than other versions of the same type. In general, an ensemble series
    of optimized ET products could improve the accuracy of simulating monthly ET and
    reduce the uncertainty of the simulation series for the whole region and the basin
    scales. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This study was supported and funded by the Second Tibetan

    Versions Notes Abstract Soil moisture (SM) data can provide guidance for decision-makers
    in fields such as drought monitoring and irrigation management. Soil Moisture
    Active Passive (SMAP) satellite offers sufficient spatial resolution for global-scale
    applications, but its utility is limited in regional areas due to its lower spatial
    resolution. To address this issue, this study proposed a downscaling framework
    based on the Stacking strategy. The framework integrated extreme gradient boosting

    machine learning 1. Introduction Soil moisture (SM) is an important component
    of the global water cycle, affecting rainfall and temperature through evapotranspiration
    processes [1]. Its variation not only relates to plant growth and agricultural
    production, but also to global climate change and extreme climate events, such
    as droughts, floods, and heat waves [2]. In the past, the acquisition of SM data
    has mainly relied on manual sampling and site observations [3]. In situ SM can
    be interpolated to a larger area by geostatistical techniques. However, the practical
    application is unsatisfactory, and the interpolation results have great uncertainty
    in complex surfaces [4]. Therefore, the observation based on point scale makes
    it challenging to meet the monitoring needs of SM at a regional or global scale.
    The remote sensing technique reduces the cost of SM measurements and allows continuous
    monitoring over a large scale. Microwave remote sensing has unique advantages
    in SM monitoring, as it is not affected by weather conditions, has a certain penetration
    ability, and captures SM information in the vertical profile [5]. Previous studies
    have found that L-band is less affected by surface roughness and vegetation types
    [6], and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), represented by L-band, has higher
    accuracy and robustness than other remotely sensed SM products [7]. SMAP L4 products
    provide estimates of surface (0–5 cm) and root zone (0–100 cm) SM at a 9 km spatial
    resolution. These products also fill in the gaps in SMAP observations caused by
    orbit and land surface characteristics, thus providing spatially and temporally
    more complete SM products [8]. However, 9 km resolution is still too coarse for
    many applications that require finer scale data, such as in agriculture, hydrology,
    and ecology. Therefore, it is necessary to develop methods to downscale SMAP products
    to higher resolutions, such as 1 km or finer. There are many classifications for
    downscaling methods [9,10,11]. Zhao et al. [9] categorized downscaling methods
    into three types based on the relational models used: empirical methods, semi-empirical
    methods, and physics-based methods. Among these methods, empirical methods are
    based on a priori knowledge and operate under the assumption that the model’s
    scale remains consistent. They apply a relational model, established at a coarse
    resolution, to high-resolution downscaling factors, thereby producing the downscaled
    SM. This method has been widely used due to its simplicity. Machine learning (ML)
    belongs to the category of empirical methods, which has a strong ability to deal
    with nonlinear issues [12]. It expresses the relationship between SM and downscaling
    factors more reasonably under the lack of a physical background, overcoming the
    limitations of empirical methods and physical-based models. ML techniques have
    many cases in the field of passive microwave SM downscaling. Part of the studies
    performed downscaling directly through a single model. For instance, Wei et al.
    [13] used the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm to downscale SMAP
    products and obtained promising results in most regions, although improvements
    are still needed in areas with denser vegetation cover. Karthikeyan et al. [14]
    generated a multi-layer SM product using the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)
    algorithm, and demonstrated that the method has high accuracy, with ubRMSE less
    than 0.040 m3/m3 at most sites. Another part of the studies selected the best
    performing one for downscaling by comparing a series of models in the training
    phase. Rao et al. [15] adopted a combination of multiple ML methods to downscale
    SMAP SM, including multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression
    (SVR), artificial neural networks (ANNs), random forest (RF) and XGBoost. They
    found that XGBoost was selected most frequently and had the highest accuracy,
    followed by RF. Similarly, Yan et al. [16] compared three ML algorithms: RF, SVR,
    and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) for AMSR-E and AMSR2 products. They found that RF
    had the best accuracy and used it to establish seasonal downscaling models. Despite
    the success of these studies, there are still some potential concerns. A single
    ML model is prone to overfitting in a multidimensional feature space and may not
    fulfill both performance and stability requirements. The Stacking fusion model
    is a heterogeneous ensemble method that can effectively combine the advantages
    of multiple models and obtain better results than a single model. Its advancement
    has been verified in the landslide susceptibility assessment [17], biomass estimation
    [18], visibility prediction [19] and other remote sensing related fields. However,
    to our knowledge, the potential of this method in the field of SM downscaling
    has not been fully explored. Therefore, this study attempted to improve the resolution
    and accuracy of SMAP products by using the Stacking fusion model. We chose three
    models as the base estimators for Stacking: XGBoost, light gradient boosting machine
    (LightGBM), and categorical boosting (CatBoost). They are improved algorithms
    based on GBDT, with excellent generalization ability [20]. The superiority of
    XGBoost and LightGBM in SM downscaling has been confirmed [14,21]. CatBoost is
    widely used in various ML tasks due to its advantages in dealing with categorical
    features and regression issues [22,23]. But its applications in SM downscaling
    are relatively limited, and it is necessary to evaluate its applicability. To
    enhance the interpretability of the downscaling model, auxiliary data closely
    related to SM are required. Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Vegetation Index
    (VI) are the most commonly used factors that form a feature space to describe
    the surface water and heat exchange process, also known as the triangular feature
    space [24]. In addition, Bai et al. [25] found that combining optical/infrared
    data with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data can obtain better downscaling results
    in semi-arid areas with low vegetation cover. This is due to the fact that C-band
    radar can penetrate the soil surface and directly detect the surface SM content,
    while optical data has an indirect relationship with SM. In other words, multi-source
    data can reflect SM changes from different perspectives, thereby complementing
    the limitations of each data type. Apart from the dynamic variables mentioned
    above, some static variables also have a significant impact on SM, such as topography,
    soil properties, and land cover [21,26]. They are more important than dynamic
    variables because they determine the primary level and spatial pattern of SM at
    a specific location, and act as constraint conditions for the downscaling model.
    Dynamic variables predominantly capture the short-term fluctuations of SM, which
    are influenced by climate and vegetation. Karthikeyan et al. [14] first identified
    homogeneous regions by predictors in their study, and then performed SM downscaling
    by region. They suggested that ML algorithms based on homogeneous regions may
    solve the extrapolation problem. This inspires our study: we want to explore whether
    downscaling accuracy can be improved by partitioning modeling in regions with
    complex topography. In summary, the main objective of this study is to downscale
    SMAP L4-SM products using multi-source data through the Stacking strategy. In
    particular, we selected Anhui Province, which has a rich and easily distinguishable
    terrain, as the study area. This study compared the accuracy differences between
    downscaling models with and without terrain partitioning. Furthermore, we performed
    a comprehensive validation of the downscaling results through ground measured
    SM and precipitation data, as well as other 1km SM products. We also analyzed
    the impact of different sources of downscaling factors on SM. The contributions
    of this study are (1) Validating the applicability of the Stacking fusion model
    in passive microwave SM downscaling. (2) Exploring whether the strategy based
    on terrain partitioning can improve the downscaling accuracy. (3) Analyzing how
    different downscaling factors influence SM. 2. Study Area and Data 2.1. Study
    Area Anhui Province (29°41′–34°38′N, 114°54′–119°37′E; Figure 1) is situated in
    eastern China and is significantly influenced by monsoon climate. It has an average
    annual temperature of 14–17 °C and an average annual precipitation of 773–1670
    mm. The topography of Anhui province is diverse [27], with higher elevation in
    the south and lower in the north, consisting of five geomorphic units: Huai Bei
    Plain (HB), Jiang Huai Hilly (JH), Wan Xi Mountain (WX), Yan Jiang Plain (YJ),
    and Wan Nan Mountain (WN). This paper will use these abbreviations to describe
    these geomorphic units, respectively. Figure 1. Location of the study area. HB
    is located in the north of Anhui province, accounting for about 27% of the total
    area, with flat terrain and fertile soil, making it the largest agricultural center
    in the province. JH covers around 23% of the total area, characterized by relatively
    low terrain and abundant water resources. YJ, spanning about 21% of the total
    area, is situated along the Yangtze River. It has a dense river network and well-developed
    paddy agriculture. WX and WN make up approximately 29% of the total area and are
    dominated by forest, with higher elevation. 2.2. Research Data The data used in
    this study included ground measured SM, SMAP SM, MODIS products, Sentinel-1 data,
    DEM, soil property data, and precipitation data, all from the period of 1 April
    to 1 November 2019. Table 1 provides a description of these datasets. Table 1.
    Description of datasets used in this study. 2.2.1. Ground Measured SM Data The
    ground measured SM data are provided by the Anhui Hydrology Bureau. There are
    87 SM sites, of which 11 are located in WN, 5 in WX, 18 in YJ, 16 in JH, and 37
    in HB (Figure 1). These sites collect SM data at three standard depths (10 cm,
    20 cm, and 40 cm) on the 1st, 11th, and 21st of each month at 8:00 AM using the
    drying method. Validation of downscaling results with measured SM at 10 cm may
    introduce some uncertainty as the SMAP L4 represents SM at a depth of 5 cm. It
    has been demonstrated that SM of two consecutive soil layers is strongly correlated
    [28], therefore inconsistency in measurement depths has little effect on the correlation
    assessment. Theoretically, SM at 10 cm will be slightly higher than that at 5
    cm as a result of infiltration and evapotranspiration. 2.2.2. SMAP SM Data SMAP
    is a satellite mission launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    (NASA) in 2015 to monitor the global distribution of SM and freeze–thaw states
    at the Earth’s surface. The satellite is equipped with an L-band radar and an
    L-band radiometer, which synergistically enhance the accuracy and spatial resolution
    of SM retrievals [29]. The SMAP L4-SM data used in this study were acquired from
    the National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) (https://nsidc.org/data/smap, accessed
    on 10 April 2023). It is generated every three hours, and data from 6:00 AM to
    9:00 AM were selected to match the observation time of the measured SM. 2.2.3.
    Modis Products MODIS is a crucial data source for constructing downscaling models
    in this study, providing continuous data with a spatial resolution of 250 m–1
    km for important features such as spectral indices and surface temperature. All
    MODIS products used in this paper have been listed in Table 1, among which the
    MCD12Q1 provides LC data at 500 m resolution for 2019, MOD15A2H provides LAI data
    at 500 m every 8 days, and MOD11A1 provides LST data at 1 km per day. Additionally,
    MOD09A1 provides reflectance data at 500 m resolution every 8 days, and four spectral
    indices were calculated to provide information on surface vegetation, water bodies,
    and soils. The expressions for these indices are as follows: 𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼=(𝑛𝑖𝑟−𝑟𝑒𝑑)/(𝑛𝑖𝑟+𝑟𝑒𝑑)
    (1) 𝐸𝑉𝐼=2.5∗(𝑛𝑖𝑟−𝑟𝑒𝑑)/(𝑛𝑖𝑟+6∗𝑟𝑒𝑑−7.5∗𝑏𝑙𝑢𝑒+1) (2) 𝑁𝐷𝑊𝐼=(𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑛−𝑛𝑖𝑟)/(𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑛+𝑛𝑖𝑟)
    (3) 𝑁𝑆𝐷𝑆𝐼=(𝑠𝑤𝑖𝑟1−𝑠𝑤𝑖𝑟2)/𝑠𝑤𝑖𝑟1 (4) where red, nir, blue, and green correspond to
    bands 1–4 of MODIS, and swir1 and swir2 correspond to bands 6–7, respectively.
    Furthermore, MCD43A3 provides albedo data in visible, near infrared, and shortwave
    bands. Since the difference between the mean values of white-sky albedo and black-sky
    albedo is small and highly correlated [30], their mean values in the shortwave
    band were used as an approximation of surface albedo in this study. 2.2.4. Sentinel-1
    Data Sentinel-1 is composed of two polar-orbiting satellites, Sentinel-1A and
    Sentinel-1B, both equipped with C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors
    to monitor land and ocean surfaces. It has a 12-day repeat cycle and can operate
    in four imaging modes: strip map (SM), interferometric wide swath (IW), extra-wide
    swath (EW), and wave (WV). The IW mode is the main mode for land surface observation,
    providing 10 m resolution images in both VV and VH polarizations. In this study,
    the ascending orbit data of Sentinel-1 in the IW mode were utilized, and a sliding
    time window processing method was applied to generate daily radar data. The window
    had a size of 12 days, containing 6 days before and after each day. This setup
    ensured that each day’s radar data had an equal temporal span, thus avoiding data
    gaps. Within the sliding time window, daily radar data were obtained by averaging
    all the Sentinel-1 images. 2.2.5. Topographic Data Topography plays an important
    role in SM downscaling, which is closely related to the climate, surface runoff,
    and the water cycle, etc. The distribution of SM at different scales is strongly
    influenced by topography (e.g., elevation, slope), and many studies have used
    topographic features for SM downscaling [21]. In this study, the Shuttle Radar
    Topography Mission (SRTM) data from the GEE platform were used with a spatial
    resolution of 90 m. 2.2.6. Soil Property Data Soil properties (proportion of clay,
    sand, and silt) are also vital predictors, which determine the permeability of
    surface water and the water-holding capacity of soil. The soil property data used
    in this study were downloaded from the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) [31].
    This dataset adopted the FAO-90 soil classification system, which encompassed
    physical and chemical characteristics of topsoil (0–30 cm) and subsoil (30–100
    cm). The clay, sand, and silt data of topsoil were extracted and cropped to the
    study area. 2.2.7. Precipitation Data Precipitation is another important climatic
    factor that affects SM dynamics besides surface temperature, and the soil response
    to rainfall differs across depths [32]. Time series precipitation data are commonly
    used to validate downscaled SM. The Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation
    with Station dataset (CHIRPS), which combines 0.05° resolution satellite imagery
    and in situ station data, is currently updated to version 2.0 and provides global
    precipitation data from 1981 to the present. In this study, CHIRPS data were acquired
    through the GEE platform as a validation set for the downscaling results. 2.2.8.
    Other SM Products Two SM products with a spatial resolution of 1 km were selected
    for comparison with downscaled SM. The first is SMCI1.0 (Soil Moisture of China
    by in situ data, version 1.0), produced by Shangguan et al. [33]. It provides
    daily SM data from 2000 to 2020 and consists of 10 depth layers (10–100 cm), offering
    two versions with different resolutions of 30 s (~1 km) and 0.1 deg (~9 km). The
    product is available from the National Tibetan Plateau Science Data Center (https://cstr.cn/18406.11.Terre.tpdc.272415,
    accessed on 6 May 2023). This study obtained SMCI1.0 SM at 10 cm depth with a
    spatial resolution of 1 km as one of the validation datasets. Moreover, SMAP released
    the SMAP-derived 1 km downscaled surface SM product (abbreviated as SMAP D-SM)
    in March 2023, which contains global daily 1 km resolution surface SM [34]. Currently
    version 1 data are available from the NSIDC Center, and daily SM data during the
    study period were obtained as another validation dataset (https://nsidc.org/data/smap,
    accessed on 25 April 2023). The product has two bands: band 1 represents the data
    for the ascending orbit (6 AM) and band 2 for the descending orbit (6 PM). Given
    the high number of missing values, we combined the two bands to fill in the missing
    values of the AM data with the PM data. 3. Methods Section 3.1 illustrates the
    data preparation process based on GEE. Section 3.2 introduces three improved algorithms
    for GBDT: XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM, which are tree-based ML methods that
    differ in model construction, feature processing, and target optimization. To
    integrate the advantages of the three models, this study adopts the Stacking strategy.
    This subsection can be realized with the scikit-learn library for Python3 and
    Jupyter Notebook. Section 3.3 demonstrates the overall downscaling strategy and
    provides a schematic diagram. Finally, Section 3.4 presents several metrics to
    evaluate the downscaling results. 3.1. Data Preparation Some low-quality pixels
    may be observed in the MODIS products due to noise (mainly clouds). To maintain
    the spatial continuity and consistency of the data while minimizing the outliers,
    low-quality pixels were first filtered out through the quality control bands in
    each MODIS dataset. Then, for the daily-scale data (MOD11A1, MCD43A3), the missing
    values were filled in by linear interpolation using the valid values of the images
    within 15 days before and after. Similarly, for the 8-day scale data (MOD09A1,
    MOD15A2H), images of intermediate dates were generated by linear interpolation.
    To further improve the quality and smoothness of the interpolated data, the SG
    (Savitzky–Golay) filter was introduced. This method utilizes polynomials for the
    least-squares fitting of values within a moving window, effectively removing noise
    while preserving the trend of data [35]. There are two important parameters of
    the SG filter, the half-width of the sliding window, m, and the order of the polynomial,
    d. Specifically, m determines the amount of data considered by the filter, while
    d defines the order of the polynomial used in the filter. A larger m and smaller
    d result in a smoother filtering result. After several tests, this study set m
    to 5 and d to 4. MCD12Q1 is an annual product with five classification schemes.
    This study selected Land Cover Type 5, the Plant Functional Type (PFT) scheme,
    which includes 8 biomes and 4 other land cover types, totaling 12 types. The area
    of each class was calculated and reclassified to reduce the complexity and uncertainty
    of classification (Table 2). Water bodies were excluded to minimize the negative
    impacts on downscaling performance. Table 2. MCD12Q1 (PFT) land cover types and
    reclassification scheme. 3.2. Machine Learning Methods 3.2.1. XGBoost XGBoost
    is an ensemble learning method based on the GBDT algorithm proposed by Chen and
    Guestrin [36]. Compared to the traditional GBDT algorithm, XGBoost adopts the
    second-order derivative to expedite model convergence, thereby enhancing optimization
    efficiency. It also incorporates a regularization term to control the model complexity.
    Moreover, XGBoost can handle samples with missing features by assigning them to
    the left or right subtrees based on their gain. 3.2.2. LightGBM LightGBM was created
    by Microsoft in 2017 [37]. It is also based on GBDT and employs a histogram-splitting
    algorithm that greatly reduces the time complexity. Unlike other decision tree
    algorithms that operate level-wise, LightGBM uses a leaf-wise algorithm with depth
    limits, which reduces unnecessary computation. Additionally, LightGBM utilizes
    the gradient-based one-side sampling (GOSS) algorithm to remove samples with small
    gradients and prioritize under-trained data, making it particularly effective
    for handling large datasets. 3.2.3. CatBoost CatBoost is based on oblivious trees,
    developed by Yandex [38]. Oblivious trees are a special type of decision tree
    that are characterized by the use of the same features for node division at each
    level, which can minimize the depth of the tree and memory consumption. By using
    the ordered boosting method, CatBoost addresses the prediction shift problem inherent
    in traditional gradient boosting algorithms, thus avoiding target leakage and
    overfitting. 3.2.4. Stacking Model Current prevailing ensemble learning methods
    include Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking. Bagging and Boosting are homogeneous
    ensemble algorithms, and their base estimators are generated by the same algorithm.
    Stacking is a heterogeneous ensemble approach that observes different aspects
    of the data through different models. It is essentially a stratified structure
    where each layer can contain multiple estimators. In the case of two layers, the
    base estimator in the first layer receives its predictions from the training data
    and then passes them to the second layer for further study. This stratified structure
    allows different models to complement each other, ultimately creating a more powerful
    model. Considering the base models used in this study, the steps of Stacking are
    shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Schematic of the Stacking strategy. 3.3. Construction
    of Downscaling Framework Based on Stacking Strategy ML methods have been widely
    applied in SM downscaling. Some studies experiment directly with a single model,
    while others compare the performance of models during the training phase to select
    the best one. However, relying on a single model may not fully capture the complexity
    of SM distribution, especially when dealing with multiple influencing factors.
    This study proposed a Stacking fusion model for SM downscaling with a total of
    15 predictors, including NDVI, NDWI, NSDSI, EVI, VV, VH, LAI, LST, Albedo, sand,
    silt, clay, DEM, LC, and DOY (day of that year). Figure 3 illustrates the framework
    of downscaling, specifically: Figure 3. Schematic of the proposed downscaling
    framework. Data preparation: in Section 3.1, we performed quality control, gap-filling,
    and SG filtering on MODIS data through the GEE platform, simplifying the land
    cover types and removing the water bodies. Data processing: To standardize the
    spatial resolution of all predictors to 1 km and 9 km, the MCD12Q1 dataset was
    aggregated using the mode method and the remaining datasets were aggregated using
    the mean method. The coordinate systems for all datasets were unified to the UTM
    projection system with WGS84 datum. Sample generation: The 9 km features and SMAP
    L4-SM were sampled according to the terrain partition (HB, JH, WX, YJ, WN). Besides
    remotely sensed features, DOY was added to indicate the generation time of features.
    Model construction: Taking the WN region as an example, the samples collected
    in this region were randomly divided into the training set and test set with a
    ratio of 7:3. XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were trained using the five-fold
    cross validation method and fused through the Stacking strategy. The test set
    was not involved in training and only used for model evaluation. It is worth mentioning
    that, to test the effectiveness of terrain partitioning, we also trained a Stacking
    model without partitioning. Model application: The trained Stacking models were
    then applied to the 1 km resolution features to generate downscaled SM for each
    region, and finally the downscaled results were merged by date. Validation: The
    downscaling results were validated using the measured SM from 87 sites, together
    with precipitation data. Furthermore, we compared the SMCI1.0 and SMAP D-SM products
    as well as the downscaled SM without partitioning. 3.4. Evaluation Method To fully
    evaluate the proposed downscaling framework, several metrics were introduced [39].
    The correlation coefficient (R) and the root mean square error (RMSE) were used
    to assess the performance of the trained model, measuring the difference between
    the predicted and true values. The bias and unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) were also applied.
    UbRMSE is commonly used in SM downscaling studies, and the SMAP requirement for
    ubRMSE is less than 0.040 m3/m3. These four metrics are calculated as follows:
    𝑅= 𝐸[( 𝑦 𝑆𝑀𝐴𝑃 −𝐸[ 𝑦 𝑆𝑀𝐴𝑃 ])( 𝑦 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 −𝐸[ 𝑦 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 ])] 𝜎 𝑆𝑀𝐴𝑃 𝜎 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 (5)
    𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸= 𝐸[ ( 𝑦 𝑆𝑀𝐴𝑃 − 𝑦 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ ] (6)
    𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠=𝐸[ 𝑦 𝑆𝑀𝐴𝑃 ]−𝐸[ 𝑦 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 ] (7) 𝑢𝑏𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸= 𝑅𝑀𝑆 𝐸 2 − 𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠 2 − − − − − − − −
    − − − − √ (8) where E[•] represents the mean operator, 𝑦 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑  and 𝑦 𝑆𝑀𝐴𝑃
    refer to the measured SM and SMAP SM; and 𝜎 𝑆𝑀𝐴𝑃 and 𝜎 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 are the standard
    deviations of the SMAP SM and measured SM, respectively. 4. Results 4.1. Validation
    of Downscaling Framework A total of 310,935 samples were obtained by sampling
    the feature dataset and SMAP L4 dataset at 9 km spatial resolution during the
    study period. For each region, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost models were trained
    using the five-fold cross validation method, and their prediction results were
    fused by the Stacking strategy. Table 3 displays the number of samples for each
    region and the performance of the models in the training and test sets. It is
    evident that all models achieved R values exceeding 0.9 and RMSE values below
    0.028 m3/m3 on both training and testing sets, indicating a strong correlation
    between the model predictions and the actual values. The four models successfully
    captured the relationship among the features and target at a coarse scale. In
    addition, they exhibited similar R and RMSE values on their respective training
    and test sets, which further demonstrated that they were not overfitted. Table
    3. Number of samples and performance of XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost and Stacking
    models on training and test sets for each region (HB, JH, WX, YJ, and WN). Bold
    indicates the best model score. The unit of RMSE is m3/m3. The model’s performance
    on the test set determines its ability to generalize to unknown data. Figure 4
    reveals that the Stacking model outperformed the others, with the highest R and
    the lowest RMSE in each region. XGBoost had comparable performance to Stacking
    model and was the most robust of the three base models. CatBoost also showed reliable
    accuracy, confirming its feasibility for the SM downscaling task. While LightGBM
    had the fastest training speed, its performance was slightly inferior to the other
    models. Surprisingly, the WN region had the best simulation results among the
    five regions (Stacking: R:0.989; RMSE:0.011 m3/m3), followed by the WX region
    (Stacking: R:0.981; RMSE:0.014 m3/m3), which may be attributed to the quality
    of the samples. Figure 4. Performance of XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Stacking
    on the test set. 4.2. Overall Performance of Downscaled SM Downscaled SM was validated
    using the measured SM data collected from April to November 2019. Figure 5 shows
    the distribution of R and ubRMSE values for 87 sites. Overall, most sites exhibited
    satisfactory performance. Regarding R values, 52 sites performed well (R > 0.60;
    60% of the total), 26 sites showed moderate performance (0.4 < R < 0.6; 30%),
    and 9 sites performed poorly (R < 0.4; 10%), including one with extremely weak
    correlation (R < 0). The 9 poorly performing sites were mainly located in the
    HB and JH regions, characterized by flat terrain and predominantly agricultural,
    so the weaker correlation may be attributed to the irrigation conditions in these
    regions. This emphasizes the influence of human activities on SM and the sensitivity
    of the downscaling approach to such impacts. In addition, the average ubRMSE value
    for these 87 sites was 0.040 m3/m3, with 45 sites that met the SMAP accuracy requirements
    for ubRMSE (ubRMSE < 0.040 m3/m3), 38 sites showed acceptable errors (0.040 m3/m3
    < ubRMSE < 0.060 m3/m3), and 4 sites underperformed (ubRMSE > 0.060 m3/m3), mainly
    in the JH and WN regions. Figure 5. Spatial distribution of (a) R and (b) ubRMSE
    between downscaled SM and measured SM at 87 SM sites from 1 April to 1 November
    2019. To further compare the downscaled SM across different regions, bias was
    introduced to assess the deviation between downscaled SM and measured SM. As shown
    in Figure 6, the positions of points represent the values of R and ubRMSE, and
    the colors reflect the bias values. Red indicates a dry bias, while blue signifies
    a wet bias, and the darker the color, the more severe the deviation. The results
    revealed that the downscaled SM in the HB and JH regions exhibited significant
    dry bias. Among the 37 sites in the HB region, 33 sites had bias values less than
    0, as well as for 14 out of 16 sites in the JH region. The average bias values
    for these two regions were −0.050 m3/m3 and −0.034 m3/m3. Conversely, the WX,
    YJ, and WN regions displayed a clear wet bias, especially in the WN region, with
    average bias values of 0.029 m3/m3, 0.026 m3/m3, and 0.090 m3/m3, respectively.
    The fundamental reason for deviation was that the original SMAP products had certain
    uncertainties due to the coarse resolution as well as the effects of vegetation
    and surface roughness, which inevitably affected the performance of the downscaled
    SM. Moreover, the deviation was related to the methods of obtaining SM data at
    different scales. The measured SM was collected based on ground observations,
    representing specific SM values at 10 cm depth, while the downscaled SM represented
    approximate average SM values at 5 cm depth within 1 km. Figure 6. The relationships
    between measured SM and downscaled SM. (a) HB, (b) JH, (c) WX, (d) YJ, and (e)
    WN. The color of the points represents the bias value. n represents the number
    of sites, and sites with a correlation coefficient less than 0 are excluded from
    the figure. We compared all SM products with measured SM and plotted their R,
    bias, RMSE, and ubRMSE values. As shown in Figure 7, the downscaled SM generally
    had higher correlation coefficients, with a mean R value of 0.613 and a median
    R value of 0.659. SMAP L4-SM is the original coarse-resolution product, which
    had comparable accuracy with the downscaled SM (mean R: 0.605; median R: 0.648).
    Yet, the downscaled SM showed a significant reduction in R outliers. The downscaled
    SM(WP) is a downscaled version of SM obtained without partition modeling. It also
    showed reliable accuracy, with a mean R value of 0.551 and a median R value of
    0.610. Compared with SMAP L4-SM, both downscaled SM and downscaled SM(WP) displayed
    a narrower range of bias values and were closer to 0. This may be explained by
    the fact that the downscaling process introduced more details, making the results
    closer to the measured SM. Although the RMSE values of the downscaled SM were
    slightly higher than downscaled SM(WP), its ubRMSE values were generally lower
    and exhibited less variability, suggesting higher overall accuracy. This demonstrated
    the feasibility of the Stacking model in SM downscaling field and proved the effectiveness
    of the terrain-based partitioning modeling strategy. The SMAP D-SM showed the
    most significant variation of all the metrics, implying the instability of its
    performance. This product consists of two bands representing SM values at 6 AM
    and 6 PM. Given the high number of missing values in a single band, the practice
    of using the 6 PM values to fill in the 6 AM missing values may have introduced
    additional uncertainties, leading to inconsistent overall performance. Furthermore,
    the algorithm of the product itself also has an impact. The SMCI1.0 product presented
    the lowest R level and the highest wet bias (mean bias: 0.089 m3/m3; median bias:
    0.076 m3/m3), probably related to the data and method used by the authors. In
    summary, the Stacking model successfully improved the accuracy of SM, especially
    under the terrain partitioning modeling strategy. Figure 7. Comparison of all
    SM products with measured SM. SMAP L4-SM denotes the original 9 km SMAP product.
    SMCI1.0 refers to the 1 km SM product of Shangguan et al. SMAP D-SM is the 1 km
    SM product released by SMAP in March 2023. Downscaled SM is the 1 km downscaling
    results of this study. Downscaled SM(WP) indicates the 1 km downscaling results
    without partition modeling. 4.3. Temporal Dynamics of Downscaled SM To verify
    whether downscaled SM can capture the temporal dynamics of SM and respond to rainfall
    events, we randomly selected 11 sites and plotted a series of charts. In Figure
    8, the first column shows the analysis results of all SM products (SMCI1.0, SMAP
    D-SM, SMAP L4-SM, downscaled SM, downscaled SM (WP)) along with measured SM, and
    precipitation data. The second column keeps only SMAP L4-SM, downscaled SM, and
    measured SM, highlighting the R, bias, and ubRMSE metrics before and after downscaling.
    We identified these sites using CODE-Region-LC numbers, where CODE stands for
    site code, Region for location, and LC for land cover type. The findings suggested
    that both downscaled SM and downscaled SM(WP) had strong temporally consistent
    behavior with SMAP L4-SM and captured the dynamic changes of SM. This observation
    was consistent for all sites. Surprisingly, downscaled SM eliminated the systematic
    deviation of SMAP to a certain extent, making the results closer to the measured
    SM. For instance, SMAP L4 underestimated the surface SM at site 50,637,471, resulting
    in a strong dry bias (bias = 0.094 m3/m3), while downscaled SM minimized it to
    0.010 m3/m3. Similar dry bias corrections were found at sites 50,435,400 and 50,901,400.
    Overestimation can also be mitigated by downscaled SM, as exemplified by sites
    62,905,301 and 70,140,600, where the bias was adjusted from 0.068 m3/m3 and 0.093
    m3/m3 to 0.017 m3/m3 and −0.025 m3/m3, respectively. Figure 8. Time series comparisons
    of SMCI1.0, SMAP D-SM, SMAP L4-SM, downscaled SM, downscaled SM (WP), measured
    SM, and precipitation data at 11 selected SM sites. Note: 2019-10-01 is not displayed
    because only one site had valid measured SM data on that day. Although in some
    cases, the downscaled SM still had a large bias, such as the wet bias of 0.071
    m3/m3 at site 62,909,502; there was already a noticeable improvement compared
    to the original SMAP L4-SM which had a wet bias of 0.138 m3/m3. In contrast, the
    bias correction ability of downscaled SM (WP) was relatively unstable. Some sites
    improved (50,801,100, 62,921,000), while others actually worsened (50,637,471,
    62,802,800), which reaffirmed the advancement of the partitioning strategy. Moreover,
    Figure 8 illustrates that almost every rainfall event corresponded with an increase
    in SM, and both SMAP L4-SM and downscaled SM responded positively. The blue boxes
    in Figure 8 highlight significant increases in SM during rainfall events, and
    the yellow boxes indicate a gradual return of SM after rainfall. Such phenomena
    have existed at any time period. SMCI1.0 tended to overestimate at most sites,
    and SMAP D-SM fluctuated wildly, with only a few valid values from mid-June to
    August. This is consistent with the findings presented in Figure 7. 4.4. Spatial
    Distribution of Downscaled SM To visualize the spatial heterogeneity of the downscaled
    SM, this section presents average distribution maps of SMAP L4-SM, downscaled
    SM, precipitation, LST during the study period, as well as DEM and clay. As can
    be seen from Figure 9, the downscaled SM not only retained the spatial pattern
    of the original SMAP L4-SM, but also provided a higher resolution. The SM pattern
    in Anhui Province presented a clear north–south variation, being lower in the
    north and higher in the south. Such difference is a consequence of combined climatic
    conditions, land cover, and topography [10]. The southern regions are located
    in the humid zone and enjoy abundant precipitation under the influence of monsoon.
    They are predominantly forested, which reduces water evaporation and runoff, thus
    increasing SM retention. Meanwhile, the northern areas experience a semi-humid
    climate characterized by limited precipitation. Coupled with extensive cultivation,
    the soil in this region is loose and has difficulty retaining water [40]. Figure
    9. Mean distribution maps from April to November 2019 for SMAP L4-SM, downscaled
    SM, precipitation, LST, and distribution maps for DEM and clay. Note that water
    bodies are not excluded from the plots. We additionally conducted a detailed examination
    of three regions, labeled A, B, and C, which display unique topographic and climatic
    features. Region A is characterized by low elevation, limited precipitation, and
    high temperature; region C is marked by high elevation, abundant precipitation,
    and low temperature; and region B has a medium elevation between the two, with
    mild temperature and precipitation. The local maps show that downscaled SM was
    sensitive to changes in precipitation and LST, indicating its strong spatial heterogeneity.
    And the distribution of downscaled SM in the three regions demonstrated characteristics
    consistent with topography and climate: region A had generally low SM values,
    suggesting a drier environment; region C tended to have higher SM values, indicating
    ample water resources; and region B had intermediate SM values and did not show
    significant dryness or wetness. It is noteworthy that the downscaled SM showed
    high spatial correlation with DEM and clay, highlighting their dominant roles
    in the downscaling models, while other features modulate the local changes and
    heterogeneity of SM. This finding will be further verified in the subsequent section.
    5. Discussion 5.1. Analysis of Input Predictors We developed a SM downscaling
    framework based on the Stacking strategy using 15 predictors: NDVI, NDWI, NSDSI,
    EVI, VV, VH, LAI, LST, Albedo, sand, silt, clay, DEM, LC, and DOY, which successfully
    generated SM at 1 km resolution on a daily scale. The relative importance of the
    predictors and their effects on the model’s output were also investigated. The
    feature importance provided by the tree models can reveal some of the black-box
    nature of the model and identify the influential features, but they do not indicate
    the exact relationship between the features and target, such as positive or negative
    correlation. SHAP [41] values can measure the magnitude and direction of each
    feature’s influence. They treat each prediction as a collaborative result of all
    features and assign a SHAP value to each feature based on its contribution to
    the prediction. We used SHAP values to analyze how each feature affects the prediction
    result in this study. To approximate the SHAP values of the Stacking model, we
    combined the SHAP values of the XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost models in each
    region on the training set. Feature importance was obtained by taking the mean
    of absolute SHAP values for each feature. Figure 10 displays the SHAP values of
    the features for each region, with the most influential features near the top
    of the y-axis. It is evident that DOY plays the most crucial role in downscaling
    models for all regions. This suggests that it is advisable to introduce time as
    a feature since it can capture the seasonal variation of SM. Moreover, the time
    feature can help the model identify anomalous data caused by noise like cloud
    cover or signal interference and adjust the predicted values promptly. Shangguan
    et al. [42] also found the importance of the DOY in their study. Figure 10. SHAP
    values and feature importance of Stacking models in different regions: (a) HB,
    (b) JH, (c) WX, (d) YJ, and (e) WN. LC_1.0, LC_2.0, LC_3.0, and LC_4.0 are new
    features generated by the one-hot encoding of LC features. (f) Feature importance
    plot obtained by averaging the absolute values of SHAP values; note that the new
    features derived from one-hot encoding of LC have been summed up as LC. Clay is
    the second most influential feature, which along with sand and silt, determines
    the physical properties of the soil, and in turn affects the storage and movement
    of SM [43]. Clay has the finest particles, and soils with more clay content generally
    have lower infiltration and permeability rates but higher water-holding capacity.
    Figure 10d shows a positive correlation between clay and SM, meaning that higher
    clay content leads to higher SM. Conversely, sand has the coarsest particles,
    and soils with more sand content have better permeability and drainage properties
    but lower water-holding capacity. Figure 10c demonstrates that sand is negatively
    correlated with SM, implying that higher sand content results in lower SM. Silt
    has a particle size between clay and sand, which can retain some water making
    the soil moist. DEM is the third significant feature, supported by previous studies
    demonstrating that topography and soil property are crucial factors influencing
    SM dynamics [14,21]. In HB, JH, and YJ regions, DEM was negatively correlated
    with SM, which is consistent with the results of Fu et al. [44]. These regions
    have lower elevations, typically below 100 m, and mainly consist of cropland.
    The negative correlation may be due to the flat topography, which allows moisture
    to accumulate. Unlike other regions, WX and WN have higher elevations and are
    predominantly forested, where a positive trend in the correlation between DEM
    and SM is observed. This could be explained by the role of trees in improving
    soil water retention capacity [45]. Generally, higher elevations have more forest
    cover, while lower elevations are dominated by grasslands or croplands. Forested
    land has more canopy and leaves, which shade solar radiation and reduce heat from
    the soil surface, thereby increasing SM content. On the other hand, temperature
    variations caused by elevation change are also a significant factor; higher elevations
    usually have lower temperatures, which reduces the evaporation rate and favors
    SM retention. We plotted the co-interaction of DEM and LST on SM in the JH and
    WX regions (Figure 11). The results show that DEM was more variable in the WX
    region, and there was a noticeable interaction between LST and DEM. In areas with
    higher DEM, LST tended to be lower and SHAP values were positive, indicating a
    positive effect on SM. On the contrary, the JH region had a small range of DEM
    variation, and the interaction between LST and DEM was less pronounced. These
    findings suggest that the impact of DEM on SM is complex, and it depends not only
    on the variation of DEM itself but also on the interaction effects of DEM with
    other factors. This is exactly the purpose of our downscaling strategy based on
    terrain partitioning, which simplifies the complex influence of terrain and improves
    the stability and consistency of downscaling models. Figure 11. Co-interaction
    of LST and DEM on SM in the JH and WX regions. (a) JH, (b) WX. LST controls the
    surface thermal changes and is the most significant dynamic variable besides DOY.
    Many studies have confirmed its importance [13,46]. As shown in Figure 10, the
    red LST point is on the left side of the y-axis, which means the increase of LST
    will bring negative feedback to the SM. This finding is further supported by Figure
    11, as the SHAP value is less than 0 when the LST exceeds about 25 °C, indicating
    a negative effect on SM at this point. Albedo is also of high importance as it
    represents the proportion of solar radiation reflected by the Earth’s surface.
    Studies have shown a typical exponential relationship between Albedo and SM, and
    the surface Albedo will decrease with the increase of SM [47]. This is due to
    the fact that wet soils are darker than dry soils and darker soils have lower
    albedo values. The negative correlation is more significant in the YJ, WX, and
    WN regions. VV and VH have a certain penetration ability and can directly detect
    the surface SM. Figure 10f shows that VV is more significant than VH, which agrees
    with the findings of Bai [25]. It is noteworthy that the influence of vegetation
    on the backscattering coefficient under the VV mode is less than that of VH. This
    is because under VH polarization, the radar microwave is vertically transmitted
    and horizontally received, which is more susceptible to vegetation, resulting
    in more vegetation information in the backscatter. Whereas VV polarization is
    vertically transmitted and vertically received, and so this mode penetrates the
    vegetation better and contains more soil information in the backscatter. Among
    the four spectral indices (NDVI, EVI, NDWI, and NSDSI), NSDSI has the highest
    importance, followed by NDWI and EVI, and NDVI is the least. NSDSI is an index
    calculated by the reflectance of the swir bands, which is sensitive to the changes
    of SM [48]. NDVI has been proven essential in previous SM downscaling studies,
    but it has little effect in this study. This is not an isolated case; Yang et
    al. [49] also found that NDVI had a low score in their study. The role of vegetation
    was significant in some studies [6,50], but others found that vegetation played
    a limited role at the 1 km scale [51]. This may be caused by the nonlinear and
    threshold effects of vegetation on SM, and the relationship between NDVI and SM
    may be positive, negative, or irrelevant for different vegetation cover. In terms
    of this study, these indices including LAI played a minor role in the downscaling
    models, while clay, DEM, and LST played a major role. 5.2. Uncertainty of This
    Study Despite the encouraging results of our downscaling study, as with most studies,
    there are some unavoidable uncertainties. The first is the quality of the remote
    sensing data sources, including both the predictors and target. During the data
    preparation step, we performed interpolation and filtering operations on the quality-controlled
    feature datasets to obtain more reliable continuous data. In fact, there were
    still missing values and outliers, especially in the LST data. Missing values
    reduced the number of valid samples, while outliers interfered with the judgement
    of the downscaling models to make inaccurate predictions. On the other hand, the
    accuracy of downscaling results is highly dependent on the coarse-resolution SM
    products. Since the model was constructed based on the relationship between the
    aggregated high-resolution predictors and coarse-resolution SM products, the uncertainty
    of the original SM products directly affected the accuracy of the downscaling
    results. As can be seen from Figure 7 and Figure 8, SMAP L4 products tended to
    underestimate at lower SM levels (HB, JH) and overestimate at higher SM levels
    (WX, YJ, and WN). These uncertainties were propagated and amplified during the
    downscaling process, leading to biases in the downscaled SM. Future research should
    aim to enhance the reliability of data sources and minimize the losses associated
    with data quality. The second uncertainty relates to scale. To align the resolution
    of the predictors with SMAP L4, the numerical features were aggregated using the
    average method. However, this process led to a loss of extreme values. For instance,
    the range of DEM changed from 1–1683 m to 4–1212 m. These extreme values reappeared
    when the model was applied, and the unlearned data may affect the accuracy of
    the model’s output. The third uncertainty occurs in the validation phase since
    the measured SM and the remotely sensed SM have different depths and breadths.
    On the one hand, the measured SM is acquired manually by the drying method, which
    always represents the SM condition at a depth of 10 cm, while the remotely sensed
    SM is obtained by inverting the microwave signal. SMAP L4 claims that the depth
    of the surface SM is the top 5 cm of the soil, but the actual penetration depth
    of the microwave signal is not fixed and varies with the soil water content [52].
    This means that the remotely sensed SM may contain SM information from different
    depths, not just from the top 5 cm. On the other hand, the measured SM only reflects
    the SM condition in a small area, while the downscaled SM represents the average
    SM condition within 1 km. In summary, the inconsistency of depth and breadth will
    affect the representativeness of the measured SM collected at a specific depth,
    thus reducing the comparability of the results. 6. Conclusions This study proposed
    a downscaling framework for SMAP soil moisture based on a Stacking strategy that
    considers the geomorphic units. The spatial resolution of the SMAP L4-SM product
    was successfully improved from the original 9 km to 1 km by using multi-source
    datasets including: MODIS, Sentinel-1, topography, and soil property. The main
    findings are summarized as follows. The framework incorporated three ML models,
    XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. Comparison revealed that the Stacking model achieved
    the highest accuracy in all regions, followed by XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM.
    Validation with measured SM showed that 60% of the sites were highly correlated
    with downscaled SM (R > 0.6), with an average ubRMSE of 0.040 m3/m3, which satisfied
    the accuracy requirements of the SMAP products. Moreover, the downscaling results
    outperformed the available 1 km resolution SM products (SMCI1.0, SMAP D-SM) and
    method without partitioning (downscaled SM (WP)). Both downscaled SM and downscaled
    SM (WP) exhibited temporal consistency with SMAP L4-SM and responded positively
    to rainfall events. They also mitigated the systematic bias of the SMAP L4 product,
    but downscaled SM (WP) performed inconsistently and sometimes even aggravated
    the bias. The spatial pattern analysis indicated that the downscaled SM preserved
    the overall trend of SMAP L4-SM while enriching the details. The downscaled SM
    was higher in the humid regions and lower in the semi-humid regions, which agreed
    with the actual situation. Among the 15 predictors, DOY, clay, and DEM were the
    most important and determined the overall distribution of SM. It is worth noting
    that the relationship between DEM and SM was complex; they exhibited a negative
    correlation in the plains and a positive correlation in the mountains. LST and
    Albedo reflected the dynamics of surface energy and showed a negative correlation
    with SM in all regions. VV polarization was less affected by vegetation and thus
    captured SM changes more effectively than VH. NSDSI was found to be more sensitive
    to SM than the other spectral indices, and together they regulated local variations
    and spatial heterogeneity of SM. In conclusion, this study provides evidence supporting
    the applicability of the Stacking model in SM downscaling studies. Furthermore,
    it validates the effectiveness of the terrain-based partitioning strategy. Future
    studies can further explore the effects of long series data in practical applications,
    such as assessing the response of SM to climate change and human activities and
    analyzing the variability of downscaling results in different seasons. Author

  description: 'Background: Leaf water content (LWC) significantly affects rice growth
    and development. Real-time monitoring of rice leaf water status is essential to
    obtain high yield and water use efficiency of rice plants with precise irrigation
    regimes in rice fields. Hyperspectral remote sensing technology is widely used
    in monitoring crop water status because of its rapid, nondestructive, and real-time
    characteristics. Recently, multi-source data have been attempted to integrate
    into a monitored model of crop water status based on spectral indices. However,
    there are fewer studies using spectral index model coupled with multi-source data
    for monitoring LWC in rice plants. Therefore, 2-year field experiments were conducted
    with three irrigation regimes using four rice cultivars in this study. The multi-source
    data, including canopy ecological factors and physiological parameters, were incorporated
    into the vegetation index to accurately predict LWC in rice plants. Results: The
    results presented that the model accuracy of rice LWC estimation after combining
    data from multiple sources improved by 6–44% compared to the accuracy of a single
    spectral index normalized difference index (ND). Additionally, the optimal prediction
    accuracy of rice LWC was produced using a machine algorithm of gradient boosted
    decision tree (GBDT) based on the combination of ND(1287,1673) and crop water
    stress index (CWSI) (R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.01). Conclusions: The machine learning
    estimation model constructed based on multi-source data fully utilizes the spectral
    information and considers the environmental changes in the crop canopy after introducing
    multi-source data parameters, thus improving the performance of spectral technology
    for monitoring rice LWC. The findings may be helpful to the water status diagnosis
    and accurate irrigation management of rice plants.'

    296 Accesses 3 Altmetric Metrics Abstract Background Leaf water content (LWC)
    significantly affects rice growth and development. Real-time monitoring of rice
    leaf water status is essential to obtain high yield and water use efficiency of
    rice plants with precise irrigation regimes in rice fields. Hyperspectral remote
    sensing technology is widely used in monitoring crop water status because of its
    rapid, nondestructive, and real-time characteristics. Recently, multi-source data
    have been attempted to integrate into a monitored model of crop water status based
    on spectral indices. However, there are fewer studies using spectral index model
    coupled with multi-source data for monitoring LWC in rice plants. Therefore, 2-year
    field experiments were conducted with three irrigation regimes using four rice
    cultivars in this study. The multi-source data, including canopy ecological factors
    and physiological parameters, were incorporated into the vegetation index to accurately
    predict LWC in rice plants. Results The results presented that the model accuracy
    of rice LWC estimation after combining data from multiple sources improved by
    6–44% compared to the accuracy of a single spectral index normalized difference
    index (ND). Additionally, the optimal prediction accuracy of rice LWC was produced
    using a machine algorithm of gradient boosted decision tree (GBDT) based on the
    combination of ND(1287,1673) and crop water stress index (CWSI) (R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.01).
    Conclusions The machine learning estimation model constructed based on multi-source
    data fully utilizes the spectral information and considers the environmental changes
    in the crop canopy after introducing multi-source data parameters, thus improving
    the performance of spectral technology for monitoring rice LWC. The findings may
    be helpful to the water status diagnosis and accurate irrigation management of
    rice plants. Introduction Rice is an important staple food worldwide. Rice is
    the largest water-consuming crop in the central rice production regions in the
    world, and water scarcity is bound to threaten rice production [1]. Additionally,
    the water consumption in paddy fields would increase significantly due to global
    climate change in the future. The unfavorable factors must aggravate the water
    crisis in rice fields [2, 3]. Leaf water content (LWC) is an important evaluation
    index for crop water demand status [4]. Monitoring LWC effectively achieves precise
    irrigation, improves water utilization, and alleviates the water crisis. Hyperspectral
    remote sensing technology has recently been widely used in agricultural production
    due to its rapid, nondestructive, and real-time monitoring of crop physiological
    and biochemical characteristics [5,6,7]. Early LWC spectral modeling studies improved
    prediction accuracy by constructing various types of vegetation indices from sensitive
    spectral bands, such as the moisture stress index (MSI) and water index (WI) [8,
    9]. Previous spectral monitoring studies have initially focused on vegetation
    indices derived from spectral bands. Researchers construct different vegetation
    indices by spectrally sensitive bands to improve the prediction accuracy of LWC
    [10, 11]. Vegetation indices are frequently screened by selecting spectral information
    and have a good correlation with LWC at multiple points over many years [12, 13],
    but the established models usually ignore the effects of the growing environment
    and growth characteristics on LWC of the crops. Climate characteristics and physiological
    status of the plants are important factors affecting LWC [14, 15]. The neglected
    information could be the primary reason for the poor generalizability of existing
    vegetation index models in practical applications. Therefore, integrating the
    actors into the spectral monitoring models of LWC would be more high precision
    due to considering the potential effects of the growing environment and growth
    characteristics on LWC [16, 17]. Qin et al. [18] have recently improved crop nitrogen
    content prediction accuracy using a spectral model that combines image feature
    parameters and fluorescence parameters. These results supported our inferences
    that introducing multi-source data may be important means to improve the monitoring
    accuracy of LWC spectral modeling in rice plants. Choosing modeling methods are
    one of key steps in building monitoring models. Vegetation index monitoring models
    have been usually established using linear and nonlinear functions [19, 20]. These
    traditional monitoring models do not represent the complex relationship between
    various indicators. Machine learning algorithms with sophisticated functionality
    and the ability to handle complex relationships between predictors and target
    variables can be a good solution to this problem [21, 22]. The accuracy and stability
    of models have significantly improved with the rapid development of machine learning
    algorithms, and these are widely adopted when establishing rice nitrogen nutrition
    monitoring models [23,24,25]. Moreover, machine learning algorithms allow the
    use of different classes of sample data as input variables, allowing multiple
    sources of data (physiological and ecological indicators and spectral information)
    to be effectively coupled and can effectively discriminate between differences
    in the contributions of the input variables, allowing the model’s parameters can
    be fully utilized. Therefore, we speculated that the monitoring capacities of
    vegetation index models integrating with multi-source data would also have significant
    advantages using machine learning algorithms when predicting the LWC of rice plants
    based on the results previous studies [16, 26]. Three irrigation regimes and four
    varieties with different drought tolerance capacities were established LWC difference
    populations in field experiments. This study’s objectives are to (1) select spectrally
    sensitive bands with high correlation with LWC at multiple growth stages; (2)
    build a new vegetation index model of LWC integrating multi-source data parameters
    after selecting key physiological and ecological indicators; and (3) use a machine
    learning algorithm to optimize the coupling model and select the optimal algorithm
    to monitor the LWC. Materials and methods Site and treatment description Three
    irrigation regimes, including two water-saving irrigation regimes named mild alternate
    dry and wet irrigation (MADW), severe alternate dry and wet irrigation (SADW)
    and traditional irrigation regime (CK), were conducted with four rice cultivars
    in Anhui province of China in 2021 and 2022 (Fig. 1). The planting and sampling
    plan details and soil characteristics are presented in Table 1. The climate conditions
    are displayed in Fig. 2. The irrigation regimes were conducted when rice seedlings
    were planted in plots. The irrigation criterion referenced the classical definition
    for the MADW and SADW treatments [27]. The supplementary irrigation with 2–3 cm
    water layer was carried out when the soil water potential at 20 cm soil layer
    reached − 15 KPa and − 30 KPa in the MADW and SADW treatments during whole growth
    stages of rice plants, respectively, across cultivars, years, and locations. The
    soil water potential of each plot was monitored by a tensiometer (Watermark, Irrometer
    Company Riverside, CA, USA). Moreover, 2–3 cm water later was always maintained
    for the CK treatment during whole growth stages. Generally, 9–14, 5–8, and 18–24
    times irrigated practices were applied for the MADW, SADW, and CK treatments,
    respectively, across cultivars, years, and locations. Fig. 1 Sketch of field experiments

    divided into three applications for each treatment: 40% as a basal fertilizer,
    30% at the early tiller stage, and 30% at the panicle differentiation stage. The
    nitrogen fertilizer was applied at the rate of 240 kg ha−1. Phosphorus and potassium
    fertilizers (P2O5 75 kg ha−1 and K2O 225 kg ha−1) were also applied as basal fertilizers.
    Plot sizes for each experiment were 12 m2 and 40 m2 in Hefei and Fuyang, respectively.
    All experimental rows were spaced 30.0 cm apart, and plants in a row were spaced
    13.3 cm apart. Measurements Hyperspectral and vegetation index Canopy reflectance
    spectra of rice plants were collected for the booting, flowering, initial grain
    filling, and middle grain filling stages using spectral scanning equipment (ASD
    Field Spec 4, Boulder, CO, USA). The band amplitude of the device ranged from
    350 to 2500 nm. The measurements were conducted under clear and cloudless sky
    conditions between 10:00 and 14:00 [16]. After measuring 10 times for each sample,
    the average value was calculated, and the reference plate was used to correct
    the instrument every 15 min. The representative hills were monitored in each plot
    for all treatments at each observed time. Numerous vegetation indices have been
    applied to monitoring crop water content. The normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) has been widely utilized in monitoring plant water using remote sensing
    methods due to its simple construction and effective improvement of spectral monitoring
    accuracy with multi-band analysis compared with other vegetation indices. Thus,
    this study used canopy spectral data to construct the normalized difference index
    (ND) and five traditional vegetation indices. The calculation equations were illustrated
    in Table 2. Table 2 List of vegetation indices used in this study Full size table
    SPAD value and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters SPAD value of rice leaves was
    monitored using a chlorophyll meter (Konica Minolta Company, SPAD-520 plus, Japan).
    The average value of the top three fully expanded leaves was defined as the SPAD
    value of the whole plant. The five independent plants were measured in each plot
    across cultivars, water treatments, and observed periods. The leaves used to measure
    SPAD value were chosen, and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of rice leaves
    were determined using a portable pulse-modulated chlorophyll fluorometer (WALZ
    Company, PAM-2500, Germany). These leaves were used to determine the minimum fluorescence
    level (Fo) and the maximum fluorescence level (Fm) of dark-adapted leaves at dawn
    for all cultivars and treatments. The steady-state Fo was measured using far-red
    light with illumination less than 1 mol m−2 s−1. Then, a 0.80-s saturating pulse
    with 8000 mol m−2 s−1 PAR was supplied to determine the Fm. Moreover, the steady-state
    fluorescence yield (Fs) was recorded at the forenoon with clear and cloudless
    sky conditions. Then, a 0.80-s saturating pulse with 8000 mol m−2 s−1 PAR was
    stimulated to obtain the maximal fluorescence level (Fm''). Finally, the maximum
    photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) and actual photochemical efficiency (Y(II)) were
    calculated: (1) (2) Leaf water content (LWC) The fresh leaf mass (FW) was determined
    by weighing the top three fully expanded leaves immediately. Five hills were sampled
    in each plot for four cultivars and three water treatments during each observed
    period. Fresh leaves were weighed and dried at 80 ℃ to constant weight at each
    sampling. The weight was marked as dry mass (DW). The LWC was calculated as follows:
    (3) Crop water stress index (CWSI) CWSI was calculated as follows [31, 32]: (4)
    (5) (6) (7) where Tc is the crop canopy temperature (℃), and Ta is the air temperature
    (℃). Tmin is the lower limit of the canopy and air temperature difference (℃),
    Tmax is the upper limit of the canopy and air temperature difference (℃), and
    VPD is the air saturation water vapor pressure deficit (KPa). VPG is the difference
    between the air saturation water vapor pressure and VPD when the air temperature
    is Ta and (Ta + A), respectively. A and B are linear regression coefficients.
    RH is the relative humidity of air (%). In this study, a HOBO UX100-003 temperature
    and humidity recorder (Onset, USA) was placed in each plot to automatically record
    rice canopy temperature and humidity every 1 h interval throughout the day. Leaf
    area index (LAI), above-ground biomass (Biomass), and Grain yield Five representative
    hills, which plants in the hills had uniform growth capacities, were randomly
    selected from each plot at each sampling time across all cultivars and irrigation
    treatments. The hills with excessively vigorous or weak plants were not sampled
    to minimize sampling error. All green leaves per hill were scanned using a portable
    leaf area meter (CI-203, CID Inc., USA). The averaged leaf area in a each plot
    was then calculated from the five hills and marked with D (cm2). Finally, the
    scanned green leaf, remaining yellow leaves, stem, and panicle organs were dried
    at 80 ℃ to constant weight to assess the biomass of each plot. (8) where ρ is
    the planting density per square meter (hill m−2). Plants from a 2 m2 area were
    harvested at maturity to calculate the actual grain yield with 13.5% moisture
    content in each plot across cultivars and water treatments. Regression models
    Some common and classic machine learning algorithms were preliminary assessed
    to select elite algorithms with high monitoring abilities to LWC of rice plants.
    Finally, the four machine learning algorithms named decision tree regression (DT),
    random forest regression (RF), K-nearest neighbor regression (KNN), and gradient
    boosting decision tree regression (GBDT) were adopted in this study. The four
    selected methods were successfully applied on estimating various ecological parameters
    such as water content of wheat plants and soil moisture of wheat fields [16, 33].
    In addition, the scikit-learn packages of the four algorithms were from Python
    3.8 software (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). Multiple linear regression
    (MLR) MLR is the most basic and commonly used method for combining two or more
    independent variables that jointly predict or estimate the dependent variable
    [34]. The y is the dependent variable. The x1, x2… xk are the independent variables.
    The multiple linear regression was calculated as follows: (9) where b0 is the
    constant term, e is the error term, and b1, b2… bk are the regression coefficients.
    When x1, x2…, and xk are fixed, b1(k) represents the effect of increase or decrease
    in x1(k) on y for each unit or named the partial regression coefficient of x1(k)
    on y. Decision tree regression (DT) DT is a way to infer classification rules
    as a decision tree from a set of unordered and irregular data, using a top-down
    recursive approach to compare attribute values of nodes inside the decision tree
    [35]. Each internal node is a splitting problem in a decision tree. A test for
    some instance attribute is specified, and it splits the samples arriving at that
    node according to a particular attribute. Each subsequent branch of the node corresponds
    to one of the possible values of that attribute. The prediction results are the
    average values of the output variables in the samples contained in the leaf nodes
    of the regression tree. In this study, the maximum depth of the tree was set as
    10, and the number of trees was 100. Random forest regression (RF) RF resulted
    from random sampling from sample observations and feature variables of the modeled
    data among many decision trees; each sampling result is a tree [36]. Meanwhile,
    each tree generated rules and judgment values that match its properties. Finally,
    the forest algorithm integrated the rules and judgment values of all decision
    trees to achieve random forest regression. K-nearest neighbor regression (KNN)
    KNN was predicted by computing the spatial similarity relationship between the
    k nearest neighbors and the predictor. The algorithm was frequently used for classification
    problems in the early stage and gradually applied to parameter estimation [37].
    The primary principle of the KNN algorithm is that a prediction sample has K nearest
    neighbors in the feature space. Then, the class of the prediction sample was usually
    determined by the majority class of the K nearest neighbors. The K data set value
    was chosen appropriately according to the samples. The model was simplified, and
    useful information was lost if the data set was too large. Oppositely, the model
    would be over-fitted if the data set is too small. The K data set was defined
    as 3 in this study. Gradient boosting decision tree regression (GBDT) GBDT is
    an improved algorithm based on the booting algorithm [38]. The booting algorithm
    assigned the same weight to each training sample in the initial training and then
    increased the weights of the error points after each training session to generate
    multiple base learners. Finally, these base learners were combined, and the model
    was formed using weighting or voting approaches. The difference between gradient
    boosting tree regression and classification algorithms was that the input training
    data was residual. The previous prediction was incorporated into the residual
    to find the training data for the current round instead of the gradient of the
    loss function. Data analysis and model verification The Pearson correlation coefficient
    (PCC) helps to measure the linear correlation between variables [39]. In this
    study, PCC was simply regarded as supplementary means to eliminate unimportant
    indicators with low correlation coefficient and to obtain eigenvalues with high
    correlation coefficient. This meant that indicators closely related to LWC were
    used to build models to improve performance. After removing invalid samples from
    the two-year experiments from 2021 to 2022, 91 sample data for each growth stage
    were obtained. In multiple linear regression (MLR), 2022 data were used for modeling
    (55), whereas 2021 data were used for validation (36). The measured data were
    randomly divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets in the machine learning
    regression algorithm. The regression model''s accuracy was evaluated using the
    determination coefficient (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). The overall
    model was evaluated in the graph, including linear regression and a 1:1 dash-line,
    to determine the relationship between the predicted and measured values. The calculation
    equations are presented in (9)–(10): (10) (11) where is the measured value of
    LWC, is the measured mean value of LWC, is the predicted value of the model, and
    n is the sample size. The larger the R2 value, the better the accuracy of the
    model. The RMSE reflects the degree of dispersion and deviation between the model’s
    predicted and true values. The smaller the value, the better the prediction of
    the model. The workflow of the LWC prediction procedures is illustrated in Fig.
    3. Data preprocessing included the following processes: (1) normal distribution
    test and scatter plots were performed for the original data such as vegetation
    index parameters, leaf water content, and physiological and ecological indexes
    (Additional file 1: Fig. S1–S4). (2) Outliers detection of all parameters were
    shown in Additional file 1: Table S1. (3) The multicollinearity test between ND
    and SPAD, between ND and Fv/Fm, between ND and CWSI at whole observed stages were
    also adopted by variance inflation factor and tolerance values (Additional file
    1: Table S2). Fig. 3 Flow chart of this study Full size image Results The classical
    and new vegetation index for monitoring LWC The sensitive bands of LWC were analyzed
    and tested using the normalized difference vegetation index formula at the booting,
    flowering, initial grain filling, and middle grain filling stages to improve the
    accuracy of the hyperspectral monitoring model for LWC. The classical vegetation
    indices, such as NDII and MSI, had a significant positive correlation with LWC
    and high predictive abilities (Table 3). The vegetation index ND constructed by
    the screened sensitive bands (1287 and 1673 mm) also had a significant positive
    correlation with LWC (Fig. 4). The R2 in the ND(1287,1673) model was higher than
    that in NDII and MSI vegetation indices at each growth stage. These results indicated
    that vegetation index ND was an optimal predicted model at each growth stage of
    rice plants. The R2 of the linear equation between LWC (y) and ND(1287,1673) (x)
    was 0.48, 0.64, 0.57, and 0.53, and the corresponding prediction R2 was 0.36,
    0.67, 0.64, and 0.52 at the booting, flowering, initial grain filling, and middle
    grain filling stages, respectively (Fig. 5). Table 3 Coefficient of determination

    image The relationship between physiological-ecological indicators and LWC The
    physiological-ecological indicators had obvious effects on LWC at each growth
    stage and yield (Fig. 6). The LWC had the highest correlation with grain yield
    at the booting, flowering, and initial grain filling stages. The LWC is the most
    important parameter that regulates grain yield, especially for different irrigation
    treatments. CWSI had the highest correlation coefficient with LWC (− 0.60 to − 0.85)
    at each observed stage, followed by the Fv/Fm (0.56–0.71) and SPAD (0.53–0.67).
    Therefore, CWSI, Fv/Fm, and SPAD can be considered reliable multi-source data
    to improve the detection accuracy of LWC using the vegetation index model. Fig.

    functions between LWC and ND(1287,1673) at different growth stages (Fig. 5) were
    systematically analyzed using multi-source data, such as SPAD, Fv/Fm, and CWSI
    (Fig. 7). Both a and b have significantly quadratic curve relations with CWSI,
    SPAD, and Fv/Fm. For a parameter, the determination coefficient (R2) of the curves
    reached the highest for the CWSI (R2 = 0.92), followed by the SPAD and Fv/Fm.
    In contrast, Fv/Fm had the greatest R2 with parameter b (R2 = 0.99), while CWSI
    had the lowest R2 with parameter b (R2 = 0.37). The results illustrate that SPAD,
    Fv/Fm, and CWSI can be regarded as useful multi-source data to improve the prediction
    capacities of LWC. Fig. 7 The SPAD value (a), Fv/Fm (b), and CWSI (c) at different

    middle grain filling; p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 indicate significant correlation at
    5% and 1% probability level, respectively Full size image Improving the prediction
    performance of LWC by coupling multi-source data There were no multicollinearity
    between ND and SPAD, between ND and Fv/Fm, between ND and CWSI based on the tolerance
    and variance inflation factor values (Additional file 1: Table S2). Also, Durbin
    Watson test indicated that the established multivariate linear regressed models
    in this study were basically meet the requirements of linear model (Additional
    file 1: Table S2). The indicators CWSI, Fv/Fm, and SPAD were introduced into the
    ND(1287,1673) model to improve the prediction model accuracy of LWC further (Table
    4). The results demonstrated that the ND(1287,1673) model integrating with multi-source
    data enhanced predictive power than the conventional ND(1287,1673) model (Fig.
    5 and Table 4). The coupled models of ND(1287,1673) and CWSI had the best monitoring
    capacity to LWC at the booting and flowering stages (Fig. 8). The R2 improved
    from 0.48–0.64 in conventional ND(1287,1673) models to 0.69–0.75 in the coupled
    models. Prediction R2 also improved from 0.36–0.67 in conventional ND(1287,1673)
    models to 0.65–0.69 in the coupled models at the booting and flowering stages.
    Moreover, the coupling models of ND(1287,1673) and Fv/Fm were optimal at the initial
    and middle grain filling. The R2 and the corresponding prediction R2 improved
    in the coupling models than in conventional ND(1287,1673) models at the initial
    and middle grain filling. Table 4 The ND(1287,1673) models predicting LWC after

    flowering stage, most sensitive to water treatments, were used as an example to
    assess the effects of the machine learning algorithm on ND(1287,1673) combined
    with CWSI model precision (Table 5; Fig. 9). The R2 were 0.77, 0.78, 0.75, and
    0.86 based on DT, RF, KNN, and GBDT models, respectively. Additionally, the RMSE
    was 0.01 and 0.02 for the simulating and verifying data sets in the machine learning
    algorithm, respectively. Table 5 The R2 and RMSE of simulating and verifying data

    sets of machine learning algorithm were compared with multiple linear regression
    (MLR) model (Fig. 10). R2 of DT, RF, KNN and GBDT simulation sets were 1.16, 1.23,
    1.16 and 1.35 times higher than that of MLR, respectively (Fig. 10). However,
    the RMSE of all simulated models were almost the same, which the RMSE in simulation
    sets were no advantage in machine learning algorithms compared with MLR. In addition,
    R2 of DT, RF, KNN and GBDT verification sets were 1.12, 1.13, 1.09 and 1.25 times
    higher than that of MLR, respectively. The RMSE in verification sets of DT, RF
    and KNN was about 2 times higher than that of MLR, but the RMSE of GBDT was at

    Full size image Discussion Relationship between multi-source data and LWC A suitable
    vegetation index is important to construct an LWC spectral monitoring model in
    smart agriculture. The first important step is to screen the sensitive band. However,
    there are some differences on the selected water-sensitive bands for different
    crops. Thomas et al. [40] discovered a significant correlation between the relative
    water content of cotton leaves and the reflectance values in the near-infrared
    (NIR) bands (1450 and 1930 nm). Yang et al. [41] suggest that the sensitive band
    range of LWC in wheat plants is located in the visible (400–780 nm) and NIR bands
    (1400–2500 nm). This study selected different spectral indices from previous studies
    to establish relationships with rice LWC. However, the correlation was not optimal.
    The ND constructed by the NIR band at 1287 and 1673 nm was instead optimal (Table
    3). This study’s results were inconsistent with those of previous studies. One
    of the important reasons could be that vegetation index models for monitoring
    LWC in our study considered the multiple growth stages of rice plants, rather
    than focusing on a specific growth stage in previous studies. Additionally, the
    spectral data obtained from different ecological sites, climates, and varieties.
    In this study, the varieties were selected for their commonality bands, considering
    the universality of the varieties from which the four rice varieties with a large
    span of validation years and large differences in drought resistance were selected.
    Recently, multi-source data related to environmental factors coupled with the
    spectral monitoring model of LWC has been successfully established in wheat plants
    to reduce the errors caused by environmental and physiological factors during
    the spectral monitoring process [16]. This study used the Pearson correlation
    coefficient method to analyze the physiological and ecological indicators related
    to LWC. Our results displayed that CWSI, Fv/Fm and SPAD would be considered as
    optimized multi-source data because the parameters had a higher correlation with
    LWC compared to other physiological and agronomic indices during whole observed
    periods (Fig. 6). These findings were also consistent with the basic physiological
    laws of plants that the three parameters would be changed with the change of LWC.
    First, the transpiration rate quickly reduces with declining LWC in rice plants
    [42, 43]. A low transpiration rate increases canopy temperature for a short time
    and then fleetly regulates CWSI in the canopy of plants [44, 45]. Second, H2O
    is insufficient to maintain its physiological activities when LWC is low in rice
    plants; the phenomenon quickly downregulates photosynthetic performance, such
    as declining Fv/Fm [46,47,48]. Third, SPAD biosynthesis would be hindered, and
    decomposition could be accelerated if LWC remains low for a long time, resulting
    in the yellowing of leaves [49]. Finally, the fluctuant sensitive parameters lead
    to significant changes in population characteristics, such as leaf area, biomass,
    and yield, presenting different degrees of decline [50]. Therefore, we deduce
    that CWSI, Fv/Fm, and SPAD should be introduced into the spectral monitoring model
    to improve the R2 for monitoring LWC in whole growth stages of rice plants. Coupling
    multi-source data for monitoring rice LWC The canopy structure and growth environment
    of rice have been changing throughout the whole growth period, resulting in different
    spectral reflectance data, making it difficult to accurately build a water prediction
    model for the whole growth period with a single vegetation index model [51]. A
    good relationship between physiological and ecological indicators and spectral
    information is the key to rapid and non-destructive monitoring of coupled multi-source
    data. The relationships between CWSI, Fv/Fm, and SPAD and the slope (a) and intercept
    (b) of the conventional linear ND(1287,1673) models were systematically analyzed
    at each observed period to achieve accurate prediction of LWC (Fig. 7). The parameter
    a had the closest relationship with CWSI with R2 of 0.92. However, the parameter
    b had the closest relationship with Fv/Fm with R2 of 0.99. These results indicate
    that the conventional linear ND(1287,1673) models could be largely influenced
    by physiological and ecological factors when LWC was monitored using spectroscopic
    equipment. Therefore, slope and intercept could be defined as ecological and physiological
    factors in conventional linear ND(1287,1673) models, especially for monitoring
    LWC in rice plants. This evidence confirms the necessity of incorporating physiological
    parameters into the conventional ND(1287,1673) model to improve LWC monitoring
    accuracy in rice plants. Currently, multi-source data are widely used in hyperspectral
    monitoring. However, most studies have utilized a single type of multi-source
    numbers to construct models independently or in combination, and few studies have
    discussed the effect of coupled multi-source data on the monitoring performance
    of rice LWC models. This study uses a commonly used multiple linear regression
    algorithm to estimate rice LWC based on coupled multi-source data and compare
    its monitoring performance. The results revealed that the monitoring capacities
    in ND(1287,1673) models coupled with physiological and ecological factors were
    significantly increased than conventional ND(1287,1673) models across all observed
    stages (Tables 3 and 4). The coupled model of ND + CWSI and ND + Fv/Fm had the
    best monitoring capacities at the booting to flowering and initial to middle grain
    filling stages, respectively. The different coupled parameters at different growth
    stages may related to the differences in rice growth characteristics. Previous
    studies have demonstrated that the canopy structure is unstable and that leaf
    area and biomass are in a state of constant growth during the booting and flowering
    stages in rice plants [52]. Irrigation regimes directly regulate canopy growth
    and development [53]. Therefore, the canopy micro-ecological factors, such as
    photosynthetically active radiation, temperature, and humidity, constantly fluctuate
    [54], especially for different water treatments. Finally, CWSI is a sensitive
    index at this stage because CWSI is mainly regulated by the micro-ecological factor
    [31, 32]. However, rice plants are in the senescence stage after flowering. Leaf
    photosynthetic capacity significantly declines during the grain-filling stage
    compared to pre-flowering in rice plants [43, 55]. Additionally, photosynthetic
    performances are susceptive to different irrigation regimes during senescence
    processes [56]. Fv/Fm is an important index evaluating photosynthetic performance.
    Therefore, photosynthetic performance could be a better multi-source parameter
    to predict LWC during the rice-filling stage. Comparison of machine learning algorithms
    Machine learning algorithms have recently been widely used in model monitoring
    research and have become popular tools in precision agricultural production research.
    In this study, four machine learning algorithms, DT, RF, KNN, and GBDT were used
    to perform operations based on coupled models using rice flowering data as an
    example (Table 5). The results indicated that the R2 for the simulation and validation
    sets of DT, RF, KNN and GBDT were 0.80–0.93 and 0.75–0.86, respectively, which
    the R2 of machine learning algorithms were 1.16–1.35 times higher for the simulation
    sets and 1.09–1.25 times higher for the validation sets compared with MLR (Fig.
    10). Among them, GBDT has the highest R2 with low and stable RMSE. Therefore,
    the GBDT model would be considered as the best machine learning algorithm for
    monitoring LWC in this study’s simulating and verification data sets. Previous
    research supports our results that the GBDT algorithm has higher prediction accuracy
    for leaf area in maize plants among the aforementioned algorithms [57]. GBDT can
    improve prediction accuracy by constructing a weak learner to correct the original
    model error via residuals and resultant iterations when the sample size is small
    [58]. The same weights are assigned for each input factor for the other algorithms;
    the algorithm would fail to determine the primary contributing factor in the input
    factor if the training data are insufficient [57]. This may be the primary reason
    the GBDT algorithm has significant advantages to improve LWC monitoring capabilities
    in this study because our sample size could not be abundant enough to support
    the data requirements of other algorithms. In summary, machine learning positively
    improves the monitoring abilities of LWC in rice plants. Future perspectives Factors
    such as fertility period and rice LWC changes lead to parameter differences between
    relevant indicators extracted from various data sources. Current crop monitoring
    models are mostly single-factor statistical models that are difficult to consider
    crop growth and development, yield formation and its interactions with climate
    and soil environment, and lack universality and dynamics. Therefore, coupling
    spectral remote sensing information with multivariate data can construct a spectral
    monitoring model with high accuracy and stable reliability of crop growth, moisture
    content, and other indicators, providing an effective solution to the spectral
    monitoring problem. In this study, only four rice cultivars were considered after
    the booting stage, and the early growth of rice has yet to be monitored. Establishing
    a standardized water stress detection and diagnosis system based on water critical
    thresholds at various growth stages of rice will require the accumulation of data
    from multi-year, multi-point, continuous trials based on different rice variety
    types. This can accurately monitor the LWC to ensure high rice yield, improving
    water resource utilization efficiency and providing a basis for implementing precision
    agriculture. Conclusion In this study, the LWC of rice with different cultivars,
    years, and water treatments was monitored based on multi-source data (physiological
    and ecological indicators and spectral information) with machine learning, explored
    the performance of single and combined multi-source data in LWC monitoring, and
    utilized different physiological indicators to establish two monitoring models
    for the growth differences of rice in the initial and middle stages. The results
    displayed that ND + CWSI had better monitoring performance in the early stage
    (booting to flowering stage), while ND + Fv/Fm was better in the late stage (initial
    to middle grain filling stage). Additionally, this study''s newly constructed
    vegetation index ND(1287,1673) also has good monitoring capacities for LWC in
    rice. Meanwhile, the machine learning algorithm (GBDT) further improves the monitoring
    performance of the model. In summary, this study confirms that using multi-source
    data and machine learning can improve the performance of hyperspectral prediction
    of rice LWC. Availability of data and materials The datasets used and/or analyzed

  description: Accurately estimating regional-scale crop yields is substantial in
    determining current agricultural production performance and effective agricultural
    land management. The Yuncheng Basin is an important grain-producing area in the
    Shanxi Province. This paper used Sentinel 2A with a spatial resolution of 10 m
    and MODIS with a temporal resolution of 1 d in 2020. The spatial and temporal
    nonlocal filter-based fusion model (STNLFFM) was used to obtain fused data with
    a spatial resolution of 10 m and a temporal resolution of 1 d, combined with the
    Carnegie–Ames–Stanford Approach (CASA) and light-use efficiency model to achieve
    summer maize (Zea mays L.) yield estimation. The results showed that the fused
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) could inherit the spatial Sentinel-2A
    NDVI details and express the spatial differences between smaller features more
    effectively. The STNLFFM NDVI curve was consistent with the actual summer maize
    growth condition, which accurately reflects the NDVI trend and local abrupt change
    information during the summer maize growth period. Moreover, the fused NDVI was
    influenced by topographic differences and artificial irrigation factors, whereas
    the summer maize yield in mountainous and plateau areas of the Yuncheng Basin
    was <5,000 kg ha−1 and those in the alluvial plain of the Sushui River reached
    8,000 kg ha−1. The accuracy of the yield estimation model constructed based on
    STNLFFM NDVI (mean absolute percentage error [MAPE] = 5.47%, −13.74% ≤ relative
    error [RE] ≤0.12%) was significantly higher than that of the model based on MODIS
    NDVI (MAPE = 15.65%, −19.67% ≤ RE ≤ 20.88%), indicating that the use of spatio-temporal

    platform sUAS small unmanned aerial system 1 INTRODUCTION Crop yield is one of
    the most critical issues affecting national economic development and food security
    (L. Wang et al., 2014). Prompt and accurate crop yield estimation plays a crucial
    role in precision agriculture and sustainable development, which can provide strong
    support for agricultural decision-making and management (Mueller et al., 2012).
    Traditional crop yield estimates rely heavily on ground-based field surveys, which
    are not conducive to estimating crop yields in large regions and are costly (Burke
    & Lobell, 2017), time-consuming, and prone to large errors due to incomplete ground-based
    observations (Meshesha & Abeje, 2018). Since the 1970s, remote-sensing data have
    been widely used for crop yield estimation at various geographical locations and
    scales (Battude et al., 2016; Maimaitijiang et al., 2020; S. Yang, Hu, et al.,
    2021). Recently, with the development of sensor technologies, airborne remote
    sensing and proximal sensing have become important tools for crop condition monitoring,
    yield prediction, and agricultural management optimization (Darra et al., 2021;
    Fountas et al., 2020; Tefera et al., 2022). Crop models incorporating proximal
    sensing images from remote-controlled aerial systems (RAS) can accurately reproduce
    geospatial variation in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield and growth variables
    (Shin et al., 2021). The spectral indices derived from the small unmanned aerial
    system (sUAS) were consistent with on-farm measurements of chlorophyll content
    and yield in maize (Zea mays L.), which were most valid for the relationship between
    spectral signatures and crop health on Malawi farms (Peter et al., 2020). Typically,
    proximal sensing is used for small-scale applications (one or a few plots), whereas
    airborne and satellite remote sensing provides system information over large areas.
    The correlation between Sentinel-2 and UAV vegetation indices was not significant
    when the area was <0.5 ha. When the area was larger than 0.5 ha, Sentinel-2 vegetation
    indices could replace the vegetation indices of UAV-acquired images (Sozzi et
    al., 2020). The crop growth model combined with the advantages of Sentinel-2 imagery
    could extend the accurate estimation of crop yield at the field scale to the regional
    scale (Xie, 2022). Since the light use efficiency model was proposed (Bastiaanssen
    & Ali, 2003; Moriondo et al., 2007), it has been widely used in practical production
    (Z. Liu et al., 2017; J. Ren et al., 2006; X. Shi et al., 2017). Winter wheat
    yields in the Shandong Province from 2000 to 2016 were estimated using the light
    use efficiency model, with small differences in annual increase rates compared
    with statistical data and high accuracy (S. Zhang, Bai, et al., 2021). The relative
    root mean square error (RMSE) for estimating maize yield in Changchun using the
    light-use efficiency model was 15.12% compared with the measured yield (An & Chen,
    2019). The light-use efficiency model process is simple, with fewer and more easily
    accessible parameters, with adequate use of remote-sensing data, and is suitable
    for yield estimation over large areas (Lobell et al., 2003). Core Ideas STNLFFM
    was used to obtain high spatial and temporal resolution images. NPP in summer
    maize planting area was simulated using CASA in combination with STNLFFM. The
    yield estimation accuracy of STNLFFM was higher than that of MODIS. Net primary
    productivity (NPP) plays an important role in crop yield estimation, which is
    a measure that characterizes the production capacity of surface vegetation under
    the action of the external environment (H. Li et al., 2021; S. Wang et al., 2021).
    It is the mass of organic matter dry matter produced by photosynthesis minus the
    organic matter dry matter consumed by plant respiration and other life activities
    in a certain land area (Maeda et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2022). To date, many
    NPP inversion methods can be divided into three categories: statistical models
    that mainly analyze ground meteorological data (such as temperature, precipitation,
    and other climate factors), establish statistical relationships with NPP, and
    derive simple regression models to estimate NPP. Representative statistical models,
    such as the Miami (Del Grosso et al., 2008; Zaks et al., 2007), WOFOST (Dhillon
    et al., 2020; H. Huang, Huang, et al., 2022), and Thornthwaite–Memorial (Cheng
    and Yin, 2022; W. Zhou et al., 2015), are easy to obtain data but lack an ecological
    theoretical basis, and the estimation results are point-based with poor accuracy.
    The process model considers the physiological and ecological processes of plant
    growth and development, which are estimated by simulating the plant photosynthesis,
    auto respiration, and transpiration processes. Typical models include TEM (Cramer
    et al., 1999), BIOME-BGC (B. Huang, Yang, et al., 2022; H. Ren et al., 2022),
    and CENTURY (Nkrumah et al., 2022); however, the process models involve more parameters
    and are difficult to obtain. The theoretical basis of light-use efficiency models
    is resource balance. Representative light use efficiency models include Carnegie–Ames–Stanford
    Approach (CASA) (N. Wu et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2022) and GLO-PEM (Tao et al.,
    2005). Among them, CASA is widely used as a typical representative of light-use
    efficiency models (Hao et al., 2019). The CASA is a light-use efficiency model
    that integrates environmental factors and the characteristics of vegetation, mainly
    using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) as technical
    means, which is driven by remote-sensing data and meteorological data such as
    temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, vegetation type, and soil type (B.
    Yang et al., 2022). Within the Chinese region, compared with statistical models
    (Thornthwaite–Memorial) and process models, CASA showed the highest agreement
    with MODIS NPP and observations (Sun et al., 2021). The CASA can predict crop
    yield at different scales (Fang et al., 2021); its parameters are easy to obtain,
    and most of the parameters required in the model can be extracted from remote-sensing
    data, which largely overcomes the drawback of the lack of information from ground
    stations. The multi-temporal, high spatial resolution, and high temporal resolution
    of remote-sensing products make the CASA model realize NPP dynamic monitoring
    (H. Yang, Zhong, et al., 2021), inversion of the spatial distribution of NPP,
    and analysis of vegetation or crop growth (F. Shi et al., 2022; Wan et al., 2022).
    However, the influence of clouds, rain, and snow limits the acquisition of a continuous
    time series of medium-resolution NPP data (Q. Wang & Atkinson, 2018). To solve
    this problem, scholars at home and abroad have used spatio-temporal fusion of
    multi-source remote-sensing data (F. Gao et al., 2006; H. Liu & Weng, 2012; J.
    J. Walker et al., 2014) to obtain both temporal phase information of high temporal
    resolution remote-sensing data and spatial texture information of medium spatial
    resolution data to simulate the spatio-temporal dynamics of terrestrial vegetation
    NPP. Image spatio-temporal fusion is the fusion of a known “temporally dense”
    low spatial resolution image sequence with a “temporally sparse” high spatial
    resolution image sequence corresponding to some of its time points to produce
    a “temporally dense” high spatial resolution image sequence corresponding to the
    low spatial resolution image sequence (Belgiu & Stein, 2019; Emelyanova et al.,
    2013; X. Zhu et al., 2018). Currently, spatio-temporal fusion application models
    can be broadly classified into the following three categories. Based on transformation
    fusion models, which are based on data transformation for processing and handling
    data information. To obtain high-resolution images at the predicted moment, an
    inverse transformation process is required, which is represented by wavelet variation
    (Acerbi et al., 2006; Malenovský et al., 2007). The advantage of this method is
    that the detailed information of the spectra is well preserved, while the disadvantage
    is the existence of a mixed image element problem that cannot be solved and the
    low fusion accuracy (Amolins et al., 2007; Gungor & Shan, 2004). Based on the
    reconstructed fusion models, most of these models are studied using the image
    element decomposition method, assuming that the image element reflectance of low
    spatial resolution data can be regarded as a linear combination of high spatial
    resolution image element reflectance. Representative models include the spatial
    and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) (F. Gao et al., 2006),
    enhancement spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) (X.
    Zhu et al., 2010), and spatial and temporal nonlocal filter-based fusion model
    (STNLFFM) (Cheng et al., 2017). This model considers not only spatial heterogeneity,
    but also the nonlinear characteristics of the image element reflectivity variation
    (Jarihani et al., 2014). In regions with high heterogeneity, the algorithm exhibits
    a significant improvement in fusion accuracy while retaining more spatially detailed
    information (Gevaert & García-Haro, 2015). The learning-based model mainly performs
    image processing using sparse representation. It uses a two-layer spatio-temporal
    fusion model to fully consider the differences in different resolution data, and
    the variation in surface reflectance in different images can be effectively captured
    (Song & Huang, 2012; H. Song et al., 2018). However, it has high data requirements,
    low operational efficiency, and is unsuitable for large-area studies (B. Huang
    & Song, 2012). The STNLFFM constructs a model to describe spatio-temporal relationships
    based on the variation of features within different time phases. The ESTARFM is
    based on correlations between different data sources and on minimizing systematic
    deviations, thus performing spatio-temporal resolution fusion operations. The
    STNLFFM is based on the same reconstruction fusion model as ESTARFM. In contrast
    to the reconstruction fusion model, the former uses the spatial information provided
    by similar image elements with high spatial resolution at the reference moment
    and assigns weights to individual similar image elements by calculating the temporal
    phase differences between similar image elements and the neighborhood blocks of
    the central image element at different moments in the calculation of weights.
    The fusion results of STNLFFM were more accurate and applicable for complex object
    types and a high number of heterogeneous image elements (Dong et al., 2019). The
    STNLFFM can effectively eliminate the accuracy degradation problem caused by excessive
    temporal phase differences when performing dual-temporal assisted fusion, which
    is because the model constructs the weight function to account for the temporal
    phase differences between images, introduces overall weights for window blocks,
    and avoids assigning higher weights to temporal phases with excessive differences,
    thus improving the accuracy of dual-temporal-assisted fusion (J. Wu et al., 2017).
    Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation of typical fusion algorithms
    from a single time phase (“points”), time series (“lines”), and multiple data
    products (“surfaces”) in combination with surface reflectance, vegetation index,
    and surface temperature showed that STNLFFM has good fusion effects (Lei et al.,
    2021; M. Zhang, Lin, et al., 2021). Compared with MODIS, the fusion-based normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI) provides more detailed spatial information
    on the NPP estimated by CASA and has a higher correlation with the measured values
    (Yin et al., 2020; M. Zhang, Lin, et al., 2019; R. Zhang, Zeng, et al., 2021).
    The spatio-temporal fusion technique of multi-source remote-sensing data can acquire
    both temporal phase information of high temporal resolution remote-sensing data
    and spatial texture information of medium spatial resolution data (Singh, 2011;
    J. J. Walker et al., 2014; M. Zhang, Lin, et al., 2021), which can provide an
    effective data source for spatio-temporal variation in terrestrial vegetation
    NPP. The Yuncheng Basin is known as the “granary of Shanxi” in which wheat and
    maize are the main crops. Summer maize accounts for 44.21% of the total arable
    land in the entire region, which makes it one of the most important grain-producing
    areas in the Shanxi Province. Due to the comprehensive implementation of conservation
    tillage in the Yuncheng region in recent years (M. Zhang, 2017), the cultivated
    area has rapidly increased; therefore, the current NPP simulations in the region
    are timely and beneficial to understand crop growth and their health conditions,
    the changes in the structure of crop cultivation, and the crop yield within the
    Yuncheng Basin. This study explored the use of multi-source remote-sensing data
    spatio-temporal fusion technology to obtain remote-sensing images with a 10-m
    resolution to simulate the NPP of summer maize in 2020 and yield estimation based
    on the light use efficiency model, with the aim of providing a feasible technical
    tool for large-scale crop yield estimation, using summer maize in the Yuncheng
    basin as the study area. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Study area The Yuncheng Basin
    is in the southwestern part of the Shanxi Province (110°15 E–111°46 E, 34°40 N–35°38
    N), with a narrow topography and a Northeast–Southwest distribution. The northern
    part of the basin is the Zijin Mountain-Emei terraces, surrounded by the Zhongtiao
    Mountains in the Southeast and looking West across the Yellow River to the Guanzhong
    Plain, including Wenxi County, Xia County, Yanhu District, Yongji City, Linyi
    County, and parts of Wanrong County and Jiang County (Figure 1), with a total
    area of approximately 6,140.6 km2. The region is a warm temperate continental
    semiarid monsoon climate zone with four distinct seasons, warm climate, and abundant
    precipitation, with average annual temperatures ranging from 11.5 to 13.8 °C and
    annual precipitation of about 500–580 mm (W. Wang et al., 2022), which has both
    latitudinal zonal climate and significant vertical variation (Khaled et al., 2022)
    and is suitable for wheat, maize, sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], and grain
    crops for cultivation and breeding. The entire basin is high in the Northeast
    and low in the Southwest, narrow in the North and wide in the South, and the topography
    gradually rises from the river valley area to both sides, which is a typical river
    valley basin, in which the plain area accounts for 58.20% of the total area of
    the region, and the mountains and hills account for nearly 41.80% (T. Liu, Gao,
    et al., 2020). The main river in the basin is the Sushui River, a first-class
    tributary of the Yellow River, which originates at the western foot of Zhongtiao
    Mountain and flows from Northeast to Southwest, passing through six counties and
    districts with a total length of 196.6 km. The main soil type in the Yuncheng
    Basin is brown soil (C. Yang et al., 2020), which covers about 80% of the region,
    and has a neutral, slightly alkaline reaction, with a high accumulation of minerals
    and organic matter, a thick humus layer (X. Gao et al., 2020), and high fertility,
    which is conducive to farming. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer Regional overview

    on the following dates in 2020: 5 April, 15 May, 24 June, 2 September, and 22
    October. Owing to the >50% cloudiness of the Sentinel-2A images in July and August,
    images within these dates were not selected. The NDVI with a spatial resolution
    of 10 m was calculated by resampling, stitching, and transforming the projection
    with Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) software (Khan et al., 2020). The MODIS
    reflectivity product MOD09GA with 500 m spatial resolution and a temporal resolution
    of 1 d for orbits H26V05 and H27V05 was acquired through NASA (https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/).
    The NDVI was calculated using the red band (R) and near-infrared band (NIR) on
    a 1-d scale based on the image stitching and conversion of MOD09GA to UTM projection.
    The meteorological parameters that were selected were the monthly average temperature
    and monthly total precipitation data collected from the 23 meteorological stations
    around the study area, and these were obtained from the China Meteorological Network
    (http://data.cma.cn/). Additionally, the monthly total solar radiation data, which
    was determined by calculating the daily solar hours obtained by the Angstrom–Prescott
    solar radiation calculation model (Duffie & Beckman, 1980), was also one of the
    parameters. The topographical data of the study area were obtained from the “Geospatial
    Data Cloud Platform” (http://www.gscloud.cn) using the ASTER GDEM 30-m product.
    Meanwhile, the meteorological raster data for the region was obtained using spatially
    interpolated meteorological data by an interpolation tool called ANUSPLIN (Huayang
    et al., 2019); the latitude and longitude being the independent variables while
    the elevation was the covariate. The sample points of the summer maize were obtained
    from the “2020 National Arable Land Quality Location Inspection Work”, where information
    on sowing and harvesting time, irrigation amount, crop yield, and crop stalk yield
    were contained. Sampling was conducted within experimental sample plots in Yongji
    City (11 Oct. 2020), Yanhu District (7 Oct. 2020), Linyi County (9 Oct. 2020),
    Xia County (4 Oct. 2020), and Jiang County (15 Oct. 2020), with a sampling area
    of 3 by 3 m, and the locations of sampling points were recorded using the handheld
    GPS (Figure 1). Five-point sampling was used for sampling. After drying and weighing,
    the average weight of summer maize from the five sampling points was used as the
    yield data for the given sample area. Among the raster data, the row number, image
    size, and projection were similar to the Sentinel-2A data. 2.3 Research methods
    2.3.1 STNLFFM The STNLFFM (Cheng et al., 2017) was constructed as a spatio-temporal
    model wherein the difference in temporal phases of different features enhances
    the fusion accuracy by improving the weighting function and transformation relationship
    between high and low resolution data. It uses the formula (Equation 1): (1) where
    F(x,y,tp) is the Sentinel-2A NDVI of the target pixel (x,y) for the predicted
    date tp; M is the number of basis (reference) dates; N is the total number of
    similar pixels (of the same type as the target pixel) in the image; (xi,yi) is
    the position of the ith similar pixel; a(xi,yi,Δtk) b(xi,yi,Δtk) are the linear
    fit coefficients of the MODIS NDVI similar pixel set between the reference moment
    tk and the predicted moment tp, which are calculated using the least squares method;
    and W(xi,yi,tk) is the weight of the ith similar pixel of the Sentinel-2A NDVI
    at the reference date tk (Equation 2). (2) (3) (4) where Windividual(xi,yi,tk)
    (Equation 3) and Wwhole(xi,yi,tk) (Equation 4) are respective individual and integral
    weights, h is the filtering parameter set to 0.15, G is the Gaussian kernel function;
    C(xi,yi,tk) and C(xi,yi,tp) are respectively the patches centered on (xi,yi) pixels
    on MODIS NDVI at the moments of tk and tp; and ω is set to 51 for the overall
    weight calculation with ω × ω as the window unit. 2.3.2 CASA CASA is a typical
    representative of light use efficiency model. It uses solar light energy as the
    driver to achieve the inversion of vegetation NPP around Absorbed Photosynthetic
    Active Radiation (APAR) (Equation 6) and light use efficiency (ε) (Potter et al.,
    1993). It uses meteorological data and remote sensing images acquired through
    the formula (Equation 5): (5) where x is the pixel; t is the time; NPP(x,t) is
    the net primary productivity (gC m−2) of pixel x in month t; (x,t) is the light
    and effective radiation (MJ m−2) obtained by pixel x at the corresponding position
    in month t; and ε(x,t) is the actual light use efficiency (gC MJ−1) of pixel x
    in month t. (6) where SOL(x,t) is the total solar radiation (MJ m−2) at point
    x in time t (Tan et al., 2012); the constant used was 0.5, which pertains to the
    proportion of the effective solar radiation (0.38∼0.71 μm wavelength) of the total
    solar radiation used by vegetation; and FPAR(x,t) is the proportion of light and
    effective radiation absorption by vegetation at the corresponding location. The
    total monthly solar radiation in this study was obtained using a model for calculating
    the total solar radiation, with sunshine hours as a parameter (Ma et al., 2013;
    Weng, 1964). It uses the formula (Equation 7): (7) where Q is the monthly total
    solar radiation; Q1 is the monthly total astronomical solar radiation, which is
    obtained by summing the daily total astronomical radiation of the month; n is
    the actual insolation hours; N is the maximum possible insolation hours; n/N is
    the relative insolation; a and b are the regression constants, and the value of
    a is 0.18 and b is 0.55 for the study area located in the temperate zone (X. Liu
    et al., 2013). (8) where Q0 is the total daily astronomical solar radiation (MJ
    m−2 d−1) (Equation 8); T is the period, taking the value of 24 × 60 × 60s; S0
    is the solar constant, taking the value of 13.67 × 10−4 MJ m−2 s−1; ρ is the relative
    distance between sun and earth (Equation 11); φ is the geographical latitude;
    δ is the solar declination (Equation 10); ω0 is the sunset time angle (°) (Equation
    9). (9) (10) (11) where J is the number of days starting on 1 January (J = 0 or
    1) and ending on 31 December (J = 365 or 366). The specific value of FPAR is related
    to the characteristics of the vegetation itself, and the study showed that the
    two vegetation type factors, the differential vegetation index and specific vegetation
    index, have a strong correlation. It uses the following formula (Equation 12):
    (12) where NDVI(x,t) is the NDVI value; NDVIi,min and NDVIi,max are the minimum
    and maximum values of NDVI for the ith vegetation type, respectively, where NDVIi,min
    and NDVIi,max are the values corresponding to 5 and 95% of the NDVI statistical
    histogram for that vegetation type in this study; FPARmin and FPARmax are constants,
    with values of 0.001 and 0.95, respectively (He et al., 2018). The light use rate
    is the efficiency of converting photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by
    plants into organic carbon per unit of land face value and per unit of time. The
    magnitude of this value is influenced by light, temperature, moisture, and other
    factors. It uses the following formula (Equation 13): (13) where Tε1(x,t) and
    Tε2(x,t) are the coefficients of stress effects of low and high temperatures on
    light use efficiency and the Wε(x,t) is the coefficient of moisture stress effects,
    in which it reacts to the effects of moisture conditions. The formula of Tε1(x,t),
    Tε2(x,t) (Equation 14) and Wε(x,t) (Equation 16) was based on the research method
    of W. Zhu et al. (2007); and ε* is the maximum light use efficiency (gC MJ−1)
    under ideal conditions; the ε* was taken as 0.542 gC MJ −1 (W. Zhu et al., 2007),
    corresponding to the summer maize growing area. (14) where Topt(x,t) is the optimum
    temperature for plant growth, characterized by the average temperature of the
    month when the regional NDVI reaches its maximum, indicating that vegetation growth
    is comfortable at this time. When the average temperature T(x,t) at time t is
    10 °C higher or 13 °C lower than the optimum temperature Topt(x,t), Tε2(x,t) is
    half of Tε2(x,t) when the monthly average temperature is the optimum temperature
    Topt(x,t). In the other cases, the calculation formula is as follows (Equation
    15): (15) where T(x,t) is the average temperature of the image element x at time
    t. (16) where E(x,t) is the actual regional evapotranspiration (mm) obtained by
    the regional actual evapotranspiration model (X. Zhang, 1989; G. Zhou & Zhang,
    1995), Ep(x,t) is the potential regional evapotranspiration (mm) obtained according
    to the complementary relationship proposed by Boucher (X. Zhang et al., 1993;
    G. Zhou et al., 1998). It uses the formula (Equations 17-18, and 19): (17) (18)
    (19) where P(x,t) is the rainfall (mm) of image element x in month t, Rn(x,t)
    is the net surface radiation (mm) of image element x in month t, Ep0(x,t) is the
    local potential evapotranspiration (mm), which is derived from the Thornthwaite
    vegetation-climate relationship model (X. Zhang et al., 1993; Zhou & Zhang, 1995),
    with the following equations (Equations 20-21, and 22): (20) (21) (22) where I(x)
    is the heat indicator for the sum of n months, a(x) formula applies to the temperature
    range of 0∼26.5 °C, and a(x) and I(x) outside this range do not satisfy this function.
    2.3.3 Yield estimation model As the light use efficiency model has been the primary
    method used in crop growth monitoring and yield estimation studies (An & Chen,
    2019), it was combined with the data obtained from the sample sites in this study
    using the formula (Equation 23): (23) where Y(Yield) is the yield per unit area
    of the crop (kg ha−1); NPP is the accumulation of NPP of vegetation; T is the
    conversion coefficient between plant carbon content and plant dry matter mass,
    for one crop T is a constant which is between 45∼50% of plant biomass C content
    (J. C. Walker, 1991), and whose T value is about 2.22∼2.46; and p is the proportion
    of biomass in the aboveground part of the crop relative to the whole plant, the
    crop maize p takes the value of 0.9 (Y. Wang, Xu, et al., 2019); ω is the moisture
    content coefficient of the crop during the storage period following harvest with
    13∼14% (Jia et al., 2021) as the value of ω for maize; HI is the index of harvest,
    which is 0.45∼0.53 (Yan et al., 2007) for maize; and the number 10 is the unit
    conversion factor that converts the unit of measure g m−2 to the common unit of
    measure kg ha−1 for grain production. Based on the field survey, T was 2.22, ω
    14%, and HI was 0.49 (Figure 2). FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer Technical flow
    chart 3 RESULTS 3.1 Data fusion accuracy The STNLFFM NDVI with a temporal resolution
    of 1 d and spatial resolution of 10 m was obtained based on the fused Sentinel-2A
    NDVI and MODIS NDVI using the STNLFFM. To test the accuracy of the STNLFFM algorithm,
    the 10-m resolution of NDVI of 24 June was predicted from the Sentinel-2A NDVI
    of 5 Apr. and 15 May 2020. It was then compared with the Sentinel-2A NDVI of 24
    June and predicted from the 10-m resolution NDVI on 2 Sept., 15 May, and 24 June
    2020. Additionally, the 10-m resolution NDVI on 22 October obtained from Sentinel-2A
    NDVI on 24 June and 2 Sept. 2020 was compared with the Sentinel-2A NDVI on 22
    October (Figure 3). The image in Figure 3 shows the downstream area of the Sushui
    River basin, and the scatter plot presents a comparison of Sentinel-2A NDVI and
    STNLFFM NDVI for the entire area. Visual analysis showed that the NDVI based on
    STNLFFM fusion had significantly improved spatial resolution compared with MODIS
    NDVI, with excellent spatial detail information (Pi et al., 2021), and could better
    express the spatial differences between smaller features, compared with Sentinel-2A
    NDVI, with better spatial resolution and spatial distribution trends being generally
    consistent. The calculation of the correlation coefficient r, Bias, and root mean
    square error (RMSE) (Gevaert & García-Haro, 2015) showed that the r between STNLFFM
    NDVI and Sentinel-2A NDVI was >0.668, and the scatter on 22 October was mainly
    distributed in the vicinity of the 1:1 line, indicating that STNLFFM NDVI had
    a high linear correlation with Sentinel-2A NDVI. Most of the scatter on 24 June
    and 2 September was distributed near the 1:1 line, and the linear correlation
    between the STNLFFM NDVI and Sentinel-2A NDVI was lower than that on 22 October.
    The Bias ranged from 0.0096 to 0.0356, and the RMSE ranged from 0.113 to 0.177,
    indicating that the NDVI data generated with this fusion algorithm had high accuracy
    and good agreement with the real images. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer Comparison
    of the spatial accuracy of spatial and temporal nonlocal filter-based fusion model
    normalized difference vegetation index (STNLFFM NDVI) and the contemporaneous
    Sentinel-2A NDVI 3.2 NDVI growing curves The NDVI was processed using a Savitzky–Golay
    filter (S–G filter) (Savitzky & Golay, 1964) to reduce the effects of clouds,
    rain, and atmosphere to obtain NDVI curves for different growing periods and analyze
    them in comparison with the actual sowing and harvesting periods (Figure 4). The
    NDVI curves exhibited a sharp decrease due to the influence of clouds, atmosphere,
    and data quality. However, the NDVI curves were found to be clearer after the
    S–G filtering process. Generally, the overall trends of NDVI curves remained constant
    based on different data sources, although large differences in spatial resolution
    led to more obvious differences in response to vegetation change information.
    The sowing period indicated by MODIS NDVI curves had a significant delay compared
    with the actual sowing period, whereas the time-series STNLFFM NDVI was more consistent
    with the actual tillage period. The MODIS NDVI curves of the sample points did
    not change significantly prior to the actual sowing period, but showed an apparent
    decreasing trend similar to the actual winter wheat–summer maize rotation pattern
    of the sample points. The temporal NDVI at different points all contained small
    and large waves, with the small wave occurring around Day of Year (DOY) 217, or
    the summer maize tasseling stage, which was between the mass trumpeting and flowering
    stages. The large wave occurred around DOY 240, or during the silking-filling
    stage. The sample point in Linyi County also showed a small wave that peaked from
    the trefoil stage to the jointing stage, or approximately on DOY 184. As the fusion
    of the time-series NDVI reflects the long-term trend of NDVI and the local abrupt
    change information, the results were found to be consistent with the growth characteristics
    of summer maize and therefore meeting the requirements for identifying crop-planting
    patterns. FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer Comparison of spatial and temporal nonlocal
    filter-based fusion model (STNLFFM) and MODIS growing curves of summer maize sample
    points after Savitzky–Golay (S–G) filtering 3.3 NPP modeling results and yield
    estimation The spatial distribution of NPP and yield of summer maize in 2020 was
    calculated using the CASA and light use efficiency model (Figures 5 and 6). Results
    showed that the distribution of NPP in the summer maize was influenced by the
    topography wherein the alluvial plains of the Sushui River in the northwestern
    part of Yuncheng Basin had high values of NPP (700–900 gC m−2). Meanwhile, the
    southwestern mountains with the largest spatial distribution, accounting for total
    of 76.11% of summer maize, had lower NPP values (500–700 gC m−2) than the alluvial
    plains. Areas with NPP accumulation values of <500 gC m−2 constituted a small
    distribution throughout the study area but were instead largely distributed in
    the northeastern mountainous and northern plateau areas; these areas accounted
    for 11.36% of the total planting area. The spatial distribution of the recorded
    yield was consistent with the distribution of NPP values. Most of the maize yield
    per unit area fell between 7,000 and 8,000 kg ha−1, accounting for 59.76%. Meanwhile,
    those >8,000 kg ha−1 occurred in patches of areas throughout the region, or approximately
    10.07%. Statistical analysis showed that the yield of summer maize per unit area
    in the entire Yuncheng Basin area was approximately 7,131.12 kg ha−1. FIGURE 5

    FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer The summer maize yield in 2020 In the accuracy
    verification, the average value of the image where the sample point was located
    and the eight neighboring images were selected as the predicted yield value of
    the sample point, which were combined and analyzed against the MODIS and fusion
    predicted yields (Table 1). Based on MODIS NDVI, the results showed that the correlation
    coefficient between the predicted and actual yield was r = .336(P > .05), and
    the absolute error ranged from 553.84 to 1,778.95 kg ha−1, with a mean absolute
    percentage error (MAPE) of 15.65%. The predicted yield based on STNLFFM NDVI correlated
    with the actual yield, r = .922(0.01 < P < .05), and the absolute error of the
    two data sets ranged from approximately 4.64 to 1,261.47 kg ha−1, and the relative
    error (RE) values ranged from −13.74 to 0.12%, with a MAPE of 5.47%, indicating
    that STNLFFM NDVI predicted yield with high accuracy. The RE between the predicted
    and actual yields of STNLFFM NDVI at each sample site was small; the only areas
    where the RE exceeded 10% were in the Yanhu District and Linyi County, while in
    Jiang County and Xia County, the RE was 0.07 and 0.12%, respectively. Therefore,
    combining Sentinel-2A with MODIS can improve the accuracy of estimating the yield
    per unit area of summer maize. TABLE 1. Comparison of actual and predicted yield

    remote sensing data spatio-temporal fusion technique can better retain the temporal
    variation information of MODIS and closely reflect the spatial details of Sentinel-2A
    data (Pi et al., 2021). The main step of the STNLFFM is to first construct the
    transformation relationship between high and low resolution data, filter similar
    image elements, and then calculate the weight function using the correlation relationship
    between images for the target image elements (Cheng et al., 2017; Shen et al.,
    2019). Since the cloud volume of Sentinel-2A images on 5 April and 15 May is large
    compared with the cloud volume of images at the rest of the time periods, it is
    affected by cloud coverage during the fusion process, resulting in a decrease
    in fusion accuracy (Knauer et al., 2016; X. Li et al., 2019; Tarigan & Isa, 2021),
    making the predicted results on 24 June with poor correlation with the corresponding
    time Sentinel-2A. Meanwhile, the fusion accuracy is correlated with the temporal
    phase difference within the prediction time period (Lei et al., 2021), and the
    prediction accuracy degrades if there is a sudden change in the feature within
    a certain time period. The maturity of summer maize is 2 September, 15 May corresponds
    to the completion of winter wheat, 24 June corresponds to the emergence of summer
    maize, and the NDVI inversion from the completion of winter wheat to the maturity
    of summer maize is too large. For regions with frequent vegetation changes, high
    heterogeneity, and complex surfaces, the images often contain many mixed image
    elements (Meng et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2020), which in turn leads to a decrease
    in data fusion accuracy (M. Liu, Liu, et al., 2020), making the predicted results
    of 2 September poorly correlated with Sentinel-2A at the corresponding time. From
    summer maize harvest to winter wheat sowing, before NDVI values were smaller,
    spectral abruptness of different features was reduced, differences were smaller,
    and fusion prediction accuracy was better (M. Wu et al., 2016), as shown by the
    better correlation between STNLFFM NDVI and Sentinel-2A NDVI. Sentinel-2A is highly
    affected by cloudy and rainy weather in summer (Pahlevan et al., 2017), resulting
    in unusable Sentinel-2A imagery for July and August, causing a decrease in data
    fusion accuracy. Therefore, the inclusion of Sentinel-2B in future studies will
    reduce the revisit cycles (Baillarin et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2021) and improve
    the temporal resolution of Sentinel-2 to reduce the effect of cloud rain on data
    fusion accuracy. However, the low spatial resolution of MODIS leads to a large
    number of mixed pixels within the data (Leckie, 1990), which makes it difficult
    to clearly express the spatial texture detail information among different features
    (Bei et al., 2020; X. Zhu et al., 2016); hence, this results in a delay in NDVI
    growing curves. Consequently, the combined image can better retain spatial detail
    information as the STNLFFM NDVI (Lu et al., 2016) growing curve was consistent
    with the actual growing condition of summer maize. The trefoil stage marks the
    shift from autotrophic to heterotrophic life of maize (Ran et al., 2018). From
    this stage to the jointing stage, seedling growth, particularly the root and leaf
    growth and stem node differentiation, was slow because of the underdeveloped root
    system and leaves of the plant that absorb and produce nutrients in limited amounts
    (Chen et al., 2021). On DOY 184 (July 2020), the Yuncheng Basin had been affected
    by seasonal activities as precipitation increased. During the maize seedling stage,
    the effects of flooding were more significant than the effects of drought as heavy
    floods resulted in crop destruction and death (Chen et al., 2021), especially
    when water flows from the River Sushui through Linyi County. This is exacerbated
    by the poor soil permeability of the meadow and brown soil types in the watershed
    (M. Li & Guo, 2018) that were neither flood tolerant nor drought resistant (Chen
    et al., 2019). Excessive rainfall can lead to a decrease in NDVI. The male spike
    entered the tetrad period during the extraction stage wherein the length of the
    upper spikelet in the middle of the main axis reached approximately 0.8 cm. A
    small wave peak appeared around DOY 217 as the rod trilobes were thrown open in
    a trumpet shape (Zhen et al., 2019). In mid-September when all the maize leaves
    had opened and the plants had standard height, the NDVI had peaked. However, a
    decline in the growth of stems and leaves had followed (Guo et al., 2022). The
    alluvial plain of the Sushui River in the northwestern part of the Yuncheng Basin
    is characterized by flat terrain, fertile land, adequate irrigation, and the occurrence
    of significant human activities. These features have greater effects on crop growth
    (L. Song et al., 2021), as they facilitate the growth and development of food
    crops with high NPP accumulations, reaching 900 gC m−2 and summer maize yields
    of 8,000 kg ha−1. The high degree of topographic fragmentation in the northeastern
    mountainous and northern plateau areas makes erosion more likely, as it prevents
    NPP accumulation. This resulted in summer maize yields below 5,000 kg ha−1 in
    some areas. MODIS data are susceptible to the influence of clouds, atmosphere,
    and noise, creating many mixed pixels in the images (Z. Wang, Guo, et al., 2019),
    resulting in low yield prediction accuracy of MODIS NDVI. The fused images based
    on STNLFFM can clearly express the spatial texture information of the ground,
    rendering its yield estimation accuracy high compared with that of MODIS NDVI
    estimation. Related studies have shown that when water is insufficient, yield
    increases with water consumption because maize water consumption and yield are
    linearly related (Sui et al., 2018). When water consumption exceeds a certain
    value, the trend in yield becomes parabolic and results to a negative correlation
    (M. Zhang, Lin, et al., 2019). A moderate water deficit during a specific period
    does not necessarily reduce yield, but rather increases it along with the water-use
    efficiency (W. Yang, Bian, et al., 2021). The Yuncheng Basin is rainy in the summer
    months (June–August), whereas the Sushui River Basin is more water abundant during
    the maize-growing period as it flows through the entire area. Therefore, for those
    with less irrigation (0 and 60 mm of irrigation), such as in the sample points
    of Yanhu District and Linyi County, crop growth and yield were improved. In contrast
    to the sample points of Yongji City, and Jiang and Xia Counties, where there were
    better irrigation conditions (irrigation >150 mm), the yield was smaller than
    that of the Salt Lake District and Linyi County, and hence, may have had a suppression
    effect. In the summer, Sentinel-2A was affected by clouds and rain (Pahlevan et
    al., 2017), which caused excessive inversion of NDVI from the seedling to the
    small trumpet stage in the Yanhu District and Linyi County, which in turn reduced
    the maize yield estimation accuracy at the sample sites in the Yanhu District
    and Linyi County with a RE >10%. The significance of the correlation between the
    predicted and measured STNLFFM NDVI yields did not pass the 0.01 test as there
    were only five national arable land quality monitoring sample sites in the Yuncheng
    Basin. Therefore, in future studies, additional summer maize monitoring sample
    sites should be established to reduce the uncertainty of yield estimation models
    according to the characteristics of summer maize growth conditions, soil properties,
    meteorological information, and regional spatial heterogeneity. 5 CONCLUSIONS
    Using the spatio-temporal fusion technique of multi-source remote sensing data,
    NDVI with a 1 d temporal resolution and 10-m spatial resolution was used to combine
    the CASA and light-use efficiency yield estimation models for crop yield prediction
    at a large scale, providing a new idea and technical means for large-scale crop
    yield estimation. The STNLFFM spatio-temporal fusion algorithm was used to obtain
    10-m spatial resolution NDVI time series data, which could better retain the temporal
    variation information of MODIS and reflect the spatial detail information of Sentinel-2A.
    Compared with the MODIS NDVI growth curve, the STNLFFM NDVI growth curve could
    more accurately reflect the NDVI variation trend and local abrupt change information
    during the summer maize-planting period, and was consistent with the actual growth
    characteristics. The cumulative NPP of summer maize was obtained using CASA, and
    the cumulative NPP values were concentrated between 500 and 700 gC m−2 over a
    large area of the region, which caused the cumulative NPP values to be <500 gC
    m−2 in some areas of the northeastern mountainous and northern plateau areas,
    and the summer maize yields were lower than 5,000 kg ha−1. In the Northwest Sushui
    River alluvial plain with sufficient irrigation conditions and fertile land, its
    cumulative NPP reached 900 gC m−2 and summer maize yields reached 8,000 kg ha−1.
    The accuracy of the yield estimation model constructed based on STNLFFM NDVI (MAPE
    = 5.47%, −13.74% ≤ RE ≤ 0.12%) was significantly higher than that of the yield
    estimation model based on MODIS NDVI data (MAPE = 15.65%, −19.67% ≤ RE ≤ 20.88%).
    Owing to the difficulty of obtaining Sentinel-2A by cloudy and rainy weather in
    summer, the STNLFFM fusion accuracy was reduced, which in turn led to a decrease
    in the accuracy of maize yield estimation at the sample sites in the Yanhu District
    and Linyi County, with RE exceeding 10%. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS Jingshu Wang: Conceptualization;

  description: 'A six-span center pivot irrigation system was used as a platform for
    testing two wireless sensor networks (WSN) of infrared thermometers. The cropped
    field was a semi-circle, divided into six pie-slice sections of which three were
    irrigated manually and three were irrigated automatically based on the time temperature
    threshold method. One network was mounted on masts fixed to the pivot arm (Pivot-WSN)
    and was programmed with mesh networking firmware. The second wireless network
    was comprised of sensors programmed with non-mesh firmware and was deployed in
    the field (Field-WSN). Our objectives were to: (1) compare the performance of
    a mesh and non-mesh networking systems of wireless sensors on a center pivot platform;
    (2) investigate the relationships between crop canopy, sensor body, and air temperatures;
    and (3) investigate automatic irrigation scheduling using data from wireless sensor
    networks. The Field-WSN outperformed the Pivot-WSN; data packet retrieval was
    more than 90% successful for 93% of the growing season using the non-mesh networking
    firmware for the WSN established in the field. The Pivot-WSN performed only 70%
    of the time at this same level of success. Temperature differences between the
    body temperature of the infrared thermometer and crop canopy varied as much as-5.1
    and 7.6°C. Transmission loss and incorrect calibrations of the wireless sensor
    modules affected irrigation scheduling throughout the season. However, post-experiment
    improvements-software upgrades and memory expansion of the RF module (by the manufacturer),
    changes to the calibration protocol, and an algorithm to interpolate the values
    of non-captured data are expected to improve the overall performance of the wireless
    network systems and automatic irrigation scheduling for the upcoming growing season.'

  description: Owing to the lack of hydrological monitoring stations and groundwater
    observations, particularly for natural habitats, the distribution of groundwater
    along the Mountainous (alluvial fan)-Oasis-Desert System (MODS) in the middle
    reaches of the Tarim River has not yet been systematically investigated. The performance
    of ensemble algorithms with multi-source/multi-scale (30 m, 90 m, 250 m, 500 m,
    and 1000 m) remote sensing data to predict the groundwater levels of the MODS
    of the Tarim Basin should be investigated. To improve the current knowledge on
    the spatial distribution of groundwater in this region, we conducted a study on
    the applicability of ensemble learning algorithms for groundwater assessments
    in typical regions of dryland, namely the Oasis-Taklimakan Desert (OTD), Nature
    land in Oasis system (NLOS), Irrigation area (IA), and Oasis system (OS). The
    results showed that the R2 values of the groundwater level prediction accuracy
    for the four ecosystems were 0.92, 0.96, 0.86, and 0.50, respectively, and their
    corresponding optimal ensemble algorithms were AR_GRBFN, AR_RF, RotationForest_MLP,
    and AR_ GRBFN. The scales corresponding to the optimal prediction accuracy of
    OTD, NLOS, IA, and OS were 250 m, 30 m, 250 m, and 90 m, respectively, and the
    effect of the scale on their respective groundwater level prediction accuracies
    (maximum value compared to minimum value) were 11.48%, 21.63%, 26.73%, and 10.59%.
    Random Subspace, Rotation Forest, and Additive Regression improved the prediction
    accuracy of the base learning method by 76%, 72%, and 64%, respectively, followed
    by Bagging, whereas Dagging greatly increased prediction errors. Rotation Forest
    and Random Subspace showed stable performances and guaranteed relatively low prediction
    errors. Among all ensemble algorithms, Additive Regression helped the base learners
    obtain relatively optimal prediction accuracies with high probabilities. Except
    for the OS system, groundwater level could be predicted with much greater accuracy
    at depths of >8 m than at <8 m. The contribution analysis showed that topography
    and land-use patterns controlled the spatial distribution of groundwater across
    MODS. The ensemble learning algorithm showed good performance using multi-source
    and multi-scale data.

  explanation: 'In this study, the authors used ensemble machine learning to predict
    groundwater levels in four different ecosystems: the Oasis-Taklimakan desert (OTD),
    Nature land in Oasis system (NLOS), Irrigation area (IA), and Oasis system (OS)
    in the Tarim Basin of China.


    They used five different base learners (M5, Random Forest (RF), Gaussian radial
    basis function networks (GRBFN), Multilayer Perceptron Neural network (MLP)) and
    five different ensemble algorithms (Additive regression (AR), Bagging, Dagging,
    Random Subspace, and Rotation Forest) to create 25 different models for each ecosystem.
    They also used five different spatial resolutions (30, 90, 250, 500, and 1000
    m) for each model.


    The best model for each ecosystem was selected based on the root mean square error
    (RMSE) and R2 values. The best model for OTD was AR_GRBFN (250 m), with an RMSE
    of 6.09 m and R2 of 0.92. The best model for NLOS was RotationForest_MLP (30 m),
    with an RMSE of 5.66 m and R2 of 0.96. The best model for IA was AR_GRBFN (250
    m), with an RMSE of 3.78 m and R2 of 0.86. The best model for OS was AR_RF (90
    m), with an RMSE of 3.49 m and R2 of 0.50.


    The authors found that the optimal scale for groundwater level prediction varied
    depending on the ecosystem. The optimal scale for OTD was 250 m, for NLOS was
    30 m, for IA was 250 m, and for OS was 90 m.


    They also found that the ensemble algorithms generally improved the prediction
    accuracy of the base learners. Random Subspace, Rotation Forest, and Additive
    Regression improved the prediction accuracy of the base learners by 76%, 72%,

    effectRemote sensing 1. Introduction Groundwater, which comprises nearly one-third
    of the world''s freshwater supply, is an essential part of the distribution of
    water resources and the largest freshwater reservoir in the world, especially
    in arid areas (Wang et al., 2021b, Yang et al., 2019). Groundwater reduces the
    gap between water supply and demand owing to its widespread distribution and ease
    of exploitation. However, the disparity between the availability and demand of
    water resources has worsened due to rapid economic growth, population growth,
    and agricultural land expansion. Groundwater is an important water source for
    residential use and farming, as well as for natural dryland ecosystems, such as
    the Tarim River Basin in Central Asia (Li et al., 2007, Zuo et al., 2021). Substantial
    hydrological and ecological issues have become apparent in the middle and lower
    reaches of the Tarim River Basin due to anthropogenic impacts and climate change,
    including precipitous groundwater level decline (Bai et al., 2020), natural vegetation
    degradation (especially riparian ecosystems), soil salinisation and desertification,
    and river drying (Wei et al., 2020). Bai et al. (2020) proposed that increased
    water usage and evaporation in the upstream regions are responsible for the declining
    groundwater level in the Tarim Basin. Chen et al. (2019) suggested that groundwater
    depletion at the current rate would not sustain the normal function of the existing
    ecosystem. In response, the Chinese government initiated the Ecological Water
    Diversion Project (EWDP) in 2000, spending 10.7 billion CNY to restore the lower
    Tarim River''s ecological environment. Several research projects have been conducted
    to explore the intricate connection between the EWDP and ecohydrological processes.
    These studies have primarily focused on the characteristics of changes in groundwater
    depth and quality in the lower Tarim River recharge zone, ecological responses,
    such as plant community structure and diversity, minimal ecological water requirements
    of natural vegetation, and appropriate groundwater levels for vegetation (Bao
    et al., 2017, Huang and Pang, 2010, Li et al., 2007, Liu et al., 2022). According
    to the findings of previous studies, land use, temperature, and precipitation
    in Tarim River Basin have changed significantly over the past few decades (Liu
    et al., 2014, Yao et al., 2019, Yao et al., 2018). Thus, the spatial distribution
    of groundwater level in the middle reaches of the Tarim River would also change.
    However, owing to the lack of hydrological monitoring stations and groundwater
    observations, particularly for natural habitats, a systematic understanding of
    the distribution of groundwater along the Mountainous (alluvial fan)-Oasis-Desert
    System (MODS) in the middle reaches of the Tarim River has not yet been achieved
    (Chen et al., 2019). This is detrimental to the proper scheduling and use of groundwater.
    The advent of ensemble machine learning and multi-source/multi-scale remote sensing
    data may provide the opportunity to reproduce the spatial distribution of groundwater.
    In recent years, data-driven models related to machine learning and multi-source/multi-scale
    remote sensing for groundwater prediction have been increasingly used due to their
    inexpensiveness and ability to rapidly produce reliable findings in various complicated
    groundwater systems (Sahoo et al., 2017, Zounemat-Kermani et al., 2021). Boreholes
    and geophysical, geological, hydrogeological, and methodological approaches are
    standard traditional groundwater research techniques; however, they are typically
    expensive, time-consuming, and unprofitable. Groundwater mapping has benefited
    from applying Geographic Information System (GIS), remote sensing, and machine-learning
    approaches (Panahi et al., 2020). Groundwater grade zoning and water resource
    management are two applications in which the use of GIS is efficient for processing
    vast volumes of spatial data. Thus, remote sensing has emerged as an alternative
    method for acquiring surface water, soil, biological, and gas characteristics
    (Konduri et al., 2020). Ensemble techniques have received considerable attention
    owing to their proficiency in managing complex and high-dimensional data (Zounemat-Kermani
    et al., 2021). According to recent findings, ensemble machine-learning approaches
    better decreased simulation errors than individual machine-learning techniques
    (Shin et al., 2017, Sun et al., 2020). Since the 1990s, ensemble techniques have
    emerged as a research hotspot in statistics, data mining, machine learning, and
    pattern recognition. Many researchers have used these methods to solve various
    classification and regression issues. Singh et al. (2014) modelled the hydrochemistry
    of groundwater in northern India based on bagging and boosting. The findings demonstrated
    that ensemble models had higher accuracy than single decision tree models and
    were more successful in describing the impacts of human activity and seasonal
    fluctuations on groundwater hydrochemistry. Avand et al. (2020) examined ensemble
    learning such as multiboosting, best-first tree, bagging, and AdaBoost to discover
    potential groundwater zones, with best-first tree providing the best prediction
    accuracy. Chen et al. (2020) proposed several ensemble learning methodologies
    to map groundwater spring inventories in Wuqi County, Shaanxi Province, China.
    All ensemble learning methods showed superior prediction accuracy compared to
    the base classifier, with Rotation Forest having the highest output accuracy.
    To estimate groundwater potential mapping in the Vietnamese province of Dak Lak,
    Nguyen et al. (2020) developed five ensemble learning approaches, including bagging,
    dagging, decorating, multiboosting, and random subspace. The outcomes demonstrated
    that the prediction accuracy of the ensemble learning method was significantly
    increased compared with that of the base learner. Groundwater contamination, potential
    mapping, groundwater table, and groundwater balancing are the primary focus of
    the present study. Groundwater prediction mainly involves forecasting groundwater
    levels in a limited scale or in coastal zones, or the numerical modelling of longer
    time series of individual observation locations. Additive Regression (Friedman,
    2002), Bagging (Breiman, 1996), Dagging (Ting and Witten, 1997), Random Subspace
    (Tin Kam, 1998), and Rotation Forest are the ensemble approaches which have become
    the most popular in recent years (Rodriguez et al., 2006). The performance of
    these ensemble algorithms have not been examined to predict the groundwater levels
    of the Tarim Basin MODS. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to: 1) quantify
    the impact of four basic learners and five ensemble algorithms on the groundwater
    prediction accuracy in four ecosystems: Oasis–Taklimakan desert (OTD), Nature
    land in Oasis system (NLOS), Oasis system (OS), and Irrigation area (IA); 2) evaluate
    the effects of multi-scale remote sensing, using five spatial resolutions, and
    topographic variables on predicting groundwater level errors; and 3) map the spatial
    distribution of groundwater levels using optimal models for the four ecosystems.
    2. Study area The study area is located in the Tarim Basin in southern Xinjiang.
    The elevation decreases from north to south and west to east (Fig. 1), with a
    range between 900 and 1300 m. Quaternary sediments of various hydrogeological
    units cover the study area, including fine sandstones, pebble sandstones, chalky
    fine sandstones, fine siltstones, sand gravels, and sandstones. Runoff is caused
    by glaciers, snowmelt, and precipitation from the surrounding mountains in the
    Tarim Basin. The Weigan and Kuche rivers in Kuqa, Muzal and Kizil rivers in Baicheng
    County, Kizil River in Luntai County, and Tarim River in southern Kuqa are the
    principal rivers in the research region. The annual surface runoff to the oasis
    is 31.2 × 108 m3, and >90% of the river water is channelled for agriculture (Wang
    et al., 2021b), which has caused natural rivers to dry up in recent decades. A
    moderate continental desert climate dominates southern Xinjiang. The mean annual
    precipitation ranges between 17.4 and 42.0 mm, while pan-evaporation ranges between
    2500 and 3000 mm. The mean annual temperature ranges between 5.1 °C and 6.1 °C,
    and the accumulated temperature over ten °C ranges from 4100 °C to 4300 °C per
    year under extreme circumstances. Cotton, wheat, corn, and several other varieties
    of economic crops are the principal crops grown in oasis irrigation areas. In
    contrast, the natural environment comprises drought/salt-tolerant trees, shrubs,
    and grasses, with the most common species being tamarisk, poplar, reed, early
    sedge, and camel thorns. Groundwater from oasis areas is critical to the natural
    desert ecosystems and agricultural economic development. The area is also densely
    populated with oil fields and has a well-developed road network with diverse landscape
    types. Download : Download high-res image (607KB) Download : Download full-size

    observation sites (depth) in the study area. The Tarim River Basin''s hydrological
    characteristics in northwest China''s interior desert region have changed significantly
    due to human activity and climate change (Chen et al., 2015, Yang et al., 2022).
    With the expansion of oasis areas in arid regions over the past 30 years, the
    centre of gravity for new arable land has gradually shifted from northeast to
    northwest in China, especially in the Tarim Basin (Liu et al., 2014), creating
    a water use conflict between ecology and agriculture (Wang et al., 2021b). The
    Tarim River Basin in southern Xinjiang is the largest inland river basin in China
    and is a socially and economically important region for ethnic minorities. During
    the past 60 years, snowmelt runoff from three source rivers (Aksu, Hotan, and
    Yarkant) of the Tarim River Basin has increased. However, net runoff from the
    main streams has been declining (Zhou et al., 2018). The analysis showed that
    the total evapotranspiration of major crops in Xinjiang increased by 47.85%, causing
    a trend of decreasing ecological water supply to desert vegetation (Lv et al.,
    2017). Surface soil moisture (0–50 cm) in the oasis region of the Tarim Basin
    has also significantly decreased during the past three decades because of higher
    evapotranspiration caused by global warming (Yao et al., 2018). Climate change
    and human activities have already caused dramatic changes in the hydrological
    environment. Changes in the groundwater levels in recent decades due to the hydrological
    characteristics of the study area are of great concerns to stakeholders, as groundwater
    is an essential source of irrigation in dryland oases (Li et al., 2007, Wang et
    al., 2021b, Zuo et al., 2021). 3. Materials and methods 3.1. Observations of groundwater
    level Groundwater data obtained from the Tarim Oilfield Construction Project,
    which has a capacity of 30 million tons, were used for the preliminary environmental
    assessment of the groundwater prior to project development and collected from
    the Baicheng, Kuqa, and Luntai oases, Taklamakan Desert, and the desert-oasis
    ecotone between the oases. These data were derived from two types of surveys (Fig.
    2): Existing Observation Wells (EOW) and Drilling Boreholes (DB). The sampling
    sites were near the oil and gas fields and groundwater observation wells, specifically
    the Kuqa Oasis (EOW), Baicheng Oasis (EOW), Donghetang (DB), Halahatang (DB),
    Keshen (DB), Lungu (DB), Qianshan in Yingmaili (EOW), Dina (EOW), clastic rocks
    in the western part of Tabei (EOW), and Tazhong (DB). A total of 436 groundwater
    level readings were obtained throughout April to June 2018. To the best of our
    knowledge, these observations were applied to regional-scale groundwater prediction
    research for the typical MODS of the Tarim Basin in Central Asia or the first
    time. Download : Download high-res image (216KB) Download : Download full-size

    Earth Engine (GEE) and other publicly available datasets were used to collect
    variables for the experiment. All variables are shown in Table 1. Geographic information
    system (GIS) data include land use and landform categories. Remote sensing and
    DEM-derived variables include surface reflectance, vegetation biomass parameters
    such as normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation
    index (EVI), surface temperature, and topographic indicators. The bioclimatic
    variables from WorldClim (https://www.worldclim.org/data/index.html) include temperature
    and precipitation data. The soil properties database was derived from SoilGrid.
    All variables were normalized prior to modelling. Table 1. Environmental variables

    Earth Engine (GEE) Digital elevation model data was obtained from GEE. The dataset,
    NASA DEM (30 m), was created by reprocessing SRTM data and adding supplementary
    information from the ASTER GDEM, ICESat/GLAS, and PRISM datasets to increase accuracy.
    The System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) GIS platform was then used
    to calculate several morphometry- and hydrology-related topographic indices, namely
    topographic position index (TPI), multiresolution index of valley bottom flatness
    (MRVBF), (MRRTF), terrain ruggedness index (TRI), topographic wetness index (TWI),
    slope, and aspect. These variables were then resampled into five spatial resolutions:
    30, 90, 250, 500, and 1000 m. In the arid zone, the change of land use and the
    fluctuation of groundwater level are closely correlated and are eagerly noticed
    (Scanlon et al., 2005). Therefore, a global 30-m surface land use/cover product
    (Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring, FROM) made by Tsinghua University
    and published in 2017 (Gong et al., 2019) was selected and downloaded from https://data.ess.tsinghua.edu.cn/.
    This product provides seven land-use categories: Irrigation field, Shrub, Grass,
    Lake, Salt-affected soil, Rock and gravel, Wetland, Bare land, Gobi, City, and
    Desert. Chai et al. (2009) provided a technique for the geomorphologic surface
    regionalisation of Xinjiang using SRTM-DEM (90 m) and Landsat TM (30 m) data.
    This dataset (30 m resolution) was downloaded from the National Earth System Science
    Data Center (2009). The final product divided the Xinjiang topography into six
    geomorphic zones, 23 geomorphic subzones, and 195 geomorphic plots. The study
    used the GEE platform to calculate surface reflectance and the vegetation variables
    that reflected surface hydrology based on long time series data from Landsat 8
    OLI. The variables involved in b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, and b7. TCW, TCG, and TCB represent
    wetness, greenness, and brightness, respectively, derived from the tasselled cap
    transformation, EVI, NDVI, and generalised difference vegetation index (GDVI).
    The time period covered by these variables was the entire growing season (April
    to September) in 2018. Each index involved in the calculation included the minimum
    (5%), maximum (95%), and mean values from five spatial resolutions: 30, 90, 250,
    500, and 1000 m. Several surface temperature time-series characteristic parameters
    were computed based on the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)
    surface temperature (day and night) dataset from the GEE platform. They were employed
    to describe the feedback of various surface changes for hydrothermal feature.
    The parameters included the annual mean surface temperatures during the day (LST_Day)
    and night (LST_Night), the average day surface temperature in March subtracted
    from the surface temperature in April (DLST3_4), DLST4_5, DLST5_6, DLST7_8, DLST8_9,
    and the average night surface temperature in March subtracted from the surface
    temperature in April (LST3_4), LST4_5, LST5_6, LST7_8, and LST8_9. Instead of
    using the mean annual temperature and rainfall as climate proxies, bioclimatic
    variables that had greater environmental relevance were used to characterize hydrological
    changes. Nineteen bioclimatic variables from WorldClim (Bio1, Bio2, Bio3, …, Bio19)
    (Hijmans et al., 2005) were also used as potential predictors and were calculated
    using monthly temperature and rainfall data from 1970 to 2000. These yearly trends,
    such as mean annual temperature and precipitation, and extreme or limiting environmental
    circumstances are represented by biologically significant variables, such as temperature
    during the coldest and hottest months and precipitation during the rainy and dry
    seasons. Please visit https://www.worldclim for further detail. SoilGrid provided
    eight soil products with global coverage: organic carbon, soil bulk density, cation
    exchange, pH, sand content, clay content, and available water content. Each product
    contained seven standard depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100, and 200 cm) (Hengl et
    al., 2017) with a spatial resolution of 250 m. The value of a specific product
    participating in the modelling was calculated by averaging seven depths at that
    location. 3.3. Methods 3.3.1. Base learner The most common base learners in studies
    on ensemble learning in hydrology-related domains are tree model structures (42%),
    followed by artificial neural networks (30%), according to Zounemat-Kermani et
    al. (2021). Therefore, we employed two algorithms for tree model structures, M5and
    random forest (RF), and two techniques for neural network types, Gaussian radial
    basis function networks (GRBFN) and Multilayer Perceptron Neural network (MLP).
    M5 Depending on the input data, the M5 tree regression technique can be used to
    develop useful regression models (Quinlan, 1992). It can predict the nonlinear
    characteristics of data more accurately than conventional linear regression (Holmes
    et al., 1999). This white-box method makes it easier to describe the contribution
    of variables to the research outcomes compared with black-box algorithms such
    as neural nets. The crucial parameter of this algorithm, minNumInstances, was
    set to 4 (Witten et al., 1999). RF RF is a powerful and versatile supervised machine-learning
    algorithm that grows and combines multiple decision trees to create a “forest”
    (Breiman, 2001). It can solve both classification and regression issues. The forest
    chooses the mean of all tree outputs when performing regression. Its main practical
    advantage is that it automatically corrects decision trees'' propensity to overfit
    their training set. The problem of overfitting is almost eliminated when using
    the bagging approach with random feature selection, which is excellent because
    overfitting results in erroneous results. Furthermore, RFs often retain accuracy,
    even without certain data. maxDepth = unlimited, numFeatures sets the number of
    randomly chosen attributes when int(log_2(#predictors) + 1) is used. For this
    study, we set numIterations = 100. GRBFN GRBFNs are an effective method for learning
    detailed input–output mappings. A GRBFN is typically described as a monotonic
    function of the Euclidean distance between every point in space and a specific
    centroid (Frank, 2014). This is a scalar function that is symmetric along the
    radial direction. Its function assumes a small value when a point in space is
    far from the centre. Complex functions can be fitted by modifying the local function
    value and range of action. The most popular GRBFN, which has numerous applications
    in computer vision, artificial intelligence, image compression, and data fitting,
    is the one we employed in this research. The main parameters were set by default;
    the scale optimisation option was set to use scale per unit and attribute, rige
    = 0.01, seed = one, tolerance = 1.0 E–6 (Frank, 2014). MLP An MLP is a feed-forward
    neural-network augmentation (Hornik et al., 1989) that comprises three layers:
    input, output, and hidden. The input layer receives the input signal to be processed.
    Prediction and categorisation are examples of operations that fall under the purview
    of an output layer. An arbitrary number of hidden layers between the input and
    output constitute the MLP''s true computational engine. Like a feed-forward network,
    the data moves forward from the input to the output layer of an MLP. The MLP neurones
    were trained using the back-propagation learning method. MLP is used to address
    problems that cannot be resolved linearly and approximate any continuous function.
    The main parameters were set by default as follows: hiddenlayers=(attribs) / 2,
    learning rate = 0.3, and momentum = 0.2 (Taud and Mas, 2018). 3.3.2. Ensemble
    algorithm 3.3.2.1. Additive regression Gradient boosting constructs additive regression
    models, which is accomplished by sequentially fitting a simple parameterised function
    (base learner) to current “pseudo” residuals using least squares at each iteration.
    The pseudo-residuals are the gradient of the loss function that is minimised for
    the model values at each training data point evaluated at the current step. Adding
    randomness to the process can significantly increase the approximation accuracy
    and execution speed of gradient boosting. A subsample of the training data is
    randomly selected (without replacement) from the entire training dataset at each
    cycle. The base learner is then fitted to this randomly chosen subsample, and
    the model update for the current iteration is computed instead of using the entire
    sample. This randomised approach also increases robustness against the overcapacity
    of the base learner (Friedman, 2002). The main parameters were set by default,
    the number of iterations = 100 and shrinkage = 1.0. 3.3.2.2. Bagging Bagging predictors
    are methods that generate multiple versions of a predictor and use them to obtain
    an aggregated predictor. When forecasting a numerical outcome, aggregation averages
    all variants, and when predicting a class, it performs a plurality vote. Many
    versions are generated by creating bootstrap copies of the learning set and using
    these as new learning sets. Bagging can result in significant improvements in
    accuracy according to tests on actual and simulated datasets utilising classification
    and regression trees, as well as subset selection in linear regression. Bagging
    can increase accuracy if perturbing the learning set can result in significant
    changes in the built predictor (Breiman, 1996). The main parameters were set by
    default as follows: numExecutionSlot = 1, numIterations = 100. 3.3.2.3. Dagging
    Ting and Witten (1997) examined the technique of stacked generalisation in mixing
    models produced by a single learning algorithm from several subsets of a training
    dataset and other methods. The influence of the sampling regime used to produce
    training subsets has already been investigated in this context. When bootstrap
    samples are used, the approach is termed Bagging, and Dagging for disjunct samples.
    The simplest way to integrate predictions from competing models is through the
    majority vote. In this study, we expanded these investigations to stacked generalisation,
    combining the models using a learning technique. This results in two new techniques,
    known as bag-stacking and dag-stacking. 3.3.2.4. Random subspace Splitting criteria
    and tree-size optimisation have received considerable attention when discussing
    decision trees (Ho, 1998). The dilemma between overfitting and achieving maximum
    accuracy has seldom been resolved. A proposed method to construct a decision-tree-based
    classifier that maintains the highest accuracy on training data and improves the
    generalisation accuracy as it grows in complexity. The classifier is composed
    of many trees that were built systematically by pseudo-randomly choosing subsets
    of the feature vector component or trees built in randomly selected subspaces.
    Experiments on publicly accessible datasets were used to compare the subspace
    approach against single-tree classifiers and other forest construction techniques,
    proving the method''s superiority. The main parameters were set by default as
    follows: numExecutionSlots = 1, numIterations = 100, seed = 1, and subSpaceSize
    = 0.5. 3.3.2.5. Rotation forest Rodriguez et al. (2006) presented a feature-extraction-based
    strategy for constructing classifier ensembles. The feature set was randomly divided
    into K subsets (K is an algorithm parameter), and principal component analysis
    was performed on each subset to generate training data for a base classifier.
    All primary components were kept to maintain the variability information in the
    data. Consequently, K-axis rotations occur to produce additional features for
    a base classifier. The rotation strategy was intended to promote individual accuracy
    and variety within the ensemble. Feature extraction for each base classifier promotes
    diversity. Decision trees were chosen because they are sensitive to the rotation
    of the feature axes, hence the name “forest.” The main parameters were set by
    default as follows: maxGroup = 3, minGroup = 3, numberOfGroups = 1, numIterations
    = 100, removedPercentage = 50, and seed = 1. Recursive feature elimination (RFE)
    by Genuer et al. (2010) was used to find the smallest dataset from all covariates,
    that is, the dataset with a minor relative error in the variable combination.
    RFE determines the smallest dataset by employing all variables at the start of
    the modelling, and then eliminating the last variable in the order of contribution
    from each iteration. This modelling method was repeated until the final covariate
    was reached. This technique employs coefficient of determination (R2) and Root
    Mean Square Error (RMSE) to assess the ideal (small) dataset, which has the highest
    R2 and lowest RMSE values. Camera et al. (2017) advocated combining the RFE with
    RF to produce more consistent and dependable forecasts. Therefore, this study
    used the same strategy. The modelling strategies listed below were used for the
    four ecosystems to predict groundwater level. Previous studies have demonstrated
    that the application of scale dependency has been shown to significantly increase
    the mapping accuracy of soil salinity in regions with considerable spatial variability
    (Huang et al., 2015, Pachepsky and Hill, 2017, Wei et al., 2021). The groundwater
    depth in the study region determines how severely the soil is salinized (Li et
    al., 2007). Thus, the scale impact may improve the prediction accuracy of the
    groundwater level in the study area. Furthermore, we also investigated the ensemble
    algorithm''s potential to simultaneously increase the prediction accuracy. For
    this purpose, we developed the following procedure (Fig. 4): First, four datasets/ecosystems
    were established based on the geographical location of the samples and land use
    characteristics, namely the OTD, NLOS, OS, and IA (Fig. 3). This was done to explore
    the main factors of the different ecosystems that controlled groundwater levels
    and to examine the effectiveness of ensemble algorithms at various scales (five
    spatial resolution datasets) in improving prediction accuracy. Download : Download

    the methodology applied in the study. Second, we analysed the influence of ensemble
    algorithms and scales on groundwater level prediction in different ecosystems.
    For this purpose, 24 algorithms were used for modelling, including four base algorithms
    (MLP, GRBFN, M5P, and RF) and five combinations of ensemble and base learners
    (20 groups) by mode of one-to-one integration, such as additive regression_RF,
    additive regression_MLP, additive regression_GRBFN, and additive regression_M5P.
    The five datasets used in the modelling corresponded to five spatial resolutions
    (30, 90, 250, 500, and 1000 m). Climate variables, MODIS temperature products,
    land use, and geomorphology were maintained at their original scales. The variability
    between the datasets was dominated by Landsat and DEM-derived variables with different
    resolutions. Finally, the study selected the best combination (base learner +
    ensemble algorithm + specific spatial resolution dataset) based on the results
    of error analysis to map the spatial distribution of groundwater level in the
    different ecosystems. 3.4. Validation Owing to the limited amount of data provided,
    the predictive abilities of the ensemble algorithms and base learners were examined
    using the K-fold cross-validation method. In this method, the training dataset
    was randomly partitioned into five subsets, with four partitions containing 80%
    of the data used to train the learner, and the remaining 20% for validation. Because
    the approach involves significantly more computing effort than a simple train-and-test
    (hold-out) procedure, this validation test was reliable and impartial for smaller
    datasets (Heung et al., 2016). This approach was deemed superior to the standard
    leave-one-out cross-validation technique by assessing the predictive capabilities
    of the regression models over a larger number of samples. The RMSE and R2 values
    were used to evaluate the model''s performance. These statistical parameters and
    related calculations were performed in Graphpad Prism 7.0 and Origin 8.5. where
    Pi refers to the model-predicted value at sampling site i and P is the mean value.
    R2 values close to 1 indicated that the model effectively explained the variance
    of the observations. RMSE values close to 0 indicated accurate model predictions.
    4. Result and discussion 4.1. Statistical characteristics and spatial variability
    of groundwater levels in typical ecosystems The mean values of the corresponding
    groundwater level for each artificial and natural ecosystem were calculated (Table
    2). For all samples, the minimum, maximum, and mean values were 0.79, 150.26,
    and 12.25 m, respectively, with an extreme spatial variability (coefficient of
    variability equal to 1.87). Subsequently, we divided the samples into OTD, NLOS,
    IA, OS, Crop_highland, Crop_plain, Saline_soil, Saline_desert, and Desert, based
    on Google maps, apparent electrical conductivity maps (Wang et al., 2021a), land
    use and Landsat OLI actual colour synthetic images, and our local knowledge over
    many years. The mean value of each dataset showed that the Crop_highland subsurface
    level was the largest (18.84 m), followed by NLOS, and the minimum value occurs
    in Saline_soil (3.89 m). Saline_desert ecotone and Desert had mean groundwater
    levels of 7.69 and 7.70 m, respectively. In a study of the Daryaboyi Oasis in
    the centre of the Taklamakan Desert, Imin et al. (2021) found that a groundwater
    level of 2.1–4.3 m may guarantee more active photosynthesis of plants. Groundwater
    level cannot be > 7 m to guarantee the normal development of riparian woody plants.
    According to Li et al. (2007), groundwater levels > 5.59 m and soil salinity >
    1.61 g/L would significantly impede the expected growth of T. ramosissima. Groundwater
    levels in OS (CV = 1.88) and NLOS (CV = 1.26) exhibited very high spatial variability,
    whereas the remaining geographic areas showed moderate spatial variability. Considering
    the importance of groundwater for oases, natural ecosystems, and irrigated areas,
    and the number of samples, we then used OTD, OS, NLOS, and IA as the main geographic
    areas for testing the effect of ensemble algorithms and scale on the prediction
    accuracy of groundwater level. Table 2. Statistical characteristics of groundwater

    4.35 0.64 Groundwater level influences the fate of ecosystems in dry zones and
    fluctuates with it to produce different landscape characteristics. In this study,
    the mean value of groundwater level in the irrigated agricultural region (4.66
    m in plain and 18.84 m in Baicheng Oasis plain) was greater than the results of
    Wang et al. (2021b) who assessed the mean value of groundwater level from 2000
    to 2018 as 4.10 m. Research showed that irrigated agriculture that is heavily
    reliant on groundwater leads to overexploitation (Wang et al., 2021b), which in
    turn depletes the groundwater table. This supports that the main causal factor
    for the continuous decline of the groundwater level is the large amount of groundwater
    consumed by the expansion of the oasis in recent decades (Sun et al., 2011). Additionally,
    the groundwater in the Tarim Basin also showed a decreasing trend between 2003
    and 2016, with a significant decline in South Tianshan (Zuo et al., 2021). The
    same phenomenon was observed in the Hexi Corridor of China (Chen, 2010) and western
    Australia (Hu et al., 2019). Data for the study were collected during cropping
    from April to June, when groundwater was required for salt washing and irrigation,
    which may have further lowered the groundwater level. Fig. 5 shows the statistical
    characteristics of EVI at different groundwater levels, revealing that the interval
    of 6–8 m was the extreme range for vegetation to survive, whereas only specific
    deep-rooted vegetation can survive at 8–10 m. The localisation found that these
    observations were mainly in the desert area and adjacent to the oasis-desert transition
    zone. The areas with higher vegetation cover are located in the areas with groundwater
    levels < 6 m and > 10 m, respectively, attributed to irrigation and rainfall at
    higher elevations, such as the Baicheng Oasis, respectively. Historical studies
    in this region indicated that the basic groundwater table range for plants in
    the lower Tarim River basin was 0–6 m, and the diversity of species was greatest
    between 2 and 4 m, drastically declining below 6 m (Hao et al., 2010). This is
    consistent with our findings, demonstrating the reliability of the sampling results.
    Regional fluctuations of the groundwater level was present in OTD, NLOS, and IA,
    consistent with the strong spatial variability of soil salinity in the study area.
    This is because the groundwater level is a crucial determinant of the occurrence
    of salinisation within the region (Wang et al., 2021a). Download : Download high-res

    prediction error (RMSE) of groundwater level under different predefined conditions.
    The NLOS and OTD ecosystems had the highest prediction accuracies, with R2 and
    RMSE values of 0.96 and 0.92 and 5.66 m and 6.09 m, respectively. This was followed
    by IA with R2 and RMSE values of 0.86 and 3.78 m, respectively. Meanwhile, OS
    had a 50% explanatory power of spatial variability with an RMSE value of 3.49
    m. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 6. Impact of scale, base learners, and ensemble algorithms on modelling in
    different ecosystems. The Root Mean Square Error is used as a reference. Itself
    in the figure represents the base learners themselves. The lowest RMSE for OTD
    was obtained using a dataset with a spatial resolution of 30 m and a mean value
    of 10.86 m. The minimum RMSE produced without the ensemble algorithm by the base
    learner was 7.00 m, with R2 = 0.94. This result was obtained from the GRBFN algorithm
    with a 1000 m spatial resolution dataset. The ensemble algorithm performance of
    the five machine learning methods at different spatial resolutions revealed that
    Rotation Forest computed the comparatively least RMSE with a mean value of 10.02
    m, followed by Random Subspace and Dagging with mean values of 10.20 and 19.28
    m, respectively. RatationForest_MLP, which was supported by a 30-m spatial resolution
    dataset, was the top-performing ensemble algorithm for NLOS. This algorithm predicted
    an RMSE of 5.66 m with an R2 of 0.98. Comparatively, RandomSubspace_MLP achieved
    a lower RMSE of 5.91 m with R2 = 0.96, supported by same dataset. The best-performing
    ensemble algorithm for IA was the Additive Regression_GRBFN supported by a 250
    m spatial resolution dataset, with an RMSE of 3.78 m and R2 = 0.93. The best-performing
    base-learner learning algorithm was RF (250 m), with a predicted RMSE of 4.43
    and R2 = 0.91. Under different conditions, Random Subspace was generally the best
    partner for all base learners in the IA region with a mean RMSE of 5.69 m, followed
    by Rotation Forest, with the worst being Dagging. For OS, Additive Regression_RF
    was the best ensemble technique for forecasting groundwater levels, which performed
    slightly better than RF using a 90-m spatial resolution dataset. Additive Regression_RF
    (90 m) predicted an RMSE of 3.49 with R2 = 0.50, whereas RF (90 m) had an RMSE
    of 3.59 m. However, comparing the performance of the five ensemble algorithms
    under the background of five spatial resolution datasets revealed that Random
    Subspace had the best ensemble performance with a mean RMSE of 4.26 m, followed
    by Bagging, and the worst performer was Additive Regression. Without the assistance
    of ensemble algorithms, the mean RMSE of the groundwater level predicted by the
    four base learners and supported by five spatial resolution datasets was 4.87
    m. After all ecosystems were evaluated, the OS region had the lowest prediction
    accuracy. This could be explained by the poor link between environmental factors
    and groundwater levels in the area. The sustainability of the artificial oasis
    in the OS ecosystem relies mainly on irrigation (shallow-rooted vegetation), which
    differs significantly from the survival strategy of plants under the natural environment.
    We speculated that the combined data from the two regions (artificial oasis and
    natural ecosystems) lowered the groundwater-aboveground landscape relationship.
    4.3. Impact of ensemble algorithms on prediction accuracy The data statistics
    showed that the most optimal ensemble algorithm was influential in predicting
    the groundwater level in the study area (Fig. 6). First, we used the mean RMSE
    value as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of the four base learners. The
    best-performing algorithm, according to the 20 RMSE statistics (scenarios) for
    the five spatial resolution datasets from four regions, was RF (RMSE = 6.49 m),
    followed by GRBFN (RMSE = 6.75 m), MLP (RMSE = 8.31 m), and M5 (RMSE = 10.26 m).
    This is because RF itself is an ensemble algorithm. However, in many instances
    in our investigation, GRBFN performed similarly and had superior computational
    accuracy. However, the advantage of RF over GRBFN is that it requires fewer parameters
    to be set. Subsequently, a total of 84 RMSE statistics from the five spatial resolutions
    datasets of the four regions confirmed that Random Subspace was the best ensemble
    algorithm compared with the base learner, with an average reduction in RMSE percentage
    of –9.22%, followed by Rotation Forest (–6.74 %), Additive Regression (–2.94%),
    and Bagging (–2.78%), and the worst one was Dagging (42.55%) (Fig. 7a). Among
    them, Random Subspace, Rotation Forest, and Additive Regression improved the prediction
    accuracy of the base learner by 76%, 72%, and 64%, followed by Bagging. Meanwhile,
    Dagging increased the possibility of prediction errors. By comparing the four
    ecosystems, we found that Random Subspace was more stable and improved the RMSE
    of all systems, followed by Rotation Forest and Additive Regression. Bagging''s
    overall performance was average; however, in terms of error reduction, it was
    comparable to that of Rotation Forest and Random Subspace. The largest error reduced
    by bagging in NLOS, OS, and IA were –28.21%, –36.63%, and –26.67%, respectively,
    whereas Rotation Forest and Random Subspace reduced the errors by –34.60% and
    –37.11%, –37.06% and –29.80%, and –25.85%, and –23.69%, respectively. Download

    Efficiency of the improvement of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) using the ensemble
    algorithm compared with base learners. A positive number implies an increase in
    RMSE and a negative number indicates a decrease in RMSE, (left). The effect of
    different spatial resolution datasets on the RMSE of different ecosystems (right).
    Finally, we analysed the efficiency of cooperation between the base learners and
    ensemble algorithms. The results showed that Additive Regression was best paired
    with RF (RMSE = 6.10), Random Subspace with GRBFN (RMSE = 6.55 m), Bagging with
    MLP (RMSE = 6.90 m), and Rotation Forest with M5 (RMSE = 8.21 m). Additive Regression–RF
    had the best predictive power among the ensemble algorithms. Furthermore, in terms
    of mean RMSE, Additive Regression was the only ensemble algorithm that improved
    the prediction error of RF (RMSE = 6.48 m), whereas all other ensemble algorithms,
    such as Bagging (RMSE = 7.06 m), Dagging (RMSE = 11.97 m), Random Subspace (RMSE
    = 6.54 m), and Rotation Forest (RMSE = 6.61 m), failed to improve the prediction
    error of RF. With all base learners, Additive Regression had the highest probability
    (75%) of obtaining optimal prediction accuracy within the four ecosystems. In
    summary, Rotation Forest and Random Subspace provided relatively low prediction
    errors with high probability and were distinguished by their steady performance
    in various ecosystems. Additive Regression helped base learners obtain relatively
    optimal solutions with high probability. However, no single algorithm perfectly
    optimised all the error problems; multiple algorithms must be applied and validated
    for testing to determine the most efficient one (Khosravi et al., 2018a). 4.4.
    Effect of different scale data sets on prediction accuracy The accuracy of groundwater
    level estimation in various ecosystems was influenced by five datasets with different
    spatial resolutions (Fig. 7b). We calculated the average values of 24 RMSEs at
    five resolutions in four ecosystems, which included the base learner (four calculation
    scenarios) and ensemble learning algorithms (20 calculation scenarios). The magnitudes
    of the effect of five datasets with different spatial resolutions on the accuracy
    of groundwater level prediction (maximum value of RMSE compared with the minimum
    value) were 11.48%, 21.63%, 10.59%, and 26.73% for OTD, NLOS, OS, and IA, respectively
    and their respective optimal spatial resolutions were 500, 30, 90, and 250 m.
    However, the above statistical results did not represent the spatial resolution
    used for the highest prediction accuracy nor indicated that the optimal solution
    can be obtained with the support of the spatial resolution dataset. The probability
    of the optimal solution was higher with the support of the spatial resolution
    dataset. For example, the optimal scales for obtaining optimal precision for different
    ecosystems were 250 m (OTD), 30 m (NLOS), 90 m (OS), and 250 m (IA), whereas the
    optimal scale for OTD was not from the dataset with spatial resolution of 500
    m. However, the results demonstrated that scale factors can improve the accuracy
    of groundwater level predictions in different ecosystems. The findings from the
    four ecosystems showed the effect of the scale on the groundwater level and surface
    environment, consistent with many other studies that have found that scale affects
    the relationship between soil properties and the environment (Behrens et al.,
    2010, Guo et al., 2018, Miller et al., 2015). This may be because groundwater
    is the precondition of oasis existence, and its spatial and temporal variability
    is essential in determining the spatial heterogeneity between soil properties
    and environmental characteristics. Notably, the optimal interpretation scale adapted
    to the MODS system, such as the OTD, is not the optimal scale for other ecosystems.
    The optimal scale of groundwater level prediction changes depending on the ecosystem.
    We correlated the scale and prediction accuracy with the spatial variability of
    the groundwater level and found no significant correlations between them, implying
    that numerous attempts should be performed to obtain an ideal scale. 4.5. Prediction
    error of the optimal ensemble algorithm at the threshold depth of the groundwater
    table Fig. 8 and Table 3 show the accuracy of the predicted groundwater levels
    at various depths in the four ecosystems. According to the literature, the groundwater
    levels at 4 and 8 m are the fuzzy threshold values for salinisation and desertification,
    respectively (Hao et al., 2010, Sun et al., 2011). Using this as a guideline,
    this study investigated the performance of the optimum model at 0–4, 4–8, 0–8,
    and > 8 m. Except for the OS system, the results revealed that groundwater levels
    can be forecasted with higher accuracy at depths > 8 m than at depths < 8 m. We
    discovered that these observations were mostly located in natural habitats outside
    the irrigation region and were tightly connected to topography and geomorphology.

    RMSE 3.78 2.25 1.48 1.84 7.64 The mean predicted values of all ecosystems were
    higher than the observed values for groundwater depths < 4 m (Table 3). The randomness
    of the scatter between the predicted and observed values within this range is
    shown in Fig. 8. The reason for this might be that this depth (<4 m) occurs in
    the saline zone of the NLOS, the oasis-desert transition zone, and irrigated areas.
    The vegetation types within the saline zone are homogeneous and have low coverage
    while the vegetation within the oasis-desert transition zone, which can reflect
    the groundwater level, is composed of multiple communities and has a low remote
    sensing spectral separation. In addition, not all vegetation is groundwater-dependent.
    The utilisation of various water sources by desert vegetation during various growing
    seasons suggests that roots are selective in their uptake of water sources during
    different periods (Bahejiayinaer et al., 2018). In summer, Phragmites in dune
    habitats mainly use groundwater, salt spiraea in salt marsh habitats use soil
    water, and white spiraea in desert habitats shift their water use strategy from
    surface to deep soil water (Hao and Li, 2021). In contrast, in agricultural cultivation
    areas where irrigation is routine, the groundwater level does not influence the
    geographical variance of economic crop greenness. We also attempted to forecast
    the groundwater level in the desert; however, because of the uniform texture,
    undulating dunes, and lack of vegetation, determining the groundwater level using
    the current dataset was more challenging. Therefore, the results were excluded
    from the study. In these locations, the combined impact of environmental factors
    on groundwater is complicated (Bekele et al., 2019). The means of the predicted
    and observed values were similar when the observed groundwater depth was between
    4 and 8 m. However, the R2 values were not high. Similar to the predictions within
    0–8 m, all forecasted values fell within the threshold range. In summary, the
    use of data with various spatial resolutions and sub-regional modelling is recommended
    to boost the groundwater prediction accuracy according to the comparison of the
    prediction errors at various depths, especially when the scale of the research
    area is large and its land cover type is more diverse. 4.6. Influencing factors
    In diverse habitats, the combination of topography, land use, and climate control
    the groundwater fluctuations that vary depending on ecosystem features (Fig. 9).
    Geomorphology, DEM (250 m), and climatic variables (WC01, WC13, WC15) had the
    most significant influence on the overall trend of the groundwater level in the
    OTD. Although temperature and evaporation significantly impacted variation of
    groundwater level, precipitation has a comparatively limited impact on changes
    in groundwater levels (Zuo et al., 2021). For the OS area, the spatial variation
    in the groundwater level resulted from the interaction between geomorphology,
    land use, and MRVBF 90 m, in which geomorphological features dominated among all
    variables. Climate variables, such as the maximum temperature of the warmest month
    and other meteorological parameters, had a greater influence than other factors
    in the NLOS region, followed by elevation (DEM30m). The DEM at 250 m dominated
    the entire groundwater level in the irrigated region. Groundwater level changes
    in the studied region were generally driven by geomorphology and the DEM. Download

    Optimal datasets used to construct groundwater level predictions for four ecosystems
    and their contributions. Therefore, we used OTD as an example to investigate the
    response relation between these two and the partial variable-dependent groundwater
    level. In Fig. 10a, when the altitude is < 1025 m, the groundwater table is relatively
    shallow and does not exhibit a clear trend. However, when the altitude is between
    1025 and 1200 m, the groundwater depth exhibited an increasing trend and raised
    quickly between 1200 and 1240 m (mid-elevation alluvial floodplain), after which
    (>1240 m) the groundwater table did not change. This may be the result of insufficient
    observations. Fig. 10b illustrates that the middle elevation alluvial floodplain
    (121341), middle elevation river valley plain (121360), middle elevation flowing
    gently undulating sandy area (123132), middle elevation dry floodplain (123220),
    and middle elevation dry floodplain (123221) had deeper groundwater levels. In
    contrast, the low-elevation alluvial fan plain (111334), middle-elevation alluvial
    depressions (121336), and erosion and deposition have relatively shallow groundwater
    levels. Download : Download high-res image (394KB) Download : Download full-size

    displaying their relationships with natural groundwater depth in the study area:
    (a) elevation (b) geomorphology. The Pearson correlation between the preferred
    variables and the groundwater level is presented in Table 4. For OTD, DEM250m
    showed the highest correlation value with the groundwater level, r = 0.71, followed
    by Slope250m (r = 0.52) and WC12 (r = 0.36). The mean annual temperature (WC01)
    showed the highest negative correlation (r = −0.60), followed by MRVBF250m (r
    = −0.52). The groundwater level decreased significantly with decreasing elevation
    (Bekele et al., 2019). The correlations between the preferred environmental variables
    and groundwater levels were low within the OS system. Regarding preferred environmental
    characteristics inside NLOS, WC11 (r = −0.40) and TCW90m (r = −0.32) had the strongest
    correlations. The groundwater level and DEM showed the greatest positive correlation
    with r = 0.90, followed by WC12, and the greatest negative correlation indicated
    by WC01 with r = −0.88, and WC05 with r = −0.83. Within the IA system, the largest
    positive correlation value was DEM250m (r = 0.63), followed by Slope250m, and
    the maximum negative correlation was MRVBF250m with r = −0.53. Table 4. Correlations

    Spatial distribution characteristics of groundwater levels The spatial distribution
    characteristics of the groundwater levels matched the land use and geomorphological
    patterns of the study area (Fig. 11). The groundwater level of the Baicheng Oasis
    was deeper compared with other regions due to its high altitude. In contrast,
    the groundwater level of the irrigation area was relatively shallow, maintaining
    a groundwater level of ≤ 4 m. Groundwater levels in the ecotone between the desert
    and the oasis ranged from 6 to 8 m but increased with elevation, as seen in the
    eastern half of the Kuqa Oasis and its western border with the Aksu salt-affected
    land. The actual predictions were in the range of 6–8 m, whereas the mean value
    of the groundwater level in the surroundings of the Kuqa Oasis (in the northern
    end of the southern Taklamakan Desert) was approximately 8 m. The predicted and
    observed values were within comparable intervals in the region where the sample
    sites were located in the southern Taklamakan Desert. Download : Download high-res

    maps of groundwater levels in the OTD, OS, and IA regions predicted by the optimal
    ensemble algorithm. The link between the observed and predicted values was further
    examined, and the prediction accuracy was found to vary depending on the depth
    range. The probability that the predicted and actual values fell within the 4–8
    m depth range was 87.57%, 93.47%, 92.91%, and 92.10% for OTD, NLOS, OS, and IA,
    respectively. In contrast, using the predicted values in the range of 4–8 m as
    a reference, the probability of the actual values that fell in this range were
    57.37% for OTD and 62.07% for OS. Here, only these two ecosystems were used as
    examples. The probability of the predicted values between 0 and 8 m was 92.39%,
    95.45%, 91.81%, and 99.01% for OTD, NLOS, OS, and IA, respectively. In contrast,
    the probability that the predicted values were set within 0–8 m and the actual
    values fell within this range were 85.35% for OTD and 91.80% for OS. Finally,
    for predictions deeper than 8 m, the predicted values indicated a confidence level
    of 76.42% for OTD and 83.87% for OS. In conclusion, the confidence level of the
    predicted groundwater depths was greater in the ranges of 0–8 m and > 8 m than
    at the other depths. When utilising the observed and forecasted values as references,
    the findings of these respective depth ranges assisted us in recognising differences
    in the actual scenario. 4.8. Uncertainty and limitations The unsatisfactory precision
    of the available data and a lack of important soil vegetation factors that were
    directly connected to groundwater may restrict the predicted accuracy of the groundwater
    level. Groundwater samples were collected over two months for this investigation,
    possibly affecting the time dependence of the groundwater level-subsurface relationship
    because the sample could not be promptly collected. We examined data from observation
    wells in the Kuqa Oasis from 1997 to 2003 and discovered that intra-annual groundwater
    level changes varied from 0.44 to 2.33 m, with a mean value of 1.17 m. However,
    because the range of intra-annual groundwater level changes in the desert-oasis
    transition zone was unknown, the precise degree of the impacts above cannot be
    determined. Additionally, land use data were mapped for 2015, which may have reflected
    the land use pattern of an earlier period. Furthermore, the prediction accuracy
    of 0–4 and 0–8 m could have been better enhanced if soil-related data with greater
    spatial resolution were available, such as soil moisture and hydraulic characteristics.
    The analysis of variations in groundwater levels benefits significantly from the
    more specific categories of soil properties (Fu et al., 2019). Existing soil moisture
    data with a poor spatial resolution (25 km) are of limited use in the prediction
    aims of the current study. High-precision soil hydraulic properties, such as bulk
    weight, soil texture, organic carbon, wilting point, saturated water content,
    field water holding capacity, and agricultural drainage data are in short supply
    (Fu et al., 2019, Kim and Jackson, 2012, Zhang et al., 2014). These characteristics
    provide clear evidence of the hydrological relationship between groundwater and
    the surrounding environment in anthropogenic and natural oases (Jiang et al.,
    2015, Wang et al., 2014). A hydrogeological map considerably impacts groundwater
    level, although it can be challenging to collect (Erler et al., 2019). In contrast,
    information regarding the development of the groundwater cycle and hydrogeochemistry
    can be obtained from the geographical and temporal distribution of groundwater
    levels. 5. Conclusion The spatial variability of groundwater level in the typical
    MODS of arid zones is unknown due to the extreme lack of observational data. To
    this end, the study used explored the spatial distribution patterns of groundwater
    levels in MODS in the Tarim Basin in Central Asia using limited observational
    data. The study simultaneously examined the effects of ecosystem characteristics
    of four typical regions (OTD, IA, OS, and NLOS), ensemble algorithms, and five
    spatial resolution datasets to obtain the best groundwater level prediction accuracy.
    In OTD, IA, and NLOS, the best model exhibited > 90% explanatory power, whereas
    OS only explained 50% of the spatial variability. Random Subspace, Rotation Forest,
    and Additive Regression improved the prediction accuracy of the base learner by
    76%, 72%, and 64%, respectively. Dagging with other base learners indicated a
    high probability of increasing the error. Rotation Forest and Random Subspace
    combined with base learners generated relatively low prediction errors with a
    high probability and exhibited steady performances in the four ecosystems. Base
    learners produced nearly optimum outcomes with high probability using Additive
    Regression. In the four ecosystems, the scale factor increased the prediction
    accuracy of groundwater level by 10.59%–26.73%. Compared with the range of <8
    m, the optimum model performed better in the range of >8 m. Future research should
    address the limited prediction accuracy of shallow groundwater level (<8 m) by
    adding multiple data sources, such as geologic data, multi-period runoff data,
    multi-period microwave retrieved soil moisture datasets with high spatial resolution,
    soil hydrologic conductivity (spatial interpolation based on field collected data),
    and fine-scale vegetation types (crops and natural vegetation communities). As
    vegetation is an essential prerequisite for maintaining the survival of oases
    in dryland, the correlation between groundwater level and above-ground vegetation
    should also be explored, covering the influence of vegetation type, biomass, vegetation
    growth fluctuations, and vegetation phenology on groundwater levels. CRediT authorship

  description: A prescription map is a set of instructions that controls a variable
    rate irrigation (VRI) system. These maps, which may be based on prior yield, soil
    texture, topography, or soil electrical conductivity data, are often manually
    applied at the beginning of an irrigation season and remain static. The problem
    with static prescription maps is that they ignore spatiotemporal changes in crop
    water status. In a two-year study (2012 and 2013), a plant feedback system, including
    a wireless sensor network of infrared thermometers (IRTs), was used to develop
    dynamic prescription maps to accomplish adaptive irrigation scheduling for cotton
    (Gossypium hirsutum L.). One-half of a center pivot field was divided into manually
    and plant feedback-controlled irrigation treatment plots. Irrigation treatments
    were at three levels, 75, 50 and 25 percent of full as defined by either replenishment
    of crop water use to field capacity or by the equivalent threshold of the IRT
    sensed crop water stress. The system accepted user input to control irrigation
    for the manual treatment plots (I<inf>75M</inf>, I<inf>50M</inf>, and I<inf>25M</inf>),
    and calculated and compared a thermal stress index for each plant feedback-controlled
    treatment plot (I<inf>75C</inf>, I<inf>50C</inf> and I<inf>25C</inf>) with a pre-determined
    threshold for automated irrigation scheduling. The effectiveness of the plant
    feedback irrigation scheduling system was evaluated by comparing measured lint
    yield, crop water use (ET<inf>c</inf>), and water use efficiency (WUE) with the
    manually scheduled treatment plots. Results for both years indicated that average
    lint yields were similar between the manual and plant feedback-control plots at
    the I<inf>75</inf> level (181 and 182gm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, in 2012; 115
    and 103gm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, in 2013) and I<inf>50</inf> level (146 and
    164gm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, in 2012; 95 and 117gm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively,
    in 2013). At the I<inf>25</inf> level, average lint yield was significantly greater
    for the plant feedback-compared with the manual-control treatment plots (142gm<sup>-2</sup>
    and 92gm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively), but the mean amount of irrigation was twice
    that of the manual-control plots. Mean water use efficiencies (WUE) within the
    same irrigation treatment levels were similar between methods. Importantly, the
    automatic plant feedback system did not require the time consuming and expensive
    manual reading of neutron probe access tubes that was required to schedule the
    manual treatments. These results demonstrate that the integration of a plant feedback
    system with a commercial VRI system could be used to control site-specific irrigation
    management for cotton at higher irrigation treatment levels, i.e., I<inf>75</inf>
    percent and I<inf>50</inf> percent of full. Such a system can facilitate the use
    of a VRI system by automating prescription map coding and providing dynamic irrigation
    control instructions to meet variable crop water needs throughout the irrigation
    season. As of yet, further research is required to maintain automatic deficit
    irrigation at a level equivalent to 25 percent replenishment of crop water use
    relative to field capacity.

    • Dynamic prescription maps were developed from plant canopy and weather data.
    • Continuous plant measurements were made with a wireless sensor network system.
    • Prescription map development was automated. • Site-specific irrigation was accomplished
    with a plant feedback system. Abstract A prescription map is a set of instructions
    that controls a variable rate irrigation (VRI) system. These maps, which may be
    based on prior yield, soil texture, topography, or soil electrical conductivity
    data, are often manually applied at the beginning of an irrigation season and
    remain static. The problem with static prescription maps is that they ignore spatiotemporal
    changes in crop water status. In a two-year study (2012 and 2013), a plant feedback
    system, including a wireless sensor network of infrared thermometers (IRTs), was
    used to develop dynamic prescription maps to accomplish adaptive irrigation scheduling
    for cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). One-half of a center pivot field was divided
    into manually and plant feedback-controlled irrigation treatment plots. Irrigation
    treatments were at three levels, 75, 50 and 25 percent of full as defined by either
    replenishment of crop water use to field capacity or by the equivalent threshold
    of the IRT sensed crop water stress. The system accepted user input to control
    irrigation for the manual treatment plots (I75M, I50M, and I25M), and calculated
    and compared a thermal stress index for each plant feedback-controlled treatment
    plot (I75C, I50C and I25C) with a pre-determined threshold for automated irrigation
    scheduling. The effectiveness of the plant feedback irrigation scheduling system
    was evaluated by comparing measured lint yield, crop water use (ETc), and water
    use efficiency (WUE) with the manually scheduled treatment plots. Results for
    both years indicated that average lint yields were similar between the manual
    and plant feedback-control plots at the I75 level (181 and 182 g m−2, respectively,
    in 2012; 115 and 103 g m−2, respectively, in 2013) and I50 level (146 and 164
    g m−2, respectively, in 2012; 95 and 117 g m−2, respectively, in 2013). At the
    I25 level, average lint yield was significantly greater for the plant feedback-compared
    with the manual-control treatment plots (142 g m−2 and 92 g m−2, respectively),
    but the mean amount of irrigation was twice that of the manual-control plots.
    Mean water use efficiencies (WUE) within the same irrigation treatment levels
    were similar between methods. Importantly, the automatic plant feedback system
    did not require the time consuming and expensive manual reading of neutron probe
    access tubes that was required to schedule the manual treatments. These results
    demonstrate that the integration of a plant feedback system with a commercial

    schedulingPlant feedbackWireless sensor network 1. Introduction Variable rate
    irrigation (VRI) systems provide the flexibility of delivering accurate but variable
    depths of water along a sprinkler lateral or in the direction of sprinkler travel
    (Dukes and Perry, 2006, Han et al., 2009, Chávez et al., 2010, Evans et al., 2010,
    O’Shaughnessy et al., 2013a). These systems are now commercially available and
    could be used as a tool for improving crop water management by delivering water
    to plants where needed, when the crop demands it and in the appropriate amounts.
    Prescription maps, sets of coded instructions, control pivot movement and flows
    to apply specific irrigation depths for each management zone. Management zones
    are defined by the radial extent of controlled sets of drop hoses along the sprinkler
    lateral, and by the angular extent of pivot rotation in the direction of travel.
    Prescription maps for a VRI system are usually generated at the beginning of a
    growing season, manually uploaded to the irrigation control panel (Evans et al.,
    2013), and typically based on geo-referenced data from prior yields, soil texture,
    apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa), or topographical elevations. Static
    prescription maps are problematic in the sense that spatiotemporal variability
    of crop water stress throughout the growing season is overlooked. Such variability
    can be a consequence of spatially variable precipitation, topography, variable
    soil infiltration rates and soil storage capacity (Sadler et al., 2005), variable
    plant stand, or disease and pest infestation (Falkenberg et al., 2007). Additionally
    crop evapotranspiration varies over a growing season and between years, due to
    fluxes in radiation, temperature, wind speed, and vapor pressure deficit. Dynamic
    prescription maps resulting from continuous monitoring and assessment of climatological
    and crop data are highly desirable. Crop water stress has been characterized using
    infrared thermometry (Nielsen and Anderson, 1989), and theoretical (Jackson et
    al., 1981) and empirical (Idso and Reginato, 1982, Wanjura and Upchurch, 2000,
    Barbosa da Silva and Rao, 2005) thermal stress indices. Information from IRTs
    mounted on a moving sprinkler irrigation system with a global positioning system
    (GPS) has been demonstrated to provide spatial and temporal crop water status
    (Sadler et al., 2002, Peters and Evett, 2007, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2011a) at
    the field scale. By continuous crop canopy temperature and meteorological monitoring,
    the use of IRTs on a moving VRI irrigation sprinkler provides plant feedback control
    (Fig. 1) for irrigation scheduling. Control of irrigation is possible using threshold
    stress indices (Nielsen and Gardner, 1987, Garrot et al., 1994, Evett et al.,
    1996, Evett et al., 2002, Barbosa da Silva and Rao, 2005, Gontia and Tiwari, 2008).
    The amount of irrigation to be delivered can be determined using multiples of
    peak daily water use (i.e., frequency of repeat travel over a management zone
    multiplied by daily peak crop water use) (Peters and Evett, 2008, O’Shaughnessy
    and Evett, 2010) or by estimating crop water requirements using weather based
    measurements and crop coefficients. After the sprinkler travels over the field,
    the need to schedule an irrigation is automatically re-assessed for each management
    zone. In the strictest sense, plant feedback systems are open-loop feedback systems.
    However, crop response (yields and water use efficiencies) using plant feedback
    systems for irrigation scheduling has been similar to or better than crop response
    from irrigation scheduling using direct soil water measurements with the neutron
    probe (BIOTIC method, Upchurch et al., 1996; the time-temperature-threshold method,
    Evett et al., 1996, Peters and Evett, 2008, O’Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010; CWSI
    and time threshold, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012; and the integrated CWSI (iCWSI),
    O’Shaughnessy et al., 2013b). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Design
    of integrated system of wireless sensor network and variable rate irrigation sprinkler
    controlled with dynamic plant feedback prescription maps. If prescription maps
    are constructed using geo-referenced plant sensing data and pre-established thresholds
    to indicate where, when, and the depth of irrigation required, then dynamic site-specific
    instructions for irrigation scheduling can be developed throughout the irrigation
    season. These dynamic prescription maps could direct site-specific irrigation
    according to crop water needs, potentially improving crop water use efficiency
    by irrigating the crop only when it needs it, and reducing the likelihood of excessive
    irrigations, runoff and deep percolation. Using a computer for centralized data
    collection, storage and control, construction and uploading of the maps can be
    automated. However, to date, the effectiveness of dynamic prescription maps for
    controlling site-specific variable rate irrigation using plant feedback methods
    has not been demonstrated. Therefore, our specific objectives were to: (1) assess
    the feasibility of developing dynamic prescription maps from a plant feedback
    system for irrigation control of a center pivot outfitted with a commercial VRI
    package; and (2) evaluate irrigation control via the dynamic prescription maps
    by comparing cotton responses of lint yield, water use (ETc), and crop water use
    efficiency (WUE) from plots irrigated automatically using the plant feedback system
    with the responses of plots irrigated manually based on weekly neutron probe readings.
    2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental site and irrigation system The two-year
    study was conducted at the Conservation and Production Research Laboratory (CPRL),
    Bushland, Texas (35°11′N, 102°06′W, 1170 m above mean sea level). The field soil
    was a Pullman clay loam, a fine, mixed, superactive, thermic, Torrertic Paleustoll
    (Soil Survey Staff, 2004). The field capacity (0.33 m3 m−3) and wilting point
    (0.18 m3 m−3) (Unger and Pringle, 1981) water contents were assumed uniform across
    the center pivot field. The climate is semi-arid with an average annual rainfall
    of 470 mm. Upland cotton, delta pine, variety 1212RFBG21 was planted on May 19,
    2012, day of year (DOY) 140, and on May 31, 2013 (DOY 151) at a rate of 198,000
    seeds ha−1. The planting date was delayed in 2013 due to low spring soil temperatures.
    Irrigations were applied in alternate furrows with low energy precision application
    (LEPA) drag socks (Lyle and Bordovsky, 1983) in every other furrow. Furrows were
    diked to minimize runoff (Schneider and Howell, 1995) and to provide temporary
    detention required for LEPA irrigation. 2.2. System design The plant feedback
    system (Fig. 1) was comprised of a wireless sensor network (WSN) system of infrared
    thermometers (IRTs) (Melexis, MLX90614, Ieper, Belgium) and meteorological data
    integrated with a commercial VRI system. The embedded computer (base station)
    was located at the pivot point and provided central data collection and data processing.
    Data collected at the base-station was time stamped and geo-spatially referenced.
    Prescription maps were built every two days using data manually entered by the
    user and information calculated by the embedded computer. The manual input was
    the amount of water to be applied to replenish 100% of mean soil water depletion
    to field capacity to the manual treatment plots in the I75 treatment level. Irrigation
    applied was 75%, 50%, and 25% of the amount entered by the user, and was calculated
    within the embedded computer. The integrated crop water stress index (iCWSI) values
    were calculated for daylight hours from continuous crop canopy temperature and
    meteorological data collected over a 24 h period. More details are provided later
    in this section. 2.3. Variable rate irrigation system The irrigation system was
    a three-span center pivot with a 131 m lateral, retrofitted with a commercial
    variable rate irrigation (VRI) package (Valmont Industries1, Valley, Nebr.). Each
    drop hose was plumbed with a hydraulic valve, which pulsed water “on” and “off”
    and regulated to 41.4 kPa. The pivot lateral was configured for 12 irrigation
    zones. Each irrigation zone was comprised of six sprinkler drop hoses that were
    hydraulically connected and actuated by a single electronic solenoid valve. A
    programmable logic controller in the irrigation system’s control panel regulated
    the VRI hardware using the prescription map uploaded into the control panel using
    an RS-232 serial connection between the computer and control panel. A wide area
    augmentation system (WAAS) corrected GPS, with a differential position accuracy
    of ±3 m, communicated with the programmable logic controller using power line
    carrier communication. 2.4. Sensor network systems The wireless sensor network
    (WSN) was comprised of a base station (embedded computer) at the pivot point,
    infrared thermometers (IRTs) installed on the pivot lateral and in the field below
    as described by O’Shaughnessy et al. (2013b), and a weather station located in
    near proximity (8 m from the pivot point). The wireless IRTS (simple IRTs) and
    multiband radiometers (MBRs) were developed at the USDA-ARS CPRL. The thermal
    detectors of each instrument were calibrated in a temperature controlled chamber
    against a commercial black body prior to the beginning of each growing season
    using methods similar to those described in O’Shaughnessy et al. (2011b), in ambient
    temperatures of 15 °C, 25 °C, 35 °C, and 45 °C, while the black body temperature
    was stepped down from 55 °C to 10 °C in increments of 5 °C. The infrared thermal
    detector is an off-the-shelf sensor (Melexis, Model MLX90614BCF, Belgium) with
    a field of view (FOV) of 28° and a pass filter ranging from 8 to 14 μm. The temperature
    accuracy is 0.5 °C over the range of 0–50 °C for the target and sensor body temperature.
    The measurement resolution is 0.01 °C. In 2012, eight simple IRTs were mounted
    on masts located on the pivot lateral at the border of each concentric plot looking
    inwards at an oblique angle (angle of 135° relative to the vertical mast on which
    the sensor was mounted). The sensor was pointed slightly forward at an azimuth
    angle of 70° between the direction of pivot travel and the crop row. The simple
    IRTs were housed in weather-proof cases milled from solid white ploy-vinyl chloride
    (PVC), and measured 17.8 cm in length and 4.4 cm in diameter. The sensors located
    on the pivot lateral viewed the cropped field forward of the irrigations and were
    maintained at a height approximately 1.0 m above the crop canopy. Additionally,
    three IRTs were placed in the well-watered inner border region (Fig. 2) at nadir-looking
    views and adjusted to maintain a height of 1.0 m above the crop canopy. Data from
    these sensors were used as reference temperature measurements for the scaling
    algorithm (described below). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Experimental
    field layout; plots designated with the letter “M” indicate manual irrigation
    scheduling using weekly readings from a neutron probe, and those with a “C” indicate
    irrigation scheduling using the plant feedback algorithm (iCWSI) for (a) 2012
    and (b) 2013. In 2013, wireless multiband radiometers were used in lieu of simple
    IRTs. The sensor housing measured 23.0 cm in length and was 6.5 cm in diameter.
    The MBRs contained three filter/detectors with bands in the visible range, red
    (685 ± 35 nm), blue (450 ± 40 nm), and green (560 ± 10 nm) range; one filter/detector
    with a band in the near infrared (NIR) (880 ± 50 nm) range; and the infrared temperature
    sensor (Melexis). The white PVC housing for the photodiode detectors was designed
    to collimate light onto each detector/filter (Intor, model T-5, Soccoro, NM).
    The MBRs were developed by ARS scientists at the CPRL in Bushland, TX. The MBR
    footprint was a circular pattern with a FOV determined to be 28°. These sensors
    were mounted as described for the simple IRTs used in 2012. Reflectance measurements
    from visible bands within the MBR were individually calibrated against red, blue,
    and green (5 cm × 5 cm) samples in a color chart (Edmund Optics, Barrington, NJ)
    in full sunlight and then cross-calibrated against a reference sensor over larger
    colored targets. During the individual calibrations, each MBR was positioned in
    a nadir view over the color sample of interest. The readings were taken in full
    sunlight to enable us to determine the maximum response of each band, while the
    minimum response was determined by capping the sensors with an opaque cover. This
    procedure provided a qualitative means to determine if the photodiode detectors
    were responding appropriately. The cross-calibration procedure required simultaneous
    reflectance measurements of multiple sensors over large (2 m × 2 m) color targets
    (red, blue and green). These targets were made of plywood and spray-painted to
    achieve an even coat of color. One of the eight MBRs was chosen as a reference
    sensor and was always included during batch measurements with the other MBRs.
    During the batch measurements, the MBRs were placed in a nadir-looking view over
    the large target, and measurements were made over daylight hours. A band-to-band
    cross-calibration was made between each photodiode detector of a MBR and the corresponding
    photodiode detector of the reference MBR. Coefficients from the resulting linear
    regression equations were used to establish custom calibration equations for each
    photodiode detector of each MBR. Coefficients were entered into the base station.
    Even with these calibrations, it was expected that reflectance readings from the
    MBRs would vary due to differences at the circuit board level, height above the
    canopy, and variations in the viewing angle from manually adjusting and aiming
    the MBRs. Prior to deploying the sensors on the pivot lateral, continuous reflectance
    measurements were then made over dry and wet soil (Pullman clay loam) and green
    vegetation-grass fetch at the CPRL weather pen and winter wheat planted on the
    laboratory. The grass represented an example of a pixel that was comprised nearly
    of 100% vegetation, the winter wheat samples represented pixels that were of mixed
    percent vegetation and soil. A customized metal stand was built to accommodate
    six MBRs. An algorithm was used to qualify the thermal data as being relevant
    to either plants or some mixture of soil and plants in the viewing area. The algorithm
    was based on a normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) (Rouse et al., 1974)
    calculated with reflectance measurements taken from the NIR and red bands (ρNIR
    − ρred)/(ρNIR + ρred) and concomitant with the reading of the thermal band. Thermal
    measurements recorded in conjunction with NDVI values less than 0.25 were not
    used to calculate the iCWSI. Radiometric instruments capturing mixed pixels of
    vegetation and soil are a common problem in agricultural applications. Jiang et
    al. (2006) demonstrated that NDVI over partially vegetated surfaces were non-linear
    and that NDVI calculated at different resolutions were not comparable. Additionally,
    the detection of water stress and disease using thermal images can be confounded
    with pixels containing a mixture of soil and vegetation (Jones and Sirault, 2014).
    When canopy temperature is used for irrigation scheduling, temperatures resulting
    from pixels comprised mainly of soil can result in false positive triggers and
    over-irrigation in the long run. After the analyses of NDVI from multiple measurements
    over grass, wheat and soil, we determined that at NDVI values <0.25 there was
    enough soil background to make the temperature data unrepresentative of the plant
    water status. Data from the wireless IRTs and MBRs were sampled every 5 s, averaged
    and stored every minute, and transmitted ad hoc every 5 min to the base station.
    Meteorological data (wind speed, relative humidity, air temperature and solar
    irradiance) were sampled every 5 s, and averaged and stored every minute to the
    weather station''s datalogger (CR1000, Campbell Scientific, Logan, Utah). Weather
    station data were polled hourly by the base station using radio telemetry in the
    900 MHz bandwidth. 2.5. Treatment plots and irrigation scheduling Treatments consisted
    of three irrigation levels and two irrigation-scheduling methods, replicated four
    times. The irrigation treatment amounts were 75%, 50%, and 25% of full as defined
    by either replenishment of crop water use to field capacity or by the equivalent
    threshold for the IRT sensed crop water stress. One-half of the center pivot field
    was cropped and divided into seven radial sectors of 24° each, and four concentric
    plots, and inside and outside borders for well-watered cotton. Treatment plots
    were arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications (Fig.
    2). The width of each plot was 18 m (defined by two irrigation zones), and consisted
    of 24 plant rows. Access tubes were placed in a row in the center of each plot
    (24 rows wide). The pivot scanned the field on even days of the year (DOY). On
    odd DOY, a prescription map was automatically coded from canopy temperature and
    meteorological data for the plant feedback-control plots (designated with a “C”
    for CWSI), and from user input for the manual-control plots (designated with an
    “M”) (Fig. 2). Plots were irrigated on odd DOY as instructed by the updated prescription
    map. The maximum application depth of the irrigation system was fixed at 20 mm
    by setting the pivot travel speed at the end tower to 43.8 m h−1 (19° h−1). Treatment
    plots designated I0 were quasi-dryland established to compute IWUE. These plots
    did not receive irrigation past the establishment of a uniform plant stand. 2.5.1.
    Manual method Manual irrigations were scheduled weekly and carried out over 2
    or 3 days as needed in a 7-day period and based on 75%, 50%, and 25%, (designated
    I75M, I50M, and I25M, respectively) replenishment of crop water use to field capacity
    in the top 1.5 m of soil. Soil water content was determined weekly using a neutron
    probe (NP) (model 503DR1.5, Instrotek, Campbell Pacific Nuclear, Martinez, Cal.)
    in 0.2 m increments from 0.10 m to 2.3 m (center of measurement) in the I75M treatment
    plots. The neutron probe was field calibrated to accuracy of better than 0.01
    m3 m−3, resulting in separate calibrations for three distinct soil layers, Ap,
    Bt and Btca, using methods described by Evett (2008). Any precipitation occurring
    prior to irrigation of the total amount for the week was subtracted from the required
    total. 2.5.2. Plant feedback method Infrared thermometers located on the pivot
    lateral recorded temperature measurements of crop canopy as the pivot moved across
    the field. Therefore, canopy temperature measurements were recorded from different
    parts of the field at different times of the day. By using the temperature-scaling
    algorithm developed by Peters and Evett (2004), temperature measurements comparable
    in time were estimated for each portion of the field over daylight hours. In doing
    so, stress indices developed from canopy temperature measurements could be compared
    across different parts of the field for the same time of day. The scaling algorithm
    uses a one-time-of-day temperature reading taken during daylight hours, and scales
    it to a known reference temperature curve (taken from measurements made with stationary
    IRTs located in the field over well-watered plants, Fig. 2) and a measured early
    morning temperature: (2.1) where Te (°C) was the predawn canopy temperature; Tref
    (°C) was the reference canopy temperature at the same time interval as Ts (°C);
    Trmt,t was the one-time-of-day canopy temperature measurement at the plot (remote
    location, denoted by subscript rmt) at any daylight time t measured by the IRTs
    on the pivot lateral; and Tref,t (°C) was the measured reference temperature for
    the time t that the plot (remote) temperature measurement was taken. The integrated
    CWSI (iCWSI) thresholds were calculated for every minute, t, and averaged over
    each treatment plot between the hours of 9:00 am and 7:00 pm (inclusive), using
    a theoretical CWSI (Jackson et al., 1981): (2.2) (2.3) (2.4) (2.5) where dT was
    the difference between measured canopy (Tc) and air temperature (Ta), dTll was
    the estimated lower limit for a well-watered crop and assumes that bulk canopy
    resistance (rc) = 0, while dTul was the estimated upper limit for a non-transpiring
    crop and assumes that rc approaches infinity. Net radiation, Rn (MJ m−2 d−1),
    was estimated as the difference between incoming net shortwave and outgoing net
    longwave radiation using equations 38, 39, and 40 in FAO-56; albedo (α) = 0.23;
    G = soil heat flux (MJ m−2 d−1) was estimated using equation 45 from FAO-56; ρ
    (kg m−3) was the density of air approximated as a function of air temperature,
    ρ; Cp = specific heat capacity of dry air (1013 J kg−1 °C−1); and ra was aerodynamic
    resistance (Eq. (2.6)) (FAO-56). The psychrometric constant, γ (Pa °C−1) was calculated
    as a function of Cp, ρ, and latent heat of vaporization; Δ was the derivative
    of the saturated vapor pressure-temperature relationship calculated at the average
    of canopy and air temperature expressed in °C (as in Jackson et al., 1988); es
    was saturated vapor pressure, ea was actual vapor pressure, and ra = aerodynamic
    resistance (s m−1). (2.6) where zm = height of wind measurements (m); zom = roughness
    length (m) for momentum transfer, approximated by 0.123 × crop height; zh = height
    of humidity measurements (m); d = zero plane displacement height (m), approximated
    by 2/3 × crop height; zoh = roughness length governing transfer of heat and vapor
    (m), approximated by 0.1 × zom; k = von Karman’s constant = 0.41; and uz = wind
    speed (m s−1). Three threshold values (thresholdi), where i є (75%, 50%, and 25%),
    were established at 260, 290, and 344 (dimensionless) for the plant feedback treatment
    plots, I75C, I50C, and I25C, respectively. Thresholds were based on previous data
    measured over differentially irrigated cotton at the CPRL in 2007 and 2008 (O’shaughnessy
    and Evett, 2010). By varying the stress index thresholds, differential levels
    of irrigation could be achieved, i.e., treatment plots with the higher thresholds
    would receive irrigation signals less frequently than those plots with lower thresholds
    as demonstrated by Evett et al., 1996, Evett et al., 2000, Evett et al., 2002,
    Evett et al., 2006. 2.5.3. Prescription maps For manually irrigated plots, the
    amount of irrigation to replenish 100% of crop water use to field capacity was
    entered using the graphical user interface (Fig. 3). User input at this level
    was provided to satisfy the objective of comparing plant feedback and manual control
    methods of irrigation scheduling. Irrigation amounts delivered to the manual designated
    plots were achieved by pulsing the appropriate sprinkler banks at rates that were
    equivalent to 75%, 50%, and 25% of the entered application depth. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Graphical user interface constructed to deliver the appropriate
    irrigations depths to manual control plots (based on entered data) and to plots
    controlled by the plant feedback method when thresholds were exceeded. The interface
    enables the generation of the prescription map, its uploading to the pivot control
    panel, and the start of an irrigation. For each plant feedback-controlled plot,
    p, a mean daily iCWSIp was calculated after midnight for daylight hours from the
    preceding 24 h period. Mean values for each treatment plot were calculated from
    approximately 85 temperature readings. If the iCWSIp was greater than the assigned
    thresholdi, an application of 20 mm [2 days (frequency of pivot rotation across
    the cropped field) × peak daily crop water use (10 mm)] was delivered to plot,
    p. Plant feedback control-plots generating an irrigation signal were irrigated
    by sprinkler banks delivering water at a rate of 100% (i.e., always “on”) of 20
    mm. When the “generate prescription” button was pressed, watering rates for each
    of the 28 treatment plots were converted into code that was compatible with the
    commercial VRI system (Fig. 3). Treatment plot boundaries were static and defined
    by sectors and sprinkler irrigation zones. A visual prescription map, coded in
    extensible markup language (XML), could be reviewed using commercial software
    provided by the pivot manufacturer prior to uploading the map to the control panel.
    The user could view the prescription map, but could not easily modify the instructions.
    The prescription map was uploaded to the pivot control panel after pressing the
    “send prescription to panel” button, and irrigations were activated using the
    “start irrigation” button. The direction and speed of the pivot, its angular location,
    and water pressure were recorded at one-minute intervals using software previously
    developed by the USDA-Agricultural Research Service (ARS). All code was written
    in visual basic using Microsoft Visual Studio 20101 (version 10.0.4). 2.6. Agronomic
    practices and biophysical measurements Each season, trust (a.i., trifluralin)
    was sprayed as a pre-emergent herbicide at a rate of 2.41 L ha−1 prior to planting.
    In 2012, fertilizers, N and P, were applied at a rate of 68 kg N ha−1, and 37
    kg P ha−1. In 2013, only N was required and applied at a rate of 150 kg N ha−1.
    Preplant irrigation totaled 127 and 107 mm in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Cotton
    was planted later in 2013 due to cool springtime temperatures. Plant height and
    width measurements were recorded every two weeks, and digital images were taken
    of each plot with a RGB digital camera (IS-1, Fuji, Edison, NJ) on a weekly basis
    from late June through the first week of August for both years. Percent canopy
    cover was determined using Multispec ver 3.3, Multispectral Image Data Analysis
    System software (Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN). The supervised classification
    was performed in a manner similar to that described by Colaizzi et al. (2010).
    Bolls were harvested by hand on DOY 303-305 in 2012, and on DOY 299 and 300 in
    2013. 2.7. Sampling methods and calculations Plant sampling, height and width
    measurements were recorded approximately every two weeks from three subsamples
    in each of the 28 treatment plots. Bolls were harvested by hand from a 10 m2 area
    near the middle of each plot and stored in cotton bags inside of a drying facility
    for three months. A 500 g subsample of cotton from each plot was ginned at the
    Texas AgriLife Gin in Lubbock, TX. 2.7.1. ET, WUE, and IWUE Water use or ET was
    calculated using the soil water balance equation: ET = P + I + F − ΔS − R (2.7)
    where ET is evapotranspiration, ΔS is the change in soil water stored in the profile,
    R is runoff, P is precipitation (mm), I is the irrigation water applied (mm),
    and F is flux across the lower boundary of the control volume (taken as positive
    when entering the control volume), all in units of mm. Water use efficiency (kg
    m−3) was calculated as; (2.8) where Yg is the economic yield (g m−2 of lint),
    and ET is the crop water use (mm). Irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE, kg m−3)
    was calculated as; (2.9) where Yg is the economic yield (g m−2), Ygd is the average
    dryland yield (g m−2), and IRR is the irrigation water applied (mm), Howell (2002).
    2.7.2. Statistical analysis Results were analyzed using mixed models in the PROC
    MIXED models procedures (Littell et al., 2006) with SAS statistical software1
    (SAS 9.3, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The main factors of irrigation scheduling
    method (plant feedback and manual) and irrigation levels (75%, 50%, and 25%) were
    treated as fixed effects. Concentric plots were considered random effects, and
    their contributions to variability could signal erraticism among sensor measurements.
    Differences between means were tested using least square means. Comparisons of
    multiple means were performed using the Tukey–Kramer method and considered to
    be significant at the p < 0.05 level. Statistical results were analyzed for individual
    seasons. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Weather conditions Drought conditions
    prevailed during both growing seasons (May–October) at Bushland, with precipitation
    totaling only 31% and 38% of the 20-year historical mean of 377 mm for Bushland
    (Howell et al., 2004) (Table 1). In 2012, ninety percent of rainfall received
    in September occurred at the end of the boll-filling stage. In 2013, rainfall
    from May through August was approximately three times that of 2012, and minimal
    rainfall occurred in September. For both seasons, maximum daily air temperatures
    were greatest June through August, and ETo was largest in June. Early in the growing
    season, mean wind speeds in 2013 were greater than in 2012. Table 1. Climatological

    and irrigation amounts Dynamic prescription maps directed irrigation control for
    each of the 28 treatment plots during these two growing seasons. As an example,
    a map of calculated iCWSI values for each treatment plot is shown for DOY 221
    (Fig. 4a). Treatment plots (1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25) where the calculated
    iCWSI exceeded pre-established thresholds are shown in red. The ensuing application
    depth (shown in green; Fig. 4b) for these plots was 100% of 20 mm. The calculated
    iCWSI for plots 7 and 21 were less than the pre-established threshold and are
    shown as white polygons with a watering rate of 0% and application depth of 0
    mm (Fig. 4b). The iCWSI was also calculated for manual-control plots (shown in
    blue; Fig. 4a.), but not used for irrigation scheduling. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Examples of field treatment effects and treatment implementation
    illustrated, respectively, by: (a) integrated crop water stress index values (iCWSI)
    calculated from field scan on DOY 221. Those plots within sectors 60–228° under
    plant feedback control receiving an irrigation signal are hatched. The iCWSI values
    exceeded pre-established threshold values; and (b) resulting prescription map
    built on DOY 221. Watering rates are color coded-treatment plots (southeast half
    of the field) controlled by the plant feedback system that received an irrigation
    signal (hatched plots) show a prescribed watering rate of 100% of the depth applied
    (19 mm), automatic plots that did not receive a signal are shown in white and
    will not be irrigated. I75% manual plots (shown in blue) will receive 75% of the
    applied depth, I50% manual plots shown in pink will receive 50% of the applied
    depth, and I25% manual plots (shown in peach) will receive 25% of the applied
    depth. The northwest side of the field will not irrigate because ARS software
    code turns the water off prior to crossing the pivot road at 58°. (For interpretation
    of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
    web version of this article.) In 2012, differential irrigation treatment amounts
    (75%, 50% and 25% of 20 mm) were applied on June 19 (DOY 171) and June 20 (172)
    to the I75M and I75C, I50M and I50C, and I25M and I25C treatment plots, respectively,
    by use of the “all plots” button (Fig. 3). Plant feedback irrigation scheduling
    was initiated on June 27, 2012 (DOY 183). Irrigations continued through September
    3, 2012 (DOY 247). In 2013, irrigation treatments were started on July 12, 2013
    (DOY 193), using the “all plots” button. However, 51 mm of precipitation occurred
    between DOY 194 and 199. Differential irrigation treatment amounts (as described
    for 2012) were applied on DOY 205 and DOY 209, and the plant feedback system was
    initiated on DOY 211. In 2012, the mean post-plant irrigation applied at the I75
    level was similar between the plant feedback-control plots and the manual treatment
    plots. In the I50 and I25 treatments, mean post-plant irrigation amounts for the
    plant feedback-control plots were significantly greater, 15% and 120%, respectively,
    than the amounts applied to the corresponding manual-control plots (Table 2).
    At the start of the irrigation season, soil water content was variable among treatment
    plots. For plots, there was evidence of soil water storage at the depths of 30-
    through 110-cm, but no evidence of deep percolation (Fig. A.1, Appendix). No post
    plant irrigation was applied to treatment plots at the I0 treatment level, as
    antecedent soil water content was enough to establish a uniform plant stand in
    these plots. Table 2. Post-plant irrigations for the 2012 and 2013 growing seasons
    as directed by the dynamic prescription maps. Amounts followed by the same letter
    are not significantly different at p = 0.05. Empty Cell 2012 2013 Irrigation level

    plots was similar to the amount applied to the manual-control plots in the I75
    treatment level. In the more deficit-irrigated treatments (I50 and I25), the mean
    irrigation amounts were 24% and 63% greater (significantly so) than manual control
    treatment plots for the respective irrigation treatment levels. However, there
    was no indication of deep percolation from soil water data or observations of
    run-off during the 2013 irrigation seasons (Fig. A.2, Appendix). A review of the
    multiband radiometer data indicated a general negative trend between concomitant
    NDVI calculations and canopy temperature measurements; i.e., temperature measurements
    were generally higher when NDVI was lower (see Fig. A.3, Appendix). Later in the
    irrigation season for the I25 level, leaf wilt occurred due to deficit irrigation;
    this is evidenced by lower mean NDVI values in the I25 treatments for both the
    manual and plant feedback-control plots (Fig. A.4, Appendix). Plant feedback irrigation
    signals in the I25C treatment plots were more frequent early in the 2012 growing
    season as compared to the 2013 season. The mean percent canopy cover for the I25C
    treatment plots was estimated to be 18% from analysis of digital images taken
    on DOY 181 (2012), while in 2013 mean percent canopy cover in the I25C plots was
    49% at the start of plant feedback irrigation scheduling (determined from digital
    images taken on DOY 210). 3.3. Yield, WUE, and IWUE Plant counts were recorded
    during the hand-sampled harvest (Table 3). In 2012, plant counts were similar
    when compared between irrigation methods, irrigation levels, and between irrigation
    method × irrigation treatment levels. During the 2013 season, plants harvested
    in the I0 treatment level were significantly less than those plots receiving irrigation.
    Mean plant numbers in the I25 level were significantly greater for the plant feedback-control
    plots as compared with the manual-control plots. This was likely due to the differences
    in irrigation amounts applied between the two treatment application methods. Although
    planted at the same rate, plant counts were different between years. Cotton seed
    planted in 2013 was from bags purchased in 2012. The age of the seed could have
    contributed to the difference in final plant counts as could the seasonal variability
    in environmental factors between years. Table 3. Cotton response to manual (designated
    with M) and plant feedback (designated with C) methods of irrigation scheduling,

    different. Data were analyzed separately by year. Growing season 2012 Category

    0.05a In 2012, overall mean lint yields (129.07 and 111.81 g m−2) and mean ETc
    (502 and 464 mm) were significantly greater in the plant feedback-control plots
    as compared with the manual-control plots, respectively (Table 3). Irrigation
    treatment levels had a significant effect on lint yield and ETc. The highest amounts
    (181.75 g m−2 and 651 mm) occurred in the I75 treatment level and the lowest (27.91
    g m−2 and 252 mm) in the I0 treatment level. Lint yield, ETc, and WUE were significantly
    reduced in the I0 treatment due to the lack of irrigation, which decreased transpiration
    and fruit production. The mean boll number per plant in the irrigated plots was
    3–4, while for the I0 treatment, the mean boll number per plant was 1 (Table A.2,
    Appendix). The low lint yields were expected since cotton yield is dependent on
    the number of bolls produced and the preservation of bolls to maturity, either
    of which can decline from water stress (McMichael and Hesketh, 1982, Yazar et
    al., 2002, Pettigrew, 2004, Ritchie et al., 2009). Water stress can also cause
    an increase in the shedding rate of squares and young bolls as well as limit canopy
    growth (Gerik et al., 1996, Cetin and Bilgel, 2002) and leaf area (Dăgdelen et
    al., 2009). Water use efficiency and IWUE were not dependent on methods or irrigation
    treatment levels. These results of WUE (0.24–0.29 kg m−3) and IWUE (0.32–0.43
    kg m−3) (Table 3) were higher than WUE (0.13–0.17 kg m−3) and IWUE (0.11–0.20
    kg m−3) reported by Colaizzi et al. (2009) where irrigation treatment levels of
    100%, 75%, 50%, 25% and 0% were applied to a short season upland cultivar of cotton
    using low energy precision application (LEPA). However, WUE (0.20–0.29 kg m−3)
    and IWUE (0.31–0.47 kg m−3) were similar to those demonstrated by O’Shaughnessy
    and Evett (2010) for irrigation treatment levels of 100%, 67%, 33% and 0% applied
    to cotton using LEPA. Comparing crop response between methods within each irrigation
    treatment, lint yields at the I75 level were similar between the plant feedback-control
    and the manual treatment plots, even though ETc was significantly less for the
    plant feedback method (626 mm) as compared with the manual method (677 mm). Variations
    in ETc may be due to differences in the amounts and frequencies of irrigation
    by method (manual and plant feedback). When the plant feedback plots received
    irrigation signals, the applied amount was 20 mm, but the amounts for the manual-control
    plots were typically between 13 and 15 mm. After DOY 192, the frequency of irrigation
    signals for the plant feedback-control plots occurred approximately every 3–4
    days, while irrigations were applied every other day to the manual-control plots
    to replenish 75% soil water depletion to field capacity within the seven-day target
    period. Comparing results between methods at the I50 irrigation treatment level,
    mean lint yields (164.2 ± 17 and 146.1 ± 17 g m−2), mean ETc (580 ± 26 and 542
    ± 17 mm) and mean WUE (0.27 ± 0.04 and 0.28 ± 0.02 kg m−3) for the plant feedback
    and manual irrigation treatment plots, respectively, were similar. The relationship
    between lint yield and crop evapotranspiration (ETc) was linear for both the manual-
    (Yield = 0.36 × ETc − 53.4, r2 = 0.95) and plant feedback-control methods (Yield
    = 0.41 × ETc − 75.3, r2 = 0.96). At the I25 treatment level, lint yield (141.8
    ± 15.1 and 92.2 ± 14.4 g m−2) and ETc (551 ± 28 and 387 ± 14 mm) were significantly
    greater for the plant feedback method as compared with the manual irrigation method.
    This difference can be attributed to higher irrigation quantities applied to the
    plant feedback-control plots (Table 2). Frequent irrigations were applied early
    in the irrigation season due to partial canopy cover which resulted in false positive
    irrigation signals. Towards the end of the irrigation season, the frequency of
    irrigation scheduling in these plots decreased. Mean lint yield (92.2 g m−2) and
    ETc (387 mm) in the I25M irrigation treatment plots were significantly reduced
    as compared with all other irrigated treatment plots (Table 3). There was no difference
    in the number of bolls among irrigated treatment plots. However, the average boll
    weight in the I25M plots was reduced by 51% and 35% as compared with mean boll
    weights for the I75M and I50M irrigation treatment levels, respectively (Table
    A.2, Appendix). Papastylianou and Argyrokastritis (2014) also reported that limited
    irrigation (50% of ETc) negatively influenced boll number and boll weight, decreasing
    boll number by 25% of the fully irrigated crop. In 2013, solenoid valves controlling
    zones 9 and 10 were mistakenly wired in reverse from the period of DOY 193–DOY
    217, after replacing failed valves. This resulted in differential irrigation amounts
    between zones 8 and 9 located within concentric plot 4 (Fig. 2b). Although, hand-samples
    were taken from both zones in each affected plot (4, 5, 12, 13, 20, 21 and 28),
    neutron access tubes were only located in zone 9. Because the focus of this study
    is to compare cotton response between the plant feedback- and manual-control methods,
    the ensuing analysis and discussion for 2013 data only contains the 21 plots (3
    replications) not impacted by this mishap. For lint yields compared by irrigation
    method in 2013, the overall mean lint yield and mean ETc (95.07 g m−2 and 441
    mm) in the plant feedback-control plots were significantly greater as compared
    with the manual-control plots (76.57 g m−2 and 411 mm) (Table 3). Again, these
    responses can be attributed to larger total irrigation amounts. Initial soil water
    content was again variable at the beginning of the irrigation season. Similar
    to 2012, overall mean WUE and IWUE were not dependent on the method of irrigation.
    Irrigation treatment level significantly affected mean lint yields between the
    I75 (109.6 g m−2) and I0 treatment level (28.9 g m−2). Again, mean lint yield
    in the I0 treatment level was significantly less compared with mean lint yields
    from all irrigation treatment levels. In this year, lint yields at the I75 and
    I50 treatment levels were similar. Mean ETc was significantly different between
    irrigation treatment levels and ranged from 535 mm in the I75 treatment to 294
    mm in the I0 treatment. Water use efficiency and IWUE were similar between the
    irrigated treatment plots (I75, I50 and I25); however, the minimal irrigation
    amount (80 mm) applied to the I0 treatment plots limited transpiration and fruit
    production, significantly reducing ETc and WUE as shown in 2012. Comparing multiple
    means of lint yield and ETc for each type of treatment plot (irrigation method
    × irrigation treatment level), means for the I25M treatment plots were significantly
    less. Limited irrigation likely affected boll production and transpiration in
    these treatment plots. The number of bolls per plant in the I25M treatment plot
    was significantly less compared with the number of bolls in the I75M and I75C
    treatment plots (Table A.2, Appendix), but boll weights were similar among these
    treatment plots. However, mean boll weight in the I25M treatment was less compared
    with the I50C and I25C treatment plots. When comparing crop response between irrigation
    methods at the same irrigation level, mean lint yields and mean ETc in the I75
    and I50 treatments were similar. In the I25 irrigation level, lint yield and ETc
    were significantly greater for the plant feedback-control treatment plots as compared
    with the manual-control treatment plots. Again, this was attributed to greater
    irrigation amounts scheduled by the plant feedback-control method. Mean WUE was
    not affected by the irrigation method × irrigation treatment interaction. Irrigation
    water use efficiency was significantly greater in the I25C treatment plots as
    compared with the I75M and I75C. The plant feedback method, which used iCWSI thresholds
    of 260 and 290 to schedule irrigations for the I75 and I50 treatment plots, respectively,
    was useful for indicating the need for irrigating cotton. Wanjura et al., 1992,
    Wanjura et al., 2004 also demonstrated successful automatic irrigation scheduling
    of cotton using continuous canopy and air temperature measurements for drip and
    center pivot irrigation systems, respectively. Our method was able to control
    irrigations to produce cotton lint yields at levels similar with the manually
    scheduled irrigations at the 75% and 50% irrigation treatment levels. Thus, the
    iCWSI method, which uses environmental parameters and canopy temperature to characterize
    the level of water stress, was sensitive to spatial and temporal soil water deficits
    that developed during the growing season. Many studies demonstrate the link between
    thermal stress indices and soil water deficits in the root zone (Ehrler, 1973,
    Lacape et al., 1998, Colaizzi et al., 2003a, Colaizzi et al., 2003b, Padhi et
    al., 2012). The mixed linear models for crop response (yield, ETc, WUE, IWUE)
    were fitted using the restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML). The models
    were fit with the main factors irrigation method and irrigation treatment level
    and their interaction as fixed effects. Concentric plot (block effect) was treated
    as a random effect. The variance was partitioned into components contributed by
    the blocking effect and residual error. The variability of crop response due to
    differences in the concentric plots were small, less than 3.1% and less than 0.5%
    of the total variance in 2012 and in 2013, respectively. However, the standard
    deviation for lint yield and ETc means within each irrigation treatment level
    were greater in the plant feedback control-plots. If the goals is reduce this
    variability, refinements to the hardware or software of the MBRs need to be made.
    Canopy architectural features and sun angle effects (Pinter et al., 1985) could
    influence the variability in spectral reflectance, since spectral reflectance
    measurements were made from sensors moving over the different plots during different
    times of the day. It is expected that variability could be reduced by making improvements
    to the thermal qualifying algorithm, such as adjusting the threshold value between
    soil and vegetation or by estimating crop canopy cover from additional MBRs placed
    on the pivot lateral with a nadir-looking view angle. Irrigation treatment amounts
    applied to the I25C plots were less than in 2012, but larger than expected. This
    suggests that changes could be made to the iCWSI threshold values, perhaps increasing
    the threshold value for the I25C treatment plots to reduce the excessive irrigation
    triggers. In a previous study where irrigation scheduling of cotton was controlled
    using a plant feedback method (O’Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010), similar results
    comparing plant feedback and manual irrigation methods were demonstrated for cotton
    grown in 2007 and 2008 at the CPRL. In these earlier years, yields for the greatest
    irrigation amount treatment (I100) scheduled by the plant feedback method resulted
    in similar or better yields than those from the manual method. In that study,
    irrigations for the plant feedback-control plots were based on the mean stress
    index exceeding the established threshold. The mean stress index was calculated
    from each of six automatic-control plots designated as I100. Irrigation control
    for the deficit treatments in that experiment (I67 and I33) were dependent on
    the mean signal from the 100% treatment plots. The deficit plots received 67%
    and 33% of 20 mm (twice the daily peak crop water use). This discussion is noteworthy,
    as it points out that under the more recent experimental design reported herein
    (cotton grown in 2012 and 2013), irrigation scheduling for each plot controlled
    by the plant feedback system was independent of every other plot, yet, mean yields
    grouped by irrigation treatments at the highest levels (I75 and I50) were similar
    regardless of irrigation scheduling method. 4. Summary and conclusions This study
    demonstrated that it was feasible to develop dynamic prescription maps to control
    site-specific variable rate irrigation of cotton. These dynamic instructions were
    derived from the plant feedback method using a temperature scaling algorithm and
    an integrated CWSI that evaluated water stress of specific plots on an individual
    basis, or were based on manual input of irrigation amounts for manual-control
    treatment plots using neutron probe readings. Remotely sensed information included
    geo-referenced surface radiometric temperature measurements and meteorological
    data. We were successful in automating the prescription map code that directed
    pivot irrigation control and the separate code that enabled a user to view the
    prescription map in a graphical format. The cotton plants were exposed to environmentally
    induced stresses and to differing levels of water stress during the two-year study,
    yet the plant feedback-control method was able to schedule irrigations that resulted
    in similar lint yields in both years in the higher irrigation treatments. Overall,
    these dynamic prescription maps were effective in addressing spatial and temporal
    crop water stress for the I75 and I50 treatment plots, i.e., plant feedback-control
    plots from these treatment levels were not grossly over- or under-irrigated. This
    demonstrates that plant feedback systems can provide site-specific irrigation
    control. System integration of a wireless sensor network and plant feedback algorithm
    as used in this study provides one possible framework for dynamic prescription
    map construction and seasonal irrigation control. The incorporation of additional
    sensor network systems such as soil water sensors could be useful in overcoming
    problems that might be caused by limitations in temporal frequency and cloudy
    days. Automatic irrigations in excess of manual amounts early in the irrigation
    season were likely due to false positive triggers resulting from temperature contributions
    from soil background viewed by the IRTs due to less canopy cover at the beginning
    of the irrigation season. However, excess irrigation during the latter parts of
    the season may be adjusted by increasing the stress threshold and refining the
    algorithm for the multiband sensors. Further research is required to maintain
    automatic deficit irrigation using canopy temperature data at a level equivalent
    to 25% replenishment of crop water use to field capacity. Acknowledgements The

    A. Soil water data Soil water data Mean soil water content graphs of each irrigation
    method × irrigation level are shown below for each irrigation season (Fig. A.1,
    Fig. A.2). The plots indicate that although irrigation amounts for the plant feedback
    control plots at the I50 and I25 were greater than the manual-control plots, the
    additional irrigation did not result in deep percolation. Soil water storage for
    all plots was mainly within the depths of 30–110 cm. No run-off was observed during
    the irrigation season. NDVI and canopy temperature data Time series plots of NDVI
    and canopy temperature for DOY 224 are shown for concentric plots 1 (Fig. A.3a)
    and 2 (Fig. A.3b). These arcwise plots include treatment plots 1, 8, 9, 16, 17,
    24 and 25; and 2, 7, 10, 15, 18, 23 and 26 as shown in Fig. 2b. The multiple spot
    calculations of NDVI and canopy temperature measurements are highly variable within
    each treatment plot. This is expected due to variability in plant height, and
    width (data not shown) within a single treatment plot and from plot to plot in
    the arcwise direction. Additionally, the sensors were pointed at a downward-looking
    oblique angle towards the canopy, therefore NDVI is not necessarily related to
    the amount of above-ground biomass, but rather is a function of the amount of
    vegetation within the field-of-view of the multiband instrument at the time of
    the spot measurement. The plots demonstrate a general trend of higher levels of
    surface temperature where NDVI values are relatively low, and conversely lower
    surface temperatures where NDVI values are high. Using calculated NDVI from a
    downward-oblique looking angle demonstrated that the average NDVI value for each
    treatment plot gradually increased from 0.12 on DOY 200 and peaked on DOY 230
    (crop was in the R-12 stage). Mean NDVI for the I75 treatment plots peaked at
    nearly 0.6, while the mean NDVI for the I0% peaked at 0.45. (Fig. A.4a and b).
    The NDVI-biomass relationship between NDVI calculated from multi-spectral sensors
    pointed at the canopy at oblique-downward looking angles with a constant adjustment
    of height above the canopy are expected to be less linear compared with NDVI calculated
    from a multi-spectral radiometer used to remotely assess biomass from a nadir-looking
    view. In the latter case, the radiometer is held at the same height above the
    ground for all sampling events. Also, a path is traversed in either a direction
    that is transect to plant rows or if in a parallel direction, measurements are
    made between rows to monitor the change in canopy cover (Gitelson, 2004, Hunsaker
    et al., 2005) into the furrow. From this graph, it is clear that NDVI values for
    the I0 and I25 irrigation treatments were less than treatments receiving more
    water throughout the season, Later in the irrigation season for the I25 level,
    leaf wilt occurred due to deficit irrigation; this is evidenced by lower mean
    NDVI values in the I25 treatments for both the manual and plant feedback-control
    plots. Number of bolls and boll weight Hand samples were harvested from a 10 m2
    area in each plot at the end of each season. The table below lists the mean number

  description: Accurate quantification of sensible (H) and latent (LE) heat fluxes
    are desperately crucial for agricultural irrigation strategy, drought monitoring,
    water resource management, and climate change. Regional-scale H and LE were derived
    generally from satellite remote sensing data using relevant modeling methods.
    However, one of the challenges of modeling methods is to deal with sub-pixel heterogeneity,
    because the model usually assumes homogeneous conditions within a pixel. In this
    study, a hybrid model, which coupled deep neural network (DNN) and the remote
    sensing-based two-source energy balance (TSEB) model, was developed to estimate
    H and LE at multiple spatial resolutions to further quantify the influence of
    pixel size on the modeled fluxes. First, the DNN-based land surface temperature
    (LST) estimation model was developed and validated. LST at multiple spatial resolutions
    (i.e., 1, 5, 10, 30, 100, and 1000 m) were generated by the DNN method using multi-source
    satellite data including the GaoFen-2 (GF-2, a Chinese high-resolution optical
    remote-sensing satellite), Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8 images, respectively. Then,
    the hybrid DNN-TSEB model was used to estimate H and LE at multi-pixel sizes.
    Finally, modeled H and LE at 1 ∼ 1000 m were validated by eddy covariance (EC)
    and optical-microwave scintillometer (OMS) flux observation. Results revealed
    that the DNN-based LST model was a potential approach to generate LST at multiple
    pixel sizes. The hybrid DNN-TSEB model can produce more accurate H and LE when
    different land cover types were discriminated over heterogeneous farmland (e.g.,
    the average bias for H and LE at a spatial resolution of 1 m were −9 and −6 W/m−2,
    respectively). Besides, the deviation of modeled fluxes from the observations
    increased as the spatial resolution became coarser, particularly the pixel size
    was greater than 30 m (average bias for H and LE were −34 and 30 W m−2, respectively).
    However, the magnitude of bias of fluxes estimates remained unchanged when the
    pixel sizes of satellite data were between 100 and 1000 m. The more important
    finding was that the hybrid model was a promising approach, which can obtain accurate
    estimates of H and LE at a high spatial resolution. In addition, the performance
    of the model based on GF-2 data was better than that based on Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8
    data. The results suggest that pixel heterogeneity should be considered when estimating
    H and LE over heterogeneous landscapes with various surface types.

  explanation: 'The extraction point is a critical component in the TSEB model for
    calculating the temperature related to canopy and soil, in this study, the derived
    Ts and Tc are used to calculate surface energy balance equation for the soil and
    canopy components of the composite land surface system. The initial Tc value in
    the TSEB model is set to the traditional Priestly-Taylor formula. Then, Ls and
    LEc are computed as a residual of the Eqs. 6-8.


    The innovation of our study is the construction of hybrid DNN-TSEB. DNN approach
    has a strong ability for non-linear fitting, feature extraction, and fault tolerance.
    DNN is used to establish a relationship between LST and NDVI and to achieve finer
    resolution LST in this experimental area. The DNN-based LST model not only considers
    the relationship between LST and NDVI but also ensures the theoretical foundation
    of the method. The predicted LST exhibited a good agreement with the measured
    LST (Fig. 6), with an RMSE value of 2.53 K and 3.81 K for DNN-Landsat-like and
    DNN-MODIS-like, respectively.'
  extract_1: In this study, a revised TSEB model (Kustas and Norman, 1999) was utilized
    to obtain surface heat and water vapor fluxes. The revised TSEB model partitions
    the composite surface radiometric temperature (Trad), i.e., LST, into soil (Ts)
    and canopy (Tc) component temperatures based on the fraction of vegetation cover
    (fc) observed by the sensor at an angle θ, using the Stefan Boltzmann law, which
    relates a blackbody temperature to radiance emission (Kustas and Norman, 1999,
    Norman et al., 1995). The derived Ts and Tc are used to calculate the surface
    energy balance equation for the soil and canopy components of the composite land
    surface system (Kustas et al., 2012).
  extract_2: 'The net radiation (Rn) from soil and vegetation i.e., Rns and Rnc are
    estimated by the algorithm proposed by Kustas and Norman (1999). The formulas
    are as follows: Rn= Rns + Rnc (6) Rns= (1 − αs)Rs↓ − εsσTs4 (7) Rnc= (1 − αc)Rc↓
    + εcσTc4 − G0 (8) where Rs↓ and Rc↓ is correspond to the incoming shortwave and
    longwave radiation from the sky (W/m−2); αs and αc is the albedo for vegetation
    and soil, respectively; εs and εc are the emissivity for vegetation and soil,
    respectively; σ is the Stefan Boltzmann constant of ∼0.06 kPa K−1; G0 is the surface
    soil heat flux (all in W/m−2). The G0 can be estimated as a fraction of Rns or
    Rn (i. e., or , where was the empirical coefficient and can be set to ∼0.1 according
    to Song et al., (2016b) concluded that G0 estimation agreed with observation when
    at satellite overpass time over the middle reach of HRB.'

    remote sensingPixel heterogeneity 1. Introduction The surface heat and water vapor
    flux (i.e., H and LE) are the nexus of the water cycle, energy balance, and carbon
    cycle (Fisher et al., 2016). The regional-scale H and LE are crucial to issues
    associated with climate change, hydrology processes, and water resources (Wang
    and Dickinson, 2012). The Heihe River Basin (HRB) is the endorheic basin of China.
    The midstream area of HBR are well-known agricultural areas, where water consumption
    is mainly from agricultural irrigation. Since 2000, the water resources in the
    whole HRB have been reallocated, but the imbalance between irrigation and ecological
    water consumption still occurred in the midstream area of HRB (Cheng et al., 2014,
    Li et al., 2018). Spatiotemporal continuous LE in farmland not only provides information
    on crop water consumption and demand but also is beneficial to improving water
    use efficiency. The remote sensing technology coupled with the two-source energy
    balance (TSEB) model offers great advances for estimating surface heat and water
    vapor flux over the heterogeneous surface (Kustas and Anderson, 2009). Since the
    TSEB model have a clear physical mechanism (Burchard-Levine et al., 2021, Kustas
    and Anderson, 2009), they are particularly suitable for applications at different
    spatial scales as they rely less on calibration parameters (Anderson et al., 2003).
    However, the TSEB model must involve the differences between aerodynamic and radiometric
    temperature (i.e., Land surface temperature, LST), which is very pronounced in
    the sparse vegetation surfaces in semi-arid and arid regions (Colaizzi et al.,
    2004). Regional-scale LST mainly depends on remote sensing thermal infrared data
    (Dominguez et al., 2011). Currently, most thermal infrared sensors have a spatial
    resolution between 100 and 1000 m. Under these pixel scales, LST within a pixel
    in which the surface is covered by different land cover types (e.g., soil and
    vegetation) is assumed to be one value. For heterogeneous surfaces, a single value
    of a pixel cannot represent the feature of the real surface. Therefore, scale
    issue has become a prominent problem in the estimation of surface fluxes using
    remote sensing data. The influence of scale on estimating regional fluxes is mainly
    manifested in pixel heterogeneity. Different land covers, vegetation, and surface
    properties all contribute to the sensor signal and the mass and energy exchange.
    As the spatial resolution decreased, the detailed information reflected by the
    higher spatial resolution remote sensing images was lost, resulting in a reduction
    in the pixel heterogeneity of the image (Zhang et al., 2018). For remote sensing
    data, pixel size is one of the main factors affecting spatial heterogeneity. Also,
    the research concluded that pixel heterogeneity greatly affected surface flux
    estimates (Moran et al., 1997, Nassar et al., 2020). Therefore, characterizing
    the value of the grid with a single pixel value becomes an issue, particularly
    on the heterogeneous surface. The deviation of the surface flux estimates caused
    by the spatial resolution of LST was larger than that of other surface characteristic
    parameters, e.g., vegetated variables (Lagouarde et al., 2013, Lagouarde et al.,
    2015, Whitley et al., 2017). At present, the potential best solution to this issue
    is to downscale the remote sensing-based inputs to reduce the uncertainty caused
    by the pixel heterogeneity (Burchard-Levine et al., 2021, Nassar et al., 2020,
    Ershadi et al., 2013, McCabe and Wood, 2006). As massive amounts of earth observation
    data have been collected and shared, machine learning (ML) can provide a more
    effective way to generate LST at multiple spatial resolutions through algorithms
    such as random forest (RF) (Dong et al., 2020), support vector machine (SVM) (Keramitsoglou
    et al., 2013) and artificial neural network (ANN) (Feng et al., 2020). However,
    ML algorithms rely too much on the samples, and there would be a large error in
    the scarcely observed region (Wang et al., 2022). Deep learning (DL) can break
    through some drawbacks of ML (LeCun et al., 2015). Over the past few decades,
    the DL method has been utilized for the retrieval of LST, the reconstruction of
    ill-conditioned problems of LST, and the estimation of LST at subpixel size (Jia
    et al., 2021, Wu et al., 2019b, Wu et al., 2019a, Zhang et al., 2018). Recently,
    Wang et al., (2021) proposed a novel approach for estimating LST at different
    spatial resolutions by combining remote sensing data, the physical model, and
    DL. Compared to the other methods of obtaining LST at the high spatial resolution,
    such as the disaggregation procedure for radiometric surface temperature (DisTrad)
    (Kustas et al., 2003), the thermal image sharpening (TsHarp) algorithm (Agam et
    al., 2007) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) (Wu et al., 2019b, Wu
    et al., 2019a), DL produced a lower deviation (Dong et al., 2020). Therefore,
    the DL approach has great potential in obtaining LST at finer spatial resolution.
    Research on regional-scale H and LE over the cropland in the midstream area of
    HRB mainly focuses on intercomparison between models (Wei et al., 2019), optimization
    of parameters in the model (Li et al., 2017, Song et al., 2016a, Song et al.,
    2016b) and up-scaling flux measurements from point to the satellite pixel scale
    (Liu et al., 2016). The standard deviation of surface evapotranspiration (i.e.,
    LE) over the heterogeneous surface increased gradually as the sensor resolution
    became coarser (Wang et al., 2016). Currently, available satellite data have a
    spatial resolution ranging from 10 to 1000 m, which may not allow the separation
    of spectral signals of major landscape features (e.g., crop and soil) in farmland,
    especially in the early stages of crop growth. Thus, this work focuses on pixel
    heterogeneity related to the accuracy of the estimated H and LE. To this end,
    H and LE at 1, 5, 10, 30, 100, and 1000 m spatial resolution were simulated by
    the hybrid model that combines the TSEB model and DNN using multi-source satellite
    data over heterogeneous irrigated farmland. This research was undertaken with
    the following objectives: (1) to develop the DNN-based LST estimation model and
    validate the transferability and applicability of the locally trained DNN model
    at different pixel sizes using Landsat-8 and MODIS data, (2) to obtain LST at
    multiple pixel resolutions based on GF-2, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8 data by the
    established the DNN model, respectively, (3) to build the hybrid DNN-TSEB model
    based on the TSEB and DNN method to estimate H and LE at multi-pixel sizes, (4)
    to evaluate the performance of the hybrid model using turbulent flux from EC and
    OMS systems, (5) to compare modeled H and LE estimates at multiple pixel sizes
    using GF-2, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data and quantify the influence of pixel
    heterogeneity on H and LE modeled by the hybrid model over a cropland field. The
    paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the study area
    and dataset. Section 3 describes the methodology including DNN and TSEB model,
    and hybrid DNN-TSEB model coupling DNN and TSEB. 4 Results, 5 Discussion list
    the results of surface heat and water vapor flux at multiple pixel sizes using
    different remote-sensing satellite data and present a discussion, respectively.
    Section 6 delivers our conclusions. 2. Study area and data 2.1. Study area This
    research was conducted at the farmland experimental site (38.855°N, 100.372°E)
    in the midstream area of Heihe River Basin (HRB) (Fig. 1(b)). The HRB is the second-largest
    inland river basin located in the arid and semiarid regions of northwest China.
    Farmland has important ecological and economic roles in the midstream of HRB.
    This study area is a typical irrigated crop ecosystem (Fig. 1(c)). Maize is the
    main crop that is planted in late April and harvested in late September of the
    current year. The precipitation in cropland was about 200 mm yr−1, while the annual
    evaporation was up to 570 mm (Li et al., 2018). Therefore, irrigation is the main
    source of water for crops. There are four rounds of irrigation (i.e., early June,
    early July, late July, and late August) from sowing to harvesting of maize. Download

    A comprehensive eco-hydrological experiment (Heihe Water Allied Telemetry Experimental
    Research, HiWATER) was carried out in the middle reaches of the HRB since 2012
    (Liu et al., 2016, Li et al., 2013). The Daman superstation (38.855°N, 100.372°E)
    was installed in this experiment region. Automatic weather station (AWS), and
    eddy covariance (EC) system (CSAT3 & LI7500, Campbell/LI-COR, USA) at a measurement
    height of 4.5 m within the experimental site were set up at the superstation since
    2012. A set of a combined optical (BLS450; Scintec, Germany) and microwave (RPG-MWSC-160;
    Radiometer Physics GmbH, Germany) scintillometer (OMS) system have been operated
    over oasis cropland with an effective height of 24.1 m and a path length of 1854
    m since 2019. 2.2. Data collection and processing The data used in this study
    mainly include the turbulent fluxes obtained by EC and OMS systems, meteorological
    data, and multi-source remote sensing data. The detailed descriptions of data
    processing are shown in the following sections. 2.2.1. Turbulent fluxes from eddy
    covariance system The 10 Hz raw EC data were processed by EddyPro software (Lincoln,
    Nebraska USA) to obtain 30-min periods averaged flux data, procedures including
    spike detection, sonic virtual temperature correction, coordinate rotation, Webb-Pearman-Leuning
    correction, and frequency response correction (Liu et al., 2011, Allen et al.,
    2011, Xu et al., 2013). The processed data was assessed for data quality using
    the flagging system with three different levels (0, 1, 2) (Mauder and Foken, 2015).
    For details on the processing steps, see Wang et al. (2015) and Xu et al. (2013).
    The data quality of level 0 is the best, and that of level 2 is the worst. The
    flux data of flags 0 and 1 were utilized in the following analysis. The average
    energy balance closure ratios (EBR) for EC flux were evaluated using the surface
    energy balance components: EBR = (H + LE)/(Rn − G0) (Foken et al., 2010). The
    EBR value was 0.89 at maize surface (Xu et al., 2017a). In this study, to evaluate
    the hybrid model performance, every 30-min turbulent fluxes from EC were implemented
    to achieve energy balance closure by the Bowen ratio approach (Twine et al., 2000).
    In this study, the two-dimensional Flux Footprint Prediction model proposed by
    Kljun et al. (2015) is implemented for estimating the source areas of EC measurements.
    The flux contribution of the selected total source area was set to 90 %, which
    was generally representative of the main surface types (Xu et al., 2017b). 2.2.2.
    Turbulent fluxes from optical-microwave scintillometer system The OMS system can
    provide both H and LE at the kilometer-scale. The 1000 Hz raw OMS data were reprocessed,
    including removal of outliers mainly spikes and dropouts as well as high-pass
    filtering; then, from the preprocessed data over 10-min intervals, the refractive
    index structure parameters are obtained by the log-intensity variances; and the
    structure parameters of temperature and humidity are derived by proper using of
    the current better Lüdi et al. (2005) method; finally, the H and LE are obtained
    using the current robust similarity coefficients of Kooijmans and Hartogensis
    (2016). The detailed procedure to obtain accurate turbulent fluxes from OMS measurements
    is referred to Xu et al. (2023). The OMS data processing procedure has also been
    reported by Zheng et al. (2023). Estimation of scintillometer footprint combines
    Kljun’s FFP model (Kljun et al., 2015) with the path weighting function (Meijninger
    et al., 2002). The larger spatial representativeness of the OMS provides an opportunity
    to validate estimates of H and LE at the kilometer scale (Fig. 1(b)). 2.2.3. Meteorological
    data The 10-min intervals wind speed (u) / direction (model Windsonic, Gill, UK),
    air temperature (Ta) and relative humidity (RH) sensors (model AV-10 T, Avalon,
    UK) were installed at heights of 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 m, respectively.
    The four-component radiometer (model PSP & PIR, Eppley, USA) was measured at 12
    m above ground level. Soil moisture (model CS616, Campbell, USA) and temperature
    (model AV-10 T, Avalon, UK) at 10-min intervals set up at depths of 0.02, 0.04,
    0.1, 0.20, 0.40, 0.80, 1.20, and 1.60 m, respectively. The rain gauge was installed
    at a height of 2.5 m on the west side of the station. The 10-min soil heat flux
    (G) was measured by soil heat flux plate (model HFP01SC, Hukseflux, Netherland)
    installed at a depth of 0.06 m. Surface soil heat flux (G0) was obtained by the
    one-dimensional equation of soil thermal diffusion combined with soil moisture
    and temperature at depths of 0.02 and 0.04 m (Xu et al., 2017a, Yang and Wang,
    2008). LST observations were calculated from upward and downward longwave radiation
    measured at AWS (Liang, 2004). The HiWATER experiment observatory network provides
    useful data through quality assessment and calibration (Xu et al., 2013, Liu et
    al., 2018). 2.2.4. Satellite remote sensing data One GaoFen-2 (GF-2) satellite
    image (August 18) and five Sentinel-2 hyperspectral images (May 30, June 29, July
    4, August 18, and September 12) on cloud-free days in 2020 were acquired. The
    GF-2 is the second satellite of High-definition Earth Observation System (HDEOS)
    promoted by China National Space Administration (CNSA). It is equipped with one
    1 m spatial resolution panchromatic and one 4 m spatial resolution multispectral
    camera within the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectrum (i.e., 0.45 and 0.9
    μm). GF-2 satellite realizes global observation within 69 days and repeats observations
    within 5 days (https://data.cresda.cn). Sentinel-2 satellite is developed by European
    Space Agency (ESA) that is designed for fine spatial resolution global monitoring.
    Sentinel-2 satellite constellation consists of two identical satellites (Sentinel-2A
    and Sentinel-2B) with each carrying a multispectral imager (MSI) sensor. The satellites
    provide multispectral data from visible (0.443 μm) to short wave infrared (2.19
    μm) bands with variable spatial resolution (10, 20, and 60 m, respectively). The
    wavelength of VNIR for GF-2 and Sentinel-2 sensors is approximately same, as shown
    in Table 1. Table 1. Spectral bands of VNIR for the GF-2 and Sentinel-2 sensors.
    Band Wavelength (μm) GF-2 Sentinel-2 Blue 0.450 ∼ 0.520 0.458 ∼ 0.523 Green 0.520
    ∼ 0.590 0.543 ∼ 0.578 Red 0.630 ∼ 0.690 0.650 ∼ 0.680 NIR 0.770 ∼ 0.890 0.785
    ∼ 0.900 Unfortunately, neither of the above satellite is equipped with thermal
    infrared sensors with the same spatial resolution as the VNIR spectrum. Therefore,
    Landsat-8 and MODIS images with the thermal band were utilized to validate the
    applicability of the locally trained DNN-based LST model. Ten Landsat-8 data of
    cloud-free days (January 30, March 2, March 18, May 51, August 9, August 25, September
    26, October 12, December 15, and December 30) in 2020 were acquired in this study
    area. Land surface products from MODIS were also applied including Normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI) (1 km, 16-Day) and LST (1 km, 8-Day) on January
    17, February 2, February 18, March 5, March 21, April 6, April 22, May 24, June
    9, June 25, July 11, July 27, August 11, August 28, September 29, October 15,
    and October 31 in 2020. The surface reflectance of VNIR spectral bands from GF-2,
    Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8 was derived by performing preprocessing, including radiation
    correction, atmospheric correction, and geometric rectification. NDVI was calculated
    by the reflectance of the near-infrared band (ρNIR) and the red band (ρR) as in
    Eq. (1). LST from Landsat-8 image was calculated by the improved split-window
    algorithm (Du et al., 2015). Leaf area index (LAI), canopy height (hc), and the
    fraction of vegetation coverage (fc) can be expressed as a function of NDVI through
    empirical relationships that have been commonly used (Choudhury, 1987, Choudhury
    et al., 1994), as follows, (1) (2) (3) (4) where ρNIR and ρR is correspond to
    the 8th (5th) and 4th (4th) bands of Sentinel-2 (GF-2), respectively. NDVImin
    and NDVImax are the minimum and maximum values of the NDVI in the experimental
    area; hmin and hmax are the minimum and maximum canopy heights of vegetation in
    the experimental area. 3. Methods 3.1. The two-source energy balance model 3.1.1.
    Description of the TSEB model The TSEB model has been proposed originally proposed
    by Norman et al. (1995). Subsequently, the TSEB model has undergone several refinements
    (Kustas and Norman, 1999, Kustas and Norman, 1999, Colaizzi et al., 2012a, Colaizzi
    et al., 2012b, Colaizzi et al., 2014). In this study, the revised TSEB model (Kustas
    and Norman, 1999) was utilized to obtain surface heat and water vapor fluxes.
    The revised TSEB model partitions the composite surface radiometric temperature
    (Trad), i.e., LST, into soil (Ts) and canopy (Tc) component temperatures based
    on the fraction of vegetation cover (fc) observed by the sensor at an angle θ,
    using the Stefan Boltzmann law, which relates a blackbody temperature to radiance
    emission (Kustas and Norman, 1999, Norman et al., 1995). The Trad at an angle
    θ can be expressed as: (5) where fc(θ) is the fraction of vegetation coverage
    observed at the view zenith angle (θ). Then, the derived Ts and Tc are used to
    calculate the surface energy balance equation for the soil and canopy components
    of the composite land surface system (Kustas et al., 2012). The net radiation
    (Rn) from soil and vegetation i.e., Rns and Rnc are estimated by the algorithm
    proposed by Kustas and Norman (1999). The formulas are as follows: (6) (7) (8)
    (9) where H and LE represent sensible and latent heat flux, and G0 is surface
    soil heat flux (all in W/m−2); the subscripts s and c represent the soil and canopy
    surface, respectively. and are the longwave and shortwave radiation transmittances
    through the canopy, respectively; and are the incoming shortwave and longwave
    radiation from the sky (W/m−2); and are the emissivity for vegetation and soil,
    respectively; and are the albedo for vegetation and soil, respectively. The G0
    can be estimated as a fraction of Rns or Rn (i. e., or , where was the empirical
    coefficient. Song et al., (2016b) concluded that G0 estimation agreed with observation
    when at satellite overpass time over the middle reach of HRB. Thus, was taken
    as 0.3 in the farmland area in this study. The H can be calculated by permitting
    the interaction between soil and vegetation (Norman et al., 1995), it can be expressed
    as: (10) (11) (12) where is the air density (kg m−3); Cp is the specific heat
    of air (J kg−1 K−1); Tac is the temperature in the canopy-air space (K); Ts and
    Tc are soil and vegetation canopy temperature (K), respectively; ra is the bulk
    aerodynamic resistance (s/m); the term rx is the boundary layer resistance associated
    canopy (s/m); rs is the resistance to heat flow in the boundary layer directly
    above the soil surface (s/m). The ra is computed from the aerodynamic resistance
    ( ) (s/m), while can be affected by several factors, such as the height and distribution
    of rough surface elements (i.e., vegetation height and structure, etc.), wind
    direction and atmospheric stability, and so on (Kustas and Norman, 1999). The
    formula (Norman et al., 1995) has undergone several refinements (Kustas and Norman,
    1999, Brutsaert, 1999, Li et al., 2005) and was formally proposed, the corresponding
    calculation expression as follows, (13) where d0 is zero plane displacement; k
    is the von Karman constant (∼0.41); zu and zT are the observed heights of u and
    Ta; L is the length of Monin-Obukhov; Ψm and Ψh are the diabatic correction factors
    for momentum and heat; z0m and z0h represent aerodynamic roughness length for
    momentum and heat transport (Brutsaert, 1982). The rs is generally determined
    on the basis of certain empirical analyses. Sauer et al. (1995) made an in-depth
    statistical analysis based on measured data in the corn field and set up an estimation
    formula after some simplification. After that, Kustas and Norman (1999) appropriately
    optimized this model to better meet the relevant application requirements. The
    corresponding expression is, (14) where us is wind speed near soil surface (m/s);
    b (−) and c (m/s K−1/3) are soil resistance coefficients, respectively. In this
    study area, the values for b and c are 0.012 and 0.0025 (Feng et al., 2023), respectively.
    The rx can be determined as: (15) where C’ is the adjustment parameter of the
    model and can be set to 90 s0.5 m−1; LAI is the leaf area index; S represents
    the size of the plant leaf; is the wind speed at the height of d0 + z0m. The most
    important issue for the TSEB model is to determine the temperature related to
    canopy and soil temperature (Kustas and Anderson, 2009). The initial Tc in the
    TSEB model is based on the Priestly-Taylor formula (Priestley and Taylor, 1972)
    and parallel resistance formulations (Norman et al., 1995) (16) where Tci is the
    initial estimate of Tc, and Ta is the air temperature at the reference height.
    rAH is the aerodynamic resistance to turbulent heat transport between the canopy
    source height and the reference height (W/m−2); fg is the fraction of green vegetation
    which can transpire; is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure versus air
    temperature curve (kPa K−1), the calculation of rAH, fg and can be found in Norman
    et al. (1995). is the psychrometric constant of ∼0.06 kPa K−1. The initial value
    of is set to ∼1.26 (Priestley and Taylor, 1972). Then, Ts can be calculated by
    the formula (5). Thus, LEs and LEc are computed as a residual of the Eqs. (6),
    (7), and then H and LE can be determined by the Eqs. (17), (18), as follows: (17)
    (18) 3.1.2. Input variables of the TSEB model The inputs of TSEB include meteorological
    data (wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, and
    incoming shortwave and longwave radiation), vegetation biophysical variables,
    and LST. Meteorological data can be obtained from AWS. Vegetation biophysical
    variables include LAI, fc, and hc. The formula of LAI, fc, and hc can refer to
    Section 2.2. To investigate and quantify the influence of pixel heterogeneity
    on modeled H and LE, land surface variables (NDVI, LAI, fc, and hc) at 1 m derived
    from GF-2 images were resampled by the Nearest method to 5, 10, 30, 100, 1000
    m spatial resolution and land surface variables (with a spatial of 10 m) derived-Sentinel-2
    data were resampled to 30, 100 and 1000 m by the same method. Numerous studies
    have applied thermal sharpening algorithms to obtain LST at high spatial resolutions
    (Burchard-Levine et al., 2021, Guzinski et al., 2020, Ma et al., 2018). A deep
    neural network (DNN) was used to generate LST at different resolutions to better
    achieve the separation of the thermal signal between different land surface types
    in cropland in this study. The DNN method and the generating process of LST at
    different spatial resolutions was shown in 3.2 Deep neural network, 3.3 The retrieval
    of LST by DNN, 3.4 The aggregation of LST by DNN. 3.2. Deep neural network DNN
    is based on special architectures of artificial neural networks. A typical DNN
    consists of the input layer, multiple hidden layers, and the output layer (Hinton
    and Salakhutdinov, 2006). The layers of DNN are fully connected, i.e., any neuron
    in layer i is connected to any neuron in layer i + 1. The DNN algorithm has a
    strong ability for non-linear fitting, feature extraction, and fault tolerance
    (LeCun et al., 2015). The hyperparameters, including transfer function, loss function,
    optimizer, and learning rate, are critical to the output of the DNN. The transfer
    functions of the input layer, the hidden layers, and the output layer were Sigmoid,
    Sigmoid, and Purelin in this study, respectively. The mean squared error function
    was chosen as the loss function to examine the error between the predicted and
    observed values. Adam Optimizer as the method of parameter updating. The Matlab
    software was utilized to build the DNN model, in which the learning rate was 0.001.
    A small number of samples can lead to overfitting in deep learning. Thus, regularization
    constraint (Benning and Burger, 2018) was applied to reduce the overfitting of
    deep learning in this study. In the process of regularization constraint, the
    Bayesian dropout (Ghahramani, 2015) was added to the layer parameter to prevent
    overweighting of the network thus reducing the overfitting problem. 3.3. The retrieval
    of LST by DNN Assuming a certain mapping relationship between NDVI and LST (Kustas
    et al., 2012) and that this relationship is well captured by machine learning
    (Dong et al., 2020). In this study, the DNN has been applied to establish a relationship
    between LST and NDVI to achieve finer resolution LST in this experimental area.
    For the DNN training, the observations (LST and NDVI calculated from measured
    FVC) since 2012 were used to establish the net model. The 976 valid training samples
    were selected in this study. The training structure of the DNN model were shown
    in Fig. 2(a). The deviation of training was minimized when the network has two
    hidden layers, with MSE of 0.02 K. For the model test, the LST was calculated
    by the DNN model at a spatial resolution of 100 m and 1000 m using Landsat-8 and
    MODIS NDVI, respectively (hereinafter referred to as DNN-Landsat-like and DNN-MODIS-like
    LST). Then, the comparison of Landsat-8 (MODIS) LST and DNN-Landsat-like (DNN-MODIS-like)
    LST was done to validate the applicability of the DNN-based LST estimation model
    from site to pixel scale. For model application, finer resolution LSTs (i.e.,
    1 m and 10 m) were generated by introducing NDVI derived from GF-2 and Sentinel-2
    into the trained DNN model, respectively (Fig. 2(b)). Download : Download high-res

    observation. Subscript HR represents the image at 1 m and 10 m, respectively.
    3.4. The aggregation of LST by DNN Assuming that the statistical relationship
    between LST and NDVI is consistent and stable at any resolution. To analyze the
    effect of pixel heterogeneity on the results of the model, the DNN approach also
    has been applied to aggregate LST at 1 and 10 m to multi-pixel size. For the DNN
    training, LST and NDVI at 1 and 10 m were used to establish the net model, respectively.
    For model application, first, LSTs at 5, 10, 30, 100, and 1000 m were generated
    by introducing resampled NDVI using nearest-neighbor interpolation from GF-2 data.
    Then, LSTs at 30, 100, and 1000 m were generated by introducing resampled NDVI
    from Sentinel-2 data, with the same resampling method as above. The specific process
    is shown in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (253KB) Download : Download

    to estimate H and LE at multiple pixel resolutions. The hybrid model consists
    of four parts. First, the DNN-based LST model was constructed by the observed
    LST and NDVI; the applicability of the locally trained DNN model at different
    pixel sizes was validated with Landsat-8 and MODIS data. Second, LST at 1 ∼ 1000
    m was generated by the DNN-based LST estimation model. Third, the above was integrated
    into the TSEB model to build the hybrid DNN-TSEB model. Finally, NDVI, LAI, fc,
    and hc at multiple pixel resolutions derived from GF-2 coupled with meteorological
    data (u, Ta, , , P, and RH) from AWS were input to the hybrid model to simulate
    H and LE at 1, 5, 10, 30, 100 and 1000 m. The flowchart of the hybrid model for
    estimating multi-scale surface fluxes is shown in Fig. 4. Download : Download

    of the hybrid model. The resolution of EC at the scale of the footprint was processed
    to 1 m to match the modeled fluxes. Then, modeled fluxes at 5, 10, 30, 100, and
    1000 m were resampled using the nearest-neighbor interpolation of ArcGIS software
    to 1 m to better correspond to the pixel of EC footprint. Then, variables including
    NDVI, LAI, fc, and hc at multiple pixel resolutions from Sentinel-2 data were
    input to the hybrid model to estimate H and LE at 10, 30, 100, and 1000 m, respectively.
    The EC and OMS flux observations were utilized to evaluate modeled outputs, and
    the validation strategy was the same as the one above. Additionally, H and LE
    at 30, 100, and 1000 m were obtained using Landsat-8 data. Finally, a comparison
    of H and LE from multi-source remote sensing data was done to analyze the influence
    of pixel size of different satellite remote sensing data on the model outputs.
    4. Results 4.1. The applicability of the DNN-based LST estimation model In order
    to validate the transferability and applicability of the locally DNN-based LST
    estimation model at a different pixel scale, the LST of Landsat-8 (MODIS) and
    DNN-Landsat-like (DNN-MODIS-like) were compared, which 7980 (135) pixels of Landsat-8
    (MODIS) were selected. The average pixel difference of LST between DNN-Landsat-like
    and Landsat-8 was between −1.4 and 2.5 K in 2020; while the discrepancy of pixel
    between DNN-MODIS-like and MODIS LST was slightly larger than that of DNN-Landsat-like
    and Landsat 8 LST, with values ranging from −2.3 to 2.5 K. The maximum difference
    of LST between Landsat-8 and DNN-Landsat-like occurred at the junction of two
    surface features (Fig. S1). Fig. 5 (Fig. S2) shows the histogram of pixel differences
    for LST between DNN-Landsat-like (DNN-MODIS-like) and Landsat-8 (MODIS); the results
    indicated that differences between pixels of LST ranged from −2 to 2 K. To evaluate
    the performance of the DNN-based LST estimation, the LST observation was applied
    to validate LST estimates. The result showed that the predicted LST exhibited
    a good agreement with the measured LST (Fig. 6), with an RMSE value of 2.53 K
    and 3.81 K for DNN-Landsat-like and DNN-MODIS-like, respectively. However, DNN-Landsat-like
    LST was constantly overestimated. Compared to the other periods, there are significant
    deviations of LST estimates during the flourishing period of crops i.e., July
    and August, probably because of the limited spatial representation of temperature
    observations when the surface is completely covered by crops. Generally, the DNN-based
    LST model trained at a point scale can be used at multiple pixel scales. Download

    (with a spatial resolution of 1 m), Sentinel-2 (with a spatial resolution of 10
    m), and Landsat-8 (with a spatial resolution of 30 m) using the DNN method were
    validated by LST observation. Comparisons of estimation versus observation of
    LST were shown in Fig. 7(a). In general, a better consistency between the estimated
    and measured LST was found, with RMSE = 2.21 K and Bias = −0.82 K). This research
    has achieved a breakthrough in the spatial resolution of regional LST estimates
    by using the DNN approach to obtain LST at 1 m and 10 m. Download : Download high-res

    data, respectively. The scatter of aggregated and observed LST was presented in
    Fig. 7(b). The aggregated LST agreed well with the observation of LST (RMSE =
    2.16 K and Bias = −1.31 K); LST estimates have been underestimated significantly.
    There is a large difference between the aggregated and observed LST at the coarse
    pixel size, i.e., with the spatial resolution of 100 and 1000 m. This is mainly
    attributed to the mixed pixels including various surface types. The mismatch of
    scale between observation and pixel produced a larger deviation (Li et al., 2017).
    4.3. The multi-pixel-size surface fluxes modeled by the hybrid model 4.3.1. H
    and LE modeled by the hybrid model and GF-2 data H and LE at multiple pixel resolutions
    were estimated by the hybrid model using variables from GF-2 satellite remote
    sensing data. EC fluxes, Rn, and G0 observation was used to validate modeled H,
    LE, Rn, and G0. The bias of H, LE, Rn, and G0 at 1 m modeled by the hybrid model
    was −9, −6, −1, and 20 W m−2, respectively. The modeled outputs at multiple pixel
    resolutions showed that the bias tend to increase as the spatial resolution became
    coarser (Fig. 8). The large increase in error between 1 m and 5 m pixel size demonstrated
    that the ability to distinguish between different land cover types (i.e. maize
    and vegetables) on a heterogeneous surface is a very important factor for accurate
    estimation of surface fluxes; the bias of modeled H increased from −9 and to −15
    W m−2, while the bias of the modeled LE from −6 to −13 W m−2 when pixel resolution
    ranged from 1 to 5 m. In general, the performance of the hybrid model was robust
    when the pixel resolution was greater than 100 m. Download : Download high-res

    Spatial patterns of H, LE, Rn, and G0 were varied for the diverse land cover.
    H (LE) within the experimental region was about from 45 (25) to 320 (606)W/m−2;

    in the previous research, the spatial resolution for the regional H and LE was
    between 15 ∼ 1000 m in the midstream of HRB (Feng et al., 2020). This study has
    obtained higher resolution surface flux data than previous studies. H and LE at
    1 m have been effectively achieved by the GF-2 remote sensing data and the hybrid
    model. From the deviation for fluxes estimates, the outputs modeled by the hybrid
    model and the GF-2 images agreed significantly with EC observation. The uncertainty
    of fluxes estimates was within the deviation (∼50 W m−2) of the EC-measured turbulent
    fluxes (Kustas and Norman, 2000). Moreover, modeled H and LE in this study were
    closer to observations than fluxes in previous studies (Ma et al., 2015, Song
    et al., 2016a, Song et al., 2016b, Li et al., 2017, Xu et al., 2019). 4.3.2. H
    and LE modeled by the hybrid model and Sentinel-2 data H and LE at multiple spatial
    resolutions (10, 30, 100, and 1000 m) on five cloud-free days (May 30, June 29,
    July 4, August 18, and September 12) during the whole growing season in 2020 were
    obtained by hybrid model and Sentinel-2. Figs. 10 and 11 showed the spatial distribution
    of H and LE at 10 m within the experimental region. Throughout the growing season,
    H (LE) showed a trend of decreasing (increasing) first and then increasing (decreasing).
    The mean H and LE within the experimental region ranged from 0 to 478 and 0 to
    676 W m−2. According to the frequency curves, the peak of H and LE in the early
    growing season, flourishing period, and subsequent senescent stage were about
    250 and 300 W m−2, 70 and 600 W m−2, and 250 and 200 W m−2, respectively. Download

    Images at 10 m resolution can distinguish the boundaries between vegetation and
    non-vegetation; images with a resolution of more than 30 m blurred the boundary
    between the two surface types. Different properties contribute signals to the
    pixel, which is more pronounced at coarse resolution, i.e., pixel scale was 100
    m or 1000 m. These signals ultimately affect the modeled results. Download : Download

    at any resolution and the magnitude of G0 was similar at multi-scale image compared
    to flux observation. Modeled H and LE showed that deviation tends to increase
    when pixel resolution became coarser by the verification of EC flux observation
    (Fig. 13). RMSE and bias for H were up to 51 from 21 W m−2 and −48 from −12 W
    m−2 when the pixel resolution of the imagery was increased from 10 m to 1000 m.
    For LE, the scatter between estimates at 10 m and observation was close to the
    1:1 line and the error at 1000 m was greater than that of other spatial resolutions.
    H for heterogeneous surfaces has been underestimated while LE has been overestimated.

    Generally, H and LE estimates were closer to the turbulent flux from EC than OMS
    system. There are residential areas in the OMS source area but not in the EC source
    area, which leads to greater uncertainty in the H and LE of OMS. Additionally,
    compared to the EC system, the data processing method of OMS is being developed,
    which brings some uncertainties (Ward, 2017). Download : Download high-res image

    deviation of modeled H was similar at any resolution compared to flux observation.
    The results of modeled LE showed that the value of RMSE tends to increase when
    pixel resolution is from 30 m to 1000 m, with the RMSE value being up to 82 from
    59 W m−2. H for heterogeneous surfaces has been overestimated while LE has been
    underestimated. For Rn, the value from the hybrid was close to the observation
    at 30, 100, and 1000 m. The deviation of the modeled G0 was comparable at the
    multiple spatial resolution, with RMSE was about 21 W m−2. Download : Download

    multi-source remote sensing data The histogram for deviation of modeled H and
    LE at multiple spatial resolutions based on remote sensing variables from GF-2
    and Sentinel-2 data is shown in Fig. 16(a) and (b). The results indicated that
    biases of H and LE derived from GF-2 and Sentinel-2 data were prone to increase
    in the case of coarser resolution. The bias of H (LE) estimates from the GF-2
    data was less than that of Sentinel-2, for instance, the bias of H (LE) estimates
    at 100 m was −40 (39) and −47 (45)W/m−2 for GF-2 and Sentinel-2, respectively.
    The modeled LE from Sentinel-2 data at all resolutions has been overestimated
    (i.e., bias was from 5 to 50 W m−2) while LE at 1 ∼ 10 m from GF-2 data has been
    underestimated (i.e., bias was from −12 to −6W/m−2). Overall, the performance
    of the model was excellent when the pixel size was within 30 m. The influence
    of pixel resolution on model inputs from different satellite remote sensing was
    one of the main reasons that causes the deviation of fluxes estimates (Moran et
    al., 1997, Kustas et al., 2004, Song et al., 2018, Nassar et al., 2020), the details
    have been stated in the discussion section. Download : Download high-res image

    H and LE estimates on August 18 at 1, 5, 10, 30, 100, and 1000 m. Even though
    Landsat-8 and the other two satellite data do not have the same overpass time
    for the study area, the estimation bias of the modeled H and LE derived from GF-2
    and Sentinel-2 was greatly smaller than these of Landsat-8 (Section 4.3.3). This
    was due to the large deviation of the retrieved LST of Landsat-8, with the RMSE
    value of 2.53 K, 1.54 K, and 1.62 K for Landsat-8, GF-2, and Sentinel-2 data,
    respectively. Because the difference of 1 K between Ta and LST may produce an
    error of 30 W m−2 for evapotranspiration (Cammalleri et al., 2012). Another reason
    may be the difference in pixel resolution of the satellite data source. 5. Discussion
    5.1. The importance of pixel heterogeneity for H and LE estimates The deviation
    of H and LE estimates was most small when the pixel resolution was high enough
    to differentiate two distinct surface cover types; H and LE at 1 m had a better
    consistency compared to EC observations. The edge effects of the two surface cover
    type such as maize and vegetable were visible when the pixel resolution was equal
    and greater than 5 m. Even though flux estimation deviation was within a known
    range of EC observational uncertainty (Kustas and Norman, 1997, Kustas and Norman,
    2000), this effect was more significant when the difference of LST for two land
    cover types was different, particularly for the pixel size was greater than 10
    m (Fig. 8). Therefore, pixel heterogeneity is one of the main factors affecting
    surface heat and water vapor fluxes estimates by using the remote sensing-based
    model. In this study, the heterogeneity of surface heat and water vapor fluxes
    at different spatial resolutions (1, 5, 10, 30, 100, and 1000 m) were described
    by coefficient of variation (CV). The CV values of H and LE do not change at spatial
    resolutions between 10 m and 100 m; however, the pixel sizes of 1 m and 1000 m
    have a great influence on the evaluation results of spatial heterogeneity (Fig.
    S3). The result was similar to the research of Zhang et al. (2018) which the spatial
    heterogeneity of surface heat and water vapor fluxes decreases when decreasing
    the spatial resolution of remote sensing data. Conversely, the higher the spatial
    resolution of remote sensing data, the more spatial information can be reflected;
    thus, more realistic surface heat and water vapor fluxes have been obtained (Section
    4.4). 5.2. Advantages of LST generated by DNN The histograms of LST at different
    spatial resolutions based on the DNN method within the experimental region on
    August 18 in 2020 were indicated in Fig. 17. There was a distinct distribution
    of the two peaks at 1 and 5 m. This means that pixel resolution within 5 m can
    distinguish temperatures at the edges of two different land cover types. H and
    LE can be better estimated in these scales since LST is an important factor for
    the TSEB model to estimate surface fluxes (Timmermans et al., 2007, Colaizzi et
    al., 2012a, Colaizzi et al., 2012b, Kustas et al., 2012, Song et al., 2020, Cui
    et al., 2021). Download : Download high-res image (245KB) Download : Download

    5 m, (c) 10 m (d) 30 m, and (e) 100 m pixel sizes within the experimental region
    for GF-2 overpass on August 18 in 2020. The LST obtained by the DNN method can
    capture efficiently variability between images, especially for the junction of
    two objects. H and LE at 1 m modeled by the TSEB combined with DNN-based LST has
    a good consistency with EC observations. The DNN-based method appears to be a
    feasible way to obtain finer spatial resolution LST for surface heat and water
    vapor flux modeling (Burchard-Levine et al., 2021). It makes up for the defect
    that thermal infrared sensors cannot obtain high temporal and spatial resolution
    at the same time (Guzinski et al., 2020). 5.3. Influences of the pixel size of
    LAI on the model The LAI estimates can lead to greater uncertainty in estimating
    surface fluxes (Song et al., 2018). Additionally, as discussed in Moran et al.
    (1997) and Kustas et al. (2004), the downscaling technique of modeling inputs
    from remote sensing data leads to significant errors in modeled energy fluxes.
    Fig. 18 showed the histograms of LAI value within the experimental region on August
    18 in 2020. There was a distinct distribution of the two peaks at 1, 5, and 10
    m (Fig. 18(a), (b), and (c)), while only one peak appears when pixel resolution
    was greater than 10 m. This is because the edge between vegetation and non-vegetation
    can be discriminated within the spatial resolution of 5 m over a heterogenous
    surface and the pixel value can be captured. Therefore, the pixel resolution of
    LAI affects the outputs of the hybrid model. Download : Download high-res image

    within the experimental region for GF-2 overpass on August 18 in 2020. 5.4. The
    uncertainty of flux observation The mismatch between EC/OMS observations and modeled
    fluxes was one of the factors affecting the validation results (Wang et al., 2015).
    It can be discussed in both temporal and spatial terms. For temporal terms, there
    is a certain mismatch between the modeled and the observed flux because the estimated
    fluxes are instantaneous values while the observed values are half-hourly averages.
    For spatial terms, the spatial representation of the in-situ observation was limited
    while a larger pixel can encompass lands outside the area covered by observed
    devices. For LST, there is a clear discrepancy between the measured and modeled
    LST using remote sensing data, which is due in part to the fact that the radiometer
    of the middle reach of HRB has a field of view of about 45 m, while the 100 m
    pixel encompassed vegetation/land use conditions outside the 45 m radiometer footprint
    (Song et al., 2016b). There is a certain uncertainty between the observation and
    estimation of pixel scale. Therefore, the deviation of estimates of H and LE from
    the observations increased as the spatial resolution became coarser. Moreover,
    the difference of H (LE) between EC and OMS measurements was approximately 27%
    (37%) over the heterogeneous underlying surface in the middle reach of HRB (Zheng
    et al., 2023); therefore, it can lead to differences in model validation. Additionally,
    the heat storage in the canopy and surface heterogeneity (Xu et al., 2017a) are
    important factors affecting EBR for observed flux. Also, the EBR of the OMS system
    was increased over the heterogeneous underlying surface, thus OMS has a potential
    advantage in validating surface heat and water vapor flux at pixel scale (Zheng
    et al., 2023). Nevertheless, the model simulations are much closer to the observed
    values of EC than that of OMS in this study. The relevant discussion and analysis
    should be conducted continually in subsequent studies. Besides, this study area
    belongs to the irrigation area. Although the data selected in this study avoid
    the irrigation date, the regional advection will also affect the EC and OMS observation
    value, so there is some uncertainty in the observation data. The simulated Rn
    and G0 were closest to the observation at any resolution. For Rn, the following
    reasons may explain this, (1) the accuracy of the optimized radiation model is
    reliable for all surface types i.e., from smooth to rough surfaces. Colaizzi et
    al., 2012a, Colaizzi et al., 2012b optimized the parameter of the radiation model
    and evaluated the model on row crops surface. The results showed that the performance
    of the improved radiation model was desirable, with a RMSE value of 26.3 W m−2
    over the sparse to full vegetation cover; (2) The systematic error cannot be eliminated
    at any resolution, resulting in the same estimation deviation at multiple spatial
    resolutions; thus, simulated Rn closest to the observation; (3) the errors caused
    by several factors counteract each other. This is because Rn is the sum of the
    incoming and outgoing shortwave and longwave radiation components. Therefore,
    the error of the parameter or input of the radiation model counteracts each other
    at any resolution. For G0, there are two reasons why the simulated G0 were close
    to the observation, (1) the G0 is calculated based on its experienced relationship
    with the soil net radiation, (2) the range of variation of G0 is relatively small
    in the study area, therefore the spatial resolution has less influence on it.
    Certainly, these explanations need to be confirmed in future research. 5.5. Limitations
    and prospects The TSEB model can better obtain surface fluxes. As discussed in
    Kustas et al., 2012, Morillas et al., 2013, and Li et al. (2019), the remote sensing-based
    TSEB model was more applicable for surface fluxes estimates over the heterogenous
    surface in semi-arid or arid regions. This is mainly because the TSEB model can
    well capture signals from dual sources (soil and vegetation) at high spatial resolution
    images. However, the TSEB model should have different parameters when pixel size
    increases with larger mesh sizes. As summarized in Su (2002), aerodynamic resistance
    decreased with coarser inputs, resulting in a larger deviation of H estimates.
    Roughness parameters (e.g., zero plane displacement, z0h, and z0m) may be non-fixed
    in different pixel sizes. However, these parameters were set to the same in multiple
    spatial resolutions to investigate the scale effect in surface flux estimates.
    What’s more, the hybrid model, i.e., the fusion of the physical processed-based
    model and deep learning approach is the most potential method for estimating surface
    fluxes or evapotranspiration. Until now, only a few studies attempted to build
    a hybrid model by packaging the analytical solution of the physical equation as
    a hidden layer in the neural network (de Bézenac et al. 2019), optimizing processes-based
    ET model parameter (Chen et al., 2022, Hu et al., 2021a, Hu et al., 2021b, Zhao
    et al., 2019) and correcting model structural errors (Hu et al. 2021a) by deep
    learning method. This study successfully applied a hybrid model to estimate H
    and LE over heterogeneous surfaces. However, this study initially explores a combination
    of the two methods. A large amount of work needs to be conducted on the development
    of the hybrid model in the future, including (1) the physical equation of the
    TSEB model has been packaged into the loss function of deep learning to enhance
    the interpretability of deep learning, (2) deep learning is used to optimize the
    key parameters (e.g., surface roughness and soil resistance) of the TSEB model,
    (3) the errors in the model structure are corrected by deep learning. 6. Conclusions
    In this study, H and LE estimates at multiple pixel resolutions over the cropland
    field were obtained by the hybrid model that the TSEB model combined with the
    DNN method using multi-source remote sensing data including GF-2, Sentinel-2,
    and Landsat-8 satellite remote sensing data; the uncertainty of flux estimates
    at different pixel resolution was quantified by EC/OMS flux observations. The
    effect of pixel size on the performance of the hybrid DNN-TSEB model over the
    heterogeneous surface was investigated. The main findings can be summarized as:
    (1) The DNN-based LST estimation model was an effective approach for obtaining
    LST with finer spatial resolution, with an RMSE value of 1.54 K at 1 m pixel size.
    It compensates for the inability of thermal infrared sensors to provide images
    with high spatiotemporal resolution. The DNN can provide reliable input data for
    the TSEB model. (2) The hybrid DNN-TSEB model was a promising method that can
    accurately estimate the finer spatial resolution H and LE over the heterogenous
    surface. The modeled H and LE agreed well with flux observations; the bias of
    H and LE with a spatial resolution of 1 m were −9 and −6 W m−2, respectively.
    The compared results between fluxes observations and estimates at multi-pixel
    resolution demonstrated that the hybrid model performed well given the level of
    heterogeneity. (3) The accuracy of modeled H and LE decreased as the spatial resolution
    became coarser. When the pixel resolution changes from 1 to 100 m, the deviation
    of H and LE estimates increases by about 30 and 35 W m−2, respectively. The comparison
    of fluxes based on GF-2 and Sentinel-2 data also proved that the uncertainty of
    H and LE estimates increased with coarser spatial resolution. Besides, modeled
    H and LE derived from GF-2 data were closer to observation than those from Sentinel-2
    and Landsat-8 data. To reduce the uncertainty of heterogeneity in modeled H and
    LE estimates, more GF-2 images will be utilized to estimate H and LE in the future
    to better monitor crop water consumption and demand information, thereby improving
    water use efficiency, and managing rational water resources in semi-arid and arid
    regions. CRediT authorship contribution statement Jiaojiao Feng: Conceptualization,

    1. Introduction The regulation of water-heat exchange at the land–atmosphere interface
    is significantly impacted by soil moisture (SM), thus making it an essential climatic
    and ecological variable (Humphrey et al., 2021). In agriculture, excessive SM
    lead to waterlogging, while insufficient SM result in drought (Liu et al., 2018).
    Both conditions adversely affect crop growth, highlighting the close relationship
    between SM and food security. In terms of land surface/hydrological modeling,
    the assimilation of SM data improves model state estimation (Yin et al., 2023).
    Additionally, SM can be used as a constraint to parameterize the model to prevent
    the phenomenon of “same result with different parameters” (Rajib et al., 2016).
    In climate, existing research indicates that SM significantly improves rainfall
    forecast, especially in extreme events (van den Hurk et al., 2012). Moreover,
    spatiotemporally continuous SM is beneficial to climate change analysis (Seneviratne
    et al., 2010). All these domains necessitate SM data with high spatiotemporal
    resolution, precision, and continuity to serve their application needs. Since
    soil dielectric constant measured by microwave is directly correlated with SM,
    and the microwave band has the characteristics of all-day, all-weather measurement
    and penetration of vegetation (Ulaby et al., 1981), it is widely regarded as the
    primary wavelength for SM monitoring (Ma et al., 2023). Microwave satellites have
    two different types of sensors: active (radar, scatterometer) and passive (radiometer-based).
    Although the active microwave has a high spatial resolution, it is susceptible
    to factors such as surface roughness, vegetation, and speckle noise, and has a
    relatively long satellite revisit period (Ambrosone et al., 2020, Wang et al.,
    2022). In contrast, the passive microwave technique offers a high temporal resolution
    and its retrieval algorithms are more mature, yet its application is restricted
    to the resolution of tens of kilometers. In addition, it is possible to create
    model-based SM products with spatial integrity and temporal continuity by utilizing
    data assimilation techniques and driving land surface models. However, like passive
    microwave data, model-based products also have relatively coarse spatial resolution.
    For example, the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) resolution is 0.25°
    (Rodell et al., 2004), the ERA5-Land resolution is 0.1° (Muñoz-Sabater, 2019),
    and China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS)
    has a resolution of 0.0625° (Shi et al., 2011). More importantly, improper parameter
    settings, model structure, and the forcing data uncertainty, affect the accuracy
    of the products and require evaluation of various model-based products in different
    regions (Fan et al., 2022, Zeng et al., 2015). Due to the coupled influence of
    human activity, underlying surface conditions, and climate change, SM exhibits
    significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Coarse spatial resolution microwave
    and model-based products are not entirely capable of describing this heterogeneity,
    and need to be disaggregated to produce SM products with higher spatiotemporal
    resolution. Currently, there are three main disaggregation methods (Peng et al.,
    2017, Qu et al., 2020). The first is based on geospatial information data (Ranney
    et al., 2015), but it requires a large amount of station data to establish the
    relationship. The second is model-based approach, including statistical model
    (Kim and Barros, 2002) and land surface/hydrological model (Vergopolan et al.,
    2020). However, statistical models are not universally applicable, and the process
    of constructing land surface/hydrological models is complex, requiring a substantial
    amount of driving data. The third is a multi-source data fusion approach, which
    has been extensively used in recent disaggregation studies. For example, Song
    et al. disaggregated the AMSR-2 data to 1 km by geographically weighted regression
    (Song et al., 2019). To disaggregate SMAP observations, Wei et al. employed a
    gradient-boosted decision-tree regression model through a high-resolution SM index
    (Wei et al., 2019). Long et al. leveraged microwave and CLDAS SM products as background
    fields, and developed an effective SM disaggregation method by random forest (Long
    et al., 2019). Based on remote sensing, ERA5-Land, and in-situ data, Huang et
    al. generated a spatiotemporally continuous surface SM product (Huang et al.,
    2022). However, there are three main limitations to existing disaggregation studies
    based on multi-source data fusion in obtaining highly accurate, high spatiotemporal
    resolution and spatially complete SM products: 1) some studies disaggregated individual
    passive microwave SM product (e.g., SMAP, AMSR-2). However, such passive products
    suffer from spatial and temporal missing due to their operation orbit and revisit
    intervals, hence the derived disaggregation products also inherit these deficiencies.
    Some studies have addressed this issue by introducing model-based data, but they
    do not evaluate different model-based products to choose the most suitable one
    for the study region; 2) many studies employ machine learning techniques to merge
    various SM products. However, the internal mechanisms of machine learning are
    not as well defined and it is difficult to accurately characterize the error in
    each product; 3) optical/infrared products as auxiliary data are susceptible to
    impacts from cloud masking, atmospheric effects, and vegetation coverage, resulting
    in invalid grids. To overcome the above-mentioned issues, this study contributes
    to the following three components: 1) three mainstream model-based SM products
    (GLDAS, CLDAS, and ERA5-Land) were individually combined with microwave active
    and passive data to form three sets of triplets. Through triple collocation (TC)
    analysis, the model-based products were compared, and the product with the smallest
    error was selected; 2) depending on the error variance derived from triple collocation
    analysis, the selected model-based, microwave active, and microwave passive products
    were optimally fused through least squares merging and Pearson correlation-based
    determination scheme to produce reliable 25 km daily seamless SM products; 3)
    the temporal correlation and spectral similarity among images were explored by
    spatiotemporal interpolation and the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance
    fusion model (ESTARFM) to complement the missing in optical/infrared products
    and generate daily seamless auxiliary data at 1 km. Finally, the geographically
    weighted regression (GWR) model with local regression capability was employed
    to disaggregate the 25 km TC-merged product by the auxiliary data, resulting in
    daily seamless SM product at 1 km. 2. Study area The Shandian River Basin, which
    is in the intersection of Hebei Province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    in China, was chosen as the study area (Fig. 1). This area boasts a diverse range
    of land cover types that includes farmland, grasslands, forests, and small amounts
    of shrubs and bare land. The climatic type of the study area is temperate continental,
    characterized by cold, dry winters and wet, rainy summers, with an average annual
    precipitation of 300–500 mm. As a result, there are significant seasonal variations
    in SM (Wang et al., 2023). Download : Download high-res image (987KB) Download

    River Basin. A wireless sensor network measuring SM in the Shandian River Basin
    consists of 34 stations that operate at three different scales: 100 km, 50 km,
    and 10 km. As this study involves different scales of SM products (25 km, 6.25
    km, and 1 km), the area can satisfy different scales of product validation. Decagon
    5TM SM sensors are used at each station, and measurements are taken at five depths.
    In this study, the 5 cm depth data is used to match the SM products. In addition,
    the final study range was chosen between 41° − 43°N and 115° − 117.5°E to facilitate
    data fusion. 3. Data and methodology 3.1. Multi-source soil moisture and auxiliary
    data 3.1.1. Microwave soil moisture The ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project
    provided the microwave SM products used in this study, which includes active,
    passive, and combined products at 25 km. Annual updates by the CCI SM team have
    resulted in 13 releases so far, each of which added new sensors and extended the
    time series (Gruber et al., 2019). In this study, both active and passive microwave
    products were selected to participate in the triple collocation calculations,
    they include mainstream active and passive sensors. 3.1.2. Model-based soil moisture
    (i) CLDAS The CLDAS product depends on data fusion and assimilation methods by
    atmospheric products to drive different land surface models, and in turn the values
    simulated by these models are ensemble averaged to obtain the surface state variables.
    The CLDAS near real-time SM product was chosen for this study, with 0.0625° spatial
    resolution at a daily or hourly time scale. To match the microwave data, the daily
    data from 0 to 5 cm depth was selected and resampled to 25 km. Moreover, hourly
    CLDAS land surface temperature (LST) was used in the ESTARFM fusion process. (ii)
    GLDAS The GLDAS product is developed by NASA to provide an optimal field for land
    surface conditions and fluxes, it contains the products of three land surface
    models (Catchment, VIC, and Noah). This study used SM product simulated by Noah
    model, which vertically divided into four layers with 0.25° spatial resolution
    at 3-hour temporal scale. Similarly, to match the satellite products, the top
    layer (0–10 cm) was selected, and the 3-hour data were averaged on a daily scale.
    (iii) ERA5-Land ERA5-Land product has higher spatial and temporal resolutions
    (0.1°, hourly), more output parameters, more advanced forecast models, and data
    assimilation technology than ERA5. This study utilized the top layer (0–7 cm)
    of the ERA5-Land SM product. Same as the aforementioned product, the ERA5-Land
    product was resampled to 25 km and temporally averaged to a daily scale. 3.1.3.
    Auxiliary data (i) MODIS products The nighttime MYD11A1 product offered the LST
    in this study, which has a local overpass time of around 1:30 AM. For the enhanced
    vegetation index (EVI), by combining 16-day EVI data from MYD13A2 and MOD13A2,
    an 8-day EVI product at 1 km can be obtained. Furthermore, the land cover type
    product (MCD12Q1) was used and the IGBP classification layer was chosen to participate
    in the error calculation. (ii) DEM The multi-temporal interpolation and GWR disaggregation
    process used the STRM Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data as auxiliary data. 3.2.
    Methodology The method of this study comprises three parts (Fig. 2): 1) assessment
    of the optimal model-based product and analysis of each product''s error variance
    using the TC methods. Based on error variance, the model-based, active microwave,
    and passive microwave products are optimally merged to produce a daily seamless
    SM product at 25 km; 2) development of daily seamless EVI product by linear interpolation
    and daily seamless LST product through iterative multi-temporal reconstruction
    and ESTARFM method, forming a 1 km seamless auxiliary dataset; 3) utilization
    of the GWR method to disaggregate the TC-merged product by the auxiliary dataset
    and ultimately obtaining a 1 km daily seamless SM product. Download : Download

    25 km daily seamless SM product, all products were first bias corrected to unify
    the value ranges, and then the optimal model-based product was evaluated by the
    triple collocation algorithm, while the error variance of each product was obtained.
    According to the error variance, the least squares merging technique was used
    to further calculate each product''s weight. Finally, for a more reliable merge,
    data were merged under different scenarios by considering the relevant significance
    levels. (i) Bias correction Differences in sensor frequency, observation principles,
    and inversion algorithms lead to certain systematic biases among different SM
    products. This study applied the cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching
    technique to eliminate statistical moment differences between the two datasets
    (Reichle and Koster, 2004). Since model-based data have high spatiotemporal continuity,
    they are widely used as reference data in bias correction. All SM products involved
    in TC calculations were matched with model-based products by the CDF technique,
    so that they had the same value range and distribution. In addition, the reference
    data quality affects the merged product’s accuracy (Afshar et al., 2019), therefore
    it is necessary to evaluate different model-based products. (ii) Evaluation and
    uncertainty estimation of model-based products The TC method has the advantage
    of not relying on “true values” and can estimate the error of each product independently.
    This method has been extensively applied to calculate errors of hydrological variables
    such as precipitation (Lyu et al., 2021), evapotranspiration (Khan et al., 2018),
    and SM (Gruber et al., 2016, Wu et al., 2023, Wu et al., 2021). It is called “triple
    collocation” because the three data need to be paired together to form a triple
    in the calculation. An important principle of triple collocation is that the errors
    between the data must be uncorrelated. In this study, three triplets were constructed,
    namely 1) CLDAS - passive - active, 2) GLDAS - passive- active, and 3) ERA5-Land
    - passive- active. In each triplet, the data are model-based, passive microwave,
    and active microwave, which have different data sources and algorithms, thus fulfilling
    the prerequisite of uncorrelated errors. Moreover, these three triplets make three
    model-based products comparable. By comparing the results of three triplets, it
    is possible to assess the best model-based product and to obtain the relative
    error between each product. The calculation of TC is categorized into difference
    and covariance methods. This study chose the covariance method, which assumes
    the following principles between SM products and “true value”: 1) they are linearly
    correlated; 2) they are independent of each other in terms of error. According
    to the formula of covariance, the final formula of error variance ( ) is: (1)
    where is random error variance, and are the variance of product and covariance
    between products, respectively. represent three SM products after CDF matching.
    Moreover, the following two points should be considered during TC calculation:
    1) only grids with more than 100 samples in the time series retained for analysis;
    otherwise the results may be unreliable (Scipal et al., 2010); 2) when the error
    variance of one of the products is less than zero, the results of other products
    are not credible. Both cases may result in invalid grids. To ensure full coverage
    of the error variance, this study assigned the average error variance of valid
    grids in a given land cover type to the invalid grids of the same type. (iii)
    Weight estimation This study adopted the least squares merging method to estimate
    weights, which has been effectively used to merge SM (Gruber et al., 2017, Zeng
    et al., 2016), rainfall (Dong et al., 2020), and terrestrial water storage (Yin
    and Park, 2021) products. The aim of least squares merging is to obtain the smallest
    error variance ( ) of merged products and thus achieve an optimal merging of the
    different data, which takes the following form based on the TC estimates: (2)
    where is the weight of each product, and is the error variance calculated by the
    TC method. To obtain unbiased combined results, the sum of is 1. Then: (3) Letting
    and equal 0, the weights for each product are: (4) When only two products are
    available, the weights for each product change to the following form: (5) (iv)
    Merging scheme considering significance levels The SM product generated in this
    study needed to meet two criteria: seamlessness and reliability. However, apart
    from the two unreliable situations mentioned in section 3.1.2, a weak correlation
    between one product in the triplet and the other two indicates a lower temporal
    coverage or poorer quality for that product, which would result in a low spatial
    coverage of the merged product. Hence, a scheme considering the relevant significance
    level (p-value < 0.05) was adopted to fulfill the seamless requirement of the
    merged product, which has been applied in previous studies (Gruber et al., 2017,
    Peng et al., 2021). The merging scheme is grid-based and consists of four scenarios
    (Table 1): 1) when all products are significantly correlated, a weighted average
    based on TC weights is used; 2) when a product shows strong correlation with two
    others, the value of that product is chosen; 3) when only two products are significantly
    correlated, the average value of these is calculated; and 4) when there is no
    significant correlation between the three products, the grid is generally ignored.
    For full spatial coverage, we filled in the gaps by utilizing model-based products
    that have continuity in both temporal and spatial. Table 1. Pearson correlation-based

    Generating 1 km daily seamless auxiliary data The objective of this section is
    to generate 1 km daily seamless auxiliary data. First, daily seamless EVI data
    were obtained through Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering (Savitzky and Golay, 1964)
    and linear interpolation methods. Second, seamless LST data were acquired by an
    iterative multi-temporal interpolation algorithm, and then the LST data were further
    extended to a daily scale by introducing the ESTARFM method. (i) Daily seamless
    EVI In this study, high-quality 16-day MODIS EVI (MYD13A2 and MOD13A2) products
    were selected. They were quality controlled and SG filtered to remove unreliable
    grids and then combined to generate an 8-day EVI. Moreover, linear interpolation
    was performed on the 8-day EVI in the time series to obtain daily seamless EVI,
    as there is a certain phenological regularity of vegetation growth. (ii) Daily
    seamless LST (a) Iterative multi-temporal interpolation The multi-temporal interpolation
    method supposes that the LST variation is highly consistent across grids with
    similar seasonal, elevation, and vegetation conditions (Song et al., 2019, Yu
    et al., 2015). Assuming a linear relationship between the variables, the following
    relationship exists between the two LST images obtained at close date intervals
    ( and ): (6) where is the EVI image on day, , , , and represent coefficients.
    According to the above principle, the LST images were first quality-controlled
    to remove unreliable grids. The LST images with above 90 % clear-sky grids were
    served as reference images ( ), and all images were the target images for interpolation
    ( ). The time interval between and was limited to 30 days to prevent significant
    seasonal changes. If this condition was not met, images from adjacent years were
    substituted. In addition, this study fully utilized all reference images with
    temporal intervals from the target image less than 30 days to perform an iterative
    interpolation operation. According to the principle of proximity of time intervals,
    the ones with shorter intervals were given priority. (b) ESTARFM Although seamless
    LST images can be obtained through iterative multi-temporal interpolation, the
    prerequisite is that the interpolated image must have LST values corresponding
    to the reference image. However, the proportion of clear-sky grids over the entire
    study area is zero on certain dates, these images cannot be processed by multi-temporal
    interpolation. Therefore, ESTARFM was introduced to deal with these dates, which
    takes the time trend of reflectance variations into account and integrates spectral
    and geographic similarities to reconstruct each grid. This method effectively
    fuses high-spatial and low-temporal resolution images with high-temporal and low-spatial
    resolution images to obtain high-spatiotemporal resolution data. It has been widely
    applied in the data fusion field (Abowarda et al., 2021, Long et al., 2020), and
    more descriptions of this model can be found in Zhu et al. (Zhu et al., 2010).
    In this study, the seamless interpolated LST (1 km, some dates missing) data were
    extended to the daily scale using the ESTARFM method by the CLDAS LST (∼6.25 km,
    daily) product. After the above process, all images had 99 % or higher clear-sky
    LST grids. To generate a seamless LST image, the remaining missing grids were
    filled by the inverse distance interpolation (IDW) method. 3.2.3. GWR disaggregation
    The geographically weighted regression (GWR) model utilizes regression coefficients
    to investigate spatially non-stationary relationships between variables (Brunsdon
    et al., 1996). In contrast to simple global regression methods, GWR follows the
    idea of local regression and the first law of geography. It calculates the weight
    relationship between each sample point and the target sample point by introducing
    a distance decay function to obtain the regression coefficient value. In recent
    years, there have been many studies using the GWR method to disaggregate different
    variables such as precipitation (Chen et al., 2015, Xu et al., 2015), water storage
    changes (Chen et al., 2023), land surface temperature (Duan and Li, 2016, Wu et
    al., 2019), and soil moisture (Jin et al., 2018, Song et al., 2019). The formula
    for GWR is: (7) where are the locations of the ith grid, and denote the dependent
    and the kth independent variable of grid i, respectively. m is the total number
    of independent variables, denotes the residuals. and are the constant term and
    regression coefficients, respectively, they are calculated from: (8) where is
    the unbiased estimate of , X and Y represent the multi-dimensional and one-dimensional
    matrices of the independent and dependent variables, respectively. is a spatial
    weighting matrix, and T denotes the transpose. In this study, SM was the dependent
    variable, the daily seamless LST and EVI were obtained in sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2,
    and DEM data were used as independent variables. The reasons for choosing these
    three factors are: 1) LST is related to water evaporation, the higher the LST,
    the faster the rate of evaporation; 2) EVI indicates the growth law of plants,
    which reduces evaporation and retains water in the soil; and 3) DEM affects water
    significantly, such as there is a significant difference between the water level
    of the shaded and sunny slopes. Many previous studies have selected these three
    factors to disaggregate SM (Hu et al., 2020, Song et al., 2022, Wei et al., 2019).
    This study also attempted to include other variables, such as slope factor, but
    the fitting effect did not significantly improve. Moreover, too many variables
    will lead to overfitting problems. Therefore, LST, EVI, and DEM were ultimately
    selected as independent variables. GWR was implemented by first resampling the
    LST, EVI, and DEM data to 25 km and fitting them to the merged data to produce
    the coefficients and residuals in Eq. (7). Then, the coefficients and residuals
    were interpolated to 1 km by cubic spline interpolation. Finally, the 1 km seamless
    daily SM product was obtained based on 1 km ancillary data. 4. Results and discussions
    4.1. Evaluation of model-based products To eliminate the influence caused by the
    choice of different reference data, this study rotated three products (CLDAS,
    GLDAS, and ERA5-Land) as reference data, yielding three groups of error results
    (Table 2). In general, the errors of passive and active data from different triplets
    should not differ significantly under the same reference data. However, as mentioned
    in section 3.1.2, when a product in a grid had a negative error variance, the
    results for the other products were invalid. This resulted in an inconsistent
    number of valid grids in different triplets, and the study area has a total of
    80 grids at 25 km scale. Therefore, the errors in active and passive data slightly
    differ across different triplets. Table 2. Error statistics of different triplets
    in the triple collocation. Group Reference product Triplet Error Number of valid
    grids Model-based CCI Passive CCI Active (1) CLDAS (C) C-P-A 0.021 0.042 0.033

    Land (E) C-P-A 0.019 0.028 0.022 67 G-P-A 0.027 0.026 0.024 67 E-P-A 0.048 0.025
    0.030 54 Note: P and A denote ESA CCI passive and active soil moisture product,
    respectively. For intra-group comparison, the C - P - A and G - P - A triplets
    have almost the same number of valid grids, so there is little difference between
    the errors in active and passive data in these two triplets. For example, in the
    first group, the error values for the passive products obtained from the C - P
    - A and G - P - A are 0.042 and 0.038, respectively, which only differ by 0.004.
    However, the number of valid grids for the E - P - A triplet is considerably lower,
    indicating that ERA5-Land may be unsuitable for TC analysis in this study. Moreover,
    comparing the three triplets in each group, ERA5-Land has the largest error and
    the CLDAS product has the smallest error, which supports the conclusion that CLDAS
    is more appropriate for China as it uses high-quality meteorological forcing data
    (Qin et al., 2017). Therefore, this study selected CLDAS as reference data and
    performed TC analysis with the CLDAS - passive -active combination. Based on the
    error results, the three products were fused to obtain a seamless daily SM product
    at 25 km. 4.2. Analysis of the merged microwave retrieved and model-based SM product
    To investigate the spatiotemporal variations of four SM products (CLDAS, CCI passive,
    CCI active, and TC-merged data), this study utilized Hovmöller diagram (Hovmöller,
    1949), which averages all values located at the same longitude/latitude, and is
    divided into a longitude/latitude axis showing spatial heterogeneity and a time
    axis indicating temporal variation. Fig. 3, Fig. 4 illustrate the spatiotemporal
    variations and coverage of the four SM products across latitudes and longitudes
    from 2019 to 2020, respectively. Numerically, the four products exhibited consistent
    trends in the time series: the soil began to freeze in November each year, resulting
    in low SM values, and as the temperature increased in March of the following year,
    the soil thawed and SM gradually increased. Overall, the active data had higher
    values, followed by the passive data, while CLDAS and TC-merged data had lower
    values. As latitude or longitude increased, no obvious change occurred in SM values,
    possibly due to the averaging process reducing spatial heterogeneity. In addition,
    the ESA CCI data were relatively scattered, with noticeable “jumps” between adjacent
    grids, whereas model-based and TC-merged data have a more continuous spatial distribution.
    This is because the model-based data were simulated from land surface models,
    which have the advantage of spatiotemporal continuity, the TC-merged data inherited
    this property. Download : Download high-res image (437KB) Download : Download

    terms of spatiotemporal coverage, although the Hovmöller diagrams average all
    grids along the same longitude and latitude, there are still significant data
    gaps in both active and passive data (gray areas in Fig. 3, Fig. 4), mostly concentrated
    between November and March of the following year. There could be several factors
    for the data gaps in the microwave data, including (1) the validity of backscattering
    coefficients and brightness temperature; (2) the inability of radiative transfer
    models to converge in retrieving SM; (3) radio frequency interference (RFI); and
    (4) the impacts of freezing and thawing on soil. In summary, TC-merged data combines
    the strengths of the high spatiotemporal coverage of CLDAS with the high accuracy
    of microwave data. 4.3. Analysis of interpolated LST 4.3.1. Evolution of the interpolation
    process Fig. 5 illustrates the evolution of clear-sky grid coverage for LST data
    after each step of interpolation. For ease of presentation, only 2019 is depicted.
    Fig. 5 (a) displays the original clear-sky grid coverage of each LST image. The
    distribution of the points in the figure is highly dispersed, revealing varying
    degrees of missing data in the LST data. Among these images, a total of 98 images
    with clear-sky grid coverage over 90 % were selected as reference images for iterative
    multi-temporal interpolation. Fig. 5 (b) indicates that after iterative multi-temporal
    interpolation, the proportion of clear-sky grid in the LST image has been significantly
    improved, with most of them reaching 100 % and the rest around 99 %. Download

    Original (a) and interpolated coverage (b and c) for MODIS LST data in 2019. However,
    for images with zero ratio of the clear-sky grid (points with zero value in Fig.
    5 (b)), there is no LST value as a reference. Therefore, multi-temporal interpolation
    could not be employed. To address this issue, the ESTARFM method was introduced
    in this study, where MODIS LST data with zero proportion (15 days in total) were
    treated as high-resolution images and CLDAS LST data served as low-resolution
    data. MODIS LST values for the same day were predicted from the CLDAS LST images.
    In addition, to be consistent with the acquisition time of MODIS data at 1:30
    a.m., CLDAS LST measurements at 1:00 a.m. and 2:00 a.m. were averaged. After the
    above steps, only a few images had a small number of missing grids, which were
    filled in by the IDW algorithm. Eventually, 100 % clear-sky grid coverage was
    achieved for all images (Fig. 5 (c)), producing a 1 km daily seamless LST product.
    4.3.2. Validation of the interpolated LST This study used the CLDAS LST to evaluate
    the interpolated data, the quality of this dataset exceeds that of its international
    counterparts in China, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.8 K and an average
    correlation value of 0.98 when compared to ground-based measurements, thus providing
    a reliable validation data. At 1 km scale, the study area consists of 50,000 grids,
    and the correlation (R) between interpolated LST and CLDAS LST on the time series
    was calculated grid by grid. As shown in Fig. 6, the average correlation is 0.931,
    and most of the correlations reached above 0.9. These results demonstrate the
    validity and applicability of the interpolated LST data, which can serve as auxiliary
    data in the SM disaggregation process. Download : Download high-res image (187KB)

    (Disaggregated, TC-merged, CLDAS, CCI Passive, and CCI Active), interpolated LST
    and EVI data. Regarding the temporal trends, the five SM products exhibited similar
    patterns: in winter, the SM values were lower on January 23 because of frozen
    soil and sparse vegetation. Then, SM increased on April 21 as soil temperatures
    rose and snowmelt occurred. In summer, temperatures and evaporation rates continue
    to increase. However, as shown in the EVI figure, the lush vegetation growth in
    summer helps to reduce evaporation and increase water retention in soil. As a
    result, SM values peaked on July 23. Finally, SM gradually decreased as precipitation
    decreased and vegetation withered in the autumn. Compared to other SM products,
    the disaggregated product has a finer spatial resolution, which characterizes
    the spatial heterogeneity of SM within the grid. Meanwhile, the disaggregated
    product has completed spatial coverage. Therefore, the disaggregated product effectively
    captures the spatiotemporal characteristics of SM with higher spatial resolution,
    which contributes to local SM management. 4.4.2. Product comparison and validation
    with ground measurements (i) Comparison of products involved in this study A single
    validation metric cannot fully characterize the error of the product, therefore,
    four widely used statistical indicators were employed to validate the SM products
    (Entekhabi et al., 2010): (1) Pearson correlation (R), which reflects the degree
    of correspondence between the products and in-situ data; (2) Bias, which denotes
    that the product is drier or wetter compared to station data; (3) RMSE, the Root
    Mean Square Error, which indicates the degree of error dispersion; and (4) unbiased
    RMSE (ubRMSE), which measures the product’s accuracy by removing the bias from
    the RMSE. Fig. 8 portrays the statistical metrics between each SM product and
    the stations, and Table 3 lists the average statistical indicators for each product.

    0.044 0.072 0.751 0.034 Among the five products, the active product performs poorly,
    which may be influenced by factors including vegetation cover and surface roughness.
    For the ubRMSE, the top-ranked product was the TC-merged product, indicating that
    this study achieves optimal merging. The disaggregated product ranks second because
    the disaggregated product is obtained by disaggregating the TC-merged product,
    which is bound to lose a certain amount of accuracy in the process. The average
    ubRMSE of disaggregated products is 0.044 m3/m3, which essentially satisfies the
    0.04 m3/m3 accuracy criteria set by the Global Climate Observing System for SM
    products. For RMSE, the CCI passive product demonstrates best, with TC-merged
    and disaggregated products following closely behind. Regarding R, the CLDAS product
    exhibits the highest average value (0.782), closely followed by the disaggregated
    product (0.751). The difference between them is minimal, and they all correlate
    strongly with the station data, significantly surpassing other products. In terms
    of Bias, the disaggregated product ranks second with a comparatively low average
    bias value of 0.034 m3/m3. Moreover, all products except the CCI passive product
    overestimated SM values in the Shangdian River Basin, which is in accordance with
    the past study (Zheng et al., 2022). Therefore, considering all indicators comprehensively,
    the disaggregated product inherits the advantages of microwave and model-based
    products, exhibiting satisfactory accuracy. More importantly, it offers higher
    spatiotemporal resolution and coverage. For further comparison of the disaggregated,
    TC-merged, CLDAS, CCI passive, and active SM product, Fig. 9 depicts the temporal
    evolution of these products (dot markers) and site data (line markers) for 2019–2020,
    with a total of 34 in-situ sites in the study area. In this study, one site from
    each of the three networks, large, medium, and small, is selected for demonstration,
    and the sites are L1, M1, and S2. For the site data, the soil was frozen around
    November each year and gradually thawed in March of the following year. During
    this period, SM varied very gently. Throughout the time series, SM varies slightly
    between 0 and 0.03 m3/m3. SM values between the active and passive data are significantly
    different, and they hardly capture the dynamic changes in the site data. In contrast,
    CLDAS, TC-merged, and disaggregated data are well-matched to the stations. In
    addition, all but passive data overestimate SM to some extent, which is consistent
    with the above analysis. (ii) Comparison with other 1 km products Download : Download

    products covering the Shandian River Basin were compared. The first is the 1 km
    daily product produced by Fang et al. (2022), which used thermal inertia theory
    and MODIS data to disaggregate 9 km SMAP soil moisture data to 1 km. The second
    is the 1 km daily dataset for all-weather conditions developed by Song et al.

    product to 1 km. The third is the 1 km seamless soil moisture dataset obtained
    by Zheng et al. (2023), which disaggregated the ESA CCI product using the Random
    Forest algorithm with the help of ERA5 data. Table 4 shows that the 1 km product
    generated in this study has the best ubRMSE, RMSE and R metrics, indicating its
    good performance in the Shandian River Basin. Table 4. Average values of validation

    a disaggregation methodology to combine the strengths of remote sensing and model-based
    products for SM estimation at fine-spatial resolution. The method consists of
    model-based data evaluation, seamless fusion of microwave and model-based SM data
    at 25 km, and SM disaggregation at 1 km with optical/infrared auxiliary variables.
    Based on the developed disaggregation methodology, this study produced three sets
    of valuable products: First, this study evaluates the potential of the triple
    collocation method to merge SM products at 25 km, by integrating the CCI active,
    CCI passive, and CLDAS products. CLDAS was chosen as it has the smallest error
    compared to other model-based products. The TC-merged product fully combines the
    strengths of the model-based and the microwave data, and it has a higher accuracy
    than the individual products, achieving the goal of optimal merging. Second, the
    1 km daily seamless interpolated LST product was developed by exploring spatial
    and spectral similarities between images using iterative multi-temporal interpolation
    and the ESTARFM method. After validation, the mean value of the correlation between
    the interpolated LST and the CLDAS LST was 0.931, indicating its validity and
    reliability. Finally, the 1 km daily seamless SM product was generated, by disaggregating
    25 km TC-merged SM data with the aid of 1 km ancillary data using the GWR algorithm.
    The disaggregated products captured the temporal dynamics and spatial heterogeneity
    across the study area. Given the high spatiotemporal resolution, satisfactory
    accuracy, and spatial continuity, our developed algorithms and SM products have
    significant potential for applications in precision agriculture and hydrology
    domains. In this study, the coverage of CLDAS data is for the Asian region. When
    beyond this region, it necessitates the evaluation of alternative model-based
    products. Therefore, future research endeavors will concentrate on investigating
    the optimal model-based products in various regions, as well as comparing different
    disaggregation methods. CRediT authorship contribution statement Luyao Zhu: Conceptualization,

    Alam, Malaysia Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction The Internet of Things
    (IoT) is increasingly being applied to agriculture and smart farming. Data becomes
    a more valuable resource as our globe grows more technologically networked. The
    information that farmers receive from their devices may help them make better
    decisions, enabling them to produce more safely and effectively while also adjusting
    to changing conditions more swiftly [1]. Various monitoring, and tracking systems
    have been proposed to increase the efficiency and quality of agricultural products
    [2]. While most of the existing systems focus on industrial agriculture, many
    people would like to set up their own small farms at home to produce organic products
    for daily use. However, due to lack of agricultural knowledge and infrastructure,
    people are usually unable to produce healthy agricultural products at home. One
    use of loT technology in agriculture is the measuring and control system for the
    greenhouse production environment. During the agricultural production process,
    the vital indications of temperature, humidity, and soil are gathered in real-time
    and communicated via wireless networks via M2M (machine to machine) support platforms
    [3]. It aims to collect real-time information about the agricultural production
    environment via the WAP (wireless application protocol), SMS (short messaging
    service), and web patterns so that the terminal may master the data and direct
    production [3]. Malaysia fits the description of a nation with high domestic water
    usage and high yearly rainfall. To collect rainwater for both potable and non-potable
    uses, Malaysia is in a good position [4]. According to experts, rainfall may be
    used as an alternative supply of water, which might reduce water costs [5]. Rainwater
    may be used for several purposes such as watering plants, harvesting rainwater,
    landscaping, outdoor washing, and toilet flushing [5]. Rainwater gathered is only
    suited for non-potable applications because it does not go through thorough filtering
    like local water (i.e., usage that does not require water of drinking quality)
    on the other hand, is not only better for plants but is cheaper, too. Rainwater
    is generally purer than municipal water since it includes less salts, minerals,
    and contaminants. Most gardeners feel that slightly acidic water is beneficial
    for soil health. Rainwater is somewhat acidic (pH 5.6), but municipal water is
    more alkaline (between pH 6-8.5) [6]. SECTION II. Literature Review The existing
    literature offers insights into the potential of harnessing IoT technology for
    efficient water management. In [7]. the author proposed home automation system
    exemplifies the fusion of readily available devices like Raspberry Pi, Arduino
    microcontrollers, and XBee modules, showcasing a cost-effective and energy-efficient
    approach. Notably, this system encompasses a smart drip irrigation solution, employing
    ultrasound sensors and solenoid valves to irrigate plants based on environmental
    conditions such as soil condition and user commands. This innovation, capable
    of remote control through simple notifications, exemplifies the intersection of
    convenience and sustainability. The inclusion of smart drip irrigation as a proof
    of concept further exemplifies the potential applications of the proposed design,
    providing an innovative solution for water conservation in agricultural settings
    and small gardens alike. Based on the test results, the results obtained for the
    growth of plants are very good and the soil moisture is below 60% which causes
    the water pump to turn on and the data is sent to the Blynk application. Vatsala
    Sharma (2020) [8] studied Arduino-based Smart Water Management system further
    accentuates the potential of IoT in resource optimization. Emphasizing the adaptability
    of the methodology, the study’s hardware integration, orchestrated through NodeMCU
    and Arduino IDE, demonstrates wireless control via the Blynk app. This approach’s
    efficiency and sustainability enhancement is evident, signifying its applicability
    to smart cities and beyond. Such strategies, underpinned by global awareness and
    sustainability principles, have the potential to reshape water resource management
    paradigms. The results indicate that this smart water management system can improve
    efficiency and sustainability, contributing to better water resource management
    in smart cities and beyond, provided associated strategies are implemented with
    global awareness for sustainable planning and resource utilization. The proposed
    methodology is adaptable to other water networks, making it a valuable approach
    for enhancing overall system efficiency and sustainability. In the context of
    agricultural practices in Namibia, a team led by Anton Limbo from the University
    of Namibia (2021) [9] has addressed the prevalent issue of manual irrigation operations
    among farmers. Currently, farmers in Namibia manage their irrigation systems manually,
    which results in increased labor demands and the need for consistent attention,
    especially for larger farms. To overcome these challenges and enhance water management
    practices, the team proposes the implementation of a smart irrigation system using
    Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The objective of this study is to enable
    farmers to efficiently manage irrigation processes based on specific water requirements
    of different crops. By transitioning to automated irrigation, farmers can optimize
    water usage and streamline their operations. The conceptual design of the proposed
    system involves strategically positioned monitoring stations across the field.
    These stations are equipped with soil moisture sensors and water pumps that work
    together to maintain an ideal moisture level in the soil, tailored to the specific
    crop being cultivated. To facilitate data transmission and remote monitoring,
    a GSM module is integrated into the system, allowing data to be sent to a remote
    server. The remote server plays a crucial role in this smart irrigation setup.
    It receives data from the monitoring stations and presents it in a user-friendly
    format to the farmers. SECTION III. Methodology In this project, Figure 1 displays
    a block diagram of the development of IoT-Based System for Monitoring Smart Agriculture’s
    Automated Irrigation, which illustrates the entire system from input, the system
    with the process, and finally the system’s output. The integration of inputs such
    as soil moisture sensor, DHT11, ultrasonic sensor, and rainwater sensor with the
    NodeMCU ESP-32 microcontroller. The microcontroller communicates with the Blynk
    server to display real-time data on the Blynk application. It also controls the
    water pump and servo motor for the water tank door. When the soil is dry, the
    water pump activates for irrigation, and when rainwater is detected and the water
    level is low, the automatic door opens. This system enables farmers to monitor
    their crops’ conditions and manage water resources efficiently, enhancing agricultural
    practices through data-driven decisions and automated actions. Fig. 1. Ooverall
    Block Diagram. Show All A. System Design and Component Selection The smart irrigation
    component focuses on efficiently supplying water to the crops based on their specific
    needs. The system utilizes a soil moisture sensor, connected to the NodeMCU ESP-32
    microcontroller, to continuously monitor the soil’s moisture level. When the sensor
    detects dry conditions, indicating that the soil requires water, the microcontroller
    activates the water pump. This enables precise and targeted irrigation, ensuring
    that plants receive the appropriate amount of water to thrive. By avoiding overwatering,
    the smart irrigation system conserves water resources and prevents water wastage.
    The smart water tank component focuses on rainwater harvesting and water level
    management. The rainwater sensor detects the presence of rainwater, triggering
    the automatic door mechanism to open when the water tank level is low. This allows
    for the collection of rainwater and its storage in the tank. On the other hand,
    when the water tank level is high or rainwater is not detected, the automatic
    door remains closed to prevent overflow. This feature ensures optimal utilization
    of rainwater resources and prevents wastage. By combining these two systems, the
    overall monitoring of the agricultural environment is enhanced. The integration
    of additional components, such as the DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity
    monitoring, further provides valuable insights into the environmental conditions
    that impact plant growth and crop yield. The component selection process involved
    careful consideration of sensor specifications, microcontroller compatibility,
    and the overall system requirements. Each component was chosen based on its performance,
    accuracy, and suitability for the intended application. By combining the smart
    irrigation system and smart water tank functionalities, the developed system offers
    a comprehensive solution for efficient irrigation practices, effective water management,
    and improved agricultural productivity. B. Software Setup The Arduino IDE is set
    up for NodeMCU development, and the required libraries for the selected sensors
    and actuators are installed. The code is then written to read sensor values from
    the soil moisture sensor, DHT11 sensor, rainwater sensor, and Ultrasonic sensor.
    Based on the sensor readings, logic is implemented to determine the soil moisture
    levels and control the water pump accordingly. Additionally, the code incorporates
    logic to detect rain and control the automatic door mechanism based on the water
    tank level. The Blynk library is integrated to establish communication between
    the NodeMCU and the Blynk application. Blynk virtual pins are configured to display
    and update sensor data on the Blynk application The Blynk application is set up,
    and the user interface is created to display the sensor data and control the system.
    The Blynk virtual pins are linked to the corresponding sensor and actuator data
    from the NodeMCU. This allows the sensor data to be transmitted from the NodeMCU
    to the Blynk application, enabling real-time updates and remote monitoring. Equations
    C. Hardware Materials Figure 2 shows the IoT-Based System for Monitoring Smart
    Agriculture’s Automated Irrigation of the hardware setup that underpins the system’s
    functionality. The depicted configuration includes a comprehensive assemblage
    of vital components, each intricately integrated to orchestrate the seamless monitoring
    and management of agricultural parameters. Fig. 2. The Hardware Setup. Show All
    To ensure practicality and ease of experimentation, the setup incorporates a container
    of soil, mimicking an actual agricultural environment. The rectangular box, thoughtfully
    designed to accommodate and organize the interconnected components, enhances portability
    and convenience, enabling easy deployment and monitoring in diverse field conditions.
    By effectively blending the hardware components within the hardware setup, this
    embodiment brings to life the intricate interplay of technology and agriculture.
    Based on Figure 3, NodeMCU ESP-32 serves as the microcontroller in the system.
    It is responsible for controlling and coordinating the various components of the
    smart agriculture monitoring system. The NodeMCU ESP-32 connects to the internet
    and facilitates data transmission between the sensors, actuators, and the Blynk
    application. It runs the code that reads sensor data, controls the water pump
    and automatic door mechanism, and communicates with the Blynk server. Based on
    Figure 4, soil moisture sensor measures the moisture content in the soil. It helps
    determine the soil’s dryness or wetness, enabling the system to automate the irrigation
    process. When the soil moisture sensor detects that the soil is dry which is above
    2000, the system activates the water pump to irrigate the plants. Conversely,
    when the soil moisture sensor detects that the soil is wet which is below 2000,
    the water pump remains off or turns off to avoid overwatering. Based on Figure
    5, DHT11 sensor measures temperature and humidity levels in the environment. It
    provides valuable information about the climate conditions affecting the plants.
    The DHT11 sensor’s readings are used to monitor the temperature and humidity levels
    in real-time. These readings can be displayed on the Blynk application, allowing
    farmers to monitor and adjust irrigation and other farming practices based on
    the prevailing weather conditions. Based on Figure 6, ultrasonic sensor is used
    to monitor the water level in the water tank. It detects whether the water tank
    is low or high. This information is crucial for rainwater harvesting. When it
    is raining and the water tank level is low, the system opens the automatic door
    to collect rainwater until the water tank level reaches a sufficient level. Conversely,
    if the water tank is already high during rainfall, the automatic door remains
    closed to prevent overflow. Based on Figure 7, water pump is responsible for pumping
    water from the water source, such as a water tank, to the plants for irrigation.
    It is controlled by the NodeMCU based on the readings from the soil moisture sensor.
    When the soil moisture sensor detects that the soil is dry, the water pump is
    turned on to provide water to the plants. This ensures that the plants receive
    adequate moisture for their growth and health. Based on Figure 8, automatic door
    mechanism attached to the smart water tank is used for rainwater harvesting by
    using servo motor sensor. It is controlled by the NodeMCU and the ultrasonic sensor.
    Based on Figure 9, during raining and the water in the tank is low, the system
    opens the automatic door to collect rainwater. The automatic door remains open
    until the water level sensor detects that the water tank is filled to a sufficient
    level which is more than 50% and below 100%. This mechanism prevents rainwater
    wastage and allows efficient utilization of available water resources. Based on
    Figure 10, Blynk application provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring
    the smart agriculture system. It displays real-time data from the DHT11 sensor
    (temperature and humidity), soil moisture sensor (soil condition), ultrasonic
    sensor (water tank level), and the status of the automatic door. Users can view
    the temperature, humidity, soil moisture, water tank level, rainwater existence,
    and the status of the automatic door on their smartphones through the Blynk application.
    This enables remote monitoring and allows farmers to make informed decisions about
    irrigation and farming practices. Fig. 3. NodeMCU ESP-32. Show All Fig. 4. Soil

    using Arduino programming language, which offers a simplified and versatile approach
    for emulating hardware functionality. The code was structured into separate modules
    to simulate each component’s behaviour, ensuring modularity and ease of testing.
    The following steps summarize the code implementation. E. Connection & Wiring
    In the Figure 11 show the connection between all the sensors and actuators in
    the IoT-Based System for Monitoring Smart Agriculture’s Automated Irrigation system
    using the NodeMCU ESP-32 microcontroller is illustrated. Each component plays
    a vital role in monitoring the agricultural environment. Fig. 11. Circuit Diagram.
    Show All Each pin connection serves a crucial role in the system’s overall functionality.
    Pin D35 connects to the rainwater sensor, which detects rainwater presence and
    initiates actions to manage water collection. Pin D34 interfaces with the soil
    moisture sensor, continuously monitoring soil moisture levels to trigger irrigation
    as needed. Pin D27 links to a relay module controlling the water pump, allowing
    precise control over irrigation based on soil moisture readings. Pin D14 connects
    to a servo motor responsible for the water tank door mechanism, facilitating rainwater
    collection and preventing overflow. Pin D4 interfaces with the DHT11 sensor, measuring
    temperature and humidity to provide real-time environmental insights. Pin D25
    connects to an ultrasonic sensor, enabling accurate measurement of water levels
    in the tank for efficient resource management. The interactions between components
    are highlighted in this circuit diagram, which also shows how easily sensors and
    actuators were incorporated into the system’s architecture. Each pin connection
    functions as a crucial link in a chain that enables the system to monitor, respond
    to, and optimize agricultural conditions. SECTION IV. Result & Discussion The
    results obtained from the data collection phase provide insights into the system’s
    performance and its ability to monitor various environmental factors in agriculture.
    The recorded soil moisture readings indicate the system’s effectiveness in identifying
    dry and wet soil conditions and appropriately controlling the water pump. The
    temperature and humidity data collected by the DHT11 sensor demonstrate the system’s
    capability to monitor and adjust irrigation practices based on prevailing climatic
    conditions. The water tank level readings indicate the successful operation of
    the automatic door mechanism, ensuring efficient rainwater collection. Additionally,
    the rainwater detection data provides valuable information on the system’s responsiveness
    to rainfall events. 1) Designing User Interface on the Blynk Application. Figure
    12 presents the user interface design on the Blynk application, which allows users
    to monitor the development of IoT-based smart agriculture monitoring systems.
    The Blynk application provides real-time data visualization and interaction capabilities.
    Fig. 12. Blynk Dashboard. Show All It shows that the top part of the user interface
    is the live situation that will happen in the garden in real-time with a delay
    of around 3 seconds. The several boxes show the conditions of the garden consisting
    of air temperature, air humidity, moisture level and rainwater detection and water
    tank door status either close or open. The user interface designed on the Blynk
    application proved to be an effective tool for real-time data visualization and
    monitoring. Users could easily monitor temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and
    the status of the water tank door. The insightful interface allowed for seamless
    interaction and control of the system, enhancing the user experience. 2) The Condition
    of the Soil. TABLE I The Soil Condition Table I presented the results of soil
    moisture, temperature, and humidity readings for 7 days. On 22 / 6 / 23, the soil
    was dry (4095), with a temperature of 32.3 ∘ C and humidity of 49%. On 23/6/23,
    the soil was wet (985), with a temperature of 30.8 ∘ C and humidity of 67%. The
    wet condition continued on 24/6/23 (759) due to rainfall, with a temperature of
    30.4 ∘ C and humidity of 72%. On 25/6/23, the soil became dry again (3896), with
    a temperature of 32.2 ∘ C and humidity of 45%. On 26/6/23, it was wet (587), with
    a temperature of 30.2 ∘ C and humidity of 59%. On 27/6/23, the soil turned dry
    (2965), with a temperature of 33.4 ∘ C and humidity of 42%. Lastly, on 28/6/23,
    it was wet (756), with a temperature of 31.2 ∘ C and humidity of 57%. Notably,
    on 24/6/23, the soil remained wet due to rainfall. When the soil moisture value
    is below than 2000, the soil condition is dry. However, when the soil moisture
    value is above 2000, the soil condition is wet. These readings demonstrate the
    system’s ability to monitor and respond to soil moisture levels, allowing for
    efficient irrigation and water management in agriculture. All the data such as
    soil moisture, temperature, and humidity provide insights into the environmental
    conditions affecting plant growth. The soil moisture readings indicate fluctuations
    between dry and wet conditions, which align with the irrigation control mechanism
    of the system. When the soil is detected as dry, the water pump turns on to provide
    adequate irrigation, and when it is wet, the pump remains off to prevent overwatering.
    These actions aim to optimize water usage based on the soil’s moisture needs,
    ensuring efficient irrigation practices. The temperature and humidity readings
    further enhance the understanding of the environmental conditions influencing
    crop growth, allowing for better decision-making in agricultural management. 3)
    Water Collection using Smart Water Tank Table II shows the water intake and smart
    water tank functionality. It includes the amount of water collected, rainwater
    detection, and the status of the water tank door. TABLE II The Water Tank Mechanism
    The data includes information on the water collected, rainwater detection, and
    the status of the water tank door for different dates. On 22/6/23,51 % of water
    was collected, with no rainwater detected, and the water tank door remained closed.
    Moving to 23/6/23, the water collected decreased to 38 %, with no rainwater detected,
    and the water tank door continued to remain closed. On 24/6/23, the water collected
    increased to 59 %, when rainwater was detected, resulting in the opening of the
    water tank door. On 25/6/23, the water collected increased to 59%, when rainwater
    was detected, resulting in the opening of the water tank door. On 25/6/23, the
    water collected remained at 59%, but no rainwater was detected, so the water tank
    door remained closed. On 26/6/23, the water collected decreased to 40%, with no
    rainwater detected, and the water tank door closed. The same pattern continued
    on 27/6/23, with 40% water collected and no rainwater detected, resulting in the
    water tank door remaining closed. Lastly, on 28/6/23, the water collected further
    decreased to 28%, with no rainwater detected, and the water tank door remained
    closed. These observations demonstrate the effectiveness of the IoT-Based Smart
    Agriculture Monitoring System in accurately detecting rainwater and managing the
    water tank door accordingly, allowing for efficient rainwater collection and preventing
    overflow. 4) Product Comparison TABLE III Product Comparison To assess the system’s
    competitiveness and uniqueness, a comparison was conducted against some of the
    ready market products. Table III presented the capabilities and features related
    to soil moisture sensing and irrigation control. The IoT-Based System for Monitoring
    Smart Agriculture’s Automated Irrigation system outperformed the market products
    by integrating additional functionalities such as temperature and humidity monitoring,
    real-time data visualization through the Blynk Application, and automatic rainwater
    harvesting. Based on Table III, the available product A offers limited functionality,
    consisting of a soil moisture sensor to detect soil conditions and a battery-operated
    water pump for basic irrigation. Although this product may have a lower price
    point, it lacks comprehensive monitoring capabilities and sustainable water management
    features. In contrast, the IoT- based system integrates multiple sensors, including
    soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and rainwater detection, providing farmers
    with a holistic view of their crop’s environment. This comprehensive approach
    allows for better crop health assessment and precise irrigation control, leading
    to improved crop productivity. Based on Table III, product B boasts an advanced
    watering mechanism, offering programmable settings and water pipe connectivity
    for specific plants. Also, the product provides a setting that could help users
    step up the irrigation schedule. However, this enhanced functionality comes at
    a higher cost, potentially limiting accessibility for some farmers. In comparison,
    the IoT-based system achieves a balance between advanced functionality and costeffectiveness.
    Through the utilization of affordable components, optimized resource usage, and
    rainwater harvesting, the system provides farmers with a sustainable and cost-efficient
    solution for smart agriculture practices. In evaluating the communication capabilities
    of the three systems, a pronounced distinction becomes evident in Table III. IoT-based
    smart agriculture monitoring system, utilizing the NodeMCU ESP-32 with its inherent
    WiFi communication protocol, enjoys a notable advantage, enabling seamless data
    exchange between components akin to a cohesive team with effective communication.
    This facilitates real-time data transmission from sensors to the central control
    unit and your smartphone via the Blynk app, ensuring both efficient operation
    and instant field insights. In contrast, the other two ready market products lack
    this sophisticated communication protocol, limiting their individual functions
    without holistic coordination. This comparison highlights the enhanced effectiveness
    of the system in data collection, sharing, and responsive action, showcasing its
    superior intelligence and connectivity compared to alternatives, thereby exemplifying
    the innovation brought about by IoT integration in modem agriculture practices.
    Both ready market products lack real-time data insights for informed decision-making.
    In contrast, the IoT-based system empowers farmers with data-driven decision-making
    capabilities. The Blynk application displays real-time information about soil
    condition, water levels, and weather, enabling farmers to make timely and informed
    choices regarding irrigation and crop management. This real-time monitoring feature
    enhances the system’s efficiency, ensuring optimal water usage and resource management.
    SECTION V. Conclusion The development of the IoT-Based System for Monitoring Smart
    Agriculture’s Automated Irrigation using the NodeMCU ESP-32 microcontroller has
    resulted in a successful and efficient solution for smart agriculture. The system,
    equipped with various sensors including soil moisture, temperature, humidity,
    and rainwater detection, along with the integration of the Blynk application,
    provides real-time monitoring of crucial agricultural parameters. The system’s
    automatic door mechanism for water tank management ensures optimal water collection
    during low levels and prevents overflow during high levels. The study achievements
    highlight the potential of IoT-based solutions in improving resource management,
    enhancing agricultural practices, and ultimately contributing to sustainable and
    efficient farming operations. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors are grateful for the

  description: Due to the impacts of climate change and human activities on scarcity
    and uneven spatial distribution of water resources, water use efficiency (WUE)
    has gained significant attention. Currently, there is a lack of research on estimating
    WUE with higher accuracy and stronger mechanism on the large regional scale. This
    study systematically reviewed the status and hotspots from an amount of studies
    and analyzed various concepts and estimation methods of WUE at different scales.
    Additionally, we discussed the limitations and challenges of these studies to
    point out the future opportunities. WUE at different scales could not be directly
    scale transferred as WUE varied at various scales. Recently, the remote sensing
    gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) products, the remote
    sensing crop distribution recognition models, remote sensing ET and yield estimation
    models have improved the accuracy of WUE estimation at the regional scale, but
    lack of mechanical explanation. However, data assimilation provided a stronger
    mechanistic interpretation of WUE estimation at the regional scale by coupling
    remote sensing data and crop models. Optimized data assimilation method for coupling
    multi-source remote sensing fusion platform, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform
    and crop model would be a better approach to quantify WUE of the large area in
    the future. It is also necessary to incorporate crop types and irrigation allocations
    into high spatial resolution crop-specific WUE modeling. Therefore, integrating
    multi-source remote sensing data, ensemble using multi-crop models, innovating
    near-real-time seamless efficient data assimilation algorithms at the regional
    scale, and refining multi-variables assimilation at different crop growth stages
    are the research hotspots in the future. This study will provide useful guidance
    for optimizing water resource management in precision agriculture and improving
    the efficient utilization of water resources.

    1. Introduction Water use efficiency (WUE) is an important indicator for coupling
    the water-carbon cycle, energy conversion, resource utilization, and global change
    (Cai et al., 2021; Hatfield and Dold, 2019; Huang et al., 2017). WUE is primarily
    concerned with the physical flow of water (Nay-Htoon et al., 2013). WUE represents
    the balance between gains (carbon acquisition or crop yield) and costs (transpiration
    and water applied) (Bchir et al., 2016). Crop WUE was used to assess the feasibility
    of agricultural water saving management schemes as a typical evaluation reference
    (Leghari et al., 2021; Liao et al., 2019; Liu and Song, 2020a). Optimizing crop
    water use by improving WUE was also a response strategy to ensure sustainable
    agricultural development in arid and semi-arid regions (Michelon et al., 2020).
    However, WUE improvement still is a challenge for agriculture in arid and semi-arid
    regions due to increasing irrigated acreage and higher water demands on crops,
    which consume about 70 % of the water available to humans (Bhattacharya, 2019;
    Jabeen et al., 2022). Disputes over water use for agriculture, industry, domestic
    use, direct human consumption, and other purposes have been increased by global
    water scarcity (Medrano et al., 2015), and these disputes will continue to spread.
    The imbalance in the spatial distribution of global water resources was accelerated
    due to climate change, frequent extreme weather events and human activities (Aoubouazza
    et al., 2013; Lang et al., 2017; Wang and Qin, 2017; Zhang et al., 2019a). With
    the aggravation of water disputes among various industries and the increasing
    imbalance in the spatial distribution of water resources, more and more studies
    focused on WUE. Higher food demand challenges caused by population growth and
    limited available water resources will lead the ultimate goal of future WUE research
    to produce more economic output with less water. Therefore, research on WUE will
    be critical to alleviating global food security, water security and ecological
    security crises. WUE was used as the subject term to search on ScienceDirect,
    and the annual number and cumulative number of WUE publications were statistically
    analyzed (Fig. S1). The results showed that: (1) over the last 10 years, the average
    number of WUE papers published per year reached 474. (2) the cumulative number
    of WUE publications in 2023 was more than 6900, a 118-fold increase compared to
    1999. The similarity analysis of high-frequency terms containing WUE in the titles
    and abstracts of the articles was conducted to obtain the clustering map of WUE
    research subject words (Fig. S2). The analysis results showed that current research
    on WUE is widely concentrated in four aspects. (1) Analysis of mainly external
    environment factors affecting WUE, including: climate change (Bagula et al., 2022;
    Nie et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2020), soil water (Han et al., 2023; Hao et al.,
    2021; Soothar et al., 2021), evapotranspiration, crop rotation (Oroo, 2021; Sainju
    et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2021b); tillage practices (Guo et al., 2020; Lin et
    al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020), fallow management (Adil et al., 2022; Williams et
    al., 2020); irrigation scheduling or strategies (Guo et al., 2022; Heidari et
    al., 2022; Lu et al., 2022), mulching technologies (Bai et al., 2022; Duan et
    al., 2021; Yin et al., 2022), fertilizer management (Moradgholi et al., 2022;
    Yang et al., 2023; Zhai et al., 2022), water fertilizer coupling (Peng et al.,
    2023; Sun et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2022); nutrient management (Ahmed et al.,
    2019; Akarsh et al., 2020; Ashoka and Shashadhar, 2020), biochar amendment (Fischer
    et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021a). (2) How to improve crop WUE
    based on field trials (Faloye et al., 2019; Fan et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2023)
    and meta-analysis (Wu et al., 2022b; Yin et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2020). We found
    that the mechanism for increasing WUE was achieved by improving photosynthetic
    capacity to reduce respiratory consumption and decreasing leaf transpiration and
    ineffective soil evaporation. (3) The impact of drought on terrestrial ecosystems,
    croplands, or crop WUE (Pei et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2021a; Zhao et al., 2020).
    (4) WUE analysis of main crops (Jiu-jiang et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2021b), especially
    some C3 and C4 crops (De Haan et al., 2021; Israel et al., 2022; Ozeki et al.,
    2022). Therefore, the analysis of external environment factors that affect WUE
    and how to improve WUE as the research hotspots of WUE has led to most review
    articles on WUE were also concentrated on reporting the factors that affect WUE
    (Fukai and Mitchell, 2022; Liyanage et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023) and the
    measures to improve WUE (Eshete et al., 2020; Kang et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2020).
    In fact, all studies on WUE have to be based on the reliable accuracy of WUE estimation.
    The accurate estimating of WUE at various levels was considered as a prerequisite
    for carrying out related research on WUE. The estimation accuracy of WUE will
    affect directly WUE mapping at the regional scale. The formation of crop WUE at
    the regional scale is described through the coupling process of crop growth and
    water cycle in the whole region (Wang et al., 2023). Thus, based on the perspective
    of water cycle, regional scale crop WUE reflects the distribution and allocation
    of water resources in crops, soil, atmosphere and the whole regional system. Moreover,
    estimating crop WUE at regional scale can help crops adapt to changing environment
    better (Ito and Inatomi, 2012). Based on the perspective that WUE at different
    scales can''t be directly transferred, high WUE at leaf and whole plant scales
    doesn''t mean high WUE at the regional scale. Most importantly, point-scale WUE
    is easier to measure and estimate with reliable accuracy, while WUE estimation
    at the regional scale is more complex and requires improved reliability for accuracy
    (Jiang et al., 2022). The role of WUE estimation accuracy has not received enough
    attention at present, and there are few studies on improving WUE estimation accuracy
    using the improvement and innovation methods of estimation WUE at the regional
    scale. There was an urgent need to pay attention to the estimation accuracy of
    WUE, so the focus of this review was to locate the perspective of the estimation
    accuracy of WUE. WUE research at all levels and scales has not been well analyzed.
    Limitations of previous research include: (1) The concept and scope of application
    of WUE in various fields were often confused and poorly defined and it was necessary
    to sort out the definition and application scope of WUE at all levels/scales.
    (2) The accuracy of the current estimation methods of WUE is still a key issue.
    Traditional methods, which containing field measurement and crop model simulation
    method, are still widely used to estimate WUE at a point scale, and there is a
    lack of improvement and expansion of new methods to estimate WUE at the regional
    scale. (3) The method of estimating WUE by remote sensing is still lacking mechanistic
    explanations. (4) At present, most of the studies focused on estimating crop yield
    by using data assimilation techniques to couple remote sensing and crop model,
    but few studies using data assimilation method to estimate WUE. The applicability
    of the data assimilation method still needs to be verified through extensive tests
    though it improved the estimation accuracy of WUE. Overall, there were still gaps
    in the estimation methods of WUE at various levels and scales, especially in improving
    the estimation accuracy of WUE at the regional scale. The objectives of our review
    were to (1) clarify the concept of WUE at different levels and scales to provide
    guidance for selecting WUE indicators in the evaluation area, (2) compare the
    advantages, disadvantages, and application scope of various WUE estimation methods,
    including the field measurement, crop model simulation, remote sensing estimation,
    and the data assimilation coupling remote sensing and crop model, and (3) suggest
    a basis for the estimation methods of WUE in the future. 2. Concept and evaluation
    indicators of water use efficiency 2.1. Concept of water use efficiency WUE is
    an important indicator for monitoring and evaluating agricultural water use (Hirwa
    et al., 2022). When researchers conducted a systematic evaluation of water use
    and decision-making of irrigation systems, various meanings of WUE were formed
    due to different research perspectives and concerns. Vites first used the term
    WUE to represent the ratio of crop yield to evaporation in 1965 (Vites, 1965)
    and it has been widely used to express the yield of a crop per unit of water (Heydari,
    2014). As research continues to develop, WUE can be defined as the ratio of crop
    biomass accumulation (CO2 assimilation/crop biomass/grain yield) to consumed water
    (transpiration/evapotranspiration/total water input, during the full growing season)
    (Kang et al., 2002; Sinclair et al., 1984). WUE considers the efficiency of engineering
    infrastructure design and is more focused on the relation between a unit of crop
    yield and water (Blatchford et al., 2019). WUE is designed to monitor the efficiency
    of water supply to cropland and the rate at which crops convert water into products,
    respectively (Kilemo, 2022). 2.2. The evaluation indicators of WUE WUE evaluation
    indicators include three levels of crop production, including leaf level (leaf
    photosynthesis rate per transpiration rate, WUEL), whole plant level (the ratio
    of total dry mass to water use, WUEp), and yield level (crop grain per unit area
    to transpiration, WUEy) (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Boutraa, 2010; Hong-Xing et al.,
    2007). Taking farmland as an example, the scale information and formula of WUE
    at different levels from leaf to yield level were shown in Fig. 1. The initial
    studies define WUE at leaf level (WUEL) in the 1960s (Bierhuizen and Slatyer,
    1965), and they were regarded as the basis of WUE at the whole plant (WUEp) and
    yield level (WUEy). WUEL is the exchange rate of water vapor and CO2 between the
    atmosphere and leaves (Gago et al., 2014). WUEL was also known as leaf transpiration
    efficiency (Farquhar et al., 1989). WUEp is the ratio between accumulated biomass
    and transpiration water during a given period (Bogeat-Triboulot et al., 2019;
    Gulías et al., 2012). WUEp depends on the total carbon capture and water loss
    of all crops, including water loss and respiration from the photosynthetic and
    non-photosynthetic parts (Cernusak et al., 2007). That means WUEp could represent
    WUE on a larger temporal and spatial scale (Flexas et al., 2010). WUEy is the
    relationship between the output of the crop yield and the amount of water input
    required (Tuong et al., 2000). WUEy is closest to the actual production and is
    regarded as the final result of WUEL and WUEp (Angus and Van Herwaarden, 2001;
    Fang et al., 2004). Higher WUE at the leaf scale, but not necessarily high WUE
    at the whole plant scale and yield scale (Kang et al., 2021). Therefore, WUE at
    different scales could not be directly scale transferred. Download : Download

    levels from leaf to yield level (take farmland for example). Note: these formulas
    in Fig. 1 were derived from literature review. (Boegelein et al., 2012; Hoover
    et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019b). According to the types
    of water input required, WUEy was evaluated with five evaluation coefficients,
    including rain-fed water productivity (RWP), generalized water use efficiency
    (GWP), crop water productivity (CWP), irrigation water use efficiency (WUEy-i),
    and irrigation water productivity (IWP). RWP was not suitable for arid and semi-arid
    regions as it only considered the impact of precipitation on crop yield. Due to
    the difficulty in obtaining field evapotranspiration data and the uncertainty
    of the accuracy of each evapotranspiration estimation model, CWP had limited its
    application in large-scale WUE evaluation. IWP represented the role of irrigation
    on crop yield and was not applied to areas with sufficient precipitation. GWP
    integrated the combined effects of precipitation and irrigation on crop yield,
    providing a better reflection on the relationship between crop yield and water
    consumption, and has a wider range of practical application. 3. Estimation method
    of water use efficiency In this chapter, the estimation methods of WUE based on
    three levels of leaf, whole plant and yield, and two spatial scales of single
    point and region were proposed. WUE estimation methods at yield level mainly considered
    the index of crop water use efficiency. Although the type of water consumed was
    different, several other indicators also have a lot in common in the yield estimation
    module. 3.1. Field measurement estimation Field measurement methods of WUE included
    direct measurement, gas exchange measurement, stable isotope technology, pot weighting
    method, and eddy correlation technology, comparison of these methods was illustrated
    in Table 1. WUE at the field scale could be obtained directly through the experimental
    observation data of field water consumption and crop yield, expressed by how many
    grams of dry matter are produced per kilogram of water. Field water consumption
    is generally calculated by coupling field energy balance and water balance. Compared
    with other methods, the gas exchange method had the smallest application range
    and was only suitable for the leaf scale. The sensitivity and accuracy of stable
    isotope technology were high, and dual-isotope calibration was used to determine
    not only crop WUE, but also water source and water use patterns. The pot weighting
    method had the narrowest limited conditions and was only applicable to potted
    plants. The eddy correlation technology was able to measure WUE at larger scales
    in all field measurement methods. Table 1. Summary and comparison of field measurement
    methods for measuring WUE at different levels and scales. (see reference in table
    Cheng et al., 2021b; Ebmeyer and Hoffmann, 2022; Liu et al., 2019; Li et al.,
    2020; Pan et al., 2022; Santos et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2020; Munjonji and Ayisi,
    2021; Sanz‐Saez et al., 2019; Al Tamimi et al., 2022; Alataway et al., 2019; Zheng
    et al., 2020; Baldocchi et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2020; Lavergne et al., 2019).
    Although the field measurement method theoretically determines the effects of
    WUE on dry matter production more accurately than crop model simulation, it is
    difficult to determine the spatial heterogeneity of WUE at the macroscale (Liu
    and Song, 2020). It requires a lot of detailed and complicated work for WUEp and
    WUEy to estimate the consumed water and biomass by all plants. In addition, the
    field measurement method requires destructive sampling, long time consumption,
    low efficiency, small coverage, and unable to carry out continuous observation.
    Therefore, direct measurement of WUE at the whole plant and yield level by field
    measurement method remain certain difficulties and larger random errors. 3.2.
    Crop model simulation method Crop models can simulate crop water consumption.
    The popular used models include AquaCrop (Pohankova et al., 2018), CROPWAT (Luo
    et al., 2015), PolyCrop model (Tan and Zheng, 2017), DSSAT (Jones et al., 2003),
    WOFOST (Van Diepen et al., 1989), APSIM (Holzworth et al., 2014), RZWQM2 (Ahuja
    et al., 2000), WHCNS (Liang et al., 2014) and others. Driven by meteorological
    data, crop models integrate soil parameters, genotype parameters and field management
    measurements to simulate crop water consumption and yield to obtain WUE at a single-point
    scale. Crop models simulate WUE at various levels by setting different climate
    scenarios (Bagula et al., 2022; Deihimfard et al., 2018; Han et al., 2021), adopting
    various crop varieties (Seyoum et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2020),
    changing soil physical and chemical properties (Yang et al., 2019, 2020; Zhang
    et al., 2022), and adjusting management measures (Nie et al., 2022; Rani et al.,
    2020; Xu et al., 2020). Compared with the field measurement method, crop models
    require a large number of climate, crop, soil, and management parameters, but
    reduce the cost, manpower, material resources, and frequency of operation. The
    spatial variation of soil chemical properties, meteorological conditions, and
    canopy state variables should be considered in the crop models to avoid the uncertainty
    of crops growth process simulation on the WUE estimation at regional scales. Although
    crop models can be scaled up with the GIS technique and the application range
    of models can be expanded, the accuracy of crop models with regionalized genetic
    parameters in simulating regional scale WUE is still limited. Therefore, due to
    the lack of spatial information and the difficulty in obtaining various input
    parameters required to start the simulation (Kasampalis et al., 2018), crop models
    only can simulate the water use efficiency at the single point scale, but not
    well at the regional scale. 3.3. Remote sensing estimation method 3.3.1. Based
    on remote sensing GPP and ET products WUE estimation of croplands ecosystem is
    directly obtained by the ratio of gross primary productivity (GPP) to evapotranspiration
    (ET) (Cheng et al., 2021a; Nandy et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2023). Many studies
    analyzed the WUE of crops with GPP and ET, such as wheat-maize rotation in the
    North China Plain (Hu and Lei, 2021), rice in southern India (Oo et al., 2023),
    soybean in the USA (Chen et al., 2022). Due to the limited number and uneven distribution
    of flux towers (Jung et al., 2020), it was difficult to directly obtain croplands
    ecosystem WUE by using continuous and precise GPP and ET data from flux towers.
    Remote sensing-based GPP and ET products provide a new approach for estimating
    croplands ecosystem WUE. The major global remote sensing-based GPP products used
    for evaluating croplands ecosystem WUE were shown in Fig. 2. The results showed
    that: (1) During the period 1982–2023, the main remote sensing-based GPP products
    were classified into three types: light utilization efficiency (LUE), machine
    learning algorithms (ML), and process-based land surface model (LSM). (2) Most
    GPP products have a temporal resolution of 8-day and monthly, and a spatial resolution
    of more than 500 m. The spatial and temporal resolution of LSM type was more refined.
    (3) The earliest and longest time series remote sensing-based GPP products were
    ML and a small number of LSM types, that were, obsGPP (1982–2008, 27 years) and
    GLASS (1982–2017, 36 years) products. All GPP products of LUE type and most of
    LSM types appeared after 2000. (4) According to the number of citations, obsGPP
    was the most widely used remote sensing-based GPP products, followed by GLASS,
    BESS, VPM and PML-V2. (5) PML-V2, MOD17A2H and GOSIF products were updated faster,
    especially the MOD17A2H product has been updated until 2023. Download : Download

    the color, the more times the product has been cited). The major global remote
    sensing-based ET products used for evaluating croplands ecosystem WUE were shown
    in Fig. 3. The results showed that: (1) The water balance model (WB), process-based
    land surface model (LSM), Priestley-Taylor (PT), machine learning (ML), and Peman-Monteith
    equation combined with vegetation data (PM) were the major types of remote sensing-based
    ET products over the period 1958–2023. (2) Most ET products have a temporal resolution
    of 8-day and monthly, and a spatial resolution of more than 500 m. (3) The earliest
    remote sensing-based ET products were WB type than other types, that was, Terra
    Climate products, with the longest time series from 1958 to 2020 (63 years). PT
    and ML appeared after 1982, while LSM and PM appeared at the latest after 2000.
    (4) According to the number of citations, GLDAS was the most widely used remote
    sensing-based ET products, followed by MTE, MOD16A2, Terra Climate and GLEAM products.

    by Terra Climate, GLEAM v3, GLASS v4.0 and PML-V2 products. Download : Download

    product (right circular Venault chart, the larger the area and the darker the
    color, the more times the product has been cited). Many existing GPP and ET products
    could not meet the requirements of high spatio-temporal resolution and long time
    series at the same time, and the use of different products varies greatly. The
    few flux tower data were used to verify GPP and ET products, this will affect
    the accuracy of WUE estimation. In addition, due to the complexity of the croplands
    ecosystem, a single GPP and ET product could not well represent the carbon-water
    relationship of all systems. Therefore, it is necessary to construct GPP and ET
    combination datasets, screen suitable GPP and ET products, strictly distinguish
    and refine vegetation types, and estimate ecosystem WUE under different vegetation
    types. 3.3.2. Based on remote sensing ET estimation model and yield estimation
    model Crop WUE can be estimated indirectly at the regional scale by the synergistic
    effects of the remote sensing-based crop distribution recognition model, remote
    sensing-based ET model and yield estimation model (Jiang et al., 2022). Accurate
    identification of crop types is an important prerequisite for WUE estimation.
    The working principle of the remote sensing crop distribution recognition model
    is to analyze spectral information, vegetation index and texture characteristics
    from time-series remote sensing data and images, track the evolution of crop reflection
    characteristics during growth, extract distinct time features for various crops,
    and classify them by classification model to distinguish crop types (Gumma et
    al., 2022; Sun et al., 2019). The current mainstream remote sensing crop distribution
    recognition models based on different classification methods were shown in Fig.
    4. Each classification method has its own advantages, limitations and application
    scope. Therefore, comprehensive consideration of multiple classification methods
    for crop type identification can achieve better accuracy results. Download : Download

    crop distribution recognition models for different classification methods. After
    constructing the remote sensing crop distribution recognition model, crop WUE
    at the regional scale can be estimated through the remote sensing ET and yield
    estimation model (as shown in Fig. 5). The temperature-based ET models are simpler,
    but the limitations are in producing spatiotemporal continuum ET fields under
    variable cloud conditions. The conduction-based ET models may be more accurate
    in the future, but these models rely heavily on satellite precipitation and soil
    moisture data that are least accurate when vegetation is dense) (Chen and Liu,
    2020). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. Organization diagram of crop WUE estimated by remote sensing method.
    Note: Remote sensing evapotranspiration model was adapted form Chen and Liu (2020).
    The remote sensing yield estimation models have been developed from the original
    data-driven model (empirical statistical model and light use efficiency model)
    to the process-driven model (crop model, considering the mechanism of crop growth
    and development), and even to the multi-process-driven model (coupling model).
    The coupling model can be obtained by the integration of the radiation transport
    model, hydrological land surface model, light energy utilization rate model, crop
    model and other process-driven models. Due to the limitations of various models
    and the complexity of crop yield formation processes, the coupling model will
    perform better because it considers more comprehensive yield estimation processes.
    The combined effects of the remote sensing crop distribution recognition model,
    remote sensing ET and yield estimation model provided an effective way for the
    estimation and quantitative evaluation of crop WUE at the regional scale. Jiang
    et al. (2022) used MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) index to
    extract phenological characteristics, established maize recognition model based
    on pixel classification method in Hetao irrigation district, and adopted the hybrid
    dual-source scheme and trapezoid framework-based ET (HTEM) estimation model and
    the Stewart water production function for yield estimation to evaluate maize WUE
    in three counties of Hetao irrigation district. Jin et al. (2018a) extracted phenological
    parameters based on MODIS NDVI index, combined with support vector machine (SVM)
    algorithm to classify winter wheat in the Loess Plateau, estimated regional ET
    based on the improved Priestley-Taylor method, and used light use efficiency model
    (LUE) to estimate winter wheat yield and quantify the synergistic relationship
    among winter wheat yield, ET and WUE. Compared with the field measurement method,
    remote sensing estimation of WUE saved a lot of manpower and material resources
    and was more efficient and faster. In contrast to crop model simulation for WUE
    estimation at the site scale, the method of using remote sensing to estimate WUE
    expanded the spatial scale to regional and local scales. However, the uncertainty
    of remote sensing ET and yield estimation results also influences the accuracy
    of WUE estimation. The biggest source of such uncertainty was the measurement
    error of remote sensing data, and reducing this uncertainty was the key to improving
    the estimation accuracy of WUE. 3.4. Remote sensing and crop model data assimilation
    method In order to make up for the limitation of using remote sensing technology
    or crop model alone to estimate WUE, many studies used the data assimilation method
    to combine the advantages of remote sensing and crop models for estimating WUE
    (Li et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2022a). The schematic process
    of data assimilation between remote sensing and crop model was shown in Fig. 6.
    Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    6. Schematic representation of WUE estimated by using data assimilation between
    remote sensing and crop model. The data assimilation system for estimating regional
    scale WUE constructed in Fig. 6 consisted of remote sensing observation, dynamic
    crop model and data assimilation method, the specific implementation process was
    shown as follows: (1) First, remote sensing observations (or inversions) parameters
    were obtained. Regional monitoring and sampling of cropland systems were conducted
    through satellite and UAV remote sensing to obtain regional remote sensing crop
    canopy and land surface observations (or inversion) parameter information. Such
    as leaf area index (LAI), soil moisture (SM), evapotranspiration (ET), land surface
    temperature (LST), biomass (BM), leaf nitrogen accumulation (LAN), the dry weight
    of roots (WRT), vegetation index (VIs, such as enhanced vegetation index (EVI),
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), vegetation temperature condition
    index (VTCI), etc.), gross primary productivity (GPP), reflectivity (λ), canopy
    cover (CC), the green leaf area index (GLAI), plant height (PH), crop phenology
    (PHE) and other parameters. (2) Second, the simulated values of the state variables
    were obtained. The input variable data required by the crop model was prepared,
    including weather, soil, crop genetic parameters and field management data, and
    the crop model was calibrated and verified with the field observation data. Corresponding
    to the parameter information of remote sensing observation (or inversion), crop
    model can also obtain these parameter information through simulation, and they
    were all called state variables, which were the key to integrating remote sensing
    and crop models to estimate yield, ET and crop WUE. (3) Then, the remote sensing
    observations (or inversions) were integrated into the crop model by data assimilation
    methods, such as the forcing method, parameter calibration method or updating
    method. Through spatial interpolation of input data and single point assimilation,
    the crop model was operated to obtain simulated values of state variables. Based
    on the continuous data assimilation process between remote sensing observations
    and crop model, the state variables were updated and the crop parameters were
    optimized. Crop model outputted the simulation results of yield, ET and WUE at
    the single point. (4) Finally, grid by grid assimilation was used to estimate
    crop yield, ET and WUE at the regional scale, and the assimilation accuracy was
    verified with official statistics. Data assimilation methods between remote sensing
    and crop model were mainly composed of the forcing method, calibration method
    and updating method (Wang et al., 2013). Based on the assumption that the remote
    sensing observations were true values and more accurate than simulated values,
    the forcing method argued that remote sensing can provide higher accuracy for
    state variables and obtain better estimation results (Jin et al., 2018b). Thus,
    the forcing method directly replaced or adjusted remote sensing data with crop
    model simulate variables (Kasampalis et al., 2018). Clevers et al. (2002) continuously
    forced LAI values of winter wheat obtained from SPOT data and CLAIR semi-empirical
    model into ROTASK crop model to estimate more accurate yield and LAI and better
    described this method. The calibration method was to adjust the initial values
    and parameters of the crop model to minimize the cost function of the distance
    between the remote sensing observation and the model-simulated state variables,
    and makes the simulation closer to the observations by running a recalibrated
    set of new parameters or initial values (Wagner et al., 2020). By iteratively
    adjusting the initial value of the model parameters or the state variables, the
    cost function was finally minimized and the optimal parameters were obtained (Huang
    et al., 2015). Root mean square error, least squares, three (or four)-dimensional
    variational and optimization algorithm can be used to construct cost functions.
    The updating method was a method that constantly updated crop model simulation
    data by changing the posterior distribution values of state variables according
    to remote sensing observations when remote sensing data acquisition was feasible
    (Dorigo et al., 2007). The process of the updating method was to assimilate the
    state variables obtained from remote sensing observation and model simulation
    into the continuously running mode, and the above processes were repeated when
    a new observation state variable was encountered (Zhao et al., 2013). The estimated
    value of the state variable updated at the current time was used as the initial
    value of the model simulation at the next time (Huang et al., 2019). A comparison
    of the forcing method, calibration method, and updating methods were illustrated
    in Table 2. Table 2. Comparison of the forcing method, calibration method and
    updating method, with the summary of corresponding publications, focusing on the
    technical aspects. (see reference in table Bouman, 1995; Clevers et al., 2002;
    Delecolle and Guerif, 1988; Hadria et al., 2006; Maas, 1988; Fang et al., 2008;
    Jin et al., 2015; Machwitz et al., 2014; Chakrabarti et al., 2014; Hadria et al.,
    2006; Ines et al., 2013; Pellenq and Boulet, 2004). The data assimilation technology
    helped crop models retain the advantages of mechanism, expanded the estimation
    of the model at the regional scale, and reduced the operation cost by using a
    large amount of remote sensing crop canopy and land surface spatial variation
    information. In data assimilation processing, the input variables (from remote
    sensing data sets), state variables (the most critical variable, from the complete
    crop model system), model parameters (describing the relationship between observed
    variables and state variables) and output variables (crop yield, WUE, etc.) should
    be distinguished first (Delécolle et al., 1992). The most commonly used assimilation
    variable is LAI, and the double assimilation variable has higher estimation accuracy
    than the single assimilation variable. The data assimilation can integrate canopy
    state variables with various spatial and temporal information from remote sensing
    data to optimize crop parameters in crop models (Jin et al., 2018). 4. Discussion
    4.1. Comparison of accuracy of various methods for estimating WUE This review
    summarized the advantages, disadvantages and scope of application of the field
    measurement method, crop model simulation method, remote sensing estimation method,
    and coupling method with remote sensing and crop model by data assimilation for
    estimating WUE. The field measurement method was simple and accurate, but had
    a heavy workload and large random errors. The limited number of global flux towers
    resulted in the inability of eddy covariance techniques to measure WUE at continuous
    regional scales. Due to the lack of spatial information and the difficulty in
    obtaining various input parameters required to run crop models, crop models can
    only simulate WUE at a single point scale, but not well at the regional scale.
    There were few flux tower data for accuracy verification of remote sensing-based
    GPP and ET products, which would affect the accuracy of croplands ecosystem WUE
    estimation. Remote sensing crop distribution recognition model, remote sensing
    ET and yield estimation model provided an effective way for the estimation of
    WUE at the regional scale, and expanded the spatial scale to regional and local
    scales. However, the poor mechanistic performance of the remote sensing water
    consumption and yield estimation model resulted in low estimation interpretability
    of WUE. Using data assimilation to estimate WUE at the regional scale, combined
    a mass of remote sensing continuous spatial crop parameters with the crop model
    to simulate the dynamic growth process of the crop, and had stronger mechanistic
    interpretation. Theoretically, compared with crop model simulation method and
    remote sensing estimation method, the method based on data assimilation method
    combined with remote sensing and crop model had the highest accuracy in estimating
    regional scale WUE, because it combined the advantages of crop model and remote
    sensing technology. Luo et al. (2023) reviewed a large number of research results
    on improving the simulation ability of crop models by using data assimilation
    methods, and found that taking yield as an example, the R2 range of yield estimation
    accuracy after data assimilation was significantly improved to 0.35 ∼ 0.82 (R2
    range of single crop model simulation was 0.01 ∼ 0.471). Therefore, since the
    simulation ability of the model has been improved after data assimilation, the
    simulation accuracy of other crop indicators such as WUE, ET, LAI and other indicators
    should also be improved in addition to yield indicators. Taking the study of Wang
    et al. (2024) as an example, based on Sentinel-2 remote sensing data, CERES-Maize
    model and SCE-UA optimization, this study estimated maize WUE in Fenwei plain
    of China under the data assimilation strategy and the non-assimilation strategy
    respectively. The results showed that the accuracy of WUE simulated by data assimilation
    strategy was higher and the error was lower (Fig. 7). Therefore, the data assimilation
    method combined with remote sensing and crop model had higher accuracy in estimating
    regional scale WUE than crop model simulation and remote sensing estimation method.

    data assimilation. Note: RMSE, ARE and Bias were root mean square error, average
    relative error and bias, respectively, and the data in the figure came from Wang
    et al. (2024). 4.2. Limitations in current WUE estimation research At present,
    WUE estimation at the regional scale is based on remote sensing technology, satellite
    remote sensing platform is commonly used but the UAV platform is rarely used,
    which cannot meet the needs of fine farmland scale. Satellite images reflect the
    instantaneous conditions of the land surface or crop canopy on the day of transit
    and are easily affected by the launch of the satellite, the transit time interval,
    and the cloud cover during the transit. Thus, satellite remote sensing technology
    is limited by low spatial and temporal resolution and is easy to be interfered
    with meteorological factors. It is difficult to meet the requirements of repeated
    field scale crop observation. However, UAVs have higher image resolution and are
    less susceptible to clouds. Therefore, satellite remote sensing or UAV platform
    should be selected according to the size of the plot. Satellite remote sensing
    is more suitable for large regional scale above hectare area, while UAV remote
    sensing is more suitable for field scale. Recently, ET separation methods based
    on multi-scale and multi-concept WUE have been established. However, the assumptions
    of different methods make them have obvious limitations in application. An ET
    separation method that can make up for the general limitations and has a wide
    application prospect needs to be developed. At present, there is a lack of relevant
    research to evaluate or compare the uncertainties of different methods, especially
    in terms of limitations. The current studies lack new methods to estimate WUE
    at the regional scale. The role of WUE estimation accuracy was underestimated
    at present. Remote sensing technology is used to estimate WUE at the regional
    scale, which overcomes the shortcomings of traditional methods, but mechanistic
    explanations are not sufficient. At present, most of the studies using data assimilation
    techniques to couple remote sensing and crop models focused on estimating crop
    yield. However, few studies apply this method to estimate crop WUE at regional
    scale. Theoretically, the method of coupling remote sensing and crop model to
    estimate WUE using data assimilation technology can improve the estimation accuracy
    of WUE at the regional scale, but it still needs to be clarified by a large number
    of studies. 5. Future opportunities and challenges With the development of remote
    sensing technology, various kinds of satellite sensors such as optical, thermal
    infrared, and microwave can obtain multi-source remote sensing data of multi-temporal,
    spectral, sensor, platform, and resolution in the same region. Multi-source remote
    sensing data fusion expands the spatial and temporal scale of data. Improving
    the spatial resolution or temporal resolution of multi-source data are two main
    ways of multi-source data fusion. Using NOAA/AVHRR data with low spatial resolution
    and Landsat-TM with the medium spatial resolution to extract rice planting area
    by data fusion, the accuracy was greatly improved (Fang et al., 2008). The multi-source
    remote sensing data fusion can obtain richer and more accurate information, improve
    the accuracy of remote sensing information analysis and extraction, and thus improve
    the accuracy and stability of crop growth monitoring. Multi-source remote sensing
    data fusion is necessary for the estimation of crop yield and WUE at the regional
    scale, so as to ensure food security in precision agriculture. Multi-source remote
    sensing data should be obtained through the data fusion algorithm in the future,
    and then the application research of crop yield and WUE estimation based on the
    data assimilation to couple multi-source remote sensing data and crop growth models
    could be carried out. The UAV would be a popular platform for predicting crop
    WUE on a regional scale in the future due to its portability. The combination
    of remote sensing and crop model with data assimilation technology can effectively
    combine their advantages to improve the simulation and prediction ability of crop
    growth, yield formation and water consumption process at the regional scale. And
    the development of physicochemical and quantitative refinement of stress monitoring
    in crop growth, yield, and water consumption prediction can be promoted. Crop
    model has uncertainty, which comes from the model structure, parameters, and the
    input data (Wallach and Thorburn, 2017). Considering all the major sources of
    uncertainty, improving the estimation of crop model uncertainty to reduce uncertainty
    in order to improve the estimation accuracy of WUE is a future challenge. It is
    predicted that the integrated average simulation using multiple crop models will
    be an important means to reduce the uncertainty of crop models and improve the
    WUE accuracy of model simulation (Boote, 2020). At present, the debugging of crop
    models still requires a large number of measured parameters for calibration, which
    increases the cost of parameter acquisition and model operation. The relevant
    departments should provide the measured data of corresponding sites as much as
    possible. Future research should optimize the parameter calibration process and
    parameter auto-adjustment efficiency of crop models. The sensitivity analysis
    method can be coupled with the crop model automatic parameter adjustmentprogram
    to determine the sensitive parameters to crop yield, assimilation variables and
    WUE, and run the model with these parameters can improve the simulation ability
    of the model. At the same time, crop rotation should be considered in the model
    simulation of WUE. It is important to improve the assimilation accuracy and efficiency
    by optimizing crop model with less uncertainty and optimizing assimilation algorithms.
    In the future, assimilation of multiple state variables such as LAI, ET, SM, FAPAR,
    GPP, and nitrogen would be carried out to improve the simulation results and estimation
    accuracy of data assimilation WUE of remote sensing and crop models. Assimilating
    different key state variables in the corresponding stages according to different
    growth periods of crops also helps to improve assimilation accuracy. Future research
    also could improve and perfect the assimilation algorithm, increase its running
    speed, and increase the practicability of assimilation models. Integrating multi-source
    remote sensing data, ensemble using multi-crop models, innovating near-real-time
    seamless efficient data assimilation algorithms at regional scale, and refining
    multi-variables assimilation at different crop growth stages would be the research
    hotspots in the future. Due to the lack of crop-specific temporal and spatial
    information of WUE, it is difficult to understand the root cause of WUE variation
    and develop scientific strategies for crop irrigation optimization. There is an
    urgent need to incorporate crop types and irrigation allocations into high spatial
    resolution crop-specific WUE modeling to develop efficient water use strategies
    for sustainable agroecosystem management. 6. Conclusions This paper reviewed the
    research status, research hotspots, various concepts and estimation methods of
    WUE at different scales, research limitations of WUE, future opportunities and
    challenges. The concept and application scope of WUE at different levels and scales
    were sorted out. WUE at different scales could not be directly scale transferred.
    The advantages, disadvantages and applicability scope of various current WUE estimation
    methods were compared. Remote sensing method for estimation WUE overcame the shortcomings
    of field measurement and crop model simulation. Using data assimilation to couple
    remote sensing and crop model for estimating WUE at regional scale, and combining
    a mass of remote sensing continuous spatial crop parameters with crop model, it
    has a stronger mechanistic interpretation. However, improving WUE estimation accuracy
    through enhanced data assimilation efficiency remains a difficult problem. Future
    opportunities and challenges for WUE estimation methods were provided. It is predicted
    that optimized data assimilation between multi-source remote sensing fusion, UAV
    and crop model would be an effective method for future large-scale WUE estimation.
    However, reducing uncertainty in crop models and improving assimilation algorithms
    to achieve higher assimilation accuracy and efficiency are still the focus of
    future studies. Urgently incorporating crop types and irrigation allocations into
    high resolution, crop-specific WUE modeling is essential for developing efficient
    water use strategies. Integrating multi-source remote sensing data, ensemble using
    multi-crop models, innovating near-real-time seamless efficient data assimilation
    algorithms at regional scale, and refining multi-variables assimilation at different
    crop growth stages are the future hotspots. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    1. Introduction Agriculture 4.0 consists of an upgrade of the usual farming techniques
    and has the scope to create a more sustainable and efficient agriculture system
    that can produce higher yields while minimizing the impact on the environment.
    By using advanced technologies, farmers can make more informed decisions, reduce
    waste, and optimize resource utilization, leading to a more sustainable and profitable
    agriculture industry. Agriculture 4.0 encompasses the advancement of precision
    farming and refers to all agricultural actions that are based on a precise and
    accurate analysis of data and information acquired and transferred using advanced
    tools and technology. This refers to the tools and techniques that allow for the
    synergistic use of a variety of digital 4.0 technologies, allowing for the automatic
    collection, integration, and analysis of data collected from the field, sensors,
    or other third-party sources. Agriculture 4.0 refers to the application of the
    Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, artificial intelligence, and robotics to extend,
    accelerate, and improve the efficiency of operations affecting the entire production
    chain [1]. Some innovations are: Process automation: thanks to the use of drones
    and sensors, it is possible to monitor crops throughout their growth phase, as
    well as check the state of well-being or the need to irrigate and fertilize the
    soil. There are countless benefits associated with drones in the context of the
    agricultural industry. In fact, they can be of help to farmers in acquiring data
    on the state of stress of plants and observing the movements of livestock, but
    they can also allow the identification of diseases in plants and animals, allowing
    timely interventions. The use of GIS: thanks to this software that can integrate
    data of different natures, it is possible to efficiently determine (according
    to different parameters such as soil pH, temperature, and humidity) the position
    of the crops, the land use, and the need for fertilization and irrigation. It
    is also possible to carry out an analysis of historical data to provide farmers
    with tools that allow them to choose the best conditions for their crops. Of fundamental
    importance is the sustainable management of the environment and the planet’s resources,
    including water. As is known, intelligent consumption of this resource is essential
    in the field of agriculture, [2]. Moreover, there are many studies carried out
    on the automation of agricultural vehicles and the monitoring of crops and livestock.
    The advent of robotics in agriculture has allowed numerous benefits, including
    an increase in productivity, the acceleration of operations in the procedures
    related to the maintenance of cultivation, as well as safety during production
    processes and precision in the analysis of the possible interventions to be carried
    out to optimize the harvest [3,4]. The GIS (Geographic Information System) is
    a crucial tool frequently utilized in the realm of Agriculture 4.0. It has numerous
    applications, particularly in precision agriculture, such as assessing the potential
    of agricultural waste to generate bioenergy [5]. Particularly useful are open-source
    GISs that allow for the implementation of internal functions (including forecasting
    ones) useful in various application fields, also allowing interaction with external
    technologies in real time. As it is known, diverse data types can be incorporated
    into the GIS, including free satellite data, although many of these data are limited
    due to their low resolution. As a result, higher spatial and temporal resolution
    multispectral UAV images must be combined with this data to resolve this limitation.
    To address the issue of integrating non-uniform data, data fusion techniques are
    frequently employed [6,7]. So, in the literature, extensive studies could be found
    regarding the technologies, materials, algorithms, and protocols involved in this
    research, but less could be found regarding their integration. The present research
    fits into this context by proposing as the main novelty the use of an atmospheric
    experimental simulator capable of providing punctual variables, which, together
    with local sensor data and the data fusion of satellite and drone images, are
    all managed by an open-source GIS capable of estimating fundamental parameters
    related to the cultivation and automation of agricultural vehicles. This estimation
    is in the frame of a strategic management of crops through the identification
    of local optimal cultivation typologies and the automation of optimal field route
    planning for both self-driving tractors and UAVs, which is further useful for
    tactical in-season crop monitoring to guide crop irrigation and fertilization
    management. 2. Materials and Methods During experimentations, in order to identify
    areas that best fit the different possible typologies of cultivation and to plan
    the routes of both self-driving tractors and UAVs, we have used different systems,
    algorithms, and methodologies structured and integrated with each other as schematically
    shown in the flow diagram in Figure 1. Referred to in more detail: An open-source
    GIS, in particular the open-source QGIS; an innovative and experimental atmospheric
    simulator; satellite and UAV images, local sensors; algorithms and protocols for
    data transmission. Figure 1. Flow diagram developed in the frame of Agriculture
    4.0 concept illustrating the methodological scheme and the different integrated
    systems, algorithms, and methodologies aiming to identify areas that best fit
    the different possible typologies of cultivation and to plan the optimal routes
    of both self-driving tractors and UAVs as final products of the built strategic
    management system for crop irrigation and fertilization. Firstly, the atmospheric
    simulator (using as inputs the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the territory,
    weather sensor data, radar data, and very large-scale weather models) was used
    to obtain, as outputs, the punctual values of some characteristic weather variables:
    precipitation, wind, pressure, and temperature, which were subsequently reprocessed
    to obtain DEM layers of these variables. (Weather variables such as precipitation,
    wind, pressure, and temperature are important for Agriculture 4.0 because they
    directly influence the environmental conditions that can have an impact on crops.
    Precipitation is crucial for the water supply of plants; wind can affect growth
    and disease spread; atmospheric pressure provides information about imminent climatic
    changes; and temperature influences plant growth and maturation). The validation
    of the results obtained was performed through the combination of different ground
    truth devices: local sensors (soil moisture sensor, leaf wetness sensor, pH sensor,
    temperature and humidity sensor, and barometric pressure sensor), using wireless
    sensor network nodes (WSNn). This WSN was supported with the ZigBee protocol (Texas
    Instruments, Dallas, TX, USA), an ATmega128L microcontroller (Microchip Technology
    Inc., Chandler, AZ, USA), and a solar cell module (Canadian Solar, Guelph, ON,
    Canada) with the aim of collecting information from various sensors and passing
    the information to a cloud server. Through the data fusion technique [8], we have
    combined satellite data and UAV images to establish important indices used as
    an indication of vegetation richness and to capture soil differences: NDVI (normalized
    difference vegetation index), LST (land surface temperature), NDMI (normalized
    difference moisture index), and BSI (bare soil index). In particular, the satellite
    images used are: Sentinel-2, Level 2A: Level 2A of Sentinel-2 processing includes
    a scene classification and an atmospheric correction applied to Top-Of-Atmosphere
    (TOA) Level-1C orthoimage products. Level-2A’s main output is an orthoimage bottom-of-atmosphere
    (BOA) corrected reflectance product. WorldView-3: capable of acquiring images
    at 31 cm panchromatic, 1.24 m multispectral, 3.7 m shortwave infrared, and 30
    m CAVIS (clouds, aerosols, vapors, ice, and snow) resolution. As regards UAV images,
    a Micasense Altum Camera was used to capture multispectral photos with a DJI Matrice
    600 Pro. This camera is ideal for agricultural use since it can collect photos
    of crops in both visible and infrared wavelengths at the same time. The drone
    flew around 30 m above the ground, producing aerial GSD photos with a resolution
    of 5 cm. All this information was processed by the GIS, which estimates the optimal
    automation parameters and those relating to the cultivable areas. In particular,
    the algorithms used to identify the cultivable areas are as follows: Spatial data
    analysis algorithms, in particular buffering, intersection, overlay, and clustering
    analysis, are useful for identifying areas of interest, evaluating the proximity
    of climatic data, sensor data, and DEM data, and carrying out comparative analyses
    between different areas. Raster analysis algorithms to extract information from
    raster data such as DEM and NDVI by calculating terrain statistics and identifying
    specific slope or elevation areas that are best suited for certain crops. Supervised
    classification algorithms such as random forest, support vector machine (SVM),
    and neural networks to classify image data to determine crop typology and to build
    a predictive model. These algorithms are available as plugins or additional extensions
    that can be installed and used within the QGIS environment. In relation to the
    algorithms used for tractor automation, QGIS includes a number of tools and algorithms
    that can be used to perform routing analysis and route planning and also supports
    the use of additional plugins and integration with other tools and libraries that
    offer advanced routing and route optimization features. Specifically, the “Network
    Analysis Library (NAl)” and “pgRouting” plugins were used to perform advanced
    routing analysis within QGIS. These plugins offer optimized routing algorithms
    that take into account factors such as obstacles, speed constraints, and specific
    preferences to calculate optimal routes, always keeping in mind the necessary
    use of GPS for positioning and referenced cartography for displaying the position.
    As regards the parameters, the output parameters for identifying the cultivable
    areas are as follows: Crop classification map: Using the supervised or unsupervised
    classification algorithms, it was possible to generate a crop classification map
    that assigns the estimated crop type to each area of the study area. Crop suitability
    assessment: Based on the analysis of climate data, local sensor data, DEM, and
    NDVI, it was possible to generate a crop suitability assessment for the study
    area. Analysis of environmental characteristics: The analysis of climate data,
    local sensor data, DEM, and NDVI provided information on the environmental characteristics
    of the study area, including maps of temperature, precipitation, soil moisture,
    and soil pH, which have been used to evaluate the adaptability of crops to local
    environmental conditions. Analysis report: They included statistics on the prevailing
    crops, indicators of crop suitability, analyses of environmental characteristics,
    and other relevant information for determining the type of cultivation in the
    study area. Tabular output data: In addition to the maps and reports, tabular
    output data have been produced, which reports detailed information on the study
    area. In relation to the automation of the tractor, the output parameters are
    GPS coordinates (in real time), driving routes (to maximize operation efficiency),
    speed control (to ensure safe and efficient driving), sensor monitoring (to detect
    any obstacles, avoid collisions and efficiently manage the resources of the tractor),
    actuator control (to ensure precise and smooth driving according to the routes
    and instructions provided), ground condition monitoring (to adapt the driving
    of the tractor, make decisions in real time and to optimize the use of resources),
    alarms and warnings (to alert the operator or user in case of emergency situations,
    unforeseen obstacles or technical problems during automated driving), and performance
    monitoring (for operations management). Then, through Cannelloni software (written
    in C++11 and capable of transferring CAN frames between two machines using UDP)
    and a series of protocols (datagram protocol (UDP) or stream control transmission
    protocol (SCTP), which are supported by Cannelloni software. In some cases, it
    is necessary to convert SCTP to the transmission control protocol (TCP)). The
    data are transmitted to the agricultural vehicle, which will have the task of
    irrigating and fertilizing the area according to the vegetation’s needs, and to
    the drone, which will have the task of monitoring the existing cultivation. As
    a result, it is possible to visualize the different typologies on the GIS of areas
    suitable for cultivation related to land, water, and climate parameters. 2.1.
    Geografic Information System Geographic Information System (GIS) technology is
    increasingly being used in agriculture to help farmers make better decisions and
    optimize their farming practices. GIS is a system that allows for the capture,
    storage, analysis, and visualization of geographic data, such as crop yields,
    soil characteristics, weather patterns, and other relevant information. By integrating
    this information with other data sources, farmers can gain insights into their
    operations and make more informed decisions. GIS can help farmers in various ways,
    such as: Land use planning: GIS can help farmers make informed decisions about
    the best use of their land. It can be used to analyze factors such as soil type,
    topography, and climate to determine the best species to crop in a particular
    area. Market analysis: it can be used to analyze market trends and demand for
    certain crops. Disaster management: GIS can be used to monitor and respond to
    natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and wildfires. By quickly identifying
    affected areas, farmers can take appropriate action to protect their crops and
    minimize losses. In our research, GIS plays a central role in the management of
    the information collected from different sources and in the return of important
    information related to Agriculture 4.0. In fact, the choice of the optimal areas
    for cultivation depends on several factors that can affect the yield and quality
    of the crop, which include climate, type of soil, irrigation, topography, and
    market needs. In the following study, QGIS (an open-source GIS) was used, which
    consists of software that allows one to process, display, and analyze geographic
    data such as maps, satellite images, sensor data, etc., using the Python language.
    This type of software, which is entirely updatable, has therefore allowed the
    automation of the management of geographical data, the creation of customized
    scripts for data analysis, and the creation of customized tools for data visualization.
    2.2. Atmospheric Simulator The main novelty of this research is the use of an
    atmospheric simulator [9] that, through a DEM and radar/sensor data, can provide
    important climate information in relation to the orographic characteristics of
    the land. This article outlines the functioning of an atmospheric simulator that
    has the ability to generate highly detailed weather field outputs within a restricted
    domain. With minimal input, this software can produce outputs related to wind,
    temperature, humidity, cloud cover, rain, and other atmospheric parameters for
    cubic cells as small as 50 m. Unlike NWP (numerical weather prediction), the simulator’s
    atmosphere microphysics is based on laws that regulate the interaction of a number
    of particles with which the atmosphere has been discretized. The latter, in fact,
    consists of a set of particles contained in the center of a cube (cells). Each
    of these particles contains within it a specific quantity of gas, water, and humidity
    from which its mass exchanges and interactions with other particles and the external
    environment are defined. The particles will be subjected to a force derived from
    their energy state, from interaction with other particles, or from the surface.
    Essentially, the simulator emulates the behavior of the Earth’s atmosphere as
    it relates to weather patterns and represents the state of variation of the particles
    with which the atmosphere has been discretized and how they interact with each
    other. The simulation model incorporates two solvers, L1 and L2, which work in
    tandem and process tasks at a higher level. These solvers translate the phenomena
    of the troposphere and vertical exchange into a particle representation of the
    atmosphere. 2.2.1. Solver 1 Solver L1 is responsible for several tasks, including
    assigning physical and chemical properties to particles, applying forces to particles
    based on their energy state from interactions with radiation and heat sinks, assigning
    initial states to particles and environmental elements, dividing the 3D domain
    into macro-clusters, and providing atomically referable forecast fields for each.
    Real-time data or hypothetical values can be used as input. 2.2.2. Solver 2 On
    the other hand, Solver L2 is a Newtonian Simulator that utilizes the values of
    force, mass, viscosity, and local density assigned by Solver L1 to individual
    particles. It employs a software library for fluid modeling called SPH (smoothed
    particle hydrodynamics) [10] that specializes in realistic simulations of fluids
    or gases within a few hundred meters. The library is developed by Nvidia, and
    the technology is called Nvidia PhysX. Solver L2 introduces the forces attributed
    to the particles by L1 and initiates dynamic evolution through PhysX using SPH
    Fluids rules. For instance, if there is local interpenetration of cells at time
    t, repulsion forces come into play according to the represented parameters, such
    as partial compressibility, friction, viscosity, and mass. This mechanism represents
    winds, including complex turbulence characterizations and localized pressure variations,
    such as convective or ascending situations, in the 3D domain. The mechanism is
    particularly effective in complex orographic regions, such as the Apennines, where
    sudden altitude variations are challenging to manage with classic NWP (numerical
    weather prediction). 2.2.3. General Diagram of the Simulator The initialization
    of Solver L2 involves reading an ASCII DEM that will serve as the orographic domain
    of the simulation. The particles are positioned uniformly on the scene and evolve
    until a point of stability is reached. Solver L1 processes the initial conditions
    obtained from measurements, such as sensors or radar, and provides directives
    for assigning forces, velocities, and positions to particles in specific spatial
    volumes (clusters) to Solver L2. L2 evolves by applying these directives for a
    specified time interval, and Solver L1 is informed of the new state of particles
    at the end of the evolution, including their position, velocity, density, and
    changes compared to the previous state. Solver L1 then associates the attributes
    provided by L2 with particle and atmospheric state-related characteristics such
    as humidity and temperature. The pattern detector (part of L1) creates clusters
    with homogeneous atmospheric characteristics such as cloud cover, rain, humidity,
    average temperature, and pressure from the states provided by Solver L2. The values
    referred to as clusters are the output provided by the simulator. The L1 now has
    the following inputs, which are no longer initial conditions: Pattern detector
    clusters, internal phenomenological conditions such as the position of the sun
    or the orography as seen from the point of view of atmospheric heat absorption,
    and coarse-scale boundary conditions, which are only required at the boundaries
    of the domain. The processed output then becomes directives for the new evolutionary
    step for L2, thus closing the feedback loop. For this research, we have used a
    workstation with 3 GPUs configured in SLI mode with 17280 CUDA CORE and 36 GB
    of video memory, in addition to 12 CORE Intel CPUs, a dedicated CPU Intel I7-10810U,
    and 16 GB RAM. This workstation was built to operate and cover an area of 60 km
    × 60 km. The advantages of this simulator are obvious: allows you to have a general
    view of how some weather variables can evolve in a small area and with high resolution,
    providing valid outputs in the selected area of interest; analyzes inhomogeneous
    data of different nature, therefore different in quality and quantity; use hardware
    components that are affordable and do not limit their use to specialized personnel
    only; operates at the microscale. Figure 2 shows the architecture of the experimental
    software. Figure 2. Architecture of the experimental software illustrating the
    connection of the two solvers aiming to determine the variables useful to identify
    the different possible typologies of cultivation. 2.3. Sensors and Communication
    Protocols Resources such as fertilizers, seeds, and water, the latter of which
    has become increasingly precious for a farmer, are indispensable but unfortunately
    not infinite resources. Today, with the development of new technologies, the concept
    of intelligent or precision agriculture has been introduced, which makes it possible
    to maximize crops while minimizing the resources indicated above. The introduction
    of increasingly performing sensors installed on the ground allows small-scale
    information to be provided to the farmer on crops, minimizing resources and reducing
    the impact on the environment [11,12,13,14,15]. The concept of modern agriculture
    is based on numerous physical and chemical measurements. This is possible considering
    sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Based on this concept, sensors
    in agriculture are primarily used to measure properties in soil, plants, air,
    and water. A sensor is a transducer designed to convert one physical quantity
    into another, usually an electrical signal. The latter will have to meet requirements
    such as the transmission, processing, storage, display, recording, and control
    of information. A real scenario is shown in Figure 3, which shows the real functioning
    of smart farming. Figure 3. Smart farming-based Internet of Things (IoT): (A)
    agricultural sensor nodes with associated sensors and solar cells; (B) sink and
    actuator nodes; and (C) gateway nodes and cloud computing. As regards local sensor
    communication, wireless sensor nodes (WSNs) [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23] communicate
    via their radio modules. If two or more nodes can send and receive data from each
    other, they are directly connected. The result is a network able to transmit/receive
    data to/from each other, collecting large amounts of data. The benefit for WSNs
    is due to their connection without wiring infrastructure. Today, WSNs represent
    a robust, simple, and complete wireless solution for agriculture, improving quality
    and productivity. The elements that constitute a sensor node are mainly sensing,
    storage, processing, and communication capabilities, as shown in Figure 4. Part
    A is composed of several sensors, such as a temperature sensor, humidity sensor,
    rain sensor, leaf wetness sensor, ZigBee protocol [24,25,26], ATmega128L microcontroller,
    and solar cell module, that support this WSN. Communication protocols play a major
    role in intelligent IoT-based agriculture and cover short or long distances for
    smart farming. Wireless protocols/technologies that are used in agricultural applications
    are, for short distances, ZigBee and Wi-Fi, and for long distances, mobile communication
    networks, long-range wireless area networks (LoRaWAN), Bluetooth, and LPWAN protocols.
    Among microcontrollers, the most used in agriculture are ATmega128L nodes because
    this microcontroller supports multi-level data aggregation, decision making, storage
    capabilities, flash memory, low complexity, and energy management. Traditionally,
    batteries limited in size and capacity influence the lifetime of WSNs. Today,
    solutions such as the combination of ultra-low-power nodes with energy-harvesting
    techniques make WSNs perpetually operational. Part B indicates two components—special
    nodes usually called sinks, hubs, or gateways in the literature, depending on
    their function—are added when the network needs to coordinate or communicate with
    an external network. Actuators allow for indirect intervention in the operation
    or control of mechanisms. The sink node passes all information to the cloud platform.
    All sensor, sink, and actuator nodes adopted the low-power ZigBee wireless protocol.
    This information obtained from sensors and governed by actuators is then transmitted
    via a gateway to cloud computing for data processing and storage, as shown in
    Part C. The task of the gateway is to collect information from various sensors
    and pass the information to the cloud server [27,28,29,30,31,32,33]. Figure 4.
    Study area referring to the experimentation of the atmospheric simulator. The
    area in question, located in the province of Reggio Calabria, south of Italy,
    is highlighted with a red line. (Image extrapolated from QGIS, Google Satellite
    base map). Figure 3 represents the area where the deployment of a mobile network
    is beneficial in the agricultural sector for IoT devices such as sensors and terrestrial
    and aerial drones known as UAVs, which require constant, reliable, wide coverage,
    low energy consumption, low-cost devices, high spectrum efficiency, and high-speed
    Internet connections to exchange large amounts of data. Data transmitted by sensors
    on the ground and captured by sensors on board the drone are processed, analyzed,
    and then stored in a cloud data repository through a communication link. This
    swift transfer of data to the cloud is possible in real time thanks to common
    communications protocols between sensors/vehicles and operators. Typically, agricultural
    drones are used for low-altitude flights below 120 m and use Wi-Fi, with a limited
    range of 3–7 km if on board the drone is a large transmitting antenna. Alternatively,
    for wireless control, the use of a 4G network link seems to alleviate the distance
    problem, allowing the drone to fly several kilometers away from the controller.
    To increase the range of UAVs, the 5G mobile network is suitable to promote low-flying
    drone communications and enhance the safety and security of drone operations.
    Moreover, 5G cellular networks allow farmers to receive real-time data, such as
    high-resolution video streams and other critical sensory and telemetry data from
    drones, faster and more seamlessly than with previous-generation mobile networks.
    Drones do not need to be equipped with large amounts of processing power, and
    5G technology allows all data to be transmitted to the cloud for faster processing.
    Today, cellular technologies are playing a crucial role in IoT devices. Narrow-band
    IoT (NB-IoT) is a new IoT system protocol derived from the current long-term evolution
    (LTE) capabilities that can share the LTE frequency band without coexistence problems,
    use the same devices, and seamlessly connect to the LTE main network. NB-IoT design
    shows high coverage area, extended battery life (i.e., 10 years), high network
    size (52,000 devices/channel/cell), and low-cost devices. In the near future,
    NB-IoT technologies such as long-range radio (LoRa) will be preferred for transmitting
    agricultural information over long distances due to their low power consumption.
    In a point-to-point Zigbee network, the communication range can reach 100 m in
    an outdoor environment. ZigBee’s range can be extended by employing ad hoc distributed
    and mesh network topologies. In addition, drones and UAVs can be used as mobile
    router nodes to extend the communication range within smart farming. Drones can
    pass data collected from sensor nodes to master nodes through multi-hop [34,35].
    Sensors Used in the Study In the study, five types of sensors that measure important
    soil characteristics were mainly used: Soil moisture sensor, leaf wetness sensor,
    pH sensor, temperature and humidity sensor, and barometric sensor. As is known,
    one of the limitations of using point measurement sensors is their representativeness
    of soil or vegetation parameter variability within a field. In fact, point measurements
    provide information at a specific location, but they may not fully capture the
    spatial variability of the parameters of interest. While aware of the limitations,
    we have used these local sensors because they have been useful to validate the
    reliability of the model given by the atmospheric simulator. Soil moisture sensors
    are commonly used in agriculture to help farmers determine when to irrigate their
    crops, as overwatering can be costly and damaging to the crops, and underwatering
    can also be detrimental. They can also be used in landscaping to ensure that plants
    are receiving the appropriate amount of water. Information given by the soil Moisture
    Sensor (we have used the TEROS 12 soil moisture sensor (Meter Environment, Washington,
    DC, USA) is of fundamental importance in agriculture; in fact, thanks to this
    instrument, farmers can measure the volumetric water content in the soil—which
    is the amount of water present in the soil as a percentage of the total volume
    of the soil—and manage the irrigation system in a productive way. This type of
    sensor uses different technologies with which the content of water is measured
    indirectly through specific parameters such as the dielectric constant. As is
    known, there are two categories of soil moisture sensors depending on the technology
    they use: sensors that measure volumetric water content (VWC) and sensors that
    measure soil tension when placed in the soil profile. Volumetric content is the
    volume of liquid water in the soil, usually expressed as a percentage. Soil water
    tension indicates, instead, the energy required by plant roots to extract water
    from soil particles. As soil water is removed from the soil, soil tension increases.
    The three most common types of soil moisture sensors are: Electromagnetic sensors:
    The most common electromagnetic sensors are capacitance sensors or frequency domain
    reflectometry (FDR) sensors and time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors. These
    sensors indirectly measure VWC based on the dielectric and electric properties
    of the soil medium (soil bulk permittivity or soil dielectric constant). The dielectric
    constant is a measure of the substance’s ability to store electrical energy. Since
    soil particles, water, and air all have different dielectric constants, their
    ability to store or dissipate electrical energy is different. Capacitance or frequency
    domain sensors: Typically, these sensors are in the form of two parallel rods
    (two electrodes) or a pair of metal rings (two electrodes) mounted along the length
    of a PVC pipe. The capacitor along the length of the PVC pipe allows simultaneous
    measurements of soil moisture at different depths. Portable capacitance probes
    also allow measurements at several locations through access tubes. When electric
    current passes through these electrodes, they form an electromagnetic field in
    the soil. The probe measures the permittivity of a soil medium by measuring the
    charge time of a capacitor made with that medium and thus the soil water content.
    Time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors: Time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors
    consist of two or three parallel rods inserted into the soil, acting as waveguides.
    When a defined voltage pulse is sent to the sensor, it travels along the waveguide.
    When this pulse reaches the end of the waveguide, it reflects back. The oscilloscope
    connected to the sensor measures this reflection. As the soil’s water content
    increases, the dielectric constant of the soil also increases. Consequently, the
    travel time of the pulse decreases, and thus, the soil moisture content can be
    estimated using the calibration equation [36]. A leaf wetness sensor is a device
    used to measure the amount of moisture present on the surface of leaves. It is
    often used in agriculture to help farmers determine the optimal time for irrigation
    or to prevent fungal diseases that may occur due to prolonged leaf wetness. The
    sensor works by measuring the electrical resistance between two conductive plates,
    or probes, that are placed on the surface of the leaf. By monitoring the changes
    in resistance over time, the sensor can detect when the leaf becomes wet and when
    it dries out. Leaf wetness sensors may also include temperature and humidity sensors
    to provide additional environmental data that can help farmers make more informed
    decisions about irrigation and disease management. In particular, in this study,
    we have used the AccuPAR LP-80 Leaf Wetness Sensor: The LP-80 Leaf Wetness Sensor
    consists of a flat surface that is placed in contact with the leaves. It utilizes
    electrical resistance or capacitive sensing technology to detect the presence
    or absence of moisture on the leaf surface. By measuring the wetness level, the
    sensor can provide valuable information for various applications, such as determining
    optimal irrigation schedules, assessing plant health, and monitoring disease conditions
    [37]. A pH sensor is a device used to measure the acidity or alkalinity of a liquid
    or soil. A pH sensor works by using a probe or electrode that is sensitive to
    changes in hydrogen ion concentration. Modern pH sensors may also include temperature
    sensors and microprocessors to automatically compensate for changes in temperature
    and provide more accurate readings. pH sensors are widely used in agriculture
    for monitoring and maintaining the pH levels of soil, water, and nutrient solutions
    used for crop growth. pH sensors are essential in agriculture because pH levels
    directly affect the plant’s ability to take up nutrients from the soil or water.
    They are also used in hydroponic farming to monitor the nutrient solutions used
    to grow plants that grow in water. In particular, for the experimentation, we
    have used the HALO wireless Soil pH meter (Hanna Instruments, Inc., Padova, Italy)
    [38]. A temperature and humidity sensor is a device used to measure the temperature
    and relative humidity of the surrounding air. It is commonly used in environmental
    monitoring systems, greenhouses, and HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning)
    systems. Temperature and humidity sensors are widely used in agriculture to monitor
    environmental conditions in crop production areas. These sensors are essential
    in agriculture because temperature and humidity levels directly affect plant growth
    and health. The applications of these sensors also include the monitoring of environmental
    conditions in greenhouses and the control of pest infestations. Pests thrive in
    specific conditions, and thanks to this type of sensor, farmers can identify conditions
    that favor pest populations. For the study, we have used BI-SENSOR (Maher Smart
    Agrocontrollers, Almeria, Spain) [39]. A barometric pressure sensor is an instrument
    used to measure atmospheric pressure. It is commonly used in weather monitoring
    systems, aviation, and altimeters. The sensor works by using a thin, flexible
    membrane, typically made of silicon, that is exposed to the atmosphere. As atmospheric
    pressure changes, the membrane expands or contracts, causing a corresponding change
    in the electrical resistance of the sensor. Modern barometric pressure sensors
    may also include temperature sensors to compensate for temperature-related changes
    in atmospheric pressure. This compensation is necessary because temperature affects
    the density of air, which in turn affects atmospheric pressure. Atmospheric pressure
    is an essential factor in determining weather patterns and can affect crop growth
    and yield. Barometric sensors are used in several ways in agriculture, including
    weather forecasting and livestock management. In the study, we used the Digital
    Barometer PS-0060-AD (Netsens Sensing the Environment, Firenze, Italy) [40]. 2.4.
    Self-Driving Remote Controlled Tractor in Smart Agriculture Self-driving tractors
    are autonomous vehicles that use advanced technologies such as sensors, cameras,
    GPS, and machine learning algorithms. Autonomous tractors are becoming increasingly
    popular in the agriculture industry as they offer numerous benefits to farmers.
    One of the main advantages of self-driving tractors is their ability to operate
    around the clock, which increases the efficiency of farming operations. They can
    work continuously without the need for rest breaks or sleep, which can be particularly
    useful during critical periods such as planting and harvesting seasons. Self-driving
    tractors also offer greater precision and accuracy in farming operations. They
    can operate with high levels of accuracy and repeatability, which can help reduce
    the use of fertilizers, pesticides, and other inputs, leading to improved crop
    yields and reduced costs. Moreover, self-driving tractors can be programmed to
    work in various weather conditions and terrains, which helps reduce soil erosion
    and improve overall soil health. They can also operate in hazardous conditions
    or environments that may be dangerous for human operators. Thanks to improvements
    in several fields of engineering, autonomous and remote-control studies today
    allow increased productivity in agriculture [41,42,43,44]. With a remote control,
    the tractor is operated by a person from a remote area, considering data from
    tractor cameras and sensors. TX/RX of data is possible if requirements such as
    latency and bandwidth for video and control data transfer are verified. A remote-control
    system includes cameras, sensors, collision avoidance sensors, and control devices.
    ISO 11783, commonly known as ISOBUS, is a communication standard that allows a
    link between tractors. ISOBUS is based on the SAE J1939 protocol, which includes
    the controller area network (CAN) and allows electronic control units (ECUs) to
    communicate through the CAN bus. Autonomous control algorithms for agricultural
    tractors use communication based on the ISOBUS standard. The Cannelloni software
    allows the connection of area network controllers on a local area network. However,
    data transmission over the Internet or a mobile network using this software is
    not secure. Control of the tractor is based on the CAN bus, whose protocol allows
    a bit rate of up to 1 Mbps. The components inside the tractor to remotely drive
    the tractor are a remote-controlled cabin, a remote-controlled tractor, and a
    computer for CAN tunneling on a mobile network [45]. All network traffic is over
    a virtual private network (VPN) connection, and communication data among devices
    occurs on the same local area network. A router connects the tractor to the tactical
    network using various mobile networks. By default, the router uses all these connections
    simultaneously and switches between them to provide the best possible service.
    The target of the remote control is to verify the possibility of remote control
    of the tractor through various trial networks. This is possible by sending CAN
    messages over the network. SocketCAN [46,47] allows the CAN interface to be controlled
    and programmed as a standard network interface. The Cannelloni tool allows CAN
    data to be transferred over an Ethernet tunnel. Cannelloni supports tunneling
    over UDP (user datagram protocol) or SCTP (stream control transmission protocol).
    The two protocols show substantial differences. In fact, SCTP is fast but unreliable
    in receiving data, while SCTP provides reliable transport but is slower. The secure
    shell protocol (SSH) is used to transfer the CAN traffic over the network and
    encrypt it. However, the SSH port is not compatible with SCTP. It is needed to
    convert SCTP to the transmission control protocol (TCP). This step is possible
    using the Socat utility. On board the tractor and remote-control cabin is a Raspberry
    Pi 4 computer connected to the local CAN using a Kvaser USB adapter. The Raspberry
    Pi onboard the tractor represents a client, allowing a connection to the server
    Raspberry Pi computer on the remote-control cabin. The remote-control cab server
    has a known address on the Internet, while the tractor may be behind the network
    address translation (NAT) and/or firewall of the mobile operator. The tractor
    software will constantly try to establish a connection to the server. If the connection
    to the server is lost, the client will keep trying to establish a new connection.
    The devices on the tractor generate a lot of CAN traffic, but much of it is not
    relevant to remote control. The same also applies to the remote-control cabin.
    So, a filter has been inserted so that only the requested messages pass through.
    Filtering is achieved by modifying the Cannelloni software to regulate outgoing
    and incoming traffic [48]. 2.5. Data Fusion Method for Remote Sensing and UAV
    Images Data fusion involves merging data from different sensors, platforms, or
    domains to create a single, integrated data set. The purpose of data fusion is
    to enhance the accuracy, reliability, and completeness of data and to improve
    the performance of decision-making systems. By integrating information from different
    sources, data fusion can help identify patterns, trends, and relationships that
    may not be apparent from individual sources alone. Data fusion has numerous applications
    in various fields, including defense, aerospace, medicine, transportation, and
    environmental monitoring. For example, in military operations, data fusion can
    be used to combine data from multiple sensors, such as radar, infrared, and acoustic
    sensors, to provide a more complete picture of the battlefield. In healthcare,
    data fusion can be used to combine data from various medical devices and sensors
    to monitor patient health and provide better care. In this case study, we have
    combined remote sensing and UAV data. Today, real-time information in several
    application fields can be obtained thanks to a variety of sensors on board UAVs.
    These flight objects receive large amounts of data (e.g., large amounts of images),
    and for this reason, it is needed to introduce intelligent algorithms capable
    of receiving different types of data and converting them into valuable and concise
    information. To overcome this problem, the trend today is to use multiple sensor
    data fusions capable of handling not only data from UAVs but also data from regular
    revisit times in high-resolution satellite imagery. So, the use of UAVs allows
    for obtaining periodic data, while the combination of satellites maintains a fine
    spatial resolution in the large area of observation [49,50,51,52]. However, the
    data obtained from UAVs and satellites are used separately; the goal is to merge
    them through data fusion techniques to obtain images useful for determining the
    indices useful for agriculture, bearing in mind all the advantages and disadvantages
    deriving from UAVs and satellite data sources, which differ in flexibility, cloud
    dependence, direct meteorological constraint, operator requirements, data management,
    and payload [53,54,55,56,57]. The “data fusion” strategy (spatial-spectral) aims
    to create datasets with advanced features by combining one or more resolutions
    from each source. This strategy, designed to extract the biophysical properties
    of land cover and vegetation cover at high resolution, is currently little used
    in fields such as agriculture. The fusion of satellite and UAV data offers a range
    of advantages, including improved spatial and temporal resolution, greater customization,
    and more detailed and comprehensive information. However, there are also some
    disadvantages, such as the limited coverage of drones compared to satellites,
    higher costs and more complex logistics, restrictions related to weather conditions,
    and the management of collected data. In particular, the fusion spatial-spectral
    method is useful to improve the spectral resolution of low-cost UAV sensor imagery
    and the accuracy of land cover classification [58,59]. Spatiotemporal is used
    in data analysis when data are collected over both space and time. It describes
    a phenomenon at a particular place and time. The fusion spatial-temporal method
    is useful to obtain biophysical parameters (leaf area index and chlorophyll content)
    of crops and make consistent predictions with fine spatial patterns. The spectral
    resolution of an image describes the frequency of the electromagnetic spectrum
    collected by the satellite. This spectral characteristic allows different features
    to be seen as separate entities. The temporal resolution of an image is defined
    as the amount of time needed to revisit and acquire data for the exact same location.
    The fusion spatial-temporal method is used to obtain information in multispectral
    satellite data with hyperspectral data from a UAV [60,61]. The obtained results
    allow for obtaining biophysical variables (e.g., leaf area index and chlorophyll
    content). Finally, the satellite/UAV data fusion improved the performance of the
    model compared to data obtained individually from satellite or UAV due to satellite-based
    spectral characteristics and structural characteristics obtained from UAVs [62,63].
    As is known, remote sensing techniques could be an important tool to ground information
    on the characteristics of vegetation through the production of significant vegetation
    indices. This information can be collected by multispectral and hyperspectral
    systems using optical sensors, and thanks to these, it is possible to analyze
    some fundamental indices in agriculture, such as the NDVI (normalized difference
    vegetation index), NDMI (normalized difference moisture index), and BSI (bare
    soil index). In this research, Sentinel-2 satellite images were used that have
    a spatial resolution of a decameter and a revisit time of six days, together with
    images captured by UAVs, which have a higher resolution and the possibility to
    catch details within the canopies with no difficulty thanks to their flexibility.
    The data utilized for this analysis included a Sentile-2 Level 2A image obtained
    on four different dates (17 May, 14 July, 30 August, and 25 September 2022) at
    10:00 UTC, as well as a WorldView-3 satellite image taken on 17 November 2022.
    The WorldView-3 images are considered to be one of the most detailed and precise
    commercial satellite images accessible to the public, with a spatial resolution
    of approximately 30 cm per pixel, allowing for the detection of small objects
    on the Earth’s surface, including cars, buildings, vegetation, and other features.
    In addition, the multispectral images acquired by the DJI Matrice 600 Pro drone
    (SZ DJI Technology Co. Ltd., Shenzhen, China), which was equipped with a Micasense
    Altum Camera (AgEagle Aerial System Inc., Kansas, USA), were also utilized. This
    camera is well suited for agricultural purposes and has the capability to capture
    images of crops in both visible and infrared spectra simultaneously. The drone
    flew at a height of approximately 30 m above the ground, resulting in aerial GSD
    images with a resolution of 5 cm. 3. Case Study The study area chosen for the
    research is in Calabria (South Italy), in particular, in the municipality of Reggio
    Calabria, as shown in Figure 4. The red line shows the application area of the
    simulator, while the application of the entire methodology was focused in a zone
    near the Castle of San Niceto, always in the Municipality of Reggio Calabria,
    with an extent of 35 hectares. This area was chosen for different reasons: It
    is a virgin area that has not been cultivated yet, so the GIS was able to show
    us the most suitable area for cultivation. It has a morphology suitable for using
    the simulator. In a few kilometers, there is a sudden change in the orography
    of the land: one passes from a coastal area to an Apennine area, and this allows
    the simulator to function properly as it takes the DEM of the area of interest
    as its initial input. The dimensioning described in Section 2 was designed to
    cover an area of 60 km × 60 km. It is a small area, and therefore it is possible
    to apply the entire proposed system and have detailed results. 4. Results All
    the data collected during the research were imported into a GIS that, using the
    methodology in paragraph 2, displayed the main results of the activities we conducted.
    As regards the atmospheric simulator software, Figure 5 shows a single frame extracted
    from the animation offered by the software, highlighting the positions of the
    particles of the atmosphere in the domain of interest. In Figure 5, orography
    (derived from the DEM) is represented with the red color, while with blue dots,
    the positions of particles in the atmosphere are shown according to the SPH model
    that rules the interactions between them and their evolution over time. Figure
    5. Frame extracted from the software showing the positions of the particles. The
    orographic trend of the study area is highlighted in red, and the atmospheric
    particles are highlighted in blue. Once the software is running, the Pattern Detector
    (part of Solver L1) creates clusters with similar atmospheric characteristics,
    identifying rain, humidity, wind, pressure, etc. Each punctual value, referred
    to as Clusters, is the output provided by the simulator, which is then imported
    into the GIS. Below, it shows an example of the extrapolation of the precipitation
    and wind values represented in Figure 6 with dots within the area of the case
    study. One hundred dots with the respective values of these climatic variables
    were produced by the simulator and reported to the GIS. In the specific case,
    the values obtained (also validated with the local sensors considering a tolerance
    of 10%) varied in a range between 0 and 4 mm for the precipitation and in a range
    from 0 to 55 km/h for the gusts of wind. Figure 6. Example of values extrapolated
    from the atmospheric simulator. The orange dots show the precipitation and wind
    values (derived from the atmospheric simulator) imported into QGIS for processing
    and analysis. (Image extrapolated from QGIS, Google Satellite base map). In order
    to identify the area more susceptible to adverse climatic events, we have interpolated
    these values, creating the tridimensional map shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8.
    The distribution of climatic events can be variable according to the seasons and
    specific weather conditions. For an accurate prediction of adverse climatic events,
    it is necessary to use local meteorological data. For this reason, an analysis
    of the data from the local weather stations in Calabria (which were used in the
    initialization phase of the simulator) was carried out. From this analysis, it
    emerged that, in principle, the areas most affected in Calabria are the coastal
    areas and the mountainous areas. Figure 7. Tridimensional map derived from the
    interpolation of points (yellow dots) representing the precipitation punctual
    values that have been determined by the atmospheric simulator. These values have
    been interpolated in the GIS to obtain a continuous representation of precipitation
    data representative of the expected precipitation trend, reported in the figure
    with different shades of blue. Figure 8. Tridimensional map derived from the interpolation
    of points (yellow dots) representing the wind punctual values that have been determined
    by the atmospheric simulator. These values have been interpolated in the GIS to
    obtain a continuous representation of wind data representative of the expected
    wind trend, reported in the figure with different shades of red. After having
    evaluated Sentinel-2 and WorldView-3 images and UAV multispectral images, a data
    fusion technique (which also leverages different sensors, such as soil moisture
    sensors, to further enhance the overall understanding) [7] was performed in the
    area of interest, determining the different interest indices such as the NDVI
    (normalized difference vegetation index), LST (land surface temperature), NDMI
    (normalized difference moisture index), and BSI (bare soil index) useful for the
    planning and management of agricultural activities. The choice fell into these
    indices because they are very relevant in the context of Agriculture 4.0 in order
    to have an indication of vegetation richness and to capture soil differences [64].
    As is known, to quantify the link between land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation,
    the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is usually employed as an indication
    of vegetation richness. But the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) is
    an alternative indicator. By studying the correlations between the land surface
    temperature (LST), the NDMI, and the NDVI, some studies show that the linear association
    between LST and NDMI is stronger, whereas the relationship between LST and NDVI
    is significantly less and varies by month. The linear association between LST
    and NDMI steadily decreases as the seasons change from summer to fall. This finding
    implies that NDMI, in addition to the previously used NDVI, can be used to analyze
    LST. NDVI values range from −1.0 to 1.0 in general, with negative values suggesting
    clouds and water, positive values near zero indicating bare soil, and higher positive
    values indicating sparse vegetation (0.1–0.5) to thick green vegetation (0.6 and
    above). The bare soil index (BSI) is a numerical indicator that captures soil
    differences by combining blue, red, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared spectral
    bands. These spectral bands are employed in a normalized fashion. The blue and
    near-infrared spectral bands are utilized to highlight the presence of plants,
    whereas the short-wave infrared and red spectral bands are employed to measure
    soil mineral content. BSI can be utilized in a variety of remote sensing applications,
    including soil mapping, crop identification (in conjunction with NDVI), and so
    on. In particular, Figure 9 shows an application of the data fusion technique
    [7] used to calculate the NDVI in the study area. Figure 9. Example of data fusion
    technique applied, highlighting (VHR image) the calculation of an important index
    (NDVI) useful for determining vegetation richness. Data fusion techniques enable
    the acquisition of comprehensive information about an area and the associated
    cultivation requirements by merging various data sources, including satellite
    data and UAV images. In particular, VHR (very high resolution) image: green =
    NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) high; yellow = NDVI medium; red
    = NDVI low. Once the data were collected from the multiple sources, we were enabled
    to identify using the open-source GIS, in relation to climate parameters, sensor
    values, and indices deriving from satellite and UAV images (wind, soil type, soil
    moisture, NDVI…), different types of areas suitable for the cultivation indicated
    with different capital letters (A, B, C, D…) and grouped for simplicity of treatment
    according to the parameters useful for the particular types of crops. Specifically,
    the available data have made it possible to identify in the study area exclusively
    three types of classes (A, B, and C) reported with different colors. Typology
    A (orange color): cultivation areas suitable for crops that do not need continuous
    irrigation. Typology B (green color): cultivation areas suitable for crops that
    need continuous irrigation. Typology C (yellow color): cultivation areas suitable
    for trees. Figure 10 shows the three different typologies of cultivation. Figure
    10. GIS showing the three different typologies of cultivation, A, B, and C, reported
    in three different colors (letters and arrows are superimposed on the original
    image to better visualize the different typologies highlighted: typology A (orange
    color) represents cultivation areas suitable for crops that do not need continuous
    irrigation; typology B (green color) represents cultivation areas suitable for
    crops that need continuous irrigation; typology C (yellow color) represents cultivation
    areas suitable for trees. Finally, using the methodology and algorithms illustrated
    in paragraph 2, the GIS allowed us to establish the path of a drone used for monitoring
    existing crops and the path of an automatic tractor used for fertilization and
    irrigation. In Figure 11, the path of the drone in an existing crop is shown with
    a blue line, the path of the tractor with a red line, and the points at which
    greater fertilization and irrigation interventions are required with green dots.
    Figure 10 shows the application of the methodology concerning the choice of the
    different typologies of cultivation in a small portion of the study area. Figure
    9 and Figure 11, representing the calculation of the NDVI and the optimal path
    of the drone and the tractor, respectively, refer to a small area included within
    the larger area represented in Figure 10. Figure 11. GIS, the optimal path of
    the tractor is shown with a red line, calculated within a cultivated portion of
    land. Within this cultivation, points requiring more irrigation and fertilization
    interventions have also been identified and highlighted in green. The optimal
    path of the drone for monitoring an existing cultivation is shown with a blue
    line. 5. Discussion The research conducted in this work aimed to experiment with
    and test an automatic integration system for crop optimization and control. The
    methodology involves the integration of an experimental atmospheric simulator,
    satellite and UAV images, local sensor data, and data transmission protocols,
    all managed in an open-source GIS. The study focused on identifying different
    types of cultivation and establishing optimal routes for an automated tractor
    and a drone to monitor crop growth and health. The research was conducted in a
    specific area in the province of Reggio Calabria, chosen for its suitability for
    applying the various technologies described. Compared to similar approaches, this
    research demonstrates several strengths and weaknesses. One notable strength is
    the comprehensive integration of multiple technologies, allowing for a holistic
    approach to Agriculture 4.0. Our experimentation enables a detailed understanding
    of crop conditions and facilitates precise fertilization/irrigation optimization.
    The tested method is part of Agriculture 4.0, which still has a number of weaknesses.
    In fact, the success of Agriculture 4.0, and therefore also of the methodology
    proposed by us, relies on the availability of accurate and up-to-date data as
    well as the expertise required to interpret and utilize the collected information
    effectively. Additionally, the initial setup costs and the need for skilled personnel
    to operate and maintain the system may pose challenges for widespread adoption.
    Despite these weaknesses (however intrinsic to Agriculture 4.0), this research
    contributes valuable insights into the potential of Agriculture 4.0. The integration
    of various technologies and data sources offers a significant advantage in optimizing
    irrigation practices and monitoring crop health. Clearly, the authors have given
    importance to the methodology and not so much to the results, reserving the right
    to analyze them in more detail through different skills for the subdivision of
    the areas suitable for cultivation. The technologies to be integrated within drones
    may be particularly promising, including increasingly sophisticated sensors for
    the performance of different functions such as the vaporization of fertilizers
    or natural pesticides. In fact, evaporation and crystallization processes are
    currently prevalent in commercial fertilizer production facilities. As fertilizer
    demand continues to rise and the availability of low-cost raw materials decreases,
    new fertilizer production technologies are being developed. Evaporation and crystallization
    techniques have many applications in the fertilizer industry. This research contributes
    to the advancement of Agriculture 4.0 by showing the integration of different
    tools and techniques. While there are weaknesses to address, the benefits of adopting
    such integrated systems for precision agriculture are significant. The results
    of this work demonstrate the value of employing advanced technologies to optimize
    agricultural processes and pave the way for more efficient and sustainable agricultural
    practices in the future. 6. Conclusions The advantages of the proposed innovative
    system are evident in terms of time consumption, human resources, and productivity.
    In fact, the automation of some fundamental agricultural activities normally carried
    out by people saves time and costs. Furthermore, the possibility of analyzing
    different types of data on soil conditions and the well-being of crops can increase
    productivity and quality and save a highly precious resource, water, which is
    instead managed according to what emerges from the weather variables provided
    by the simulator. The main novelty reported in this article lies precisely in
    the use of this software, which, through a few input data, allows you to have
    an assessment of the weather conditions. Furthermore, although self-driving tractors
    are still relatively new, they are already having a significant impact on the
    agriculture industry. With the rapid advances in technology, it is likely that
    self-driving tractors will become more common in the future and will continue
    to transform the way farming is conducted. This research focused on a specific
    area in the province of Reggio Calabria, leveraging the morphological and orographic
    characteristics of the region for the application of various technologies. This
    demonstrates that, with proper planning and implementation, such approaches can
    be adapted to specific agricultural contexts, thus maximizing the benefits obtained.
    The future developments of this research should focus first of all on speeding
    up and optimizing data processing and data transmission protocols, possibly experimenting
    with more efficient algorithms in terms of productivity and processing, and moreover,
    on the validation and large-scale implementation of these integrated systems.
    Collaboration between research institutions, agricultural organizations, and farmers
    will be crucial to promoting the adoption of these innovative solutions. The ultimate
    goal is to create a sustainable agricultural approach that efficiently utilizes
    available resources, reduces environmental impact, and is beneficial for farmers.
    This requires the continuous development and adaptation of technologies and methods,
    taking into account the specific needs of different crops, environmental conditions,
    and the farmers’ requirements. Author Contributions Conceptualization, V.B.; methodology,

  limitations: '- The paper focuses primarily on the integration of different data
    sources and the development of a data analysis framework, but it does not provide
    a comprehensive evaluation of the system''s performance in a real-world agricultural
    setting.

    - The methodology described in the paper is complex and involves the use of multiple
    software tools and algorithms, which may not be readily accessible or applicable
    to all users.

    - While the paper mentions the use of machine learning algorithms for image classification,
    it does not provide details on the specific algorithms used or the performance
    of these algorithms.'
  relevance_evaluation: The document is highly relevant to the outline point as it
    directly addresses the topic of combining data from multiple sources (e.g., sensors,
    weather forecasts, satellite imagery) using data fusion techniques to create a
    comprehensive view of system health. The paper provides a detailed overview of
    the methodology used to integrate an atmospheric forecasting simulator, remote

  description: Saffron is a highly prized and globally demanded spice.Still, the rate
    of production is unable to keep up with the exponentially rising demand due to
    a variety of reasons. One of the major problems faced in increasing saffron growth
    is the lack of understanding of the best circumstances. Factors like Temperature,
    humidity, and light intensity play a vital role in the growth and development
    of plants, and continuous monitoring and control of these factors are necessary
    to ensure optimal growth. To address this issue this paper introduces an integrated
    automated system designed to empower farmers in optimizing production while simultaneously
    facilitating data collection for research purposes, aimed at enhancing both the
    quantity and quality of agricultural yields using the utilization of sensors and
    a live data streaming application. It allows for efficient management of saffron's
    growing operations and enables more accurate adjustments. The sensors can be remotely
    located in the saffron growing areas and connected to the app via wireless connections,
    allowing farmers to monitor these factors and suggest changes continuously. Using
    this system, farmers can ensure that the conditions for saffron plant growth are
    optimal at all times, leading to increased production. The developed app utilizes
    technologies such as ReactJS and Google Firebase, and also allows for real-time
    data streaming, enabling farmers to view the current conditions at any time and
    make adjustments accordingly. Additionally, a user-friendly mobile application
    is developed to enable farmers to easily oversee their cultivation conditions.
    This paper bridges the gap between existing research by integrating the factor
    of luminous intensity and its effect on Saffron during it's budding and growth
    stage, an area which is severely under researched and finds almost negligible
    mainstream integration in similar prototype models. Furthermore, the paper underscores
    the potential for future machine learning models by highlighting the provision
    for follow-up studies using the data collected through the prototype, thus fostering
    ongoing advancements in agricultural research and technology.

    Introduction Saffron (Crocus sativus) is renowned for its unique flavor, aroma,
    and natural coloring properties and medical applications. (Rezaee Khorasany and
    Hosseinzadeh 2016; Bingcong Xing et al., 2021) Saffron has potential medical applications
    that include its role as an antioxidant, mood enhancer (Peng Zhou et al., 2022),
    neuroprotective agent (Marx et al., 2019), anti-inflammatory, and potential benefits
    for cardiovascular health, weight management, eye health, cancer prevention, menstrual
    health, and skin health (Boskabady and Farkhondeh, 2016, Akhondzadeh et al., 2010,
    Agnihotri, 2015). However, further research is needed to confirm its effectiveness
    and safety for specific medical conditions. It should be used in moderation and
    under medical supervision (Amin et al., 2011, Bani et al., 2011), but its cultivation
    is characterized by substantial manual labor, making it one of the world''s most
    expensive spices. This study addresses a significant research gap in the field,
    focusing on the nuanced growth stages (López Córcoles et al., 2015) of saffron
    and the critical environmental factors that influence its development. The aim
    is to provide novel insights into optimizing saffron production through IoT and
    addressing the challenges posed by its cultivation, which have been relatively
    understudied in existing literature. The two major analytical points are: 1. Optimizing
    Growth Stages: It is hypothesized that understanding the specific environmental
    requirements at each saffron growth stage can lead to improved crop management
    practices, ultimately enhancing saffron yield and quality. 2. Greenhouse vs. Open
    Field Cultivation: The expectation is that greenhouse cultivation provides more
    precise control over environmental factors such as light, temperature, and humidity,
    leading to higher saffron production efficiency compared to traditional open-field
    methods. This comparative analysis fills a gap in existing research. The five
    major stages of the annual saffron cycle—sprouting, flowering, leaf development,
    daughter corm development, and dormancy—are influenced by various factors, which
    have been deduced and summarized from different works as below 1.1. Temperature
    Abbasi et al. (2009) and Nehvi et al. (2022) observed no bud growth during the
    first 30 days after leaf withering despite warm temperatures, but flowering commenced
    shortly thereafter. Interestingly, Molina et al. (2005) found optimal floral development
    within a range of 23–27°C for over 50 days, though exceeding 150 days resulted
    in floral abortion. A separate study by Zhang et al. (2023) highlighted the crucial
    role of temperature in flower emergence. They demonstrated that lowering the temperature
    to 17°C after initial incubation at warmer conditions (23–27°C) was essential
    for successful blooming. Higher temperatures, as reported by Wang et al. (2020),
    can impede flower initiation and even cause existing blooms to abort. Notably,
    their research showed that corms kept at 9°C produced no flowers at all. Further
    research by Li et al. (2022) investigated the impact of seasonal temperature fluctuations
    on saffron phenology. They observed rapid leaf withering followed by flower initiation
    in late spring/early summer when temperatures reached 20°C. Conversely, prolonged
    hot summers delayed flower emergence until late autumn when temperatures dropped
    to 15–17°C. 1.2. Humidity Research conducted by Singh et al. (2021) suggests that
    maintaining an average air temperature of 23.34°C and relative humidity of 65.71%
    for 60 days during corm incubation promotes efficient flower ontogenesis. However,
    for optimal sprout development, Zhao et al. (2019) found that 36 days of incubation
    at 19.77°C with 67.71% humidity was more effective. Interestingly, both excessive
    and deficient rainfall during the bud sprouting period have been linked to decreased
    saffron production and productivity, as noted by Kumar et al. (2018). Additionally,
    chilling periods in December and January, with mean aerial temperatures around
    2.4°C, appear to be crucial for successful saffron flowering, according to the
    findings of Khan et al. (2023). 1.3. Light intensity The role of light intensity
    in saffron cultivation remains somewhat enigmatic, particularly its impact on
    daughter bulb quality and seed yield. However, recent research by Chen et al.
    (2024) explored the effects of different light intensities and red/blue light
    combinations on saffron plants. Their findings suggest that a light intensity
    of 200 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ with a 3R2B ratio might be optimal for maximizing stigma yield,
    quality, and nutrient content. On the other hand, studies by Liu et al. (2020)
    indicate that higher light intensities can compromise stigma yield and quality,
    despite promoting leaf growth and photosynthesis. Leveraging the wealth of knowledge
    obtained from previous studies, an IoT-based saffron system offers unprecedented
    opportunities to revolutionize saffron cultivation by providing precise environmental
    control, data-driven insights, and adaptive management strategies. This integration
    of technology and scientific understanding holds great promise for advancing saffron
    production efficiency and sustainability in the future. 2. Materials and methods
    2.1. Technologies used The technologies that have been used in developing the
    prototype after considering all of the parameters are: -ESP32 as the primary micro-controller
    -The sensors used are the DHT11 and an LDR -Database management is handled using
    Google FireBase -The app environment was set up and developed using ReactJS Other
    technologies used by researchers in the same field have included Arduino UNOs
    which are generally more expensive than the ESP-32. They have also used separate
    air moisture and temperature while we used a DHT 11 sensor that incorporates both
    these sensors as one and helps reduce the overall cost and size of the equipment.
    Each of them is explained in detail below: 2.1.1. ESP32 The ESP32 family of systems
    on a-chip microcontrollers features dual-mode Bluetooth and integrated Wi-Fi and
    is cost-efficient and less power-consuming. ESP32 series uses Tensilica Xtensa
    LX7 dual-core The Tensilica Xtensa LX6 dual-core or single-core microprocessor,
    or a single-core RISC-V microprocessor, which also has integrated antenna switches,
    power amplifiers, filters,low-noise receive amplifiers, RF baluns, and power-management
    modules. ESP32 used is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (112KB)

    LDR sensor and a 10 kohm resistor). 2.1.2. DHT11 sensor The widely used DHT11
    temperature and humidity sensor consists of an exclusive NTC for temperature measurement
    and an 8-bit microprocessor which is used to output the temperature and humidity
    measurements as data which is serialized (Bai et al., 2017). 2.1.3. LDR sensor
    The most common uses for photoresistors, also known as light-dependent resistors
    (LDR), are expected to discern the presence or absence of light or to gauge the
    power of the light. When the LDR sensor is exposed to light, the resistance reduces
    rapidly, perhaps even to scant ohms, hinging on the light intensity. In the dark,
    their resistance is very elevated, often reaching 1 M. LDRs are non-sequential
    devices consisting of variable sensitivity depending on the wavelength of the
    input light. Although they are exploited in many applications, other gadgets like
    photodiodes and phototransistors frequently perform this light-sensing function.
    LDR Sensor used is shown in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (123KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. (LDR Sensor). 2.1.4. Soil moisture
    sensor (under implementation) In our current prototype of the IoT-based saffron
    system, we are enhancing its suitability for outdoor cultivation conditions by
    incorporating a soil moisture sensor. This addition will enable real-time monitoring
    of soil moisture levels, a critical parameter for optimizing saffron cultivation.
    By accurately assessing soil moisture content, our system can dynamically adjust
    irrigation schedules, ensuring that saffron plants receive adequate hydration
    while preventing overwatering or drought stress. This proactive approach not only
    enhances plant health and productivity but also promotes water conservation and
    sustainability in saffron farming practices. With the integration of the soil
    moisture sensor, our prototype aims to provide farmers with a robust tool for
    efficient and environmentally conscious saffron cultivation in outdoor settings.
    2.1.5. Google firebase Developers can use Firebase, the Google-sponsored app development
    platform, to create web apps, for Android and iOS. Firebase provides tools to
    trail analytics, report and resolve issues regarding applications, and create
    business and test products. Following are some of the benefits of using Google
    Firebase: Google Analytics for Firebase offers free, unlimited reporting for up
    to 500 different events. Analytics provides actionable data for iOS and Android
    app users to make better decisions and app marketing. Authentication with Firebase
    Authentication simplifies the onboarding and opt-in experience for users and makes
    it easier for developers to create secure authentication solutions. These features
    support email and password authentication, phone authentication, and access to
    Google, Facebook, GitHub, Twitter, and more, providing a complete identity solution.
    Cloud Messaging: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a free, cross-platform messaging
    app that allows businesses to send and receive messages on iOS, Android, and the
    web. With Firebase Instant Database, a cloud-hosted NoSQL database, synchronization
    and storage of data between users can be done instantly between users. When the
    app is offline, it is still available because the device continues to connect
    to all users. Firebase and Crashlytics A real-time crash reporting tool called
    Crashlytics helps developers monitor, prioritize, and resolve security issues
    that make their applications vulnerable. their goods. With crash analysis, developers
    can focus more on building features for their applications rather than managing
    and troubleshooting crashes. Performance - Firebase Performance Monitoring Tools
    give developers information about the iOS and Android performance of their apps,
    allowing them to analyze where and how their apps are performing. When application
    performances can be improved. Developers can test iOS or Android apps on multiple
    connected devices in a single operation. They can view results, including screenshots,
    logs, and videos in the Firebase console. 2.1.6. ReactJS React is an open-source
    front-end JavaScript toolkit. It is used for creating user interfaces that are
    based on UI components. Sometimes it is known as React.js or ReactJS. Meta (previously
    Facebook) and a group of independent programmers and businesses are responsible
    for keeping it up-to-date. React can be the foundation for single-page, mobile,
    or server-rendered applications as it has similar frameworks like Next.js. React
    is only concerned with state management and presenting that information to the
    DOM that''s why creating React applications usually necessitates the use of extra
    libraries for routing and specific client-side functionality. 2.2. Application
    development 2.2.1. Application design The purpose of the application is to display
    and store real-time data, study the related objective, and help to improve on-field
    work. The designing of the application is done such that it is easy for even a
    layman to use and comprehend the application. Ease of user experience is made
    by using various UI/UX design methods such as providing white space and equal
    margin-padding to various components. Field testing is important for demonstrating
    the app in a live and demanding environment. As we move forward with our research,
    the next phase will focus on extensive field testing to validate the application''s
    performance in real-world scenarios, ensuring its effectiveness in practical on-field
    use. 2.2.2. Methodology The application is made using React JS, which is an open-source
    front-end JavaScript library used for developing user interfaces based on UI components.
    React can be exploited as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or
    server-rendered applications The structure of the appis shown in Fig. 3 The application
    is synced with a real-time Firebase database, from which the app gets data simultaneously
    and displays it on its interface. Firebase web APIs (application programming interface)
    are used to communicate between the application and server, as shown in Fig. 4

    The app is integrated with the sensors that need to be installed in the field
    and collects live data that the user can access through the app, unlike the existing
    apps that only have static elements (Dhanaraju et al., 2022). Using the live data
    and the data that have been collected, the app compares the live data with the
    optimal data and helps farmers adjust the conditions to maximize their yield.
    This app currently focuses on saffron, but it will later be generalized to help
    farmers predict which crops will be beneficial based on the live conditions of
    the soil and field. This way, production can be increased significantly. 2.2.3.

    3. Experimentation This experiment aims to validate the effectiveness of an IoT-based
    saffron monitoring and optimization system utilizing an ESP32 device. The experiment
    is conducted in a saffron cultivation environment, where the ESP32 device, equipped
    with sensors for monitoring temperature, humidity, light intensity, and soil moisture,
    is installed. These sensors are calibrated to ensure accurate measurement of environmental
    parameters crucial for saffron growth and development. The ESP32 device is configured
    to log sensor data at regular intervals, which is then analyzed by optimization
    algorithms to generate recommendations for optimizing environmental conditions
    based on saffron cultivation requirements. The experiment employs a randomized
    experimental layout with treatment and control groups. Treatment groups receive
    optimization recommendations generated by the IoT-based system, while control
    groups do not receive any intervention. Throughout a predetermined validation
    period, environmental parameters and saffron growth stages are monitored and recorded.
    Data analysis focuses on evaluating the accuracy and effectiveness of the IoT-based
    system in providing monitoring and optimization recommendations. Preliminary results
    suggest that the IoT-based saffron monitoring and optimization system effectively
    monitors environmental parameters and generates timely optimization recommendations.
    Treatment groups receiving optimization recommendations demonstrate improved saffron
    growth and development compared to control groups, validating the system''s efficacy
    in enhancing saffron cultivation practices. This experiment contributes to the
    advancement of precision agriculture techniques in saffron cultivation, facilitating
    sustainable production and enhanced crop quality. Future research will aim to
    further refine the system''s algorithms and explore additional functionalities
    to optimize saffron cultivation under varying environmental conditions. 4. Future
    work In the next phase of our research, we plan to integrate a small pump into
    our existing IoT-based saffron monitoring and optimization system. This addition
    aims to automate irrigation by maintaining optimal soil moisture levels in the
    saffron cultivation plot. Our experimentation plan involves selecting a suitable
    pump, installing it in the cultivation plot, and calibrating it to deliver water
    based on soil moisture sensor readings. We will develop control algorithms to
    activate the pump when soil moisture falls below a predetermined threshold and
    integrate pump control functionalities into our IoT system. Through a series of
    experiments, we will validate the effectiveness of the integrated pump in promoting
    saffron growth and yield compared to manual irrigation methods. By automating
    irrigation based on real-time data, we aim to improve resource efficiency, enhance
    crop quality, and increase saffron productivity. 5. Results and discussions This
    study posits the conceptualization and realization of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based
    application designed for the surveillance and regulation of pivotal agronomic
    parameters, encompassing variables such as ambient temperature, relative humidity,
    and luminance levels. The overarching objective is to mitigate irrigation challenges
    while concurrently augmenting the cultivation practices of saffron. The resultant
    application, characterized by its intuitive and user-centric interface, harbors
    the capacity to bolster the qualitative and quantitative yield of saffron crops.
    A salient hallmark of this application is its capacity to amass and archive field-derived
    data, thus serving as a comprehensive repository that may be harnessed by researchers
    for investigative and multifarious purposes. Furthermore, the software is inherently
    adaptable, affording the ability to transition seamlessly from saffron cultivation
    to the cultivation of diverse exotic crops in prospective phases, although its
    current purview centers exclusively on saffron. The app is useful to index useful
    Luminous intensity, air moisture, and temperature data along with a radar for
    the optimum range criteria being met or not for a certain study interval. The
    paramount aim of this endeavor resides in the metamorphosis of conventional agricultural
    methodologies into the realm of smart farming, characterized by the judicious
    economization of both temporal and pecuniary resources for the agricultural community.
    A plausible extension of this initiative entails the infusion of IoT technologies
    within a controlled artificial environment, whereby scientific methodologies facilitate
    the cultivation of saffron and other crops within a smart agroecosystem, accompanied
    by rigorous performance assessment and analysis. The Light Dependent Resistor
    (LDR) sensor, a pivotal component in the research, has furnished us with essential
    data. This data, meticulously analyzed and cross-referenced with existing research
    datasets, has played a pivotal role in ascertaining an appropriate environmental
    range conducive to saffron cultivation. Notably, this dataset has been instrumental
    in forecasting optimal growth periods. From a forward-looking perspective, this
    data serves as a foundational basis for the envisaged implementation of opaque
    light-restrictive structures. These structures are strategically designed to regulate
    luminous intensity, thus fine-tuning it to the precise threshold prescribed by
    our application for saffron cultivation. This orchestration ensures that the luminous
    conditions are maintained within the ideal spectrum conducive to saffron growth
    and development. 6. Conclusion The research and prototype have successfully demonstrated
    the integration of cutting-edge technology to address critical challenges in saffron
    cultivation. By developing an innovative mobile application integrated with sensors,
    a tool has been developed for saffron farmers to monitor and manage their crop’s
    temperature and humidity levels more effectively. This project has several key
    takeaways: 1. Resource Optimization: By monitoring saffron fields remotely through
    the mobile app, farmers can optimize resource usage, such as irrigation. This
    also contributes to sustainable farming practices, conserving water and energy.
    2. Data Collection and Analysis: Over time, the data collected through our system
    can serve as a valuable resource for research and analysis. Researchers and agronomists
    can access this data to gain insights into saffron cultivation trends, climate
    change impacts, and improved crop management strategies. 3. Enhanced Crop Management:
    The integration of sensors provides accurate and reliable data on temperature
    and humidity, two crucial factors in saffron cultivation. This data allows farmers
    to take timely actions to prevent or mitigate adverse effects on the crop. As
    a result, saffron cultivation becomes more resilient and efficient. In summary,
    this research and project have successfully addressed the challenges faced by
    saffron farmers by providing a reliable, user-friendly, and data-driven solution.
    By embracing the potential of IoT and mobile technology in agriculture, we have
    not only improved saffron crop management but also contributed to the broader
    goal of sustainable and efficient farming practices. This research paves the way
    for further innovation in precision agriculture and offers a promising outlook
    for the future of saffron cultivation. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    spatial and temporal patterns, water and soil resource carrying capacity INTRODUCTION
    Listen The carrying capacity of water and land resources refers to the maximum
    capacity of water and soil resources to support social development and ecosystems
    in a specific region. The arid desert areas of northwest China are rich in land
    resources and have sufficient light and heat conditions, but water resources are
    relatively scarce and unevenly located for space. Disharmony of water and soil
    resources in arid desert areas has been greatly alleviated by water-lifting irrigation,
    and on this basis, artificial oases have gradually evolved, but the ecological
    background of the arid desert areas is fragile and very sensitive to the response
    of water and soil resources development in the context of irrigation. The injection
    of external water resources has changed the original land resource evolution process
    in the arid desert areas. The unique climate of low precipitation, high evaporation
    and large temperature difference have a long-term and stereoscopic driving impact
    on the background of regional water and soil resources, which drives the evolution
    of the water and soil resource-bearing state of the artificial oasis in a complex
    system (Xu 2010; Angelovicová & Fazekašová 2014; Felix et al. 2018; Xu et al.
    2019, 2021). As a result, long-term monitoring data, spatial remote sensing data,
    and other data are needed to reveal the influence process and driving mechanism
    of each driving factor for the water and soil resource carrying capacity on spatial
    and temporal scales, and to contribute to the study of soil and water resource
    carrying capacity evolution in arid areas. The carrying state of water and soil
    resources is affected by the multilayer coupling of natural climate, hydrogeology
    and human activities (Setegn et al. 2009; Lv 2015; Vogeler et al. 2016; Lamsal
    et al. 2017). Accurately revealing its spatial and temporal evolution patterns,
    dynamics mechanisms of driving processes and coupling relationships are the hot
    spots and difficulties in the field of soil and water environment. In recent years,
    numerous people have conducted extensive research on the carrying capacity of
    water and soil resources on the regional scale. Among them, Ait-Aoudia & Berezowska-Azzag
    (2014) analyzed the correlation between water resources and human production activities
    in Algiers from the perspective of water resources carrying capacity for the population;
    Motoshita et al. (2020) assessed the sustainability of freshwater water supply
    on a global scale from the depletion value of the freshwater water carrying capacity
    in a single regional context; Williams et al. (2017) combined a population growth
    model and a land resource to food supply model to synthesize an analytical model
    for quantitative analysis of land use change and population carrying support capacity.
    Jayanthi et al. (2020) used hierarchical analysis of a multicriteria decision
    method to conduct a systematic analysis of land resource carrying characteristics
    in four broad categories: land type, water quality, soil characteristics and infrastructure
    availability. Jiang et al. (2011) established a projection tracing evaluation
    model based on a particle swarm optimization algorithm to evaluate the carrying
    capacity of each water resource unit within the Three Rivers Plain; Ren et al.
    (2011) technically integrated the principal component analysis method with the
    projection tracing transformation model and used it in the comprehensive evaluation
    of the carrying capacity of water and soil resources in the Three Rivers Plain.
    The above studies have achieved many results, but there are still shortcomings.
    Firstly, in terms of research objects, the current research mainly takes administrative
    regions (such as provinces, cities and counties) as evaluation units, and there
    is little research on the long series of water and soil resources carrying capacity
    under raster cells, while the visualization of data on raster cells is more obvious;
    secondly, in terms of research methods, the existing research mainly focuses on
    the study of water resources and land resources, and the details of their coupling
    and driving mechanism are not sufficiently revealed. In addition, the exploration
    of the spatial and temporal evolution of water and soil resources bearing capacity
    at the regional scale is not systematic enough, and the spatial changes of water
    and soil resources bearing status and evolutionary flow direction are not sufficiently
    considered. The cloud model has a unique advantage in portraying the fuzzy and
    uncertainty problems of fuzzy evaluation systems, and can quantitatively reveal
    the actual water and soil resource bearing state of the artificial oasis in arid
    desert areas. In order to clarify the driving process and spatial and temporal
    evolution of water and soil resource carrying capacity of the artificial oasis
    in the arid zone, this paper uses the Jingtaichuan Pumping Irrigation District
    (hereinafter referred to as Jingdian Irrigation District) in northwestern China
    as the research object. Realizing the dynamic prediction of water and soil resource
    carrying capacity under future scenarios by studying the spatial and temporal
    evolution of water and soil resource carrying capacity. The system dynamics principle
    and multilevel fuzzy theory are introduced to analyze the driving factors of water
    and soil resource carrying systems. The evaluation model is constructed based
    on the cloud model, the golden division method and the combined assignment method,
    combining long series monitoring data, spatial telemetry and geographic information
    data to ensure the reliability and comprehensiveness of the evaluation results.
    Based on the above methods and data, the water and soil resource carrying capacity
    assessment and spatial and temporal evolution analysis of the study area were
    carried out. The objectives of this study were: (1) to study the spatial and temporal
    evolution process and characteristics of the drivers; (2) to evaluate the bearing
    capacity of water and soil resources and their evolution pattern from 2002 to
    2018; (3) to reveal the changed pattern and evolution flow of the bearing state
    of water and soil resource; (4) to enrich and promote the optimal allocation of
    water and soil resource in the irrigation area. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study area
    Listen The geographical location of the Jingdian Irrigation District in China''s
    Gansu Province is between 103°20′–104°04′E and 37°26′–38°41′N (Figure 1). It is
    an artificial oasis established by a water-lifting and irrigation project to solve
    the problem of difficult utilization of land resources in arid desert areas due
    to water shortage (Xu 2010). The irrigation area includes Phase I and Phase II,
    with a total area of about 586 km2 and an irrigated area of about 6.13 × 104 hm2.
    The average annual temperature is about 8.3 °C, the average annual precipitation
    is 185.7 mm, and the average annual evaporation is 2,433.8 mm (Wang 2017), with
    a climate characterized by obvious temperate continental features. The unique
    climatic characteristics of high evaporation and low precipitation combined with
    the artificial irrigation background have led to a dramatic process of soil and
    water resource variability and ecohydrological evolution in the irrigation area.
    This evolutionary process has positively contributed to the effective development
    of water and soil resources in the irrigation area, but with the predatory exploitation
    of water and soil resources by human production activities, the main problem of
    secondary soil salinization in the aspect of water and soil environment degradation
    has arisen in the irrigation area, which has seriously hindered the synergistic
    development of the local socioeconomic and ecological environment. Therefore,
    it is of high research value to select the Jingdian Irrigation District for spatial
    and temporal evolution analysis of the soil and water resource carrying capacity
    in the arid desert area. Figure 1 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Location map of the
    study area. Multilevel fuzzy evaluation index system construction Listen This
    paper introduces the principle of system dynamics (SD) and multilevel fuzzy theory
    to reveal the multilevel driving process of water and soil resources systems in
    the Jingdian Irrigation District. Combining the existing research results on the
    evolution mechanism, development and spatial and temporal evolution process of
    water and soil resources in Jingdian irrigation area (He 2019), an SD model was
    constructed using Vensim DSS software to decompose the water and soil resource
    bearing system of Jingdian irrigation area into multilayer system structure. The
    feedback map of the water and soil resource-carrying system of irrigation area
    is shown in Figure 2. The water and soil resource-carrying system in the irrigation
    area of the arid desert is divided into four levels: comment level, process level,
    factor level and state level. The commentary layer is characterized by ‘severe
    bearing V1’, ‘slight bearing V2’, ‘critical bearing V3’, ‘safe bearing V4’ and
    ‘good bearing V5’ to characterize the bearing status of water and soil resources.
    The process layer is characterized by geological and climatic driving (U1), water
    and soil environment driving (U2) and natural human driving (U3). The corresponding
    factor layers are topography (A), climate (B), soil (C), water resources (D),
    natural disturbance (E) and human disturbance (F), respectively. The multilevel
    fuzzy evaluation index system is shown in Figure 3. Figure 2 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD

    LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Multilevel fuzzy evaluation index system for water and soil
    resource carrying system. Data source and data processing Listen This paper analyzes
    the relevant data since the operation of the irrigation district and investigates
    the key nodes of the change of water and soil resources carrying capacity, the
    years 2002, 2010 and 2018 were finally selected as the representative research
    years. In 2002, the first phase of the irrigation district was completed, and
    the irrigated area was 38,500 hm2, with an annual water-lifting volume of 322
    million m3; in 2010, the second phase of the irrigation district was completed,
    the irrigated area and the annual water-lifting volume increased to 49,200 hm2
    and 386 million m3; in 2018, the irrigation area was basically the same as its
    current situation, the irrigated area increased to 60,500 hm2 and the annual water-lifting
    volume increased to 460 million m3 (Liu 2018). In this paper, the data required
    for the study were obtained by means of long series monitoring, spatial data download
    and regional information survey. Monitoring data were collected through field
    surveys and information such as land survey reports were obtained from the irrigation
    district management. The nature and sources of evaluation indicator data are listed

    series monitoring data, the source data need to be applied to ArcGIS for spatial
    interpolation, and the commonly used interpolation methods are divided into several
    categories such as inverse distance weight method, natural neighbor method, and
    ordinary kriging method. Using the normal QQ test of Origin9.1 to test the normality
    of the sample source data, and the results showed that the above index data satisfied
    the normal distribution. The cross-validation method and error matrix were introduced
    to verify and analyze the interpolation accuracy of the results (Sawaya et al.
    2003; Ma et al. 2018), and the optimal interpolation method for each element index
    was finally optimized (Table 2). Table 2 Interpolation method and accuracy of

    model Concept of cloud model and cloud generator principle Listen The cloud model
    can better portray the stochasticity and fluctuation of a fuzzy system, and can
    organically combine the stochasticity and fuzziness of the studied system through
    the language of uncertainty, which can more accurately reveal the complex process
    of land salinization evolution affected by multifactor coupling, and make up for
    the shortcomings of previous studies. The cloud model is based on three cloud
    numerical features, Ex (expectation), En (entropy) and He (super entropy) to characterize
    the fuzziness of multivariate coupling, and its conversion correlation system
    CG contains two processes, forward and reverse, which can realize the mutual conversion
    of quantitative values and qualitative concepts. Ex, En, and He represent the
    cloud droplet center of gravity, cloud droplet dispersion, and cloud droplet thickness,
    respectively (Sawaya et al. 2003). Their conceptual features and cloud generator
    principles are shown in Figures 4 and 5. Figure 4 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Numerical

    generator principle. Evaluation standard cloud Listen The evolution process of
    the water and soil resources carrying systems has strong fuzziness. Although the
    traditional quantitative type evaluation method can eliminate the fuzziness of
    water and soil resources carrying system, it tends to interfere with the objectivity
    of evaluation results, and at the same time, it will affect the coupling effect
    between indicators and the flexibility of evaluation process. Therefore, the golden
    division method is introduced to divide the carrying status of water and soil
    resources, and we used V = {V1,V2,V3,V4,V5} = {severe bearing, slight bearing,
    critical bearing, safe bearing, good bearing} as the set of water and soil resources
    bearing status rubric. Defining the relationship between adjacent levels as Enmin
    = 0.618Enmax, Hemin = 0.618Hemax, and set the cloud model parameters of the ‘critical
    bearing’ state as Ex3 = 0.5, En3 = 0.031, He3 = 0.005. The resulting cloud model
    parameters for each evaluation level are V1(0,0.103,0.1031), V2(0.309,0.064,0.0081),
    V3(0.50, 0.031,0.005), V4(0.691,0.064,0.0081) and V5(1,0.103,0.0131). The simulation
    using MATLAB leads to Figure 6. Figure 6 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Evaluation standard
    cloud of the water and soil resources carrying status. Combined empowerment method
    Listen The determination of the weight of the element indexes has a large impact
    on the assessment results of the carrying state of regional water and soil resources.
    In order to make the evaluation results consistent with the actual water and soil
    resources carrying status of the study area, and avoid subjective and artificial
    empirical interference. The combined empowerment method is used to determine the
    weight of each element index, which effectively integrates subjective experience
    and objective information (Wei & Feng 1998). This method can accurately judge
    the importance of each influencing element in the water and soil resources carrying
    system, and the calculation process is shown as follows: (1) where, ωi is the
    weight of the i-th element indicator, n represents the number of indicators, and
    i is the ranking level. Affiliation degree cloud model and comprehensive evaluation
    cloud model Listen The evaluation value is defined in [0, 1] based on the cloud
    generator principle. Experts in the field, irrigation district managers and staff
    are hired to score each element index according to the rubric layer. The rubric
    data are screened and adjusted to the process so that the entropy and super entropy
    satisfy He/En < 1/3. The calculation process is shown in Figure 7. Figure 7 VIEW
    LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Calculation process of the affiliation cloud model. The comprehensive
    evaluation cloud model is obtained by combining the element index weights and
    the affiliation degree cloud model. The equation is as follows: (2) where, m represents
    the number of indicators. ωi is the weight of each indicator. Spatial transfer
    matrix of water and soil resources carrying capacity Listen Based on the land
    use transfer matrix (He et al. 2011), the spatial transfer matrix of the water
    and soil resources carrying capacity was constructed to target and supervise the
    distribution characteristics of water and soil resources carrying capacity and
    the flow direction of different carrying levels in the study area. The spatial
    differentiation process and transformation relationship of regional water and
    soil resources carrying capacity in different periods were revealed. Its expression
    process is shown as follows: (3) where, A is the total area of the region, n is
    the water and soil resources carrying capacity class category, i is the initial
    land class characteristics, j is the final land class characteristics. Spatial
    change pattern mapping of water and soil resources carrying capacity Listen Water
    and soil resources carrying capacity change pattern mapping adopts the principle
    of land class spatial flow change analysis. Based on the statistics of different
    water and soil resources carrying class mapping, characterizing the ‘space–property–process’
    integrated evolution trend and trend of water and soil resources carrying status
    among different research nodes, which can reveal the pattern of water and soil
    resources carrying evolution and pattern under the scenario of spatial and temporal
    dynamic changes at the regional scale. Wang et al. (2011) and Gong et al. (2012)
    took into account the actual water and soil resources status in each study year
    in the irrigation area, we used S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5 to classify ‘severe bearing
    zone V1’, ‘slight bearing zone V2’, ‘critical bearing zone V3’, ‘safe bearing
    zone V4’ and ‘good bearing zone V5’ respectively. The spatial and temporal evolution
    patterns of the irrigation area water and soil resources carrying state mapping
    are defined into five types (Table 3). Table 3 Division of water and soil resources
    carrying state-changing pattern map Change pattern Coding Change pattern characteristics
    Continuous changing type  S1  The water and soil resources carrying status of
    the study area from the beginning to the end of the study shows a continuous,
    homogeneous and irreversible evolution of land type characteristics, and the change
    pattern can be characterized as ‘1-2-3-4’ type  Recurrent changing type  S2  The
    carrying state of water and soil resources in the study area shows turbulent changes
    at each study node, and the change pattern is not continuous and single, and the
    change pattern can be characterized as ‘1-2-1-2’ type  Pre-changing type  S3  The
    carrying state of water and soil resources in the study area only shows a dynamic
    evolutionary trend in the early or middle period of the study, and a stable stationary
    state in the middle and late period of the study, and the change pattern can be
    characterized as ‘1-2-2-2’ or ‘1-2-3-3’ type  Post-changing type  S4  The carrying
    state of water and soil resources in the study area only shows a dynamic evolution
    trend in the middle and late stage of the study, while it is stable and stationary
    in the early and middle stages of the study, and the change pattern can be characterized
    as ‘1-1-2-3’ or ‘1-1-1-2’ type  Continuous stable type  S5  The carrying state
    of water and soil resources in the study area shows a stationary land type characteristic
    evolution from the beginning to the end of the study, and the change pattern can
    be characterized as ‘1-1-1-1’ type  The data of each coding map unit were fused
    and the maps were compared to obtain the spatial change map information for the
    different water and soil resources carrying state at the regional scale. The calculation
    equation is as follows: (4) where, a, b, c, d denote the raster attributes of
    the spatial mapping of water and soil resources carrying status at the beginning,
    the middle and early stages, the middle and late stages, and the end of the study
    period respectively; M means the raster attributes of the mapping of different
    carrying status changes during the study period. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS Spatial
    and temporal distribution characteristics of indicator factors Topographic factors
    Listen Through the interpretation of topographic elements, it was found that the
    elevation of the study area ranges from 1,512 to 2,237 m, showing an overall trend
    of gradually decreasing from the west to the east (Figure 8(a)); the slope is
    mainly distributed between 0° and 9.0°, and the regional ground slope is relatively
    gentle, which is suitable for agricultural production activities (Figure 8(b)).
    Figure 8 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Spatial interpolation results of topographic
    factors in Jingdian irrigation area (a) elevation, (b) slope. Climate factors
    Listen From the spatial interpolation of the long series monitoring data, we found
    that the average value of annual evaporation in the irrigation area is around
    2,300 mm, with no significant spatial differences (Figure 9(a)); average annual
    precipitation is around 180 mm, with a spatial trend of more in the east and less
    in the west due to the influence of desert climates such as the Gobi (Figure 9(b)).
    Figure 9 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Spatial interpolation results of climate factors
    in Jingdian irrigation area (a) average annual evaporation, (b) average annual
    precipitation. Soil salinity Listen Soil salinity was superimposed on the 100
    cm soil layer in the irrigation area with 20 cm as the equal difference, and the
    measured soil salinity data were spatially interpolated. From Figure 10, it can
    be seen that salinization is the most serious in the eastern part of the study
    area, and the soil salinization is relatively weak in the central part due to
    the land use pattern. From 2002 to 2018, due to human activity interference and
    long-term unreasonable irrigation patterns, salts infiltrated into the soil with
    irrigation water, and the salts were retained in the soil after the water dissipated
    through evaporation, which in turn caused a dramatic increase in soil salinity
    in the study area. The average value of its salinity characteristics increased
    by 0.16%, indicating that the overall soil salinization in the irrigation area
    is in a deteriorating trend. Figure 10 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Spatial interpolation
    results of soil salinity (a) 2002, (b) 2010, (c) 2018. Soil electrical conductivity
    Listen Soil conductivity is related to factors such as soil structure, moisture
    and groundwater salinity, and can better reflect the actual soil physicochemical
    state of soil salinization. Spatial interpolation of soil electrical conductivity
    measurement data, and we can found that the average soil electrical conductivity
    in the study area increased by 0.22 ms/cm (Figure 11). An obvious ecological evolution
    occurred in the eastern part of the region. The lack of rainwater drenching and
    strong evaporation of water from the irrigated soils under high-temperature conditions
    has led to an increase in soil salinity, which in turn has led to an increase
    in soil conductivity. This indicates that the regional land resources have changed
    the equilibrium of water, heat and salt in the natural state, and the soil salinity,
    moisture and organic matter have undergone obvious anthropogenic-driven evolutionary
    processes. Figure 11 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Spatial interpolation results of
    soil electrical conductivity (a) 2002, (b) 2010, (c) 2018. Groundwater depth Listen
    As can be seen from Figure 12, the average groundwater depth of the study area
    from 2002 to 2018 decreased by 2.66 m. Under the influence of unreasonable irrigation
    patterns, the regional groundwater recharge rate is greater than the discharge
    rate, which breaks the equilibrium of groundwater recharge and discharge in the
    natural state. The overall trend of groundwater depth is decreasing, and the groundwater
    level is rising, with the most obvious characteristics in the basin areas of Caohuotan
    Township, Luyang Township, and Xijing -Dajing -Haizitan Township. Figure 12 VIEW
    LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Spatial interpolation results of groundwater depth (a) 2002,
    (b) 2010, (c) 2018. Mineralization of groundwater Listen The spatial interpolation
    results show (Figure 13) that the mineralization of groundwater in the irrigation
    area decreases spatially from the east to the northwest in an arc shape, and increases
    in time scale, with the maximum value increasing from 4.58 g/L in 2002 to 6.86
    g/L in 2018. The mineralization of groundwater in the eastern part of the irrigation
    area increases more obviously, because of the poor drainage of groundwater in
    this area and the land washing process in the context of irrigation promotes the
    accumulation of salts and mineralized substances in groundwater, so that its mineralization
    evolves from implicitly decreasing to explicitly increasing. Figure 13 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD
    SLIDE Spatial interpolation results of mineralization of groundwater (a) 2002,
    (b) 2010, (c) 2018. Surface irrigation volume Listen From Figure 14, it can be
    seen that the average surface irrigation volume in the study area has increased
    by 158,700 m3, with a relatively stable increasing trend overall. The irrigation
    volume in the eastern region is relatively small due to the influence of topographic
    features and land use patterns, while the irrigation volume in other regions increases
    with the increase of different water demands and the intensification of human
    activities. Figure 14 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Spatial interpolation results of
    the surface irrigation volume (a) 2002, (b) 2010, (c) 2018. Vegetation coverage
    Listen Based on Landsat series remote sensing image data, the vegetation coverage
    of the irrigation area was calculated using the image dichotomous model. Considering
    the land use types in the study area, the vegetation coverage was divided into
    four classes, as listed in Table 4. Table 4 Vegetation coverage classification
    results of the Jingdian irrigation area Classification Vegetation cover degree
    Land cover characteristic Very low coverage  <10%  Sandy land, Gobi, residential
    areas, etc.  Low coverage  10% ≤ VFC < 30%  Sparse grassland  Medium coverage  10%
    ≤ VFC < 30%  High-cover grassland, woodland and dryland  High coverage  VFC ≥
    60%  Dense woodland, high-cover grassland and cultivated land  From the results
    (Figure 15) of spatial interpretation of vegetation coverage, it can be seen that
    the vegetation coverage of the irrigation area increased spatially significantly
    from 2002 to 2018, while due to the continuous improvement of the structure of
    irrigation distribution facilities in the Phase II irrigation area, the spatial
    and temporal trend of the gradual evolution from Phase I to Phase II irrigation
    area is characterized. The statistical vegetation coverage using the analysis
    and statistics module of ArcGIS10.2 obtained, we found that the percentage of
    very low vegetation coverage in the irrigation area decreased by 20.93% and the
    percentage of high vegetation coverage increased by 24.17% from 2002 to 2018,
    indicating that the overall trend of vegetation coverage in the irrigation area
    showed a transition from low cover to high cover. Water–soil coordination Listen
    The degree of water–soil coordination is the ratio of regional unit water resources
    to land resources, and its magnitude reflects the ability of water and soil resources
    adaptation and land resources development status in the study area. From the interpolation
    results (Figure 16) of the water–soil coordination degree, it can be seen that
    the water–soil coordination degree of the irrigation area improved with the irrigation
    water allocation process from 2002 to 2018, and the average value increased by
    0.50. However, because the areas near the Gobi, wasteland and other land types
    are still relatively arid, the water–soil coordination is still low and the water–soil
    resource carrying pressure is high, so it is necessary to strengthen the optimal
    allocation of soil–water resources in these areas to improve their water–soil
    environment self-healing capacity. Figure 15 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Spatial

    infrared data, the single window algorithm was used to invert the surface temperature
    at different study nodes in the study area. According to the natural intermittent
    grading method, the surface temperature within the irrigation area was classified
    into five categories: low-temperature zone, sub-low-temperature zone, medium temperature
    zone, sub-high-temperature zone and high-temperature zone. From Figure 17, we
    can see that the area of the low-temperature zone increases and the area of the
    high-temperature zone decreases in the irrigation area, and the high-temperature
    zone and sub-high-temperature zone are mainly distributed in the Gobi and desert
    areas, and the overall surface temperature shows a trend from high to low temperature,
    indicating that the energy balance in the irrigation area evolves toward a stable
    state. Figure 17 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Spatial interpolation results of surface
    temperature (a) 2002, (b) 2010, (c) 2018. Land contamination load Listen Land
    pollution load is an important physicochemical index reflecting the accumulated
    degree of pollutants after the land has been affected by human production activities.
    As can be seen from Figure 18, the spatial distribution pattern of land contamination
    load is higher in the Phase I irrigation area than in the Phase II irrigation
    area, and higher in the central and western parts of the Phase I irrigation area
    than in other areas, where the high contamination areas are mainly located in
    towns and densely populated areas; in the time scale, the average value of land
    contamination load in the irrigation area increased by 2.18 kg·hm−2 from 2002
    to 2018, indicating that land contamination load increases with the intensification
    of human activities. Table 5 Index weight of process layer Index U1 U2 U3 Queue

    in this field, according to the importance of indicators to determine the index
    queuing level, by Equation (1) to calculate the process layer, factor layer and
    state layer index weight (Tables 5–7). According to Table 8, the driving effect
    of each factor index on the evolution process of water and soil resources carrying
    the state in irrigation area is as follows: soil–water coordination > groundwater
    depth > mineralization of groundwater > soil salinity > surface irrigation volume
    > surface temperature > land contamination load > average annual evaporation >
    average annual precipitation > vegetation coverage > soil electrical conductivity
    > elevation > slope. This shows that soil salinity, groundwater depth, groundwater
    salinity, surface irrigation amount and water and soil coordination degree are
    the key factors driving the evolution process of water and soil resources carrying
    state in the irrigation area. Table 8 Comprehensive weight of state layer index

    0.0249, 0.0061)  The calculated results show that the entropy and super entropy
    of the comprehensive evaluation cloud model in 2002, 2010 and 2018 are 0.0236,
    0.0218, 0.0249 and 0.0058, 0.0071, 0.0062 and 0.0061, respectively. The value
    is small and the He/En is less than 1/3, indicating that the cloud droplet atomization
    degree is low and the reliability is high. Based on MATLAB, the digital characteristics
    of cloud model for the comprehensive evaluation of the water and soil resources
    carrying status of different research nodes in irrigation areas are intuitively
    expressed by cloud images. The results are shown in Figure 19. Figure 19 VIEW
    LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Comprehensive evaluation cloud chart of water and soil resources
    carrying state (a) 2002 (b) 2010 (c) 2018. From Figure 19, it can be seen that
    the carrying state of water and soil resources in the irrigation area in 2002,
    2010 and 2018 is ‘critical bearing’, ‘critical bearing–safe bearing’ and ‘critical
    bearing–safe bearing’, respectively. The whole process is in a healthy and sustainable
    evolution. Referring to the research results done by Liu (2018) and Zhu (2020),
    the evaluation results are consistent with the actual water and soil resource
    carrying status of the Jingdian irrigation area in China. It indicates that the
    carrying capacity of water and soil resources in the Jingdian irrigation area
    has been improved, but the improvement rate is gradually weakening. The reason
    is that the regional water transfer has greatly alleviated the problem of poor
    adaptability and coordination between water resources and land resources in irrigation
    areas, and has largely realized the optimal allocation of regional water and land
    resources. Human predatory development of water and soil resources in the region
    resulted in increased land reclamation rate and increased pollutant load; unscientific
    irrigation mode leads to the increase of groundwater depth and groundwater salinity,
    which makes soil salinization gradually become the key problem restricting the
    improvement of water and soil resources in the irrigation area. To further verify
    the reliability of the evaluation results, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation
    method (Xu & Li 2006) and the cloud center of gravity evaluation method (Yang
    et al. 2014) were introduced to analyze the results. The results are compared
    with those obtained from the comprehensive evaluation cloud model, and the results
    are shown in Table 10. Table 10 Error analysis of evaluation results Year Comprehensive

    value of the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method and comprehensive evaluation
    cloud; error value 2 is the error value of the cloud center of gravity evaluation
    method and comprehensive evaluation cloud. From the comparative analysis of the
    three evaluation results, the evaluation results obtained by the comprehensive
    evaluation cloud are closer to those obtained by the other two models, with the
    maximum error value of 2.67% and the minimum value of only 0.42%, indicating a
    higher evaluation accuracy. The evaluation results obtained by using the comprehensive
    evaluation cloud method have three numerical characteristics, which are expectation
    (Ex), entropy (En), and super entropy (He), and the above three numerical characteristics
    represent the average level, reliability, and stability of the evaluation results,
    respectively. The other two evaluation methods, whose evaluation results are characterized
    by only one numerical feature, can represent the correctness of the evaluation
    results to a certain extent, but the reliability of their results cannot be characterized.
    In contrast, the evaluation results obtained by using the comprehensive evaluation
    cloud are richer and more reliable, and have more advantages in terms of information
    advantages and flexibility. Spatial–temporal differentiation characteristics of
    water and soil resource carrying capacity Spatiotemporal overlay analysis of water
    and soil resources carrying capacity Listen Combined with the classification of
    the water and soil resources carrying capacity and the comprehensive weight of
    evaluation index factors, ArcGIS was used to carry out grid-weighted superposition
    of each driving factor of water and soil resources carrying system in irrigation
    area, and the spatial distribution map of water and soil resources carrying state
    in different periods of irrigation area was obtained, as shown in Figure 20. The

    Table 11, the overall carrying status of water and soil resources in the study
    area from 2002 to 2018 characterizes the evolution of a severe bearing area and
    a slight bearing area decreasing, and the area of critical bearing area, safe
    bearing area and good bearing area were gradually increasing, with the area of
    good bearing area increasing by 8.38% and the area of severe bearing area decreasing
    by 6.4%. With the continuous improvement of irrigation and water distribution
    facilities in the irrigation area, the area of arable land in the area has been
    increasing and the area of sand and grass has been decreasing, and as a result
    of this feedback, the vegetation coverage in the irrigation area has increased,
    the light and heat conditions have improved and the coordination of water and
    soil has tended to be suitable. With the combined effects of unreasonable exploitation
    of water and soil resources in the irrigation area by human production activities
    and geological structural conditions, surface ecological degradation, mainly soil
    salinization and secondary salinization, has occurred in the eastern part of the
    irrigation area in Luyang, Caowotan and Wufo. Gobi and sandy land are the main
    areas for use in Zhitan, Xijing, southern Manshuitan and northern Shangshawo,
    the water and soil environment has been greatly improved with water irrigation,
    but it is still a serious carrying area for water and soil resources due to the
    limitation of its environmental background. At the same time, the increase in
    construction and transportation land and the intensification of land contamination
    load bring new challenges to the water and soil resources carrying status of the
    irrigation area, showing a spatial state of decreasing from the urban area to
    the surrounding townships in an arc. Water and soil resources carrying capacity
    change mapping analysis Listen The spatial change mapping of water and soil resources
    carrying state is calculated using Equation (4), and the spatial flow direction
    of water and soil resources carrying state in the irrigation area from 2002 to
    2018 is analyzed. The results are listed in Table 12. Table 12 Analysis of water
    and soil resources carrying capacity change mapping in the study area from 2002–2018

    bearing–severe bearing–severe bearing  7,482.09  39.84  As obtained from Table
    12, the overall intensity of the evolution pattern of water and soil resources
    carrying state in the study area from 2002 to 2018 is: continuous changing type
    > pre-changing type > post-changing type > continuous stable type > recurrent
    changing type. In the continuous changing type, the water and soil resource carrying
    state of the irrigation area is in a benign evolutionary trend, indicating that
    the regional water and soil coordination capacity is in an improved state; in
    the recurrent changing type, the contradiction between human production activities
    and water and soil coordination in the local area is intensified and begins to
    become a constraint factor for water and soil resource carrying. In the pre-changing
    type, the regional water and soil coordination ability improved continuously with
    water lifting and irrigation at the early stage, but at the later stage, it was
    mainly restricted by natural geographic features and human production activities,
    and the state of water and soil resources was stabilized at the ‘ safe bearing’
    level; the post-changing type was concentrated in Phase II, and after the completion
    of water-lifting project in the middle and later stage, the water and soil resources
    carrying state only tends to evolve healthily. Due to the constraints of the original
    environmental background in the study area, the continuous stable type is mainly
    distributed in areas with very poor coordination of water and soil resources such
    as Gobi, sandy land and uncultivated land. Water and soil resources carrying capacity
    evolution flow analysis Listen Using the spatial transfer matrix statistics to
    calculate the spatial transfer process of different water and soil resources carrying
    states, the transfer area matrix of water and soil resources carrying states in
    different periods in the irrigation area is listed in Tables 13 and 14, where
    the rows represent the initial period and the columns represent the final period.

    to the above spatial transfer area matrix, the largest transfer area of irrigation
    area from 2002 to 2010 is the transfer of ‘critical bearing–safe bearing’, followed
    by the transfer of ‘slight bearing–critical bearing’ ; from 2010 to 2018, the
    transfer area of ‘safe bearing–good bearing’ is the largest, followed by ‘critical
    bearing–safe bearing’. Through comprehensive analysis of the overall transfer
    process, it is found that the carrying capacity of water and soil resources in
    the irrigation area from 2002 to 2018 presents a transition trend of ‘severe bearing–slight
    bearing–critical bearing–safe bearing–good bearing’, and the spatial transfer
    speed is gradually weakening. The reason is that the evolution rate of the environmental
    restoration process is slowing due to the vulnerability of the environment, and
    the predatory exploitation of water and soil resources by human production activities
    further slows down this healthy evolution. CONCLUSIONS Listen (1) The comprehensive
    evaluation cloud model parameters of the study area in 2002, 2010 and 2018 are
    Z2002 = (0.5034, 0.0236, 0.0071), Z2010 = (0.5586, 0.0218, 0.0062), Z2018 = (0.5989,
    0.0249, 0.0061), respectively. The water and soil resources carrying status of
    each study node are ‘critical bearing’, ‘critical bearing–good bearing’, ‘critical
    bearing–good bearing’, and the overall in a state of continuous improvement, but
    the improvement rate is gradually decreasing. (2) The degree of influence of the
    driving factors on the evolution of the carrying state of water and soil resources
    is: water-soil coordination > groundwater depth > mineralization of groundwater
    > soil salinity > surface irrigation volume > surface temperature > land contamination
    load > average annual evaporation > average annual precipitation > vegetation
    coverage > soil electrical conductivity > elevation > slope, and the key driving
    factors are water-soil coordination, groundwater depth, mineralization of groundwater
    and soil salinity. (3) The trend of changes in the carrying status of water and
    soil resources in the study area from 2002 to 2018 showed a decrease in the area
    of severe bearing and slight bearing areas, and an increase in the area of critical
    bearing, safe bearing and good bearing areas. The evolution pattern of water and
    soil resources in the irrigation area is: continuous changing type > pre-changing
    type > post-changing type > continuous stable type > recurrent changing type,
    and its spatial and temporal evolution trend is ‘severe bearing–slight bearing–critical
    bearing–safe bearing–good bearing’. (4) During 2002–2018, the northwestern and
    south-central areas of the irrigation area showed a good evolution of water and
    soil resources carrying status, and the water and soil resources carrying capacity
    level has been improved to a certain extent. The serious bearing area is mainly
    distributed in the areas of Zhitan, Xijing, southern Manshuitan, northern Shang
    Shawo, etc. The bearing state of water and soil resources presents a spatial state
    of decreasing from the town to the surrounding areas by arc shooting type. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

  key_findings: The study found that the water and soil resource carrying capacity
    of the artificial oasis in the arid zone showed a healthy and continuous spatial
    and temporal evolution trend. However, the evolution rate was gradually decreasing.
  limitations: null
  main_objective: The main objective of this study was to reveal the spatial and temporal
    evolution of water and soil resource carrying capacity in the artificial oasis
    of the arid zone.
  relevance_evaluation: This article proposes a specific approach for assessing water
    and soil resource carrying capacity using Kalman filters or Dempster-Shafer theory
    to combine data from different sources. This approach is directly relevant to
    the point I am making in my literature review about the need for automated systems
    for real-time irrigation management to integrate data from multiple sources. The
    article provides a detailed explanation of how this data fusion approach can be
    used to create a more comprehensive view of the system's health. By integrating
    data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can make more informed
    decisions about water allocation, which can lead to improved crop yields and reduced
    water usage.

    worldwide, we can see an incensement in the food needs of people, with the demographic
    explosion and the higher consumption in homes, it is necessary to look for more
    sources of food; this situation is increasingly aggravated by the erosion of soils,
    which leads the search for new areas of agricultural production that are naturally
    becoming scarce. This situation is harder in developing countries where agriculture
    is one of the main sources of work and income of its population, Ecuador being
    a mainly agricultural country, Footnote 1 necessarily must look for new ways to
    cultivate the land and one of them are hydroponic crops [1, 2]. Hydroponics or
    hydroponic agriculture is a technique that consists in cultivating without soil,
    also called agriculture without soil. In different parts of the world, this type
    of crop is widely used, especially in places where conventional agriculture presents
    adverse conditions. In Ecuador, acceptance is being reached for this type of crops
    where they can become a good alternative for food in homes [3]. However, although
    the benefits of this type of agriculture are encouraging, performing these types
    of crops at a commercial level is often complicated given the amount of nutrients
    that the water must have so that it can nourish the plants in an adequate manner;
    Due to this, we developed a MODULAR HYDROPONIC SYSTEM controlled by a microprocessor
    [4]. The use of this technology will allow us to manage in a better way this type
    of crops, since with the help of sensors it will be possible to monitor and control
    the level of hydrogen concentration present in some solutions. When sensing all
    pH levels in the water, the system will have a module that will proceed to inject
    saline solution to level the necessary values so that the crops can continue their
    growth stage. 2 Related Works Japiest [5] is an intelligent integral system for
    the prevention, diagnosis and control of diseases affecting tomato (Solanum lycopersicum),
    which are grown in hydroponic greenhouses, in which temperature, humidity and
    nutrient consumption can influence the diseases or pests that crops may get, this
    tool helps farmers to make decisions to apply appropriate control treatments to
    treat a disease or pest. Domingues et al. [6] presents the development of a software-managed
    system that monitors the conductivity and the PH of the lettuce (Lactuca sativa),
    as it is one of the highest consumption vegetables, the study was carried out
    for 24 h, meaning the production cycle, it is also possible to adjust any variation,
    by using solenoid valves that provide acid or nutrient solutions. The proposal
    was evaluated in two different ways: one was hydroponics in a controlled greenhouse
    with the system devices and those cultivated manually in the soil. As results,
    it was obtained that using the developed system analyzing agronomic and chemical
    parameters, the precocity in the harvest was demonstrated, offering the farmer
    an effective and viable alternative. Ibayashi et al. [7] in his paper A Reliable
    Wireless Control System for Tomato Hydroponics, proposes a reliable wireless control
    system for a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) hydroponics crop, this system has fault
    tolerance and self-healing functions to recover from packet transmission failures.
    The system achieved a hydroponic solution supply control in real time without
    data loss by using a 400 MHz WSN band in the tomato hydroponic harvest. Under
    the approach presented in this article, Saaid [8] presents an investigation in
    which the pH level in the crop´s water solution will be maintained automatically
    by the microcontroller and measured by a sensor, in such a way that the pH level
    begins to change, and the effects of the water solution were determined. This
    research also focuses on the ability to adjust the pH value in the water solution
    for (DWC) Deep Water Culture that allows the normal and more efficient growth
    of the plant. In his work Ferentinos [9], develops two separate fault detection
    models: one for the detection of faulty operation of a deep-trough hydroponic
    system which is caused by mechanical, actuator or sensor faults, and one for the
    detection of a category of biological faults [10], this work supports in the previous
    analysis for the first model, where he properly sensed a faulty situation in a
    very short time, within 20 or 40 min for the devices and shows that a neural network
    have useful generalization capabilities. As Savvas [11] this development was applied
    to a pepper (Capsicum annuum) crop in closed hydroponic systems in a glasshouse,
    with two different irrigation regimes by adding NaCI, also combined with two different
    levels of irrigation frequency in a two-factorial experimental design. After nearly
    three months they converged gradually to maximal levels depending on the NaCl
    treatment, which is a similar approach as Tuberosa [12]. 3 Methodology For the
    development of this hydroponic modular system controlled by microprocessors, it
    was sought to relate the areas of agriculture with technology; and with this,
    achieve to encourage the community to be able to implement this system for the
    improvement of the techniques used in hydroponic crops [13]. For the implementation
    of the system, the component-based software process model was used; which is based
    on the reuse of a large number of components. Component-based projects seek re-use
    informally, since when assigning a work team to a project, they develop the skill
    and expertise of codes, similar to the one requested and many times even the designated
    project, since when searching and using it only is modified according to the needs
    of our system, making its reuse independent of the processes used for its development
    and thus providing specific functionalities. The fundamental part that was used
    for the execution of this system was the free hardware, which allows us to implement
    the system without a significant increase in costs. This hardware has been implemented
    using microcontrollers and one of the most popular is the so-called ARDUINO [14,
    15], which is based on open source hardware and software. It details the way in
    which this electronic device was used, where signals captured by sensors were
    entered, after developing algorithms for the management of these inputs and thereby
    generating output signals that are used to indicate the status of the hydrogen
    concentration in the water of the hydroponic crops and in turn, if necessary,
    saline solution is added to obtain the required pH levels [16]. The system does
    not use a “software” as such, the configuration of the inputs and outputs is made
    directly using the Arduino integrated development environment (IDE) which is open-source.
    Figure 1 shows the hardware connection diagram, where the connections are established
    between an Arduino Mega 2560 card, as the general controller of the system, an
    8-channel relay, that will allow to operate the valves in charge of the automated
    irrigation of the crop and several different sensors that will measure the different
    analogue values of the harvest and command actions deployed by the Arduino, as
    for example irrigation of the substrate in case it is necessary. It is observed
    that this is a simple circuit that could be implemented in an agile and simple
    way, and does not need a large space to be installed, it is completed by a stainless
    steel structure and ordinary PVC pipes to contain the resulting crops (Fig. 2).
    Fig. 1. Hardware connection diagram Full size image Fig. 2. Actual hardware connected
    Full size image A. Sensors To obtain data of the level of hydrogen concentration
    in water, it is necessary to use sensors, for the development a pH sensor was
    used, its operation consists of detecting the electric current, which can be a
    negative or positive value, and its generated by the existence of hydrogen ions
    present in the water. This device is composed of an electrode, a BNC connector
    and a sensor circuit. The sensor circuit is an integrated element that facilitates
    reading the pH level, it uses an asynchronous communication protocol, used in
    computer systems due to its compatibility with other components. In addition to
    the measurements of the concentration of hydrogen in the hydroponic harvest, its
    humidity must also be monitored, this action consists of measuring the humidity
    due to the variation of its conductivity and thus be able to activate the irrigation
    system. The humidity sensor used is the FC-28, which is a plate that allows us
    to obtain the measurement as an analogue value or as an digital output signal
    activated when humidity exceeds a certain threshold, which are values ranging
    from 0 (submerged in water) to 1023 (in the air or dry substrate). As for the
    digital output, this is triggered by exceeding the humidity threshold that is
    adjusted by a potentiometer built into the YL-83 module, to obtain a LOW signal,
    if the substrate is not wet and HIGH when the humidity exceeds the set value,
    it will depend on the type of soil or substrate and the presence of fertilizers,
    since different plants do not require the same humidity, so the calibration of
    the analog value of the YL-83 module must be done in the workplace. B. Results:
    First of all, achieve the interconnection of the different components, the different
    sensors have to be are calibrated. With the pH sensor, the correct calibration
    is checked with the pH 10.00 solution. After checking the pH sensor calibration,
    the levels present in the solution are observed, this is observed with the Arduino
    interface. To verify the correct functioning of the implemented system, a hydroponic
    crop of peppers (Capsicum annuum) was implemented. The proper growth of the vegetable
    crop was supported with the appropriate pH level in the nutrient solution, this
    result was given by the pH sensor, which varies according to the type of harvest.
    Up next the measure of acidity or alkalinity in the crop is shown for the vegetable
    chosen for the validation of the proposal. In Table 1, pH levels for a pepper
    crop, it is indicated that the levels suitable for the pepper range from 6.5 to
    7.5, the pH sensor is in charge of controlling the adequate levels in the nutrient
    solution based on the programming code of the microcontroller and calibration
    of the pH circuit. Table 1. PH levels for a peppers crop Full size table The showed
    results are based on a survey with subjective questions made to experts in the
    area of agriculture, who compared the products obtained using the automated hydroponic
    system, in contrast, to products obtained by conventional sowing, with a similar
    period of time to develop. 4 Analysis Due to the correct measurement of the pH
    sensor and humidity sensor that activate valves for automatic irrigation, we proceed
    to demonstrate the growth result of the pepper crop which takes about three months
    of development and flowering in the structure of the hydroponic system. It must
    be taken into consideration the rapid growth of hydroponic harvest compared to
    conventional crops [17, 18], due to the high proportion of air that it has, this
    becomes a saving of light and products, to be less time in growth than in land,
    with hydroponics, a larger size is reached in the same time of cultivation than
    on land. Analyzing the air issues, its greater presence favors a development of
    the roots much higher than on land, which produces a higher production than on
    land, or at least, it is usually easier to get more production in hydroponics
    [19] The flavors tend to be lighter, although the washing of roots in hydroponics
    will be much easier than on land, and, depending on the hydroponic system, it
    is usually also cleaner than on land. Both, at the time of the crop and at the
    time of throwing the surplus of the crop, in hydroponics it will be much easier
    to recycle the harvest products (Fig. 3). Fig. 3. Flowering in two months of the
    pepper cultivation Full size image 5 Conclusions With the construction of the
    structure of the hydroponic system it was possible to apply technological solutions
    in the field of agriculture, through a prototype applied to hydroponics with intelligent
    and independent automated irrigation, based on the results provided by the sensors
    to the microcontroller. Not all plant crops nourish with the same pH value for
    their proper growth and flowering in the nutrient solution, so using the pH sensor
    we can apply the appropriate level of pH required by the crop in order to be able
    to carry out an agricultural precision. The main function is through the use of
    free hardware components [20] from different manufacturers that were connected
    together, in order to convert the analog values present in the nutritive solution
    into digital values sent to the microcontroller, which in turn executes the determined
    actions. For the standard avr-libc programming of the source code of the Atmel
    microcontroller of the arduino mega, free programming software was used, such
    as the IDE Arduino. It must be taken into consideration that the system has some
    limitations, such as the fact that a stable and continuous energy supply is required,
    which suggests the implementation of voltage surge protectors, against voltage
    variations and energy backup systems due to the sensitivity of the elements, in
    addition that the system is developed for a specific vegetable, as a result of
    the different controls implemented. At the same time, the developed work can be
    improved through a macro project that seeks to implement an orchard with a greater
    number of vegetable varieties, with the respective expansion of sensors, research
    and new configuration of controllers, or on the contrary, micro projects to encourage
    the population to have homemade hydroponic crops as an alternative source of food
    for nutrition. Notes 1. http://www.ecuadorencifras.gob.ec/estadisticas-agropecuarias-2/.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Santa Clara, CA, USA SECTION 1. Introduction
    Optimum management of water and fertilizer can increase crop yield and net return
    remarkably at harvest. Just as there are benefits, risks also need to be considered.
    A significant risk when utilizing water and chemicals is over-application, which
    could lead to contamination of water resources and reduce crop yield and net return.
    Traditionally, irrigation and chemigation applications involve human engagement
    to interpret crop conditions and to implement the respective applications. This
    mode of operation can result in human error, less than optimal crop yield and
    lower water and chemical use efficiency. Recently, automated irrigation and chemigation
    strategies based on sensor data have been widely studied [1]. However, those strategies
    mostly use thresholds or simplistic mathematical models for decision making, which
    often result in imprecise applications. Another significant weakness of sensor-based
    strategies is that, given the complexity of real-life environments, human management
    decisions are based on thresholds and mathematical models that lack scalability,
    and forming or using thresholds or mathematical models can be complex and time
    consuming. To address these issues, some neural network-based approaches have
    been developed [2]. But those methods still require human understanding and oversight
    to analyze and control the irrigation and chemigation events effectively. In this
    work, we present a double deep Q-learning-based technique to maximize the net
    return at harvest. The proposed technique is designed to optimize timing and amounts
    of irrigation and chemigation applications during the crop growing season. Simulation
    results show an average of 50% increase of net return at harvest when compared
    to traditional methods based on DSSAT [3], which is a software-based predictor
    that predicts crop yield. SECTION 2. Previous Work Typically, irrigation and chemigation
    applications require human engagement to analyze crop conditions, decide a course
    of action, and execute the action. Figure 1 shows an example flow of typical (traditional)
    irrigation and chemigation management. This approach requires considerable human
    understanding and engagement, including collecting data from different sources,
    for example, soil characteristics, weather conditions, crop growing stage, and
    soil moisture and nutrient information. The complexity of the calculations and
    analysis is proportional to the amount of information used by the control system,
    and such process can take many hours to be executed by a human. Thus, this process
    may have a low efficiency and hence a poor net return. As sensor technologies
    have matured, they have made it more feasible to automate management decision
    with the aim of improving efficiency of irrigation and chemigation. In the last
    decade or so, many sensor-based agricultural irrigation and/or chemigation systems
    have been studied. The systems introduced by [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] can
    make irrigation decisions based on sensor information. Their work demonstrates
    that better water use efficiency can be achieved by avoiding unnecessary irrigation
    events. Figure 1: Traditional irrigation and chemigation system Show All In the
    work done by [11], a smart irrigation decision support system was introduced,
    the whole flow of this work is shown in Figure 2. In this approach, a neural network-based
    model calculates and analyzes information from sensors and generate the irrigation
    report. The professional worker can then select appropriate irrigation events
    for maximum benefit based on the irrigation report. Their work significantly reduced
    the amount of human effort involved in the irrigation decision. Figure 2: Smart
    Irrigation Decision Support System Show All However, the system still requires
    human supervision for the control of irrigation events, and the decision-making
    process heavily relies on historical data, and thus lacks the ability to learn
    from the changing environment. Another approach by [12] implemented irrigation
    control by a model-based reinforcement learning technique where the system is
    assumed to be linear, whereas the systems in real crop environments are more complex.
    An advanced approach by [2] proposed a reinforcement learning-based irrigation
    control system which is a fully automated high efficiency irrigation control system
    (patent pending). The system flow is summarized in Figure 3. Figure 3: Reinforcement
    learning based irrigation system Show All The main idea of the work is to construct
    a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to perform irrigation control. Two
    neural networks are trained to replace DSSAT [3], where one network takes weather
    and irrigation information and predicts soil moisture levels, and the other network
    takes daily soil moisture information over the entire crop growing season and
    then predicts crop yield at harvest. In the reinforcement learning phase, the
    predicted yield is used to train the decision-making module. This work provides
    a solution of fully automated irrigation control, but it is limited by small state
    space which limits applicability. To overcome the weakness of [2] ’s approach,
    the work done by [13] provided a solution by using a deep reinforcement learning
    technique which no longer requires a small state space. However, in real world
    practice, irrigation and chemigation are often combined to achieve the maximum
    crop yield, [13] ’s work failed to address the chemigation events; hence it only
    solved the irrigation side of the problem. In the work done by [14], they presented
    a computer based chemigation control solution, which takes the state variables
    in agricultural systems and compares them with the predefined value and then makes
    the decision of chemigation. Their work can achieve a better efficiency of chemigation,
    but it still limits the decision-making process within some human defined range.
    In this work, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm is presented for irrigation
    and chemigation together to fill the gap of automatic irrigation and chemigation.
    Our constructed method is based on double deep Q-learning (DDQN) which was first
    introduced by [15]. The experiment results shows that our solution outperforms
    previous techniques. SECTION 3. Irrigation and chemigation with deep reinforcement
    learning Reinforcement learning is a decision-making process in an uncertain environment,
    which is represented by set of states S = {s1, s2, s3,…}. Over time, the environment
    transits from one state to another. Meanwhile, there are a set of actions A =
    {a1, a2, a3,…}. At a time step, an action which is taken by an agent is to affect
    the state transition probability, and then an immediate reward is received. Reinforcement
    learning is to train a policy that guides the agent to determine the action at
    each state. The goal is to maximize a long-term return, which is the accumulated
    reward over time. For agricultural irrigation and chemigation, the states can
    be observed from the crop during the growing season. In our approach, the states
    are defined to be weather conditions, soil moisture and fertilizer information,
    and crop growth stage. The action corresponds to different application amounts
    for water and chemicals (fertilizers). The immediate reward can be extracted from
    intermediate DSSAT result files. Meanwhile, Eq. 1 illustrates how the return is
    calculated. Return=Y∗ P y −W∗ P w −C∗ P c (1) View Source Y is the final dry yield
    at harvest, W and C correspond to total application amounts of water and chemical
    during the entire crop season, and Py,Pw and Pc represent the prices for crops,
    water, and chemicals. Other costs of production (seed, tillage, and other inputs)
    are assumed constant between the management scenarios under given crop-soil-climate
    conditions. In our approach, the agent is the entire irrigation and chemigation
    control system. The DSSAT environment in our approach is a simulator, which takes
    an action from the agent’s output as input and simulates the corresponding rewards
    and moves to the next state. An agent must follow certain policy during the interaction
    with the environment, and the policy tells which action the agent should take
    given the current state of the environment. In this approach, we used action-value
    function Q(s,a) [16] to help us to locate the optimal policy. The Q value function
    maps each state action pair (s, a) to a numerical value, and it defines how good
    the action is in the long run given a state. The Q value provides the discounted
    cumulative reward in the future that the current action can expect given the current
    state. The optimal action value function, Q*, corresponds to the optimal policy,
    and during the training the policy Q has the control of which state action pair
    is visited, hence, the Q value of the visited state action pair gets updated.
    It is common that an action has a \"bad\" immediate reward, but a good cumulative
    reward in the long run. With traditional reinforcement learning algorithms, Q
    values are stored in a lookup table during the training process. When states of
    the problem increase, the table size increases exponentially. In real world applications,
    storing such a large table is inefficient and often impossible to attain convergence.
    To overcome this issue, deep Q-learning [17] uses convolution neural network (CNN)
    and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques to replace the Q value table. Let
    Q(s,a;θ) be the approximate action-function with parameters θ which are all trainable
    parameters in CNN and ANN. Then, one can update θ through a variety of reinforcement
    learning algorithms. With deep Q-learning, the direct approach of the optimal
    action value function is shown in Eq. 2. The parameter θ can be updated iteratively
    as shown in Eq. 3, where ∇ θ t Q( s t , a t ;θ) is the gradient of the action
    value function Q on θ and α is the step size of the stochastic gradient descent
    method [18]. Q ∗ ( s t , a t )≈Q( s t , a t ;θ) θ=θ+α( Y DQN t −Q( s t , a t ;θ))∗
    ∇ θ t Q( s t , a t ;θ) Y DQN t ≡ r t +γ max a t+1 Q( s t+1 , a t+1 ;θ) (2) (3)
    (4) View Source After a number of iterations, the Q value will converge to the
    optimal target value Y DQ N ∗ t for every state-action pair (st, at). Hence one
    can pick an action based on the Q value. Unfortunately, Q-learning, and deep Q-learning
    have a well- known drawback which is overestimated action values under certain
    conditions. To overcome this weakness, we use double deep Q-learning (DDQN) by
    [15] for combined irrigation and chemigation control. The large bias due to the
    overestimated action values of Q-learning and deep Q-learning will lead to suboptimal
    policies. The problem of overestimation of Q-learning was first discovered by
    [19], where the uniformly distributed random errors are contained in the action
    values. The work done by [15] investigated that estimation errors of any kind
    can induce an upward bias. Hence, to overcome this issue, double deep Q-learning
    is studied. The idea of using double deep Q-learning is to reduce overestimations
    by separating action selection and action evaluation. In this scenario, an additional
    network Q(s,a;θ−) is introduced which is used to estimate the action at. The update
    of double deep Q-learning is the same as deep Q-learning, but the target Y DQN
    t in Eq. 4 is replaced by Y DDQN t in Eq. 5. The update of the network Q(s,a;θ−)
    is a periodic partial copy of the network Q (s, a; θ). Y DDQN t ≡ r t +γQ( s t+1
    , max a t+1 Q( s t+1 , a t+1 ;θ); θ − ) (5) View Source In this work, we present
    a double deep Q-learning based irrigation and chemigation system to maximize the
    net return for the crop at harvest. The environment is defined by inputs selected
    within the DSSAT software, which takes application amounts of water and chemical
    (in this case fertilizers) as inputs for each time step during the simulated crop
    growing season and outputs the simulated final crop yield at harvest with daily
    soil information given predefined crop type, weather information and soil type.
    SECTION 4. Implementation The Q value is approximated by a multi-layer ANN which
    takes sensor data of soil information (water content and nutrient levels) from
    different depths (soil layers), crop evapotranspiration, precipitation and crop
    growth stage as inputs to the current state, then outputs Q values of all possible
    actions, respectively. Since the inputs are in vector form, CNN is not needed
    in our approach. By the greedy method, one can choose the action corresponding
    to the highest Q value. To increase the stability and performance of the neural
    network, we implemented experience replay [20] with DDQN algorithm. The idea was
    to construct a limited size replay memory, which stores experience et = (st, at,
    rt, st+1) at each time step t into the memory, where st and at are the state and
    action at time step t; rt is the cumulative reward at time step t ; and st+1 is
    the next state observed from the environment. When the memory reaches the maximum
    size, the new experience will overwrite the oldest experience and this process
    continues until the end of the training process. To deal with the tradeoff between
    exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning ϵ– greedy algorithm was
    also implemented. The irrigation and chemigation system structure is shown in
    Figure 4. The complete DDQN algorithm for irrigation and chemigation control is
    shown in Figure 5. Figure 4: DDQN based irrigation and chemigation flow Show All
    For the DDQN algorithm in Figure 5, lines 1-4 illustrate the algorithm setup.
    One must initialize replay memory M with size N, agent network Qaction, and evaluation
    network Qevaluation. The agent network Qaction is used to select an action, and
    the evaluation network Qevaluation is used to evaluate an action. The number of
    training episodes G, batch size, update evaluation network, and τ must be chosen
    carefully. A small G is not sufficient to ensure DDQN convergence. Typically,
    large batch size speeds up the training, but may degrade the performance of the
    network. The \"update evaluation network\" determines how often the evaluation
    network gets updated, too frequently or too infrequently will degrade the network
    performance. The parameter τ controls the step size for each target network update.
    Line 5 is the start of the training process where the total number of training
    episode is G. Each episode represents one entire crop season. Line 6 is the starting
    point of one episode and a starting state st must be initialized. Lines 7-22 are
    the body of one crop season which ends at harvest. Lines 8 and 9 illustrate the
    ϵ-greedy algorithm which is an action select strategy. A random action at for
    irrigation and chemigation is chosen with probability ε; otherwise, the action
    at will be chosen based on the highest Q value. Figure 5: Algorithm for DDQN irrigation
    and chemigation Show All Lines 10-12 define the reaction of the DSSAT software
    given the action at. Once the action at is passed to DSSAT, a set of result files
    is generated and one can extract the next state st+1 and the reward rt from those
    files. Line 13 stores the experience et into the memory M. Line 14 defines the
    state transition where the next state is set to the current state. Line 15 extracts
    the number of samples from the memory M which will be used for updating the Q
    value. Lines 16-20 illustrate the update role of the Q value. If the sample’s
    state is at the terminal state, Q value get updated by reward ri. Otherwise, Q
    gets updated following Eq. 5. Line 21 updates all trainable parameters θ in an
    agent network Q by the gradient descent method based on mean square error. Lines
    23-26 define the update of the target network Qtarget. If the target network needs
    to be updated, then the process partially copies the parameters from Q to Qtarget.
    SECTION 6. Results and discussion To evaluate the performance and efficiency of
    the proposed double deep Q-learning based irrigation and chemigation approach,
    we compared its results versus multiple differing approaches, including three
    traditional application scheduling methods, the threshold-based method [14], and
    another deep reinforcement learning algorithm [13]. The three traditional application
    scheduling methods represent methods that are commonly used in agriculture for
    chemigation. The detail of associated chemigation control for the three traditional
    application methods are shown in Table 1; with the irrigation method being the
    same among all three traditional methods. The total suggested irrigation and chemical
    amount during the crop growing season can be found in Table 2, and those values
    are calculated based on crop type and maximum yield that can be expected at harvest.
    For the traditional methods, irrigation and chemigation are scheduled to be applied
    once per week. (This application practice is sometimes referred to \"spoon feeding\".)
    The irrigation amount was based on averaged weekly suggested value, minus the
    total precipitation for that week, which was extracted from historical data in
    DSSAT, but one could substitute infeed from onsite weather data in the case of
    field studies; the chemigation amount was based on the DSSAT mean weekly suggested
    value. Table 1: Traditional Method The threshold method compares the current soil
    content information, extracted from DSSAT resultant files, with a predefined (set)
    threshold; thus, if soil water or fertilizer level is lower than the predefined
    threshold then a corresponding application is executed until it reaches a certain
    value. The threshold value is set to match the value system used in DSSAT. Table
    2: Suggested water and fertilizer For the double deep Q-learning and deep Q-learning
    techniques, the time interval between two consecutive applications was set to
    be at least 3 days to represent a reasonable field practice irrigation and chemigation
    schedule; however, this value can be changed depending on different production
    situations. The successfully trained double deep Q-learning and deep Q-learning
    methods were then used for the comparison. Figure 6 shows the double deep Q-learning
    and deep Q-learning training curve for sorghum under Austin, Texas historic weather
    conditions with a Rothamsted (silty clay loam) soil type with all other environment
    modules following the same pattern. As one can observe that the DDQN and DQN take
    similar amount of time to converge, but DDQN has a better reward and less variance
    than DQN. The soils evaluated in this study were selected due to the parameters
    completeness of the respective differing soils data in the DSSAT database. The
    combination of soils and weather conditions in this study were selected to evaluate
    the performance of our proposed method under a diversity of environments. Figure
    6: DDQN and DQN training curve for sorghum at Austin with Rothamsted soil type.
    Show All Table 3: Configuration for DSSAT simulations All comparisons were based
    on simulation results from the DSSAT model. The configuration detail used with
    DSSAT can be found in Table 3. The crop and soil information used in our experiments
    were selected from the DSSAT database, and the weather information was historic
    data in the DSSAT database. The soil water and fertilizer content information
    were extracted from DSSAT results files after each event application. Such information
    could also be obtained by soil water sensors and NPK sensors in field conditions.
    Half of the comparisons assumed sandy clay loam soil type in combination with
    different crops and weather locations (conditions), and the other half of the
    comparisons assumed Austin weather conditions in combination with the other crops
    and soil types. The combinations of weather stations and soil types were imposed
    to generate a diversity of crop conditions under which to evaluate the strategies.
    The comparison results can be found in Figure 7. Figure 7: Experiment Result Comparison
    Show All In each set of comparisons, we selected the best of the three traditional
    methods for comparison with other methods. Through comparison we observed that
    our proposed double deep Q-learning irrigation and chemigation approach outperformed
    all other approaches for corn, sorghum, and most of the cases for cotton and for
    two cases for soybean. For the rest of the cases, the double deep Q-learning is
    the second-best result which is also very close to the optimal results. Meanwhile,
    we also observe that the double deep Q-learning maximized the net return and achieved
    the highest crop yield. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the proposed
    double deep Q-learning based irrigation and chemigation control can achieve a
    better net return under various DSSAT simulated crop-field conditions using a
    precise application amount and schedule. SECTION 7. Conclusions In this work,
    a double deep Q-learning based irrigation and chemigation approach is proposed
    and evaluated. Using this approach, the final net return of a crop is increased
    due to high efficiency of irrigation and chemigation. Using DSSAT to simulate
    crop conditions and responses, the double deep Q-learning approach determined
    profitable solutions under various situations to achieve a higher net return as
    compared to traditional irrigation and chemigation methods. The experiment compared
    the double deep Q-learning approach with baseline scheduling approaches and indicated
    that that the double deep Q-learning approach outperformed the other approaches
    in most cases. Future study is needed to focus on testing the double deep Q-learning
    scheduling in actual field studies. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics

  description: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in agriculture has
    the potential to revolutionize the industry, making it more efficient, sustainable,
    and productive. AI can be used to analyze data from various sources, such as satellite
    imagery, drones, and sensors, to provide farmers with valuable insights. It helps
    in optimizing irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application by identifying
    areas of the field that require attention. AI algorithms can also predict crop
    yield, disease outbreaks, and recommend optimal planting and harvesting times.
    AI-powered systems can monitor crops and livestock through computer vision techniques
    and sensor data analysis. This enables early detection of plant diseases, nutrient
    deficiencies, or pest infestations. Livestock monitoring can include facial recognition
    to identify individual animals, behavior analysis to detect signs of illness or
    distress, and automated feeding systems. In developing countries like India, the
    rapid spread of mobile internet technology is offering a vital role in economic
    growth, social empowerment, and grass roots creativity. Every harvested crop needs
    to be transported. Transportation is one of the important factors for a farmer’s
    success. Transport that is well-managed is effective in transporting farm resources
    and harvested products as quickly as possible. So we are going to develop an android
    application for farmers and transport service providers. By this, we can pool
    the farmers according to their requirements.

    Arduino board was integrated with a multispectral camera, mini LiDAR sensors,
    infrared thermometers, soil moisture sensors, water pumps, and a temperature/humidity
    sensor. Sensor calibration and power management enhanced the accuracy and reliability
    of the system. Two genotypes (CAM212 and Giessen#4) of camelina were used to evaluate
    the system to measure phenotypic responses to abiotic stress in growth chambers
    under two temperatures (25 °C and 35 °C) and two water treatments (40% and 90%
    water holding capacity). The HTP system monitored 24 plants periodically, and
    data were wirelessly accessed by a smartphone and transferred to a computer for
    further analyses. The system revealed that camelina genotype 1 (CAM212) showed
    superior resistance to heat and drought stress. The results showed that the developed
    HTP system offers a cost-effective and portable solution for phenotyping and water
    management in controlled environment and can be modified for field applications.

    processingArduinoRaspberry Pi Introduction Plant breeding promotes the development
    of new cultivars for sustainable agriculture and requires measurement of phenotypic
    responses developed from the interaction of genotypes with the environment. High-throughput
    phenotyping (HTP) equipped with novel sensing and analytical capabilities is essential
    to improve genetic modeling and thus expedites the identification of germplasm
    that increases the crop productivity. HTP systems have been used in plant phenotyping
    to identify crop responses to abiotic stress and to discover novel traits related
    to tolerance [1,2]. Image-based phenotyping became a promising HTP tool because
    of the improvement in handling large numbers of images. Multispectral cameras
    have been widely used for plant phenotyping [[3], [4], [5]]. Various image processing
    pipelines were developed to assess plant vigor by NDVI [6], growth rate by measuring
    leaf area [7], and shoot phenotypes by image classification [8]. HTPheno software
    [9] was reported to automate image analysis of a single barley plant at a time.
    An ideal image analytic toolbox is to process multiple plants through the automated
    image processing. Canopy temperature was used for plant stress detection [[10],
    [11], [12]] and phenotyping [[13], [14], [15]] using infrared (IR) thermometers.
    Plant height has been measured for plant phenotyping by Light Detection and Ranging
    (LiDAR) [[16], [17], [18], [19]] or ultrasonic sensors [13,15]. Microcontroller-based
    systems are low-cost, highly configurable computing devices that have transformed
    the field of agricultural research. Arduino is an open-source electronics consisting
    of microcontroller hardware and Arduino software for programming and has been
    identified as a viable alternative for commercial instrumentation in scientific
    research [20]. The wide variety of inexpensive hardware and availability of open-source
    code libraries make Arduino the best choice for data loggers [21]. The plug-and-play
    nature of Arduino devices has attracted researchers for power-efficient systems
    [22] such as plant growers [23], environmental monitoring [24], and harvest management
    [25]. Prior applications of Arduino on water management include water conservation
    [26], water quality [27], irrigation [[28], [29], [30]], and water intake [31].
    Most applications focus on irrigation control from soil water feedback [[32],
    [33], [34]] or plant sensing [[35], [36], [37]]. Breeding research increased the
    need to support both plant phenotyping and percipient irrigation for effective
    plant monitoring under the water stress maintained by an irrigation controller.
    Raspberry Pi (RPi) is a compact single-board computer created for the development
    of a small and affordable computing platform for education [38]. Open-source software
    such as Python provides a flexible design of open-source systems and allows users
    to address specific needs in agronomic and environmental monitoring. A growing
    population of researchers use RPi computers for a wide range of applications:
    autonomous farming machines [39], pest detection in livestock feed storage [40],
    and plant phenotyping [41,42]. Arduinos along with the Raspberry Pi (RPi) pack
    considerable power on their diminutive boards, making them ideal for integration
    into scientific sensors and providing tremendous opportunities for automation,
    networking, and data collection and analysis [22]. This inexpensive open-source
    protocol increased the possibilities of design and resources available for troubleshooting.
    Although many applications of this protocol were reported, there are only a few
    applied on plant phenotyping [1,2]. Details of sensor integration, power management,
    and sensor calibration are not sufficiently provided. This research aims to develop
    a cost-effective HTP system to measure plant responses under abiotic stress using
    open-source electronics associated with sensor integration, calibration, and power
    management. Specific objectives are to (1) build a portable HTP system using Arduino-RPi
    protocol and image analytics for remote monitoring of plant phenotypes, (2) add
    an irrigation controller to the system to support water management for drought
    study, and (3) apply the system on camelina plants in growth chambers to identify
    phenotypic responses to heat and drought stress. Materials and methods In order
    to support plant phenotyping and automated irrigation, a cost-effective reliable
    solution was considered for end-users to enable them to afford sensing systems
    and expand their applications. A portable wireless HTP system was designed to
    offer quick installation and easy modification and was developed using Arduino
    Uno (DFR0216, DFRobot, China) and RPi (3B+, Raspberry Pi Foundation, UK). An irrigation
    controller was needed to automate water management for drought study and was integrated
    with the HTP system. The system was applied on camelina plants in growth chambers
    to characterize agronomic traits conditioning abiotic stress tolerance. Sensing
    system Plant phenotyping Metrics for plant phenotyping included canopy temperature,
    plant height, and vegetation indexes measured by infrared (IR) thermometers (SEN0206,
    DFRobot, China), mini LiDAR sensors (SEN0259, DFRobot, China), and multispectral
    cameras (Survey3W, MAPIR, San Diego, CA, USA), respectively. The IR thermometer
    measures the surface temperature by detecting IR radiation energy and wavelength
    distribution through an amplifier with 17-bit ADC. The sensor has a 35° field
    of view (FOV) with 0.01 °C precision and ±0.5 °C accuracy and is connected through
    inter-integrated circuit (I2C) to the microcontroller. An I2C multiplexer (DFR0576,
    DFRobot, China) was used to solve the address conflict of multiple IR thermometers
    on a single I2C port by providing addresses from 0x70 to 0x77. The LiDAR sensor
    is an unidirectional laser range finder based on time-of-flight (ToF) technology
    and measures the distance in the range of 0.3–12 m at 2° FOV in 100 Hz with 1-mm
    resolution and ±6 cm accuracy. The sensor is interfaced through a universal asynchronous
    receiver\\transmitter (UART). In order to connect multiple LiDAR sensors on one
    UART port in the microcontroller, software serial was used through digital ports
    such that Rx (receiver) and Tx (transmitter) wires were defined in SoftwareSerial
    function in the Arduino program. The LiDAR sensor ran at higher amperage than
    the maximum current provided from the microcontroller, and thus an external power
    source was required to achieve stable operation of the LiDAR sensor. A temperature\\relative
    humidity (T\\RH) sensor (DHT22, DFRobot, China) was used to monitor the temperature
    and humidity in the chamber. The sensor delivers digital output of the temperature
    with 0.1 °C precision and ±0.5 °C accuracy and humidity with 0.1% resolution and
    ±2% accuracy. It is connected through a standard single-bus digital interface.
    An LCD screen (DFR0063, DFRobot, China) was added to the microcontroller through
    the I2C multiplexer to display T\\RH with a time stamp. A multispectral (Red,
    Green, and Near-infrared) camera was attached in nadir view to monitor the plant
    vegetation index (VI) and leaf area index (LAI) and triggered by a pulse-width
    modulation (PWM) signal from the microcontroller. Image analytics The images captured
    by the multispectral camera were processed through a series of steps as shown
    in Fig. 1. The raw image is acquired in 3-band (3b) false color in the order of
    red (R), green (G), and near-infrared (N) with 4000 × 3000 resolution and 16-bit
    depth. They were preprocessed for conversion from raw to tif format and radiometric
    calibration to deliver canopy reflectance with a reflectance target board provided
    by the camera manufacturer. An image processing pipeline was developed for HTP
    through thresholding, filtering, masking, segmentation, and gridding (Fig. 1).
    A normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) image was converted from the 16-bit
    RGN image using a band math of (N - R) / (N + R) and automatically segmented by
    using Otsu [43] algorithm and filtered through the opening operation. Once the
    NDVI is masked to exclude non-vegetation background pixels, A 2 × 7 grid was applied
    on the masked NDVI to create 14 regions of interest (ROI), where seven columns
    were evenly spaced to fit three pots on each side and a dummy column in the middle
    to isolate non-vegetation pixels (Fig. 1). Three ROIs on each side were grouped
    to extract individual metrics of four experimental groups in each chamber. Canopy
    coverage was calculated from the masked NDVI image as a percentage of vegetation
    pixels to the combined area of three ROIs. A Python script was coded for a batch
    process to implement a series of image processing algorithm and export into a
    comma delimited file phenotypic metrics, i.e., vegetation index and canopy coverage.

    the raw image is processed and extracted for phenotypic metrics through calibration,
    thresholding, filtering, masking, segmentation, and gridding. The lower part illustrates
    a sequence of the images processed. Microcontroller The Arduino is a standardized
    rapid prototyping platform using the ATmega328 microcontroller [44] and was selected
    based on its inexpensive and customizable advantages with a wide range of sensors
    and actuators which are easily setup with sample codes and wire diagrams provided
    by manufacturer. The microcontroller has four main types of sensor interface:
    Analog\\Digital inputs, I2C, serial peripheral interface (SPI), and UART. I2C
    is the most common interface that uses 2-wire bus from a master to many slaves
    in 400 kHz: ‘SDA’ (serial data) for bidirectional data transmission and ‘SCL’
    (serial clock) for synchronizing the data transfer. SPI is used for fast, full-duplex
    sync serial data link. UART is a serial data transfer and has two ways to implement:
    software serial and hardware serial. The software serial reads only a single data
    entry at a time, whereas hardware serial can read data simultaneously using ‘Rx’
    (receiver) and ‘Tx’ (transmitter) pins. Arduino Uno provides six multiplexed analog
    input pins, 14 digital input\\output (DIO) of which six provide pulse-width modulation
    (PWM) output, one I2C, one SPI, and one UART. The analog input pins support 10-bit
    analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) using analogRead function. Most of the analog
    inputs can also be used as digital pins: analog input 0 as digital pin 14 through
    analog input 5 as digital pin 19 [45]. All sensors and actuators were connected
    to the microcontroller that was placed in a waterproof enclosure box (1020, Pelican,
    Torrance, CA, USA) including a relay shield mounted on the microcontroller. Arduino
    Shields were added as pin layout that makes wire connection efficient without
    soldering and thus saves time and cost for projects. The enclosure box was modified
    to feed cables through three holes: a USB cable from the RPi, wires from the four
    water pumps, and wires from all other sensors. The box allowed all wires to remain
    intact and undamaged inside the box during the experiment and the flexibility
    to rewire in hardware update and troubleshooting wire connectivity. Single-board
    computer The RPi is low cost and low power consumption with light weight but still
    offers a powerful computing and a full peripheral interface of a computer. The
    RPi 3B+ contains 1.4 GHz quad-core ARM processor with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, HDMI,
    and four USB ports. The RPi was enclosed in a protective box. Table 1 shows a
    complete list of all electronic components of the sensing system with total cost
    of USD 874 and total weight of 1.7 kg. A flowchart of Python code operating RPi
    is illustrated in Fig. 2. For the convenience of debugging, a serial port is opened
    for either an RPi or a personal computer (PC). After first 10 dummy iterations
    to avoid broken characters that were observed at the beginning of serial connection,
    input strings from Arduino were validated by the length of characters before saving
    them into a file Table 1. Electronic components of the sensing system used in

    Fig. 2. Flowchart of Python code in RPi in a sequence of opening a serial port
    for either RPi or PC, reading strings from Arduino after first 10 dummy iterations,
    validating the input strings by a string length, and saving them to an output
    file. Wireless communication The RPi was programmed by a Python script to read
    a serial data from the Arduino through a USB connection at 115,200 baud rate and
    store data strings to a file with time stamps. Real-time status of all sensory
    data was also displayed by the script on the RPi terminal and accessed wirelessly
    from a remote computer or a smartphone through Wi-Fi connection. Wi-Fi was selected
    for wireless data communication, because it is a built-in feature in RPi and can
    easily connect to the internet cloud that allows the user to remotely access to
    data stored in the RPi. The RPi was configured for Wi-Fi by enabling Secure Shell
    (SSH) and Virtual Network Computing (VNC) interfaces. When the RPi is connected
    to Wi-Fi through an access point (AP), network IP address is assigned to the RPi
    and used to remotely connect to the RPi using PuTTY via SSH for terminal access
    or VNC Viewer for remote desktop access. When the RPi is connected to a hidden
    network, wpa_supplicant.conf must be created in the RPi directory of etc/wpa_supplicant
    to assign network ID and user account credential. RPi 3B+ with Debian Stretch
    operation system (OS) was used for a stable Wi-Fi connection, as RPi 4 with Debian
    Buster OS was found unstable in connecting to a hidden network. The RPi configuration
    was updated to automatically run a Python script (e.g., autowater.py) that starts
    reading data from the Arduino when the RPi is powered on by adding codes (Fig.
    3) at the end of the file ‘∼/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart’ for automatically
    opening a terminal at reboot and adding ‘python autowater.py’ at the end of the
    file ’.bashrc’. Download : Download high-res image (38KB) Download : Download

    management The characterization of agronomic traits resistant to drought stress
    requires a system to support both plant phenotyping and water management. The
    HTP system was extended to include soil water monitoring and irrigation control
    for effective monitoring of plant responses to water stress in a controlled environment.
    Growth chambers were used for the experiment to provide arid (heat and drought)
    conditions for the plant. Fig. 4 illustrates a schematic diagram of the automated
    irrigation and phenotyping system in a chamber. Download : Download high-res image

    right were the drought and control group, respectively. Lines of information flow
    and interface types are drawn and described in the right top inset. Drought condition
    was generated by separating water treatments from water pumps (FIT0200, DFRobot,
    China) to plants based on soil status readings from soil moisture sensors (SEN0193,
    DFRobot, China). The water pump was equipped with a capacity of 280–500 L/h and
    powered by 6–18 DCV rated at 64–500 mA. A relay (DFR0144, DFRobot, China) was
    added to operate four water pumps. Each water pump supplied water to three replicated
    pots through an irrigation dripper (Fig. 4). A vinyl-flex PVC tube was used for
    irrigation from the water pumps to pots. A 13-L water bucket was placed in the
    chamber as a water reservoir for 12 pots and was refilled weekly. To automate
    water management, soil moisture sensors were deployed to control amount of irrigation
    based on soil water status. Four soil moisture sensors were used in each chamber
    by installing a sensor on each pot in four observation groups and inserted vertically
    at 7.2-cm soil depth. Four water pumps were paired with four soil sensors to control
    each pump individually based on corresponding soil moisture reading. The closed-loop
    irrigation was scheduled every 6 h to maintain two soil conditions (drought and
    control) by checking soil sensors and triggering the water pumps. Sensor installation
    Two adjustable rods were mounted 131 cm above the floor in parallel between side
    walls of the growth chamber to hold four IR thermometers and two LiDAR sensors
    (Fig. 5). Two LiDAR sensors aimed two pots next to the water bucket: one in the
    control group and the other in the drought group, whereas four IR thermometers
    aimed at four pots located around the bucket. Another rod was mounted 140 cm above
    the floor to hold the multispectral camera. All sensors and the camera were angled
    perpendicular to the ground. Two horizontal metal plates were mounted to a vertical
    rack on the rear wall and used to hold the microcontroller, RPi, and T\\RH sensor
    at the lower plate and the LCD screen at the upper plate. Download : Download

    moisture sensors were installed in the soil of four pots next to the water bucket
    where the water pumps were immersed in the water. Power management Power management
    is important to ensure stable operations of all sensors and actuators, the microcontroller
    (Arduino), and the RPi and must be determined by understanding the power consumption
    of each module and optimizing the wiring configurations. The RPi is powered by
    5 DCV rated at 2.5 A and typically requires 500–700 mA [38]. The USB peripheral
    of RPi 3B+ model draws maximum current of 1.2 A and typical active current of
    500 mA [46]. The Arduino is powered by 5 DCV via USB connection or 7–12 DCV power
    adapter. Maximum DC current provided by the Arduino is 40 mA per DIO pin [45],
    which suffices for most sensors, whereas some sensors or actuators use higher
    current and voltage and thus require power management rewired from an external
    power source. For seamless power management, each sensor was troubleshooted and
    calculated for power consumptions (Table 2). In the sensing system, the LiDAR
    sensor and the water pump draw 120 mA and 500 mA current, respectively, that reaches
    above the maximum current of 40 mA supplied from the microcontroller and can cause
    unstable power supply with the multiple connections. An external power source
    was supplied to LiDAR sensors from a 5 DCV 1A power adapter through an external
    power terminal of the microcontroller. Another external power source was provided
    to the water pump from a 7.5 DCV 2A power adapter through the relay sockets. The
    use of the relay sockets and external power supply allows multiple water pumps
    and LiDAR sensors to work flawlessly without power demand from the microcontroller.
    Though the sensing system was powered by two DC adapters, it can be easily converted
    to a standalone system for outdoor use by using a solar rechargeable battery pack
    (Q90–5, Kenruipu, China) that provides 25 Ah with three ports (two 5 V 2A ports
    and one 5 V 1A port) shown in Table 2. Table 2. Power management of each module
    and external power. Experimental design An experiment was conducted in a controlled
    environment to identify plant responses to abiotic stress (heat and drought) using
    the HTP system while automating irrigation for drought environment. Two camelina
    genotypes (CAM212 and Giessen#4) were grown in two growth chambers located in
    U.S. Arid-Land Agricultural Research Center in Maricopa, AZ, USA, where the average
    daily temperature measures up to 37 °C in the range of 31 °C to 43 °C during the
    growing season. The chambers were equipped with temperature, humidity, and light
    control. The chamber temperature was set at 25 °C in chamber 1 for control and
    35 °C in chamber 2 for heat-stressed environment. Drought environment was generated
    by controlling water treatments with 40% and 90% water holding capacity for drought
    and control plants, respectively. Thus, combined interactions to be observed are
    four treatment groups: control, heat (H), drought (D), and heat-drought (HD) (Fig.
    6(a)). With three replications of two genotypic varieties of camelina at each
    group, total 24 plants were cultivated in pots and split to 12 pots to each chamber
    as shown in Fig. 6(b). All sensors and controllers were installed identically
    in both growth chambers. Data were collected for 34 days from December 12, 2019
    to January 14, 2020 and recorded every four seconds generating 21,600 strings
    per day that were downsized in post processing to the averaged data per 10 min
    for further analysis. Multispectral images were captured every 10 min for 10 h
    (7am - 5pm) during the lights on in the chambers. Download : Download high-res

    (a) Four observation groups of heat (H), drought (D), and heat-drought (HD) stress

    °C and heat stress at 35 °C) with two water treatments (drought stress and control
    with 40% and 90% water holding capacity, respectively) for two genotypic varieties
    (var. 1 and var. 2) of camelina with three replications at each group to identify
    plant phenotypic responses to abiotic stress. Sensor calibration Sensor calibrations
    were performed to obtain the unbiased data from the measurements of the soil moisture
    sensors, water pump, IR thermometers, and LiDAR sensors. Each sensor is pre-calibrated
    by the manufacturer, but sensitivity errors between sensors remain. Sensor calibration
    minimizes differences among sensors and ensures sensors for consistent accuracy.
    Soil moisture sensor and water pump The output value of the soil moisture sensor
    (SEN0193, DFRobot, China) is from 0 to 1023 through a 10-bit ADC and affected
    by probe insertion depth and how tightly the soil is packed around the sensor.
    Calibration was conducted for each soil sensor by reading digital values from
    dry to soaked soil in a pot with plants, and the maximum and minimum values were
    reversely mapped to 0–100% water holding capacity. Table 3 shows the calibration
    values obtained for eight soil sensors in two chambers, where digital numbers
    in ‘Min’ and ‘Max’ of each sensor were obtained from soaked and dry soil, respectively.
    For instance of sensor 1 in chamber 1, 244 is the minimum value obtained when
    the soil in the pot is soaked indicating 100% soil moisture, whereas 430 is the
    maximum value obtained when the soil is dry indicating 0% soil moisture. The percentage
    soil moisture values were used to calculate the amount of water treatment, i.e.,
    time to turn the water pump on to supply plant-specific irrigation. Table 3. Calibration
    values of four soil moisture sensors in each growth chamber measured in digital
    readings of Min (soaked soil) and Max (dry soil) that are reversely mapped to
    0–100% soil moisture. Chamber Digital readings Sensor 1 Sensor 2 Sensor 3 Sensor

    243–515 250–515 255–515 The water pump is rated with a capacity of 280–500 L/h,
    i.e., 78–138 mL/sec but practically underrated by the resistance due to the elevation
    and length of the water tubes. The flow rate of the water pump was calibrated
    by recording water amount from the pump. Under the circumstance of the 3-way split
    water piping to distribute water from each pump to three pots, the calibrated
    flow rate (f) of 8 mL/sec was obtained. Total amount of irrigation water (Wt)
    per pot was measured to bring dry (0% watered) soil to soaked (100% watered) soil,
    where no more water drained, e.g., 1500 mL pouring on the dry soil subtracted
    by 65 mL of the drained water, resulting in 1435 mL as 100% water holding capacity.
    The water shortage (Ws) per pot was calculated from the deviation from water moisture
    set points (40% for drought and 90% for control) multiplied by Wt using the following
    equation: (1) The operation time for the water pump was calculated by the water
    shortage divided by the pump flow rate, f using the following equation: (2) Thermometer
    and range finder The IR thermometers and LiDAR sensors were calibrated and corrected
    for the consistency among the multiple sensors. The IR thermometer was calibrated
    at multiple temperatures by attaching four sensors to a horizontal arm of a copy
    stand (402,183, Smith-Victor, Bartiett, IL, USA) and aiming down to the water
    in a glass beaker that was heated by an electric heater. Data were collected at
    six temperatures settings from 21.5 °C to 43.9 °C with approximately 5 °C increment
    with reference temperatures measured by a total emersion thermometer. The IR thermometers
    were run to record 500 readings at each temperature setting. Fig. 7(a) illustrates
    calibration of the four IR thermometers. Linear regression models were extracted
    and applied to obtain the calibrated temperatures of the IR thermometers. The
    LiDAR sensor calibration was performed at multiple distances by attaching two
    LiDAR sensors to a horizontal arm of the copy stand that is vertically adjustable
    up to 107 cm. Data were collected at 16 heights from 30 cm to 105 cm with 5 cm
    increment. 500 readings from the LiDAR sensor were recorded at each height with
    reference distances measured by a tape ruler. Fig. 7(b) illustrates calibration
    of two LiDAR sensors used for dry and wet plants. Calibration coefficients were
    derived from a linear regression model and applied for the correction of sensitivity
    and variation of the LiDAR sensors. Download : Download high-res image (354KB)

    The corrections of the calibrated values of the IR thermometers and LiDAR sensors
    were compared to the uncalibrated values in Fig. 8. The corrected values of the
    IR thermometers remained within ±0.35 °C for all eight sensors except one used
    for camelina genotype 1 of the wet plants in chamber 2 which showed −1.55 °C offset
    (Fig. 8(a)) for which an erroneous sensitivity of the sensor is suspected. The
    performance of the other seven IR thermometers stayed consistent within the manufacture
    accuracy of ±0.5 °C. The corrected values of the LiDAR sensor persisted within
    3.2 cm for all four sensors (Fig. 8(b)) which is within the range of manufacture
    accuracy of ±6 cm. The calibrated values of the temperature and distance sensors
    were applied to further data analysis. Download : Download high-res image (139KB)

    moisture and irrigation Fig. 9(a) shows the amount of water provided by the water
    pumps based on the soil moisture sensors. Two pots in the dry group had daily
    average water treatments of 4 mL and 15 mL, whereas those in the wet group had
    319 mL and 249 mL in camelina genotype 1 and 2, respectively. There were data
    missing on January 5–7, 2020 in chamber 1 and on December 17–19, 2019 and December
    26, 2019 to January 1, 2020 in chamber 2 due to the accidental disconnection of
    power cables. Fig. 9(b) illustrates soil moisture data from two water treatments
    in chamber 1. The initial large fluctuations in the dry group in Fig. 9(b) were
    caused by the sensor location relative to the irrigation dripper and remedied
    by repositioning the sensor closer to the dripper. Zero soil moisture on Dry1
    during December 23–27 was recorded due to a damaged sensor. Soil moisture was
    expressed in percentage water holding capacity that was converted from a full
    range of calibrated digital readings of the sensor (Table 3). Two pots in the
    dry treatment showed soil moisture in daily average of 63% and 51%, whereas those
    in the wet treatment showed 70% and 72% in camelina genotype 1 and 2, respectively.
    Daily average of soil moisture in chamber 2 under the heat (35 °C) stress reached
    47% and 40% in the dry treatment and 71% and 68% in the wet treatment in genotype
    1 and 2, respectively. These ranges were not exactly matching to the predefined
    set points of 40% and 90% but represented separation of the drought (dry treatment)
    from the control (wet treatment) with an analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the average
    daily soil moisture indicating that soil water status was significantly different
    between the irrigated and dry plants in both genotype 1 (F1,62 = 15.97, p < .0005)
    and genotype 2 (F1,66 = 3.99, p < .0005). The result indicated that automated
    irrigation successfully produced two different water treatments and effectively
    created drought environment that was used in plant phenotyping for drought resistance.

    respectively. Plant temperature and height Fig. 10(a) illustrates canopy temperature
    responses of the irrigated and dry plants in chamber 2. All measurements show
    the same trend of higher canopy temperatures up to 1.49 °C in the dry plants than
    those in the wet plants (Fig. 10(a)). When plants undergo water stress, their
    stomata begin to close and cease to transpire, causing the canopy temperature
    to rise. Camelina genotype 1 showed 1.32 °C lower than genotype 2 under high temperature
    stress. ANOVA test of the average daily plant temperature showed that the canopy
    temperature was significantly different between camelina genotypes under combination
    of heat and drought (HD) stress (F1,36 = 30.36, p < .0005). Similar results were
    obtained under the individual stress of heat (H) and drought (D). The results
    of lower canopy temperature indicated that camelina genotype 1 has tolerance responses
    under H, D, and HD conditions (Fig. 10(b)). Download : Download high-res image

    camelina genotypes showing lower canopy temperature in genotype 1 under heat (H),

    the height of the wet plant was gradually increased up to 79 cm until December
    23 and became decreasing to 40 cm and fluctuating from 48 to 67 cm, whereas the
    dry plant remained relatively constant at 40–50 cm (Fig. 11(a)). The plant height
    in chamber 2 showed 51 ± 2.4 cm and 38 ± 1.9 cm for the dry and irrigated plants,
    respectively. This adverse response of the plant height was caused by tall thin
    camelina plants leaning out of the sensor''s FOV. The plant height differences
    between camelina genotypes were measured manually for four treatment groups showing
    that genotype 1 is taller under all three stress conditions than genotype 2 (Fig.
    11(b)). The result indicated that camelina genotype 1 grows in lower canopy temperature
    (i.e., more leaf transpiration) and taller and has superior resistance to heat
    and drought stress. Download : Download high-res image (284KB) Download : Download

    vegetation and leaf area Fig. 12 illustrates the phenotypic responses of plant
    vegetation and leaf area measured by the multispectral camera. Plant vegetation
    of all four groups remained greenish at NDVI = 0.7 during the first three weeks
    and decreased to 0.5 except Dry2 group that stayed below 0.6 (Fig. 12(a)). The
    result indicated camelina genotype 1 grew healthier than genotype 2 in the drought
    condition, whereas NDVI in chamber 2 under the heat (35 °C) stress remained close
    (e.g., NDVI = 0.01 or less) between two genotypes. Canopy coverage gradually decreased
    from approximately 40% to 10% (Fig. 12(b)). The irregular increase and decrease
    in Wet1 and Wet2 groups during December 16–20 were caused by manual adjustment
    to keep the plants upright as they became tall and leaning out of the camera''s
    FOV. With the consideration of data from December 20, the result showed more leaf
    areas in camelina genotype 1 than those in genotype 2 in both chambers, indicating
    that camelina genotype 1 has superior performance than genotype 2 in H, D, and
    HD resistance. Download : Download high-res image (329KB) Download : Download

    1 grows more canopy coverage than genotype 2 and has superior resistant to drought
    stress. Discussion The soil moisture sensors responded continuously to moisture
    conditions and should be carefully calibrated with target plants to correctly
    map readings from dry to soaked soil to 0% to 100% soil moisture. As the sensitivity
    of the sensor varies on density of soil contact, a consistent method of sensor
    installation is highly recommended to avoid measurement errors caused by loose
    soil contact. The IR thermometers performed well with stable readings and corrected
    values from the calibration stayed within the manufacture accuracy. The mini LiDAR
    sensor had consistent accuracy within 3.2 cm from the sensor calibration but showed
    measurement errors caused by tall thin camelina plants leaning out of the sensor''s
    narrow FOV of 2°. Thus, it is recommended to use the sensor on the plant with
    broad leaves for accurate height measurement. The performance of the HTP system
    developed in this study is compared with prior studies which were either irrigation
    [[28], [29], [47]], or phenotyping [[35], [36], [37], [48]] not integrating both
    nor fully deploying open-source hardware and software packages. Prior studies
    of RPi-based phenotyping [41,2,42] were limited to an imaging tool using a color
    camera only, whereas the system developed in this study is featured with tri-metric
    phenotyping metrics: canopy temperature, plant height, vegetation/leaf area indexes
    from a multispectral camera. Granier et al. [1] discussed image-based phenotyping
    of plant responses to soil water deficit in a growth chamber but using a color
    camera only without open-source packages. The HTP system performs characterizing
    phenotypes of plant traits but needs to be coupled with a variable rate irrigation
    system in a growth chamber to simulate the drought stress by controlling the amount
    of water to plants. The great value of the system lies in the use of open-source
    hardware and software packages as well as multispectral image (MSI)-based plant
    phenotyping that can maximize the difference of spectral signature of the plants
    in visible and near-infrared bands through image analytics software [49]. Using
    PWM signals from the Arduino allowed the simplicity of the MSI camera trigger.
    Conclusions Current application provided a cost-effective HTP system for plant
    phenotyping and irrigation control using open-source hardware and software packages.
    The proposed system achieved the aim of remote monitoring of plant phenotypes
    using Arduino-RPi and image analytics, integration of irrigation controller for
    water management, and identifying phenotypic responses to abiotic stress. The
    system design was detailed for the seamless integration of sensors and actuators
    with sensor calibration and power management for the accuracy and reliability
    of the system. The system was able to phenotypically differentiate two camelina
    genotypes based on their canopy temperature and height as well as vegetation and
    leaf area. The open-source sensor integration offers a real potential for the
    applied plant scientists to achieve on plant breeding and physiological assessment
    at cost-effective design of an automated control and monitoring system. The total
    cost of the system for each growth chamber was USD 874, and its weight was only
    1.7 kg. With cost-effective, portable, and energy-efficient features, this system
    can be easily adopted for other sensing and control applications such as in greenhouses,
    vertical farms, or outdoor fields. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors

  description: The agricultural sector is witnessing a transformative shift with the
    integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, offering innovative solutions
    to enhance crop management practices. This research focuses on leveraging IoT
    for the effective management of diseases affecting onion plants in agriculture.
    By employing a network of sensors, data analytics, and automated control systems,
    this study aims to create a smart agricultural framework that monitors, detects,
    and manages onion plant diseases in real-time. The research begins with a thorough
    investigation into the common diseases affecting onion crops and their associated
    environmental factors. Subsequently, a robust IoT infrastructure is designed and
    implemented, comprising sensor nodes for monitoring soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and other relevant parameters. These sensor nodes communicate data to
    a central hub, where advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms analyze
    the information to detect early signs of diseases. In response to disease detection,
    the IoT system employs automated control mechanisms, including precision irrigation,
    targeted application of agrochemicals, and the deployment of environmental control
    measures. The study also explores the integration of remote monitoring through
    mobile applications, allowing farmers to receive real-time alerts and make informed
    decisions promptly. Through field trials and data analysis, the effectiveness
    of the IoT-based disease management system is evaluated, considering factors such
    as disease suppression, yield improvement, and resource efficiency. The research
    also addresses economic considerations and the scalability of the proposed IoT
    framework for widespread adoption in onion cultivation. The findings of this study
    contribute to the advancement of precision agriculture and sustainable farming
    practices, demonstrating the potential of IoT in revolutionizing onion plant disease
    management. As the global demand for agricultural productivity increases, integrating
    smart technologies into traditional farming practices becomes paramount, and this
    research provides valuable insights for stakeholders in the agriculture and technology
    sectors.

    Introduction Surface soil moisture (SSM) is a critical land environment variable
    that connects agriculture, ecology, and hydrology, as well as a key parameter
    in hydrology, meteorology, and agricultural applications. SSM monitoring can be
    used to plan irrigation, monitor water quality, manage water resources, and estimate
    crop yield [1,2]. Understanding the spatial and temporal distribution and dynamic
    changes of SSM can help guide agricultural management. Traditional SSM monitoring
    often employs the gravimetric method or the probe method. Although the precision
    is reasonably good and the operation is simple, it necessitates a significant
    amount of personnel and material resources, and is easily influenced by the surrounding
    environment and human variables. Furthermore, because the number of sample locations
    is restricted, it is hard to obtain a substantial amount of SSM information in
    a short period of time [3]. Remote sensing technology offers a potent approach
    to detecting SSM on a broad scale and with great spatial-temporal resolution.
    Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a promising method for assessing SSM with high
    spatial-temporal resolution [4,5]. In contrast to optical remote sensing, SAR
    does not require sunshine, and microwave signals may penetrate the surface soil
    to estimate and monitor SSM in real time [6]. SAR data demonstrate the vast potential
    and promising practice of mapping global SSM at medium and high spatial resolution
    [7]. SAR is sensitive to the dielectric and geometric properties of the target
    [8,9]. Fung et al. [10] built an integral equation model to estimate soil moisture.
    Empirical models such as the Oh model established by Oh et al. [11] and the Dubois
    model established by Dubois et al. [12] can estimate soil moisture within their
    effective range. Bao et al. [13] modified the water cloud model (WCM) based on
    optical indicators, and introduced the vegetation index to reduce the impact of
    vegetation cover on SSM. Compared with empirical, semi-empirical, and theoretical
    models, machine learning can avoid complex physical relationships and solve nonlinear
    problems, and is widely used in SSM inversion. Gao et al. [14] used Sentinel-1
    and Sentinel-2 data to determine SSM using the change detection method. Guo et
    al. [15] used Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to determine SSM using support vector
    regression (SVR) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN) methods. Datta
    et al. [16] compared the applicability of different machine learning and linear
    regression models in SSM inversion using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Because
    artificial neural network (ANN) has high nonlinear fitting abilities and can learn
    autonomously, it is increasingly being employed to solve the problem of SSM inversion.
    Arnicola et al. [17] discovered that by increasing the number of input ANN characteristics,
    the SSM inversion accuracy may be gradually increased. Pasolli et al. [18,19]
    applied the SVR model to retrieve SSM using microwave remote sensing data. Using
    different input parameters can also increase the accuracy of SSM inversion. Said
    et al. [20] estimated SSM using an ANN with several input parameters. Multiple
    regression is inferior to ANN inversion. In addition to traditional machine learning
    methods, many deep learning methods have also been employed in SSM monitoring
    in recent years. Cai et al. [21] developed an SSM prediction model using a deep
    learning regression network (DNNR) with big data fitting capabilities. To obtain
    reliable results, the deep learning method requires a large number of training
    samples. In the case of small samples, it is critical to select the suitable machine
    learning model and then refine the model parameters. When there are too many input
    factors, screening some distinctive parameters can significantly enhance the accuracy
    of soil moisture inversion. Lin et al. [22] inverted the SSM of winter wheat fields
    using RADARSAT-2 data and polarization decomposition method to enhance the number
    of input factors, and used several feature selection and machine learning methods
    to improve the model performance and estimate SSM effectively and accurately.
    Zhang et al. [23] extracted several features from passive microwave remote sensing
    data, optical remote sensing data, land surface model (LSM) and other auxiliary
    data, assessed the value of different features to SSM retrieval, and then proposed
    an SSM retrieval method based on random forest (RF) model. In practical applications,
    most machine learning techniques require amounts of sample data to assure adequate
    training. When there are few training samples, the model trained with tiny samples
    is prone to over-fitting of small samples and under-fitting target tasks. Therefore,
    when the number of samples is insufficient, increasing the sample size is a crucial
    way to raise inversion accuracy. Based on multi-time camera-borne SAR and ground
    measurement data and the change detection theory, Balenzano et al. [24] investigated
    the link between SSM changes and SAR signal changes of two crops in different
    wave bands, polarizations, and incident angles, and provided the quantitative
    equation that connects them, i.e., the alpha approximation method. He et al. [25]
    expanded the alpha approximation approach by using a time series of L-band SAR
    data and simultaneous ground observations from SMAPEx-3 to retrieve SSM. Xu et
    al. [26] used the alpha approximation method to augment the measured data for
    training the SVR model and further improved the SSM inversion accuracy. However,
    the input parameters and machine learning models used in these studies were specified
    in advance, lacking more optimizations of input parameters and inversion models
    to improve the SSM inversion accuracy further. There are various constraints in
    SSM inversion for a small size of sample data. To improve the accuracy of SSM
    inversion for small samples, an SSM inversion method combining sample augmentation,
    feature optimization, and machine learning models was investigated in this paper.
    Firstly, assuming that the surface roughness and vegetation conditions remain
    unchanged in the short term, the field-measured SSM data were augmented by using
    the alpha approximation method to provide more training data for the machine learning
    models. Secondly, feature parameters were extracted from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
    remote sensing data, and optimized by using Pearson correlation analysis, RF,
    and principal component analysis (PCA) methods. Then, three common machine learning
    models suitable for small sample training, which were genetic algorithm-back propagation
    neural network (GA-BP), SVR, and RF, were built to retrieve SSM and evaluate the
    accuracy. Finally, after comparing various combinations of feature optimization
    methods and machine learning models, the optimal inversion model was chosen to
    retrieve the regional SSM of the study area. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study
    Area and Sampling Procedures The study area was the eastern part of the Danjiangkou
    Ecological Service Area, which spanned Henan and Hubei provinces, China. The Danjiangkou
    Reservoir is the water source of the Middle Route Project of South-to-North Water
    Transfer. The Danjiangkou Ecological Service Area is a national first-class water
    source protection zone that was declared as one of China’s ecological function
    protection zones in 2015. Its landscape is sloping from northwest to southeast,
    with low mountains in the northwest, hills in the center, and hills and alluvial
    plains in the southeast. The soil types in the study area are mainly yellow-brown
    soil and brown soil [27]. The study area has a monsoon environment ranging from
    the north subtropical zone to the warm temperate zone, with a mild climate, and
    four distinct seasons. In recent years, the annual precipitation here is about
    800 mm to 1300 mm. It is a transitional zone between north and south, with a wide
    range of vegetation types and an abundance of plant resources. The study area
    is mostly made up of agricultural land, building land, and a body of water, as
    shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Location of the study area and the sampling points:
    (a) the Danjiangkou ecological service area; (b) the study area and sampling points.
    Sentinel-1 SAR remote sensing images used in this study were acquired on 3 dates,
    which were 11 September, 23 September, and 5 October 2021. The obtained SAR images
    were preprocessed using the Sentinel application platform (SNAP) software from
    European Space Agency (ESA), including radiometric calibration, multi-viewing,
    Refined Lee filtering, and terrain correction. Simultaneously, the PolSARpro software
    was used to decompose Sentinel-1 SAR data to extract polarization information.
    Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing images used in this study were acquired on 3
    dates quasi-synchronous with Sentinel-1 data, which were 12 September, 22 September,
    and 2 October 2021. All Sentinel-2 data were L2A products with 12 bands. Details
    and acquisition dates for Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image data utilized in this
    study are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Remote sensing data information. A field
    survey was carried out on 23 September 2021. A total of 41 sample points were
    set-up in the study area, as shown in Figure 1. Data gathered in the field included
    SSM value and coordinates of each sampling point. A portable TDR350 SSM meter
    was used to measure field SSM value. At each sampling point, the volumetric soil
    moisture content of the farmland surface layer was measured 5 times at 5 different
    places in a cross shape, and the average value of these 5 SSM values was used
    as the final measured SSM value at this sampling point. An outdoor portable UG905
    locator with a positioning accuracy of 1 to 3 m was used to determine the latitude
    and longitude of each sampling point. The WGS84 coordinate system was used to
    record the coordinate of each sampling point. 2.2. Methods The technical roadmap
    of the proposed method is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Technology roadmap of the
    proposed method. The first step was data augmentation. The alpha approximation
    method was used to increase the sample size. The second step was feature extraction.
    To obtain the necessary characteristic parameters, Sentinel-1 SAR data were preprocessed
    and H/A/αpolarization decomposition was carried out. The band data were extracted
    from the Sentinel-2 optical data, and the corresponding vegetation indices were
    calculated as the characteristic parameters. The third step was feature optimization.
    The extracted feature parameters were optimized using 3 methods separately, including
    Pearson correlation analysis, RF, and PCA. The most advantageous feature subset
    was chosen based on the correlation between the characteristic parameters and
    the field-measured SSM values. The fourth step was model building. To guarantee
    the training and inversion correctness of the models, GA-BP, SVR, and RF models
    were built and tweaked individually. The fifth step was accuracy assessment. The
    inversion accuracy of 9 combinations of feature optimization methods and machine
    learning models was evaluated, and the optimal combination was chosen to retrieve
    the regional SSM of the study area. 2.2.1. Data Augmentation For the problem of
    SSM inversion accuracy affected by the small size of the field measured SSM sample
    data, the alpha approximation method was adopted in this study to expand the sample
    size. The alpha approximation method was proposed by Balenzano et al. [23]. Assuming
    that vegetation conditions and surface roughness remain constant throughout time,
    the change in backscattering is only affected by changes in soil moisture [25].
    The quantitative link between backscattering coefficients and SSM is defined as
    Equations (1)–(3). 𝜎 2 0 𝜎 1 0 ≈     𝛼 2 𝑝𝑝 ( 𝜀 𝑠 ,𝜃) 𝛼 1 𝑝𝑝 ( 𝜀 𝑠 ,𝜃)  

    𝜎 𝑖 0 is the backscattering coefficient at time i, 𝜃 is the incidence angle, 𝜀
    𝑠 is the soil dielectric constant, 𝑃𝑃 is the polarization ( 𝐻𝐻 or 𝑉𝑉 ), and 𝛼
    𝑃𝑃 is a function of the soil dielectric constant and the incident angle. Equation
    (1) can be written as Equation (4). | 𝛼 1 𝑃𝑃 ( 𝜀 𝑠 ,𝜃)|− 𝜎 1 0 𝜎 2 0 − − −  ⎷

    , 𝜎 2 0 and 𝜎 3 0 can be acquired from the 3 Sentinel-1imgaes that are currently
    accessible. This indicates that there are 3 unknown parameters (specifically |
    𝛼 1 𝑃𝑃 ( 𝜀 𝑠 ,𝜃)|,| 𝛼 2 𝑃𝑃 ( 𝜀 𝑠 ,𝜃)|,| 𝛼 3 𝑃𝑃 ( 𝜀 𝑠 ,𝜃)| ) that need to be determined.

    | 𝛼 2 𝑃𝑃 ( 𝜀 𝑠 ,𝜃)| and | 𝛼 3 𝑃𝑃 ( 𝜀 𝑠 ,𝜃)| can be acquired using Equation (6).
    Because the premise of this study was that vegetation conditions and surface roughness
    remain intact in a short period of time, Sentinel-1A data with a repetition period
    of 12 days is suitable for the experiment. In this paper, a field survey was carried
    out on 23 September 2021, the same day when Sentinel-1 satellite transited over
    the study area. When the other two Sentinel-1 scenarios are known and taken as
    previous knowledge, the SSM data on 11 September 2021, and 5 October 2021, can
    be simply inversed using the empirical expression of Equation (6). In the field
    survey, 41 measured SSM samples were obtained. In the subsequent experiment, the
    measured samples were randomly split into two sets, which were the training set
    with 26 samples and the testing set with 15 samples. Only the training set was
    expanded using the alpha approximation method. The testing set remained unchanged
    and was utilized to assess the experimental accuracy. A total of 93 sampling points
    were obtained after data augmentation. To get rid of the interference, any outliers
    that may be present in the expanded data were removed. 2.2.2. Feature Parameter
    Extraction The training accuracy of a machine learning model is highly connected
    to the number and quality of the training data. The model will converge too slowly
    if there is too much training data. This can impair the model’s ability to train
    on its own, lead to incorrect predictions, and lower the model’s accuracy. The
    prediction accuracy of the machine learning model can be increased while reducing
    consumption by analyzing the feature parameter set and choosing the feature parameters
    with strong correlation as the input data. Polarization Feature Parameters SAR
    works by sending microwave beams to objects and picking up echoes from those items
    to identify distinguishing traits. Radar information is directly impacted by both
    object characteristics and radar parameters, including the target object’s physical
    characteristics and the wavelength, incidence angle, and polarization mode [28].
    The incident angle (θ), VV, and VH polarization backscattering coefficients were
    extracted from the preprocessed Sentinel-1 SAR data and used as the defining parameters
    of the following experiments based on the latitude and longitude of each sampling
    point. Both cos(θ) and sin(θ) are connected to soil moisture [29]. The correlation
    between the backscattering coefficient and sin(θ) is larger in soils with higher
    soil moisture levels, and the correlation between the backscattering coefficient
    and cos(θ) is higher in soils with lower soil moisture levels. When the incident
    angle is constant, the backscattering coefficient increases with the increase
    of volumetric soil moisture content, and the combination of different polarization
    backscattering coefficients of ( 𝜎 0 𝑉𝑉 + 𝜎 0 𝑉𝐻 ), ( 𝜎 0 𝑉𝐻 − 𝜎 0 𝑉𝑉 ), ( 𝜎 0
    𝑉𝑉 × 𝜎 0 𝑉𝐻 ) and ( 𝜎 0 𝑉𝐻 / 𝜎 0 𝑉𝑉 ) are also increased. More characteristic
    parameters from SAR remote sensing data can be extracted using polarization decomposition.
    H/A/α decomposition is used for eigenvalue decomposition of coherent matrix or
    covariance matrix of target features on Sentinel-1 dual polarization data, from
    which scattering entropy (H), inverse entropy (A), average scattering angle (α)
    and eigenvalues (λ1 and λ2) can be extracted [30]. Vegetation Indices Many vegetation
    indices can be generated from optical remote sensing data to describe surface
    vegetation information [28]. The backscattering coefficient of SAR is not only
    related to its own polarization mode, incidence angle, and SSM, but also to the
    vegetation coverage and roughness of the surface. It is necessary for SSM inversion
    to remove or weaken the impact of vegetation and surface roughness. The vegetation
    index is the combination of ground reflectivity in two or more wavelength bands
    to accentuate a certain feature or detail of plants. Varied vegetation indices
    have different band application ranges and fields due to sensor kinds and band
    combinations. According to the multi-band data provided by the multispectral imager
    (MSI) carried by Sentinel-2 and the actual vegetation coverage in the study area,
    six vegetation indices commonly used in SSM inversion research, including normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference moisture index (NDWI),
    specific vegetation index (RVI), water stress index (MSI), water body index (WBI)
    and fused vegetation index (FVI) [31], were finally selected for this study. Their
    calculation formulas are shown in Equations (7)–(12). 𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼= 𝜌 842 − 𝜌 665 𝜌 842
    + 𝜌 665 (7) 𝑁𝐷𝑊𝐼= 𝜌 842 − 𝜌 1610 𝜌 842 + 𝜌 1610 (8) 𝑅𝑉𝐼= 𝜌 842 𝜌 665 (9) 𝑀𝑆𝐼=

    665 + 𝜌 1610 (12) where 𝜌 490, 𝜌 665, 𝜌 842, 𝜌 865, 𝜌 945 and 𝜌 1610 represent
    the band values corresponding to 490, 665, 842, 865, 945, 1610 nm in Sentinel-2
    data, respectively. The 490 nm and 665 nm bands represent the blue and red of
    visible light. The 842 nm and 865 nm bands represent Near Infrared (NIR) and Narrow
    NIR. The 945 nm band represents water vapor. The 1610 nm band represents Short
    Wave Infrared (SWIR). Surface Roughness The surface roughness of the soil influences
    the microwave backscattering coefficient. The surface roughness information changes
    depending on the band frequency, incident angle, and polarization mode. Removing
    the influence of surface roughness on SSM inversion can increase accuracy. The
    surface combined roughness Zs [32] used in this study was calculated using SAR
    data and represented by Equations (13)–(15). 𝑍 𝑠 =exp ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ 𝜎 0 𝐻𝑉 − 𝜎 0 𝑉𝑉
    − 𝐵 𝑣 (𝜃) 𝐴 𝑣 (𝜃) ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ (13) 𝐴 𝑣 =−2.6408 𝑠𝑖𝑛 3 (𝜃)+5.293 𝑠𝑖𝑛 2 (𝜃)−3.838sin(𝜃)+2.2042
    (14) 𝐵 𝑣 =4.1522 𝑠𝑖𝑛 3 (𝜃)−13.1 𝑠𝑖𝑛 2 (𝜃)+16.9472sin(𝜃)−16.4228 (15) where Av
    and Bv are coefficients only applicable to the combined roughness model using
    C-band data, and only change with incident angle. A total of 21 feature parameters
    were extracted from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, as shown in Table 2. Table
    2. Summary of parameters extracted from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. 2.2.3.
    Feature Parameter Optimization In this study, the extracted feature parameters
    were evaluated using Pearson correlation analysis, RF, and PCA methods separately
    to select the suitable feature parameter subset for the subsequent machine learning
    models. Pearson Correlation Analysis Method The Pearson correlation coefficient,
    which has a value between −1 and 1, is the simplest approach to determine whether
    two variables are linearly connected. The sign indicates the positive-negative
    correlation. The closer its absolute value is to 1, the stronger the linear association
    between the two variables is. Conversely, the closer it is to 0, the weaker the
    linear relationship between the two variables is. It is calculated using Equation
    (16). 𝑟(𝑋,𝑌)= 𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑋,𝑌) 𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑋)𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑌) − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (16) where Cov (X,
    Y) represents the covariance of two variables X and Y, Var(X) is the variance
    of X, and Var(Y) is the variance of Y. Random Forest Method The RF method can
    calculate the relevance of each variable during the model-building process [33].
    In feature selection process with RF, the importance of each feature is first
    calculated and arranged in descending order. The proportion to be deleted is then
    established, and the matching proportion of characteristics is eliminated based
    on their relevance, yielding a new feature set. The preceding procedure with a
    new feature set is repeated until only m features remained, among which m is a
    preset value. Finally, the feature set with the lowest error rate is chosen based
    on each feature set acquired in the preceding process and its related error rate.
    Principal Component Analysis Method PCA is a method for finding a way to minimize
    the dimension of data while minimizing information loss [34]. It is an important
    tool in data analysis and frequently used in machine learning to minimize the
    dimension of high-dimensional data, since it can extract the key characteristic
    variables from the data. Each vector has a correlation in high-dimensional data
    sets, whereas it has a linear independence in low-dimensional data sets, allowing
    the overlapping information in high-dimensional data sets to be removed [35].
    High-dimensional data are reduced to fulfill the goals of data dimensionality
    reduction, compression, and noise reduction. The data dimensionality is reduced,
    but the most relevant information is maintained, and certain unimportant aspects
    are deleted. 2.2.4. Construction of Machine Learning Models Machine learning excels
    in nonlinear fitting. It is useful in resolving issues with excessive factors
    and convoluted structures in SSM inversion models. Even after sample augmentation,
    the number of samples is still limited due to the small number of field-measured
    SSM samples. Three field-measured typical machine learning models, GA-BP, SVR,
    and RF, that are appropriate for small sample training, were chosen for the study
    in order to prevent over-fitting. Genetic Algorithm–Back Propagation Neural Network
    Model Both neural networks and evolutionary algorithms are ways for imitating
    biological treatment modes and obtaining practical answers to complicated issues.
    The BP neural network is capable of adaptive learning and powerful nonlinear simulation.
    However, it is prone to local minima. In addition, the network’s design is not
    theoretically guided and is instead dependent on the designers’ expertise and
    repeated experimentation in the sample space, which restricts the network’s ability
    to find the overall optimal solution. GA can converge to the global optimal solution
    and has strong stability, but it lacks adaptive learning capabilities. As a result,
    combining a neural network with the genetic algorithm can enhance not only the
    neural network’s ability to generalize mapping, but also its rate of convergence,
    capacity for global optimization, and learning capacity [36]. The entire prediction
    model is extensively upgraded in terms of accuracy and fitting capacity. Support
    Vector Regression Model SVR is a regression analysis technique that uses the support
    vector machine (SVM). The majority of the sample points are situated outside the
    two decision boundaries thanks to the separation hyperplane that SVM discovers
    by maximizing the interval. In contrast to SVM, SVR also takes into account the
    maximum interval, but it also takes into account the points within the decision
    boundary to ensure that the majority of the sample points are situated within
    the interval. The most significant advantage of SVR is that it uses the kernel
    function rather than the inner product operation in high-dimensional space, transforming
    a high-dimensional nonlinear regression problem into a two-dimensional linear
    regression problem [37]. Random Forest Model RF can be used not only for parameter
    optimization, but also for parameter inversion. It is an integrated algorithm
    based on decision trees, with each decision tree acting as a classifier. When
    decision trees are being trained, randomness is incorporated, and samples and
    features are chosen at random. There will be n trees with n classification outcomes
    for each input sample. All the RF-categorized voting results are combined and
    the one with the most votes is chosen as the final result. In this process, integration
    and randomness coexist. RF model has the advantages of increasing prediction accuracy,
    decreasing over-fitting, and being unaffected by missing data and multi-collinearity
    [38]. One advantage of RF is that it has good generalization performance due to
    the use of multiple regression trees, which helps to reduce model variability.
    It simply has two parameters, the number of trees and the number of features,
    therefore it doesn’t require complicated parameter adjustment [17]. 3. Results
    In this section, the results of sample augmentation and SSM inversion were analyzed,
    and the spatial distributions of regional SSM of the study area were obtained.
    3.1. Sample Augmentation Results The inversion accuracy before and after sample
    augmentation was compared using the same input parameters by various inversion
    methods, to confirm the efficacy of sample augmentation and the benefits of various
    machine learning models for SSM inversion. The incident angle (θ), the VV and
    VH polarization backscattering coefficients, and NDVI were chosen as the input
    parameters in this experiment, while GA-BP, SVR, and RF models were employed as
    the SSM inversion models. In this experiment, three precision evaluation indexes,
    which were determination coefficient (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and
    mean absolute error (MAE), were employed to assess SSM inversion accuracy. The
    average values acquired after repeated experiments were recorded as the experimental
    results to lessen the randomness of the outcomes, as indicated in Table 3. Table
    3. Comparison of SSM inversion accuracy before and after sample augmentation.
    According to the experimental results, the SSM inversion accuracy was clearly
    improved once the samples were enhanced for all these three machine learning models,
    and the RF model was the best prediction model among them. 3.2. Optimal Model
    Construction 3.2.1. Feature Selection Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data were preprocessed,
    and a total of 21 feature parameters were extracted. In order to improve the model
    performance, Pearson correlation analysis, RF and PCA methods were used to reduce
    the redundant features and improve the accuracy of model estimation. There are
    differences in the selection criteria of these three methods in feature selection.
    Pearson correlation analysis method measures the linear correlation between the
    data, and the higher correlation indicates that it is more sensitive to SSM inversion.
    The ranking of feature importance is shown in Table 4. RF is measured according
    to the average contribution of each feature on each tree. Higher contribution
    indicates that it is more sensitive to SSM inversion, and the ranking of feature
    importance is shown in Table 5. PCA shows the characteristics of data in a smaller
    dimension by dimensionality reduction, and finally the new variable is the linear
    combination of the original variables. The correlation results of different features
    are shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. Correlation between features obtained by PCA
    method. Table 4. Ranking of feature importance using the Pearson correlation analysis
    method. Table 5. Ranking of feature importance using RF method. Different feature
    selection methods were applied to the subsequent three machine learning models
    respectively. For the verification of different input parameters, the comparison
    and analysis showed that the results obtained by selecting the first eight features
    as ideal feature subsets were generally accurate, so the following experiments
    all selected the first eight parameters to ensure the homogeneity of the experiments.
    3.2.2. Machine Learning Model To verify the efficiency of the suggested method,
    a comparative experiment was carried out utilizing measured SSM data after sample
    augmentation, and the application performance of various feature selection methods
    and machine learning models in SSM inversion was reviewed. In this experiment,
    R2, RMSE and MAE were employed to assess SSM inversion accuracy. The average values
    acquired after repeat experiments were recorded as the experimental results to
    lessen the randomness of the outcomes, as indicated in Table 6. Table 6. Comparison
    of the accuracy of the inversion results under different model combinations. According
    to the experimental results, the combination of employing RF for feature selection
    and RF for SSM inversion offered the maximum inversion accuracy, with R2, RMSE
    and MAE of 0.7256, 0.0539 cm3/cm3 and 0.0422 cm3/cm3, respectively. 3.3. Spatial
    Distribution of SSM Based on Sentinel-1 SAR data and Sentinel-2 optical data,
    RF model was used for feature selection and SSM inversion, and the spatial and
    frequency distributions of regional SSM in the study area were obtained, as shown
    in Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6. In the study area, the average values of measured
    SSM on three dates after sample augmentation were 0.1892, 0.1861 and 0.1808 cm3/cm3,
    respectively. The average values of retrieved SSM on corresponding dates were
    0.1876, 0.1833 and 0.1783 cm3/cm3, respectively, which were consistent with the
    field measured SSM in general. Figure 4. Inversion results of regional SSM in
    the study area on 11 September 2021: (a) spatial distribution of retrieved SSM;
    (b) frequency distribution of retrieved and measured SSM. Figure 5. Inversion
    results of regional SSM in the study area on 23 September 2021: (a) spatial distribution

    6. Inversion results of regional SSM in the study area on 5 October 2021: (a)
    spatial distribution of retrieved SSM; (b) frequency distribution of retrieved
    and measured SSM. 4. Discussion 4.1. Data Augmentation Field measurements are
    necessary for soil moisture inversion. In practice, there are two main methods
    of field measuring. One is the traditional manual measuring method based on manual
    ground sampling and measurement on the date of satellite transits [1,4,6,8,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,22,25,26,31,33,36,38].
    The other is the automatic measuring method based on ground-based observation
    stations or networks in the study area [2,3,7,21,23,24,29]. Compared with the
    automatic measuring method, the field measured SSM data obtained through the traditional
    manual measuring method are often more difficult to collect, and usually in a
    limited number of times and in small quantities. For those areas without any ground-based
    observation sites or automatic observation networks, like the study area in this
    paper, due to the limitations of time and space, the data obtained by manual field
    measurement are generally limited. The small size of field measured SSM data have
    a negative effect on SSM inversion accuracy, since there is insufficient data
    to train the inversion model and make a meaningful evaluation on the inversion
    results. The experimental results shown in Table 3 and Table 6 demonstrated that,
    the proposed inversion method based on data augmentation was effective to supply
    more sample data for SSM inversion and further improved the inversion accuracy,
    providing a feasible reference for SSM inversion studies based on small sample
    size of field measured data. It is worth noting that, the alpha approximation
    method used in this paper for data augmentation has a certain precondition, which
    assumed that the vegetation conditions and surface roughness remain unchanged
    in the short spanned period. So, the proposed method in this paper is not suitable
    for SSM inversion in those areas with large changes in the vegetation conditions
    and surface roughness in the study period. In fact, even in a short period, this
    precondition is difficult to strictly meet. In this study, although the dates
    of 11 September 2021 and 5 October 2021 were close to the middle date of 23 September
    2021, and the vegetation conditions and surface roughness kept constant on the
    whole according to the field survey and actual situation, small changes in some
    parts of the study area were ineluctable. This fact affected the application of
    the alpha approximation method and further the SSM inversion accuracy of the proposed
    method. In the future, more reliable and effective data augmentation methods will
    be explored to expand the sample size, thus to further improving the SSM inversion
    accuracy. 4.2. Accuracy Analysis After data augmentation, the parameters extracted
    from remote sensing data and machine learning models for SSM inversion were optimized
    to improve the SSM inversion accuracy further. Three parameter optimization methods,
    which were Pearson correlation analysis, RF and PCA, were proven to be effective
    for parameter optimization in SSM inversion [22,34,38], and so chosen in this
    study to reduce the redundant features and improve the accuracy of model estimation.
    The experimental results shown in Table 4 and Table 5 and Figure 3 indicated that,
    it was hard to get a uniform optimal feature subset through these three different
    optimization methods, due to their different optimization principles and evaluation
    criteria. Inspired by the research in reference [22], the extracted parameters
    and the used inversion models were optimized in the whole in this study by using
    different combinations of parameter optimization methods and machine learning
    models. In order to ensure the homogeneity of the experiments, the first eight
    features in each ranking result of the feature optimization method were uniformly
    selected as the ideal feature subset for the subsequent experiments. However,
    it was not ensured that the subsets with the first eight features for all these
    three methods could all reach the final maximum inversion accuracy for all these
    nine model combinations. Different sizes of optimal feature subsets for different
    feature selection methods may be more reasonable for the proposed method and will
    be explored in this study to further improve the SSM inversion accuracy. Three
    typical machine learning models commonly used in SSM inversion, which were GA-BP
    [36,38], SVR [15,18,19,26,33], and RF [16,23,33,34,38], were selected in this
    study because of their good performance in SSM inversion based on the small size
    of samples [15,16,19,33,36,38]. Combined with three parameter optimization methods,
    the performance of nine different model combinations in SSM inversion was compared
    in the experiments. According to the experimental results shown in Table 6, the
    combination of employing RF for feature selection and RF for SSM inversion offered
    the maximum inversion accuracy, with higher R2 and lower RSME and MAE than other
    combinations. The performance of GA-BP and SVR models was a little worse than
    that of the RF model in this study, although they are generally considered to
    have good generalization ability when the sample size is small. One possible reason
    is that some parameters of GA-BP and SVR models may be not set properly and could
    be further optimized. Another possible reason is that there was an over-fitting
    issue in their training process because the sample size in this study was too
    small, which also affected the performance of the RF model in this study. A total
    of 41 measured SSM samples were obtained in the field survey, and expanded to
    93 samples after data augmentation. Compared with the original sample data and
    previous SSM inversion studies based on small samples [1,4,6,15,16,18,19,33,36,38],
    the sample size had increased. However, due to the limited initial sample size
    and the limitations of the alpha approximation method, the sample size was still
    limited, which was prone to over-fitting issues in practice. A considerable sample
    set is still the guarantee for sufficient model training and reasonable inversion
    accuracy. More field measurements are planned in this study in the future. Even
    though, for those SSM inversion studies based on a small sample size of field
    measured data, as demonstrated in this study, the data augmentation method was
    still an effective way to supply more sample data and further improved the inversion
    accuracy. 5. Conclusions An SSM inversion method combining sample augmentation,
    feature optimization, and machine learning models was investigated in this paper.
    First, sample augmentation was applied to the field-measured SSM data to address
    the issue that inversion accuracy was impacted by the sample size. Sentinel-1
    SAR data and Sentinel-2 optical data were integrated to extract and select several
    feature parameters. The optimal inversion model was chosen by combining various
    feature selection methods with machine learning models at the same time to achieve
    optimal inversion accuracy. The experimental results indicated that the inversion
    accuracy had improved after sample augmentation, and the combination of employing
    RF for feature selection and RF for SSM inversion offered the maximum inversion
    accuracy, with R2, RMSE and MAE of 0.7256, 0.0539 cm3/cm3 and 0.0422 cm3/cm3,
    respectively. The proposed method was finally used to invert the regional SSM
    of the study area. The inversion results indicated that the proposed method had
    good performance in regional applications with a small sample size, and provided
    a feasible way for SSM inversion in those areas where the vegetation conditions
    and surface roughness remain unchanged within a certain time span. In the future,
    more effective methods of data augmentation and machine learning can be explored
    to further improve the SSM inversion accuracy. Author Contributions Methodology,

  description: Lake eutrophication, exacerbated by high-intensity anthropogenic forcing,
    threatens water ecological security and the sustainable development of fisheries.
    Accurately evaluating lake eutrophication is the basis for effective management
    of the water environment. This study aimed to study eutrophication and its anthropogenic
    forcing in Chagan Lake, which is surrounded by agricultural areas with irrigation
    discharge as the primary water source. The spatiotemporal evolution characteristics
    of lake eutrophication and the anthropogenic forcing factors were analyzed based
    on the long-series multi-source data and modified eutrophication index. The results
    showed that (1) the average trophic state of Chagan Lake was eutrophic according
    to the modified eutrophication index (TLI = 58.31) and the nutrient level was
    higher in summer, reaching hypertrophy (TLI 61.49); (2) the maximum pollution
    footprint affecting the lake reached 34.7 km2, with a maximum buffer zone radius
    of 1 km; (3) the gross domestic product of primary industry, total sown area,
    and rice field area were the main anthropogenic factors leading to the lake eutrophication,
    with contribution rates of 64.43%, 13.09%, and 10.23%, respectively. Multidimensional
    management strategies for maximum pollution footprint, buffer zone radius, and
    contribution of anthropogenic factors were used to improve the water quality of
    the lake. The findings provided scientific support for the management of water
    environment of Chagan Lake and guided the formulation of “one lake, one policy.”.

  explanation: The study's primary goal is to determine how water resources can be
    utilized more sustainably and agricultural productivity increased in order to
    fulfill the growing demand for food. This is done by assessing the benefits and
    drawbacks of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that
    use IoT and machine learning techniques and evaluating the state of the art in
    the field. The study also emphasizes the need for compatibility, seamless communication,
    and the advantages of standardization in the integration of components of automated
    irrigation systems. The goal is to close the loop on automated irrigation systems
    by automating each component of the management process, which includes collecting
    and transferring data, processing, analyzing, making decisions, and taking automated
    actions. Furthermore, the study examines the impact of data quality, scalability,
    reliability, and security on the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end
    automated irrigation systems. The study also aims to guide future research, encourage
    partnerships, and provide a roadmap for advancing the field of automated irrigation
    management.

    © 2020 Spatial changes and driving factors of lake water quality in Inner Mongolia,
    China Article 25 October 2022 Introduction Lake eutrophication is a global water
    ecological security problem (Paerl and Huisman 2009; Smith and Schindler 2009).
    High-latitude agricultural regions particularly possess serious risk of lake eutrophication
    due to global climate change and human activities (Huisman et al. 2018; Lin et
    al. 2020). Besides the impact of global warming, lake eutrophication has threatened
    the coordinated green development of the regional ecological environment (Fink
    et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2020c; Lin et al. 2021a). The synergistic effect of multiple
    interrelated driving factors can alter lake ecosystems (Schindler 2006; Qi et
    al. 2020; He et al. 2022). The lake eutrophication index is an effective method
    using various indicators based on the physical, chemical, and biological properties
    of the lakes to assess their trophic state (Dzialowski et al. 2011; Chen et al.
    2021; Wang et al. 2022). Five commonly used indicators are total nitrogen (TN),
    total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a (Chl-a), chemical oxygen demand by manganese
    (CODMn), and Secchi disk transparency (SD) (Brezonik et al. 2019). The first trophic
    state index (TSI) was proposed by Carlson in 1977, using SD as the core indicator,
    which could well simulate the trophic state of deep-water lakes (Carlson 2007).
    Later, researchers incorporated TN and CODMn into the TSI construction based on
    the studies of phytoplankton limiting nutrients (Aizaki et al. 1981; Huo et al.
    2014; Zou et al. 2020). They developed a modified trophic state index (TSIm) and
    comprehensive trophic level index (TLI) with Chl-a as the core indicator (Huo
    et al. 2013). However, their applicability to an individual lake needs further
    improvement. The current method of “one national, one policy” does not suit different
    lakes with varying environmental factors (Torres-Franco et al. 2019; Liu et al.
    2022). Using this method to evaluate lake eutrophication more accurately helps
    implement the “one type, one policy” and “one lake, one policy” (Wei et al. 2020).
    The pollution footprint method can help find out the sources and causes of pollution,
    using different tools and models to calculate and analyze the impact of pollution
    so as to take actions to reduce or prevent pollution. Quantifying the contribution
    of anthropogenic factors can help formulate measures for improving lake water
    quality (Zou et al. 2020; Qi et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2022). The land types around
    Chagan Lake are mainly arable land, wetland, grassland, urban land, and saline
    land (Liu et al. 2020a). Chagan Lake experienced rapid agricultural expansion
    and urbanization, and large amounts of nutrients have been discharged into the
    lake, threatening its ecological health (Wang et al. 2020). The nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and suspended matter concentrations in the lake have increased due to the irrigation
    discharge (Liu et al. 2020c). The concentration of nutrients in the lake has increased
    further with rapid urbanization and industrialization, domestic sewage discharges
    from surrounding towns, and tertiary industry sources of pollution (Wang et al.
    2020). The increased eutrophication in Chagan Lake has gradually become the primary
    water quality problem facing Chagan Lake (Liu et al. 2021b). Lake eutrophication
    needs to be evaluated and managed using a better way. We changed the traditional
    method using different comprehensive eutrophication index weights for different
    lake types. This method could measure lake eutrophication more accurately and
    help us manage each lake according to its type and condition. The objectives of
    this study were as follows: (1) to develop a comprehensive eutrophication index
    model suitable for Chagan Lake by adjusting the weight coefficients and reanalyzing
    the spatiotemporal distribution according to the water quality characteristics
    of the lake; (2) to determine the main anthropogenic driver factor and the extent
    of pollution impact by different land use types in the buffer zone using the pollution
    footprint method and principal component analysis. Based on these objectives,
    we proposed the following hypotheses: the total sown area in the buffer zone was
    the main anthropogenic driver factor affecting the eutrophication of Chagan Lake
    according to the modified comprehensive eutrophication index model. Materials
    and methods Study area and field sampling Chagan Lake is located in the Songnen
    Plain (45°09′–45°30′N, 124°03′–124°34′E), which is the central grain-producing
    region in Northeast China and is a national nature reserve (Fig. 1). It is an
    essential ecological barrier and a gathering place for fishing and hunting culture
    tourism in western Jilin. The width and length of the lake are 17 km and 37 km,
    respectively. The surface area and average water depth are 372 km2 and 2.5 m,
    respectively. Chagan Lake is located in the East Asian monsoon region. It has
    a north-temperate continental semi-arid monsoon climate, with little rainfall
    and four distinct seasons in the region, with an average annual precipitation
    of 400 mm and an average annual evaporation of 1400 mm (Liu et al. 2020a). The
    differences in the temperature and daily temperature of the region are large (the
    average daily temperature difference is 11.7 ℃), and the average multi-year temperature
    is 4.5 ℃. Fig. 1 Overview map of the study area and distribution of sampling points

    Table 1. Table 1 Average values of anthropogenic forcing factors of Qianguo, Qian’an,
    and Da’an Full size table A total of nine field water quality observation points
    were set up in this study (Fig. 1). Six sampling points L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, and
    L6 were set up in the study area of Chagan Lake. P1 was set up near Jiangjia station,
    where the receding water from the Da’an irrigation area (new irrigation area)
    was discharged into the lake. P3 was set up near Chuantou station, where the receding
    water from the Qianguo irrigation area (old irrigation area) was discharged into
    Chagan Lake through Xinmiao wetland. P2 was set up near Liangdian station, where
    the water from Chagan Lake flowed out. The specific locations are shown in Fig.
    1. Data collection Data summary Relevant data were collected from three sources
    and summarized to analyze the trophic state of Chagan Lake and its spatiotemporal
    evolution characteristics (Table 2). These data sources included (1) water quality
    data processed by the Northeast Institute of Geography, Agriculture and Ecology,
    Chinese Academy of Sciences; (2) statistical data from the Bureau of Statistics
    of Jilin Province for three counties around Chagan Lake (Qianguo, Qian’an, and
    Da’an); and (3) multi-temporal remote sensing data. This study examined how land
    cover had changed in a certain region in 15 years. The data, consisting of 176
    Landsat 5/8 multispectral images from 2004 to 2019, were acquired from the US
    Geological Survey (USGS) website (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) (the access
    date is shown in the attachment.) and analyzed online using the GEE platform.
    The annual land cover type was extracted by selecting sample points based on the
    monthly variations in ground features (Liu et al. 2023). The frequency of collection
    of remote sensing data, water quality data, and socioeconomic data is shown in
    Table 2. Table 2 Data type, frequency, and source Full size table Field collection
    and laboratory test The study was conducted from May to September at the nine
    previously mentioned sampling points, with monthly sampling frequency from 2004
    to 2020 to assess water quality. All water samples were collected at the sampling
    point at a depth of 0.5–1.0 m. A quantitative volume of water samples (ranging
    from 100 to 1000 mL, depending on the water quality) was filtered using a Whatman
    GF/F filter membrane (membrane pore size 0.7 μm), and a new filter membrane was
    used for each sample. The pre-filtration sample of about 100 mL was dispensed
    into a different container and stored under refrigeration for determining TN,
    TP, and CODMn. The filter membrane was immediately wrapped with an aluminum foil,
    refrigerated, and brought back to the laboratory for determining the contents
    of Chl-a and suspended solids (SS) in water. The TP concentration in the water
    samples was determined by acid molybdate spectrophotometry (GB/T 11894–1989).
    The TN concentration was determined by UV spectrophotometry (HJ 636–2012) after
    the water samples were digested with alkaline potassium persulfate. The determination
    wavelengths of phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations were 700 nm and 210 nm,
    respectively, and the measuring instrument was Shimadzu UV-2600 type spectrophotometer.
    The Chl-a concentration was determined by the hot ethanol extraction and spectrophotometric
    method. The SS concentration was determined by the drying method at 103–105 °C.
    CODMn was determined by acidic potassium permanganate oxidation and sodium oxalate
    reduction titration (GB 11892–1989) (Ma and Wang 2018; Liu et al. 2020a; Zou et
    al. 2020). Data resources and processing We first collected all available Landsat
    surface reflectance data from 2004 to 2019 in the watershed using Google Earth
    Engine (GEE) to derive the land use types in the Chagan Lake (https://earthengine.google.org)
    (the access date is shown in the attachment) (Tamiminia et al. 2020). Such land
    use types were used to investigate the effect of land use change on the water
    quality. The random forest classification algorithm (RF) was used to classify
    the half-monthly land use types in the Chagan Lake watershed. We chose two buffer
    zones (P1 and P3 in Fig. 1) of Chagan Lake according to the proportion of paddy
    fields, and the land use types of the entrance and exit were obtained (see Fig.
    7 for detail). The land use type was divided into water bodies, rice fields, bare
    land, grassland, corn land, reed swamp, and construction land (residential land).
    Finally, the human- and land-type data of the area around Chagan Lake were subjected
    to principal component analysis. Pollution footprint model The pollution footprint
    model was developed based on the comprehensive ecological footprint calculation
    model and the ecological carrying capacity measurement model (Min et al. 2011;
    Yang and Yang 2019). The pollution footprint was used to calculate the average
    pollution-carrying capacity of the lake while comprehensively reflecting the impact
    of human production and life on the ecosystem (Jing et al. 2022). The water environment
    capacity of lakes was calculated using the fundamental equation of mass balance
    of water bodies, and the model of organic matter capacity in lakes was as follows:
    $$V(t)\\frac{\\mathrm{dc}}{\\mathrm{dt}}={Q}_{\\mathrm{in}}(t)\\cdot {C}_{\\mathrm{in}}(t)-{Q}_{\\mathrm{out}}(t)\\cdot
    C(t)+{S}_{\\mathrm{c}}+\\mathrm{k}V(t)C$$ (1) where V (t) is the volume of water
    at the moment t (m3); dc/dt is the rate of change of the water quality parameter;
    \\({Q}_{\\mathrm{in}}(t)\\) is the volume of water entering the lake (m3/a); \\({Q}_{\\mathrm{out}}(t)\\)
    is the volume of outflow from the lake (m3/a); \\({C}_{\\mathrm{in}}(t)\\) represent
    the inlet concentration values of TN and TP in the lake (mg/L); \\(C(t)\\) represent
    the outflow concentration values of TN and TP of the lake (mg/L); \\({S}_{\\mathrm{c}}\\)
    is the other unaccounted for external source and leakage of pollution. k is the
    combined degradation coefficient of TN and TP. We considered the volume of the
    lake as steady. The equation for the environmental capacity of TN and TP derived
    from Eq. (1) was as follows: $$W={C}_{\\mathrm{s}}({Q}_{\\mathrm{out}}+\\mathrm{K}V)*{10}^{-6}$$
    (2) where W is the environmental capacity of the lake (t/a); \\({C}_{\\mathrm{s}}\\)
    is the target value of the functional area of the lake (mg/L); \\({Q}_{\\mathrm{out}}\\)
    is the outflow of the lake (m3/a); K is the combined degradation coefficient of
    TN and TP; and V is the lake capacity (m3) (when the water level was 130 m, the
    reservoir capacity was 128 m3). Pollution footprint model: $${\\mathrm{PF}}_{\\mathrm{N}}=\\frac{{P}_{\\mathrm{N}}}{{\\mathrm{NY}}_{\\mathrm{N}}}$$
    (3) $${\\mathrm{PF}}_{\\mathrm{P}}=\\frac{{P}_{\\mathrm{P}}}{{\\mathrm{NY}}_{\\mathrm{P}}}$$
    (4) where \\({\\mathrm{PF}}_{\\mathrm{N}}\\) and \\({\\mathrm{PF}}_{\\mathrm{P}}\\)
    are, respectively, the nitrogen and phosphorus pollution footprints of the rivers
    entering the lake (hm2); \\({P}_{\\mathrm{N}}\\) and \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{P}}\\)
    are, respectively, the nitrogen and phosphorus contents discharged to the lake
    by the incoming rivers (kg); \\({\\mathrm{NY}}_{\\mathrm{N}}\\) and \\({\\mathrm{NY}}_{\\mathrm{P}}\\)
    are, respectively, the average absorption capacities of nitrogen and phosphorus
    by the water bodies after entering the lake (kg/hm2). Eutrophication index The
    comprehensive TSI is used to evaluate the eutrophication status of a lake. It
    uses water quality indicators representative of the algal biomass in the lake
    and gives more weight to Chl-a as the main indicator (Carvalho et al. 2013). This
    index can be used as a standard for trophic state determination (Poikane et al.
    2016). It allows comparison between many chemical and biological components associated
    with the trophic state in a lake system (Han and Cui 2016). The results may be
    a comprehensive and intuitive reflection of how these influences are interconnected
    and relevant to the lake ecosystem as a whole (Zhang et al. 2021b). A linear fit
    of the data from the study area was performed in this study to better reflect
    the degree of response of algae to each pollutant in Chagan Lake water bodies.
    The TN, TP, CODMn, and SD data from May to September were linearly fitted to the
    Chl-a data to find out the better fitting r2. The fitted value of each month was
    employed as the weight of the algal response degree to each pollutant. Subsequently,
    the normalized weight of the eutrophication index was calculated for each parameter,
    allowing the reconstruction of the eutrophication index evaluation model specifically
    tailored for the Chagan Lake area (Guo et al. 2018). Chl-a concentration being
    a biological indicator characterizing the algal content of water bodies, it was
    also important for the primary productivity of water bodies (Pan et al. 2009;
    Zhang et al. 2021b; Zhu et al. 2019). Therefore, in this study, TN, TP, CODMn,
    SD, and Chl-a in the water quality data of Chagan Lake from May to September were
    fitted and analyzed based on the traditional eutrophication evaluation model.
    Then, the fitted values of each parameter index with a better fitting effect in
    the analysis results were included in the weight calculation. The weights in the
    calculation results were used to correct the weight index in the comprehensive
    eutrophication index model to obtain a more suitable eutrophication index model
    for Chagan Lake. The comprehensive eutrophication index model calculation equations
    (Lin et al. 2021) were as follows: $$TLI \\left(\\mathrm{Chl}-\\mathrm{a}\\right)=10(2.5+1.086\\mathrm{lnCh}-\\mathrm{a})$$
    (5) $$TLI \\left(\\mathrm{TP}\\right)=10(9.436+1.624\\mathrm{lnTP})$$ (6) $$TLI
    \\left(\\mathrm{TN}\\right)=10(5.453+1.694\\mathrm{lnTN})$$ (7) $$TLI \\left(\\mathrm{SD}\\right)=10(5.118-1.94\\mathrm{lnSD})$$
    (8) $$TLI \\left({\\mathrm{COD}}_{\\mathrm{Mn}}\\right)=10(0.109+2.661{\\mathrm{lnCOD}}_{\\mathrm{Mn}})$$
    (9) where the Chl-a unit is mg/m3; the SD unit is m; and other indicators are
    in mg/L. The integrated eutrophication status index was calculated using the following
    equation: $$TLI(\\sum )=\\sum {W}_{j}\\cdot TLI(j)$$ (10) where TLI(∑) is comprehensive
    TSI; Wj is the correlation weight of the TSI of the jth parameter; and TLI(j)
    represents the TSI of the jth parameter. The specific TLI classification is shown
    in Table 3. Table 3 Eutrophication degree evaluation level Full size table Using
    Chl-a as the benchmark parameter, the normalized correlation weight of the jth
    parameter was calculated using the following equation: $${w}_{j}=\\frac{{r}_{ij}^{2}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{m}{r}_{ij}^{2}}$$
    (11) where rij is the correlation coefficient between the jth parameter and the
    benchmark parameter Chl-a; and m is the number of evaluated parameters. The coefficients
    and weights of Chl.a, TN, TP, SD, and CODMn showed significant monthly differences
    after correction; the factors also differed from each other in different months.
    The weights of each indicator in the comprehensive eutrophication index after
    weighting calculation are shown in Table 4. Table 4 Weighting coefficients of
    comprehensive eutrophication index for water quality parameters in Chagan Lake
    from May to September Full size table The weight coefficients of each water quality
    index were brought into the comprehensive eutrophication index calculation formula
    to get the comprehensive eutrophication index of each sampling site from May to
    September (Table 5). Table 5 Comprehensive eutrophication index of water quality
    parameters at each sampling point in Chagan Lake from May to September Full size
    table Principal component analysis Principal component analysis (PCA) is a mathematical
    transformation used to convert a set of correlated variables into a set of uncorrelated
    variables with decreasing variance (Li et al. 2021). The transformation preserves
    the total variance of the variables. Consequently, the first variable, called
    the first principal component, has the largest variance. The second variable,
    called the second principal component, has the second largest variance and is
    independent of the first variable (Olsen et al. 2012). PCA reduces the number
    of indicators by exploiting their correlations, thereby simplifying the original
    index system. The weights of each composite factor in PCA are determined based
    on their contribution, not artificially. This avoids the drawbacks of subjective
    weighting in some evaluation methods and makes the comprehensive evaluation results
    unique and objective (Wang et al. 2019). Water quality changes are closely related
    to human factors. In this study, we selected 10 factors affecting the water quality
    in 3 irrigation areas around Chagan Lake (Qianguo, Qian’an, and Da’an): TPOP (X1),
    GDP-PC (X2), GDP-P (X3), GDP-S (X4), GDP-T (X5), TSA (X6), RF (X7), CF (X8), UR
    (X9), and NLY (X10). We used X1–X10 as random variables and standardized the sample
    data. Then, we calculated the correlation coefficient matrix, eigenvalues, principal
    component relationship equation, and cumulative contribution rate table. The component
    calculation relationship equation was as follows: $$y = {\\mathrm{a}}_{1} {x}_{1}
    + {\\mathrm{a}}_{2} {x}_{2} +... + {\\mathrm{a}}_{n} {x}_{n}$$ (12) where y denotes
    the dependent variable in PCA; an denotes the coefficients of y; and xn; and xn
    denotes the influencing factor. Results Spatiotemporal distribution of lake eutrophication
    Spatiotemporal distribution The spatial and temporal distributions of eutrophication
    in Chagan Lake are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The monthly variation in eutrophication
    in Chagan Lake showed a rising trend in May, reaching a maximum in July (Fig.
    2). Based on the range of variation in the integrated eutrophication index of
    Chagan Lake (Fig. 3), the trophic state of Chagan Lake was found to be between
    eutrophic and severe eutrophic during 2004–2021, with a particular increase after
    2013 and a stabilization after 2020 (Fig. 3). The degree of the trophic state
    of the lake spanned a wide range (47.08–99.40) when the trophic state was evaluated
    using a single indicator alone; especially, the evaluation results of chlorophyll
    and CODMn varied significantly. Among these, the evaluation results of CODMn overestimated
    the lake’s trophic state, while those of Chl-a underestimated the lake’s trophic
    state. The trends of TLI (SD) and comprehensive eutrophication index were more
    consistent, showing an increasing trend from 2013 after a sharp decrease in 2005.

    eutrophication degree increased from southeast to northwest and reached its peak

    was higher in May and June, while the high eutrophication index in the remaining
    3 months was mainly concentrated at the entrance of the lake. Fig. 4 Spatial variation

    based on the land use type According to the pollution footprint model, the pollution
    footprint of Jiangjia station and Chuantou station inlets of Chagan Lake was calculated
    as 33.1 km2 and 34.7 km2, respectively. Using the Buffer Wizard tool in ArcGIS
    (Ver. 10.2) (Luan et al. 2021; Xie et al. 2021), a circular buffer zone centered
    at Jiangjia station and Chuantou station inlets was selected according to the
    proportion of paddy fields. Also, the area of land use types in each buffer zone
    was extracted, and the pollution footprint of TN and TP in the buffer zone was
    determined (Table 6). RFs occupied a dominant position in the land use of the
    study area (Fig. 6). Therefore, a buffer zone with a radius of 1 km centered at
    Jiangjia station and another buffer zone with a radius of 0.35 km centered at
    Chuantou station were selected. The land use types in the buffer zone of Jiangjia
    station were reed swamp > RF > construction land (residential land) > water body > corn
    land > grass land > bare land in descending order; the land use types in the buffer
    zone of Chuantou station were reed swamp > RF > corn land > water body > construction
    land (residential land) > grass land > bare land in descending order (Table 7).
    The TN pollution footprint of both buffer zones was larger than the TP pollution
    footprint, and the total pollution footprint of the Jiangjia station buffer zone
    was larger than that of the Chuantou station buffer zone. Table 6 Area of pollution

    Full size table Anthropogenic forcing analysis The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) and
    Bartlett’s sphericity tests were conducted to verify the applicability of the
    data based on the 10 socio-human factors X1–X10 and the comprehensive eutrophication
    index from 2004 to 2020. The KMO test coefficient was 0.73 > 0.5, and Bartlett’s
    sphericity test result was 699.21. The significant P value in the sphericity test
    was 0.00 < 0.05, indicating a specific correlation between these 10 socio-human
    factors and the eutrophication index each year (Cheng et al. 2014). The test results
    indicated that the socio-human data around the study area were suitable for PCA.
    The statistical results of the PCA with the help of SPSS are shown in Table 8
    and Fig. 7. Table 8 Calculation of coefficients of each principal component relationship

    As shown in Table 8, the correlations with the principal component were GDP-P > TSA > RF > GDP-T > CF > TPOP > GDP-S > GDP-PC > UR > NLY.
    In the principal component, the highest positive correlation factor was GDP-P
    (coefficient 0.96); the highest negative correlation factor was UR (coefficient
    – 0.66). The main anthropogenic factors influencing the eutrophication of Chagan
    Lake based on PCA were obtained as GDP-P, TSA, and RF. The component calculation
    relationship equation between TLI and factors was as follows. $$y = 0.644{x}_{3}
    + 0.131{x}_{6} + 0.102{x}_{7} + 0.079{x}_{5} + 0.019{x}_{8} + 0.011{x}_{1} + 0.006{x}_{4}
    + 0.005{x}_{2} + 0.002{x}_{9} + 0.001{x}_{10}$$ (13) where the contribution of
    GDP-P, TSA, and RF to the eutrophication of Chagan Lake was 64.43%, 13.09%, and
    10.23%, respectively. Discussion Advantages of the eutrophication evaluation method
    Lake eutrophication is mainly caused by an excessive increase in the amount of
    nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, in the lake (Zou et al. 2020; Qi et
    al. 2020). In addition, the chemical index CODMn and physical index SD may also
    cause or exacerbate the eutrophication of water bodies (Lin et al. 2020). The
    actual nutrient status of different lakes cannot be reflected because the eutrophication
    index often overestimates or underestimates the overall nutrient status of lakes
    when evaluating a single indicator of lakes (Lin et al. 2021). The traditional
    comprehensive eutrophication index uses a common set of parameters for the national
    water quality assessment, which may not capture the specific physical and chemical
    characteristics of a particular lake. Therefore, in this study, we modified the
    weighting coefficients of the index evaluation model based on the physical and
    chemical indicators of water quality (TN, TP, SD, and CODMn) and the biological
    indicators (Chl-a) for the Chagan Lake area. This might improve the accuracy of
    the eutrophication assessment for individual lakes. The factors affecting water
    quality changes in Chagan Lake, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, were considered.
    After the weight correction, the evaluation model increased the weight of TSI
    (SD) in the comprehensive eutrophication index, which reflected the water quality
    changes of Chagan Lake affected by the irrigation discharge more realistically.
    The modified TLI was applied to assess the trophic status of Chagan Lake, and
    the results indicated a higher level of eutrophication than that in the previous
    study (Liu et al. 2020a). The main reason was that the effect of TSS on lake phytoplankton
    was underestimated, limiting the effect of high TSS-induced SD on the trophic
    state (Liu et al. 2020a). The modified comprehensive eutrophication index reflected
    the changes in the eutrophication index of TP and SD more strongly (Fig. 3). The
    area is a eutrophic lake severely limited by light, followed by nitrogen and phosphorus,
    which is also consistent with previous findings on the phytoplankton competition
    mechanism in Chagan Lake (Liu et al. 2021a). Major factors affecting lake eutrophication
    The surface source pollution footprint around the inlet of Chagan Lake was analyzed
    based on the comprehensive eutrophication index evaluation. Since 2013, a large
    amount of irrigation discharge rich in nutrient and particulate matter has been
    released into Chagan Lake from the Da’an Irrigation District (Liu et al. 2019).
    The higher nutrient levels and lower transparency (SD) have aggravated lake eutrophication
    (Fig. 2). Especially, the western part of the lake shows an increasing trend of
    eutrophication. The irrigation return flow also causes the lake to become eutrophic
    and shows an increasing trend from east to west (Fig. 4). The old and new irrigation
    districts have different impacts on the water quality of the lake. The old irrigation
    district is the Qianguo irrigation area, which has a lower nutrient content in
    its return flow; the new irrigation district is the Da’an irrigation area, which
    has a higher nutrient content in its return flow. However, the preposition wetland
    of the lake can effectively purify the pollutants in the irrigation discharge
    (Grizzetti et al. 2003). Therefore, the large number of reeds had a purifying
    effect and reduced the nutrient content of the eastern part of the lake compared
    with the western part after the water from Qianguo Irrigation District receded
    through Xinmiao wetland (Yang et al. 2015). Based on the pollution footprint analysis,
    it was concluded that the surface source pollution affecting the water quality
    change of Chagan Lake in this area mainly came from agricultural land (Bechmann
    et al. 2005). The PCA also showed that the degree of eutrophication in Chagan
    Lake was positively correlated with the area’s TSA and negatively correlated with
    the UR, implying that irrigation discharge was the main factor leading to water
    quality changes (Fig. 7). Uncertainty analysis We preliminarily calculated the
    contribution of human activities to eutrophication and added the main human factors
    as variables in the future correction process of the eutrophication index. DO
    also affects eutrophication, which is an essential factor in determining the eutrophication
    status of water bodies. It reflects the balance between oxygen production by photosynthesis
    and oxygen consumption by respiration and decomposition. We considered incorporating
    DO as one of the indicators of eutrophication in our study. However, we faced
    difficulties obtaining reliable and consistent data on DO in Chagan Lake. Therefore,
    we decided to use other indicators of eutrophication, such as TN, TP, Secchi depth
    (SD), and chemical oxygen demand (CODMn), which were widely used and accepted
    in the literature. The assumptions we made for calculating some of these indicators,
    which might lead to underestimation or overestimation of the results, were as
    follows: (1) the temporal variations of nutrients and chlorophyll a, leading to
    misleading results for some months or seasons; and (2) the lack of data on other
    factors that might influence eutrophication, such as water temperature, pH, turbidity,
    salinity, and so forth. We also suggested some directions for improving our findings
    in the future: (1) collecting more data on DO and other water quality parameters
    in different locations and times of the lake; (2) using more advanced methods
    to measure and model the eutrophication process, such as oxidation–reduction potential,
    which can reflect the redox status of the water and the availability of oxygen
    and other electron acceptors or donors; (3) considering the human activities contributing
    to eutrophication, such as agriculture, industry, and sewage disposal, and incorporating
    them as variables in the future correction of the eutrophication index. When fitting
    the water quality indicators and influencing factors with the eutrophication evaluation
    model, other nonlinear fitting methods can also be considered, which may help
    further improve the accuracy of the eutrophication index evaluation model. Lake
    water quality management strategies We proposed multidimensional suitable management
    strategies based on the anthropogenic attribution of lake eutrophication and the
    determination of pollution footprint and buffer zone. The specific measures were
    as follows. Reducing exogenous pollution load The major exogenous pollution that
    causes the change in water quality in Chagan Lake comes from the surrounding irrigation
    and residential areas. We need to control the pollution sources and reduce the
    pollution load within 31.1 km2 near Jiangjia station and 34.7 km2 near Chuantou
    station to improve the water quality of Chagan Lake (Table 6). Specific measures
    are as follows: (1) using fertilization technology and adjusting the time of agricultural
    retreat (Lu et al. 2022); (2) protecting the irrigation area’s ecology, reducing
    pollution and vegetation loss in the buffer zone, collecting and storing livestock
    and poultry manure to avoid runoff into the lake, building drainage and sewage
    treatment facilities, cutting down domestic sewage discharge, and raising sewage
    treatment standards (Fan et al. 2020); and (3) improving fertilization efficiency
    in the irrigation area using better fertilization technology; developing new fertilizers
    and crop-specific technology based on local soil, crop, and climate conditions;
    and matching fertilizer release rate with crop growth cycle and demand (Lu et
    al. 2022). Also, it is essential to improve fertilizer utilization efficiency,
    reduce nutrient leaching and volatilization, and adjust the nutrient ratio in
    the soil to avoid the occurrence of land slumping and soil salinization around
    the irrigation area (Parry 1998; Ulén et al. 2007; Li et al. 2022). Enhancing
    buffer zone purification capacity The buffer zone between the irrigation area
    and the lake needs to be used efficiently to enhance the purification capacity
    of the buffer zone for pollutants. This study aimed to explore the optimal strategies
    for buffer zone management and evaluate their effects on water quality. One of
    the important ways to improve the water quality of lakes is to enhance the purification
    function of the buffer zone (Brumberg et al. 2021). Some common methods to enhance
    the buffer capacity are planting aquatic plants, such as reeds and cattails, around
    the wetland irrigation area, constructing artificial wetlands, and designing diverse
    wetland habitat types. Generally speaking, reeds can remove 71.3% of TN and 50.0%
    of TP, which confirms the water quality purification effect of a pre-wetland (Xinmiao
    wetland) in Chagan Lake (Yang et al. 2015). Therefore, the reed planting area
    around the wetland can be increased based on the identified buffer zones of 1
    km centered on the Jiangjia station drainage and irrigation station and 0.5 km
    centered on the Chuantou station (Fig. 6) to achieve the purpose of removing nitrogen
    and phosphorus. Besides existing drainage ditches, ponds, and wetlands on agricultural
    land, vegetation and aquatic plants that can effectively absorb and enrich substances
    such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and pesticides should be planted within the buffer
    zone radius (Zhang et al. 2021a). Using the corresponding engineering measures
    to intercept, adsorb, and degrade pollutants, the ecological interception improves
    and purifies the water quality and realizes the prevention and control of agricultural
    surface source pollution (Wang et al. 2016). Nitrogen and phosphorus ecological
    interception technologies should be adapted to local conditions based on the local
    topography in different regions (Qin 2002). Promoting environmental awareness
    and improving relevant laws and regulations The strategy of sustainable development
    of the ecological economy needs to be followed for the Chagan Lake area by balancing
    protection and development, ecology, and tourism, and improving the environmental
    policies in and around the scenic area. Moreover, the residents’ environmental
    awareness needs to be enhanced and collaboration with the local departments needs
    to be done to manage and protect the ecotourism area. Further, scientific and
    feasible solutions should be adopted for this area, with a foresight to address
    the contradictions and problems. The aim should be to achieve the sustainable
    development of environmental, social, and economic benefits and provide a guarantee
    (Nuppenau 2001). Conclusions This study refined the corresponding weights in this
    study based on the existing comprehensive eutrophication index. A modified comprehensive
    eutrophication index was built that reanalyzed the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics
    of eutrophication in Chagan Lake. The conclusions are summarized as follows: (1)
    This study focused on revising the impact of the changes in SD caused by high
    TSS on eutrophication for the characteristics of highly suspended particles in
    Chagan Lake. The overall trophic state of Chagan Lake was in a eutrophic state
    (TLI = 58.31). The eutrophication was heavier during the irrigation discharge
    period (May to September), and the lake area showed an increasing trend from eastern
    to western. (2) The total sown area is the main factor affecting the eutrophication
    of Chagan Lake, which confirms the previous hypothesis. According to the determination
    of the pollution radius and buffer zone radius, the irrigation district near Jiangjia
    station should reduce water discharge within 31.1 km2 and increase the purification
    capacity within the buffer zone with a radius of 1 km. Also, the irrigation district
    near Chuantou station should reduce water discharge within 34.7 km2 and increase
    the purification capacity within the buffer zone with a radius of 0.35 km. The
    correction of the eutrophication index in Chagan Lake in this study provided scientific
    support for the water environment management of Chagan Lake and guidance for formulating
    a similar “one lake, one policy.” Data availability Relevant data and materials

    irrigation 1. Introduction Given the advancements in the field of wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs) as well as in the miniaturization of such sensor systems, new
    trends have emerged in the field of precision agriculture (Zhang et al., 2002,
    Srinivasan, 2006). Reviews of wireless sensor technologies and applications in
    agriculture and food industry have been given by Wang et al. (2006) and by Ruiz-Garcia
    et al. (2009).Wireless networks allow the deployment of sensing and actuation
    infrastructure at a much finer granularity than has been available before. Sensors
    and actuators can be used to precisely and autonomously control, for example,
    the concentration of fertilizer in the soil, based on information gathered from
    the soil itself, the ambient temperature, and other relevant environmental factors.
    Incorporating feedback into the system through the use of sensors and actuators
    allows for a more fine-grained analysis that can adjust flow rate and duration
    in a way that is informed by local conditions. Significant economic gains are
    expected by applying such precise information to control the growth of particularly
    delicate and high value crops such as wine grapes, citrus fruit and strawberries.
    Sensors that are able to monitor the crop itself, for example, leaf temperature
    in strawberries, or sugar-levels in grapes, or the photosynthetic activity of
    the crop plant, to provide location-specific data could also prove to be very
    effective. In particular, the use of WSN technology to optimize irrigation in
    agriculture is of benefit to both the farmers and the environment. According to
    recent reports, agriculture irrigation accounts for 50–60% of freshwater usage
    from sources in the natural environment and up to more than 90% in some developing
    countries (UNESCO, 2009, pp. 106–115). Given the increasing worldwide shortage
    of water caused by a combination of a changing climate and pressure resulting
    from high demand of agricultural products, it is of primary importance to develop
    new irrigation control strategies that allow the minimization of water wastage
    while keeping associated costs at an affordable level. In this paper we describe
    the design of an intelligent decision support system and its integration with
    a wireless sensor/actuator network (WSAN) to implement closed-loop zone specific
    irrigation control in greenhouses via wireless communication. Our research focuses
    on the provision of proactive applications by deploying sensor networks and connecting
    sensor data with actuators through an adaptive and able to learn decision-making
    layer. The system developed provides real-time monitoring and control of both
    agricultural inputs and outputs (irrigation control). A rule editor with a graphical
    user interface (GUI) is used by the domain-expert to initialize the knowledge
    base. The system is optimized to adapt to changes in crop development by configuring
    the rule parameters in the system ontology. In addition, machine learning is employed
    to enrich systems’ knowledge base. The remaining of the paper is organized as
    follows. Section 2 gives an overall description of the developed system. The topics
    covered in this discussion include the layered modular architecture of the system,
    the WSAN platform, the supported sensors and their interfacing to the platform,
    the ontology-based decision making layer and the machine learning process followed
    to extend system knowledge. Section 3 details the technological and agronomic
    results. It provides an evaluation of the developed system in terms of a prototype
    deployment, the derivation of new rules from the machine learning experiments
    performed, the WSN performance analysis and the mote lifetime estimation by using
    analytical models, the agronomic impact of the system and also provides a discussion
    of related work and lessons learnt. Finally, Section 4 presents a summary of this
    work. 2. Materials and methods The overall goal of the research and development
    work described in this paper is to design a new plant growth monitoring and control
    system comprising: • a distributed network of sensors for accurately sensing the
    plant growth activity and environmental conditions, and plant growth control actuators;
    • ontology-based decision support mechanisms that associate sensor data with actuator
    commands; • a machine learning process for enhancing plant state diagnosis based
    on logged data; and • a set of tools that facilitate the specification of applications
    and the visualization of measuring parameters and assessed states. As an application
    example of the above system we have considered an intelligent irrigation control
    strategy applied to protected agricultural crops that can improve the environmental
    and economic sustainability of the greenhouse sector. 2.1. System overview The
    system is organized in a layered modular approach to allow flexibility and extensibility.
    A layered system architecture decouples the low-level sensory communication from
    the application business logic; the former gathers raw data from sensors, while
    the latter can be captured as an hierarchy of rules (Goumopoulos et al., 2007).
    In this way, applications do not depend on a specific sensor or a protocol that
    this sensor uses to transfer data values. Therefore, new sensor devices that emerge
    for a selected plant parameter can be integrated to the system without disturbing
    the other modules. Similarly, a different wireless communication protocol can
    be used without affecting the application business logic. This approach allowed
    us to develop and evaluate precision agriculture applications with diverse system
    and technology configurations (Goumopoulos et al., 2007, Goumopoulos et al., 2009,
    Goumopoulos, 2012). Fig. 1 illustrates the system architecture in a high level
    view. In yellow color are shown the components that are discussed in this paper.
    In the lower layer various sensors/actuators that can collectively form composite
    WSANs, provide the raw data and the means to activate devices associated with
    agricultural inputs (e.g., irrigation). In the driver’s layer, a specific driver
    is designed and implemented for each WSAN implementing the hardware communication
    protocol. The coordinator of the WSAN is connected to the corresponding gateway
    at the backend system which collects all sensor measurements before forwarding
    them to populate a relational database. The system architecture embraces the use
    of standalone devices that communicate directly with a driver through a device-specific
    communication protocol. These devices are usually complex sensors such as an infrared
    (IR) imaging system, and the PAM meter. The latter which is used in our prototype
    employs the so-called Pulse-Amplitude-Modulation (PAM) measuring principle to
    provide a selective measure of the relative chlorophyll fluorescence quantum yield
    for determining the photosynthetic efficiency of the plant. This parameter acts
    as a general plant health indicator and provides a reference for the classification
    process of the machine learning algorithm applied. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. High-level system architecture. The functionality of the backend
    system is supported by the following main components: Ontology, Decision Support
    System (DSS), and Machine Learning (ML). The ontology specifies all the rules
    that support the decision-making process in the form of a knowledge base. The
    DSS provides all the synthetic information, acquired from the analysis of the
    stored data, needed to make operative decisions for the plant growth management.
    The purpose of the ML component is to analyze the structured information using
    machine learning and data mining techniques in order to find interesting new correlations.
    A number of tools have also been developed to support the application development.
    2.2. WSAN platform and sensor/actuator interfacing The hardware platform used
    is the 25 mm mote developed at Tyndall (Bellis et al., 2005, Tyndall, 2014). The
    hardware platform is analogous to a Lego™-like 25 mm × 25 mm stackable system
    (Fig. 2). The module contains an Atmel ATMega128L 8-bit microcontroller and a
    Chipcon CC2420 ZigBee RF chip both of which are combined on one layer. The microcontroller
    is equipped with 128 KB in-system flash memory and can be programmed to handle
    analogue to digital conversion (ADC) of sensor data and the communication networking
    protocols for interfacing with the RF transceiver to achieve communication with
    other nodes. The CC2420 transceiver used is 802.15.4 compliant – and as such can
    cover 16 channels in the 2.4 GHz band. Current consumption is very low with transmit
    and receive currents typically 17.4 mA and 19.7 mA and 1 μA in sleep mode. Stacked
    upon this RF microcontroller layer is our custom sensor/actuator interface layer,
    which allows any combination of eight different sensors or actuators to be connected
    to the 25 mm module. On the software side, the microcontroller runs a tailored
    version of TinyOS, an optimised operating system that allows fast configuration
    of the sensor nodes. The power layer may include batteries or other energy supply
    or power harvesting mechanisms, i.e., solar cells or piezo electric power generation
    mechanisms. An 25 mm Li-ion battery layer is also provided with built-in USB charger
    capability. In an early version of the system the authors have investigated an
    alternative configuration of the Tyndall25 mote regarding the communication layer
    (Nordic VLSI nRF2401 2.4 GHz RF transceiver) and the network topology (peer-to-peer)
    (Goumopoulos et al., 2007). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Tyndall25
    mote modular platform. 2.2.1. Communication protocol and topology The communication
    protocol used in our case is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard (IEEE 802.15.4
    Standard, 2006) which specifies the physical layer and the Medium Access Control
    (MAC) layer of the protocol. IEEE 802.15.4 combined with the ZigBee open specification
    specify a protocol stack for the development of short-range and low power communications
    for Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs). The basic configuration of the IEEE
    802.15.4 permits a transfer rate of 250 Kbps to a distance range of 10–100 m in
    the 2.4 GHz frequency band depending on the antenna, the environment and the power
    consumption permitted by a given application. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard supports
    two addressing schemes, either short (16 bit) or long addresses (IEEE 64 bit)
    so theoretical network size is up to 65536 or 264 nodes. A maximum frame size
    of 127 bytes is supported with a payload of up to 114 bytes (assuming short addresses).
    An IEEE 802.15.4 network consists of one PAN coordinator and a set of devices
    which are classified as reduced functionality devices (RFD) and full functionality
    devices (FFD). The interconnection of these devices allow the creation of three
    types of topologies: star (the PAN coordinator is in the transmission range of
    all other devices resulting in single-hop communication), mesh or peer-to-peer
    (a node may communicate with any neighbor enabling multi-hop communication) and
    cluster-tree (a combination of the previous topologies where the PAN coordinator
    is the root of the tree and all the non-leaf devices are defined as coordinators
    with the ability to forward the packets to/from the root). The physical layer
    of IEEE 802.15.4 uses Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) with Collision Avoidance
    (CA) to access the radio channel (IEEE 802.15.4 Standard, 2006). The MAC layer
    enables two different operational modes: non beacon-enabled mode and beacon enabled
    mode. In the former case the access control is governed by non-slotted CSMA/CA,
    where as in the latter case the network coordinator broadcasts a special frame
    (a beacon) periodically that permits the synchronization of the associated devices.
    In our current system we use the non-beacon mode and thus our network topology
    is a star topology. Selecting the non-beacon mode was mandatory due to the unavailability
    of a beacon-mode implementation for our WSAN platform. In the star topology the
    coordinator and the actuator controlling motes are powered from the mains source,
    where as the sensor motes are battery powered. Given that the plant processes
    we want to monitor and control (e.g. plant dehydration) are slow, the use of low
    sampling intervals (in the order of 5–30 min) is acceptable to save energy. In
    addition, the data to be transmitted is of low complexity resulting in limited
    payloads on the IEEE 802.15.4 data frames. A sampling rate of 5 min with a payload
    of only 18 bytes (total data frame size 33 bytes) gives a sampling rate of 0.88
    bps which is very low compared to the medium transmission rate (250 Kbps). This
    low sampling rate affects the collision probability and allows achieving a high
    successful packet delivery rate for a sufficient number of nodes provided that
    nodes can awake in a random manner during the specified sampling interval to take
    measurements and transmit their values, as we will explain in the evaluation part
    of the sensor network. The protected environment of greenhouses provides also
    the possibility of using a range of facilities like mains power for certain devices
    (e.g. controlling of water pumps). By using the star topology we have avoided
    well known complications that are related with the use of the beacon-enabled mode
    such as clock drifts between coordinators in cluster tree topologies, dynamic
    network resynchronization in the case a cluster joins/leaves the network and the
    need for dynamic rearrangement of duty cycles in the case of a coordinator failure.
    2.2.2. Sensors The interfacing of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) sensors generally
    requires special hardware for each sensor. This is because different sensors may
    have different power requirements and output type and range. Three types of sensors
    had to be interfaced for the Tyndall25 mote: soil moisture sensors, humidity sensors
    and thermistors for determining leaf/air temperature. The main properties of these
    sensors are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Sensors interfaced to the 25 mm mote.

    http://www.sensirion.com http://www.cantherm.com 2.2.2.1. Soil moisture sensor
    Soil moisture can be measured by electromagnetic sensors which determine volumetric
    water content (VWC) and occasionally electrical conductivity in the soil under
    consideration. The correlation between the electromagnetic signals measured and
    VWC is attributed to the high permittivity of water which can be inferred by the
    sensors through various means (e.g., time, frequency and capacitance). In our
    case the ECHO EC-10 soil moisture probe by Decagon was selected. It uses the capacitance
    technique to measure the dielectric permittivity of the surrounding medium which
    can then be related to the VWC of the soil. The ECHO EC-10 sensor provides fast
    measurements with very low power consumption, giving the ability to take many
    measurements over a long period of time (e.g., a growing season) with minimal
    battery usage. Regarding the accuracy of the measured VWC the manufacturer recommends
    establishing soil-specific calibration functions (Campbell, 2004). The soil used
    in our applications was a peat substrate. A series of soil/water mixtures were
    used and the corresponding sensor responses were recorded. The process was performed
    for different sensors and the average values of 3 repetitions were used to obtain
    the following equation: (1) Soil moisture sensor outputs could be input directly
    into the analogue to digital converter because they are in the voltage range of
    the microcontroller. 2.2.2.2. Humidity sensor For measuring humidity we have selected
    the SHT11 component from Sensirion which also provides temperature measurements.
    A capacitive sensor element is used for measuring relative humidity while temperature
    is measured by a band-gap sensor. The device also integrates signal processing
    and provides a fully calibrated digital output. To obtain the relative humidity
    we used the accuracy enhancement formula that is provided by the manufacturer
    (Sensirion, 2011): (2) where SORH is the humidity readout value (12-bit length),
    C1 = −2.0468, C2 = 0.0367 and C3 = −1.5955 * 10−6. The humidity sensor provides
    its output in a digital format which can be input directly into the microcontroller.
    2.2.2.3. Temperature sensor There are different types of sensors that are used
    for temperature measurement in greenhouses. Of the sensors available, thermistors
    were chosen as they have high sensitivity to minute changes in temperature (change
    in resistance vs. temperature on a scale of −3%/°C to −6%/°C for NTC thermistors),
    low thermal mass, high thermal conduction, low cost and are small enough to be
    placed on the plant leaf. Two important parameters that must be taken into account
    when designing a temperature measurement system are resolution and accuracy. The
    temperature resolution is the smallest detectable incremental change of temperature
    that can be detected by the system. Thermistors’ inherent high sensitivity can
    provide high resolution measurements. The temperature accuracy is the maximum
    difference that will exist between the real temperature (which must be measured
    by a reference thermometer) and the measured value by the system. In our case,
    we have selected a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor (i.e. resistance
    decreases as temperature increases) with high resistance tolerance (±0.5%) and
    a nominal resistance of 10 kΩ at 25 °C (Cantherm, 2006). The measurement system
    we have designed achieves a temperature resolution of 0.02 °C and an accuracy
    of ±0.05 °C over a temperature range of 5–45 °C. The resolution and accuracy of
    temperature measurement is critical for the precision irrigation application we
    developed and therefore we have carefully designed the corresponding system. Moreover,
    higher resolution and accuracy are required for the machine learning experiments
    that will be described later in the paper. A characteristic of thermistors is
    the non-linear relationship between thermistors resistance (Rth) measured in ohms,
    and temperature (T) measured in Kelvin, as given by the well-known Steinhart–Hart
    thermistor equation or the simpler B-parameter equation: (3) where R0 is the resistance
    value at reference temperature T0 (typically 25 °C/298.15 K), B is the B or Beta
    value, which is an indication of the slope of the Rth–T curve (the higher the
    Beta value the greater the change in resistance per degree C). Both R0 and B are
    specified in the sensor data sheet. R∞ is the thermistor resistance as the temperature
    approaches infinity. Eq. (3) solved for T is written as: (4) The measurement system
    provides temperature values in three steps: 1. Measurement of the conditioning
    circuit output voltage by means of the ADC module. 2. Calculation of the thermistor
    resistance from the ADC value. 3. Calculation of the temperature using Eq. (4).
    In order to obtain both high precision and high resolution temperature values
    by the measurement system several design choices have to be made in the above
    three steps. A conditioning circuit is used to interface thermistors to the ADC
    module of the Tyndall25 mote working with an external reference voltage of 2.5
    V (Vref) for 12-bit ADC. The conditioning circuit includes four high precision
    resistors (0.1% tolerance) and a high precision operational amplifier (op-amp)
    with low noise and low offset voltage that scales and shifts the analog signal
    of the thermistor voltage in order to correctly map the required thermistor resistance
    range to the voltage range (0–2.5 V) supported by the ADC module. To overcome
    the impact of the circuit component uncertainties and get highly accurate measurements
    careful calibration was performed, matching the output of the measuring system
    to a set of known reference values. Details of this calibration process are omitted
    due to lack of space. Fig. 3 shows a plot of the calibration data and also the
    thermistor resistance variation compared to the temperature variation. The figure
    shows also the linear fit of the curves that could be used for applications that
    can afford lower accuracy measurements. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    3. Calibration data plot. 2.2.3. Irrigation system Fig. 4 shows the schematic
    layout of the irrigation distribution unit. In principle, the mote’s controlling
    software, via a transistor switch, activates a relay that in turn activates the
    pump device. The interface layer sits on top of the Tyndall25 mote as additional
    layers cannot be placed above it due to the size of the connectors attached to
    it. In order to toggle the external relay, which is part of the actuator portion,
    12 V must be supplied at the interface layer output. The heart of the actuator
    portion of the interface layer is a simple transistor switch that is controlled
    by the microcontroller. When the software running on the microcontroller toggles
    the appropriate output a voltage is supplied to the base of the transistor and
    the switch is turned on and 12 V is supplied to the relay which is connected to
    a Harwin M30-610 connector. The 12 V supply voltage is used not only for the actuators
    but also to power all possibly connected sensors and the entire Tyndall25 mote.
    The interface layer contains a Torex XC6202 voltage regulator to regulate the
    12 V supply down to 3.3 V in order to power the mote and connected sensors. Download

    unit. In order for this system to work the mote has to take commands from the
    coordinator node so as to know what section to irrigate and for how long. The
    coordinator sends a command via its radio link to the associated node controlling
    the actuator. This command is sent to the module in the irrigation distribution
    unit that converts the signal to a voltage level that the microcontroller can
    read. Once the microcontroller receives a valid command according to the decision
    making output it will actuate the pump valve and open a particular solenoid in
    order to irrigate a specific section of the crop layout. The solenoid operated
    water valves distribute the watering supply in four distinct zones of plants.
    A fifth water valve provides humidity control. The pumps used in the system are
    the Whale Whisperflo UP0815 pressure pump with a flow rate of 8 L min−1. The solenoids
    are manufactured by Bermad, model S-390-2-R. 2.3. Ontology-based DSS and tools
    At the heart of the back-end system (Fig. 1) lies the DSS component which is build
    on top of an ontology. An ontology is a tool that can conceptualize a world view
    by capturing general knowledge and providing basic notions and concepts for basic
    terms (Uschold and Gruninger, 1996). The ontology developed defines domain concepts
    and relations among them. It provides a vocabulary for expressing the decision-making
    rules based on plant and environmental sensing parameters which are related with
    a set of sensors and actuators as well as correlated biological information (Fig.
    5). The specification of the ontology was performed using the Protégé ontology
    development tool (http://protege.stanford.edu/) based on the OWL standard language.
    An in depth discussion of the ontology design is provided by Goumopoulos et al.
    (2009). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Part of the system ontology
    hierarchy. In this context, the decision-making process is based on a set of rules
    in operational representation forms, which are applied on existent knowledge and
    allow the use of the ontology for reasoning providing inferential and validation
    mechanisms. For example, there is a need for a set of rules that will take into
    account both plant and environmental parameters and the description of a plant
    in order to diagnose a plant’s state. Other rules would take into account the
    plant’s state, its description and user defined policies to determine the possible
    actions of the system, such as the request for a resource. An inference engine
    is used for the decision-making process. The inference engine module exploits
    the Jess (Java Expert System Shell) rule engine (http://herzberg.ca.sandia.gov/jess/).
    The execution of this module starts based on the initial facts and the rules stored
    in the rule base using CLIPS format. The concepts that appear in the rules have
    emerged from the ontology. Essentially, this is an approach of building rules
    on top of ontologies. Therefore, the reasoning is based on the definition of the
    ontology, by using first-order predicate calculus. The user, however, can define
    or update existing rules using a front-end tool and expressing the rules with
    simple if-then-else logic. A number of tools have been developed to facilitate
    the development, configuration and monitoring of applications. For each node in
    the WSAN we provide a driver operator configuration software that specifies the
    actions to setup the properties of the WSAN in order to make it functional for
    the agricultural application. This configuration provides also the definition
    of certain parameters that will allow the proper interpretation of the data received
    by the device operator. Fig. 6 illustrates the interface defined for configuring
    the Tyndall25-based WSAN. Options include setting the mote to be configured, its
    frequency channel and position in the field, the active ADCs and the type of the
    associated sensor/actuator. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Tyndall25-based
    WSAN driver configuration software. Fig. 7 shows the design of the ‘Heat Stress’
    calculation rule for the irrigation application using a simple rule editing tool
    targeted to the domain expert, which provides a visual interface based on a node
    connection model. The rule consists of three conditions combined with a logical
    AND node. An expression builder facilitates the definition of the condition relying
    on concepts stored in the ontology. The rule, as designed, states that when all
    conditions are met then the heat stress state of the RC area must be set to active
    (HeatStress ACTIVE). The Supervisor Logic and Data Acquisition (SLADA) tool is
    another tool used to view knowledge represented into the ontology, monitor and
    log plant/environmental parameters and manage dynamically the rules taking part
    in the decision-making process in co-operation with the rule editor. The rule
    editor and the SLADA tool are described in detail in Goumopoulos et al. (2007).

    agriculture it is feasible to extract new knowledge from stored data in the form
    of models that are in an easy to manage form by the decision making system and
    understandable to the domain expert involved in the crop production process (Dimitriadis
    and Goumopoulos, 2008). Elaborating on our previous research work, we used classification
    algorithms, which produce a classifier as a set of rules or decision trees that
    can be then exploited to predict the classification of new data cases and can
    insert new rules to the domain model. Before that, the application of clustering
    algorithms based on particular proximity criteria-attributes can create hypotheses
    about the relationships that can be found in the dataset and identify the natural
    groupings in the input data. We devised a machine learning process model that
    guides machine learning experimentation with an aim to incorporate derived rules
    and attributes into the decision-making mechanism (Fig. 8). This process is an
    expanded form of the process model for machine learning application in agriculture
    that was created by the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) group
    in University of Waikato in New Zealand (Witten and Frank, 2005). The close cooperation
    between the data mining expert and the plant science field expert is required
    in several phases. In the pre-processing and analysis phases, their collaboration
    will shape the datasets upon which the machine learning algorithms shall operate.
    The responsibility of the field expert is to review and interpret the appropriateness
    of the data and suggest possible transformations and/or relaxations. The responsibility
    of the data mining expert is to guarantee that the inferred rules correspond satisfactorily
    to the evaluated measures (e.g., overall success rate and false positive rate)
    from the machine learning perspective. Regarding the data mining process, algorithms
    provided by the WEKA workbench are used. At the post-processing phase the field
    expert could indicate which subset of the derived rules establishes new valuable
    knowledge, and which part describes common knowledge. To estimate the performance
    of classifiers generated from the entire data set of example cases, the 10-fold
    cross validation approach to training and testing was used. Download : Download

    Strawberry plants (Fragaria ananassa) have been selected for system validation
    and evaluation because the delivered technology can be relevant to the commercial
    production of this crop, while on a practical level, the size of the leaves enables
    easy attachment of sensors. In addition, irrigation control on strawberry plants
    is important as they have a shallow root system making them particularly sensitive
    to water stress. On the other hand, controlling excessive irrigation is significant
    for avoiding nutrient leaching and disease development that affect negatively
    the crop yield. The most effective balance needs to be achieved between these
    two requirements. The irrigation treatments, controlled by our system, were imposed
    from the beginning of the flowering to the end of the fruit maturity from early
    June to late July in a greenhouse establishment at the University College Cork
    in Ireland (Fig. 9) in the context of the PLANTS project (daisy.cti.gr/plants/)
    funded by the European Community under the Information Society Technologies Programme.
    A subset of this experiment was performed using a different WSAN platform (Crossbow
    MICAz) and the results regarding this configuration are discussed in Goumopoulos
    (2012). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Experimental setup (left);
    drip-feed into a pot (right). 3.1. Plant signals and environmental parameters
    The primary plant signals and environmental parameters explored during application
    development are: Plant’s leaf Temperature (PT), Chlorophyll Fluorescence (CF),
    Ambient Temperature (AT), Humidity (H) and Soil Moisture (SM). PT was chosen as
    it indicates drought and heat stress (Mannini and Anconelli, 1993). The former
    is due to lack of water and will be reflected in the stomata (leaf pores) closing
    when the plants are under water stress and with the shutdown of transpiration
    the leaves will begin to heat up (i.e., monitoring the temperature of the leafs
    to determine drought state). On the other hand, heat stress can occur independently
    of water stress when the environmental temperature gets very high and transpiration
    cannot maintain leaf cooling. By comparing PT and AT one can deduce an indication
    of plant stress. The addition of the SM parameter enables the system to decide
    between heat stress (i.e. plant has adequate water but temperature is high) and
    drought stress (i.e. both water content is low and temperature is high). The CF
    parameter serves as the feedback mechanism to determine the state of the photosynthetic
    rate of the plant and from this determine how productive or stressed the plant
    is under the current conditions (Norikane et al., 2003). We use this parameter
    for the machine learning process. A healthy plant absorbs light from the sun and
    directs a proportion of the energy absorbed (slightly above 80%) to photosynthesis,
    through chlorophyll a. This proportion can be determined by providing a very bright
    pulse of light and determining the difference between minimal and maximal fluorescence.
    Any decline in this proportion indicates a reduction in the efficiency with which
    light is converted to photosynthetic product, and such a decline is often seen
    when a plant is stressed. So when plants become dehydrated or are otherwise stressed,
    they are often less able to convert sunlight into photosynthetic product and this
    stress can be detected using fluorescence (Razavi et al., 2008). Fluorometers
    that use the PAM technique (PAM meter) work by rapidly sending brief pulses of
    light to a plant. A healthy plant responds to this light very quickly (within
    microseconds) by re-emitting some of the light energy as fluorescence which is
    detected by the fluorometer. CF measurements are taken using a standalone sensor
    device (Junior PAM1), whereas PT, AT, H and SM measurements are taken by the WSAN.
    3.2. System deployment The experimental setup consists of an array of 96 plants
    placed in a glasshouse, arranged in an array of 12 by 8. Four different zones
    are defined: Left-Edge (LE), Right-Edge (RE), Left-Center (LC), Right-Center (RC).
    Also, there is one zone selected for misting which overlaps with the RC zone.
    The setup integrates 36 thermistors (8 ambient and 28 plant temperature thermistors)
    and 8 soil moisture probes into one system that when required can irrigate and
    also determine when to stop the irrigation. This deployment takes into account
    differences in the location of the plants in the overall area and will allow for
    independent irrigation of edge or centre zone plants as required. Eight Tyndall25
    motes are used for connecting the various sensors, one mote is sensorless and
    is used as a gateway with the backend system, and one mote is used for controlling
    the irrigation system. The motes are placed in IP-67 rated water-proof packaging
    to endure the field conditions (Fig. 9). Sensor mapping to the zones is managed
    with the WSAN configuration tool (Fig. 6). Sensor nodes are taking measurements
    at user-defined intervals. For this experiment the rate was 5 min. To reduce random
    noise each measurement is the average of ten sensor readings. SM, PT and AT values
    are calculated from measurements taken by multiple sensors deployed in a zone.
    For the SM and AT parameters the average is calculated since a few sensors are
    involved (up to 3). In case of PT, where more sensors are involved (up to 10),
    both the mean and the median values have been considered and finally the median
    has been selected because of its robustness to outliers. The PAM meter sensor
    has been used for collecting data only from the RC area. The timewindow for measuring
    the photosynthetic activity is set between 9 am and 5 pm. The sensor uses a magnetic
    clamp to hold the plant leaf about 1 mm from the end of the light pipe. In order
    to receive readings from the PAM meter, successive measuring cycles must be initiated
    by the corresponding device driver. Each cycle starts with illuminating the leaf
    of the plant with an actinic light, followed by a saturation pulse, followed by
    a measurement. Then the driver pulses the leaf with increasing quantities of actinic
    light to get characterisation curves that contain information on the state of
    the leaf. A sequential protocol to communicate with the PAM meter has been implemented.
    The communication is done via the COM port connected to the PAM meter using a
    standard cable. The PAM meter uses a series of ASCII commands that are sent from
    the controlling device in a binary format. Some of these commands control the
    saturation pulse (i.e. ‘s’) and the actinic light intensity (e.g., ‘ai3’, ‘ai4’,
    etc.) and others like the ‘etr’ command request specific readings from the sensor.
    In particular, actinic light intensity commands also request PAR (photosynthetically
    active radiance) readings transmitted from the PAM meter. For example, actinic
    intensity ai3 will have a PAR value of 50, ai4 a PAR value of 70, etc. A delay
    of at least 100 ms is required between character transmissions, whereas a delay
    of up to 10 s is necessary between commands. Table 2 contains the application
    rules for the RC zone with thresholds specialized for the reproductive phase of
    strawberries. It is possible the threshold values to vary depending on the growing
    phase of the crop. In the strawberry fruiting stage, for example, more irrigation
    is required for quality production. In Table 2 we have shown a separate rule that
    defines the variable RCSMThreshold to the proper threshold value during the reproductive
    phase of the crop. Similarly, another rule defines the variable IrrigationThreshold
    with the proper value in the same growing phase. Note that the SM threshold can
    be defined to be both zone-specific and growing phase-specific, where as the irrigation
    threshold is defined to be the same for all zones. Existing knowledge from the
    horticulture literature can be easily integrated into our system through the ontology
    and rule editing tools discussed earlier. The uncertainty of the decisions can
    be modeled with confidence factors that can be integrated into the rules (Goumopoulos
    et al., 2007). Table 2. Application rules. Rule Body RCDroughtStress IF RCLeafTemperature
    – RCAmbientTemperature > 0.9 °C THEN RCDroughtStress ← TRUE ELSE RCDroughtStress
    ← FALSE RCHeatStress IF RCDroughtStress AND RCSoilMoisture > RCSMThreshold THEN
    RCHeatStress ← TRUE ELSE RCHeatStress ← FALSE RCNeedIrrigation IF RCDroughtStress
    AND NOT RCHeatStress THEN RCNeedIrrigation ← TRUE ELSE RCNeedIrrigation ← FALSE
    RCNeedMisting IF RCDroughtStress AND RCHeatStress THEN RCNeedMisting ← TRUE ELSE
    RCNeedMisting ← FALSE RCSMThreshold IF GrowingPhase = REPRODUCTIVE THEN RCSMThreshold
    ← 0.6 IrrigationThreshold IF GrowingPhase = REPRODUCTIVE THEN IrrigationThreshold
    ← 1800 s Two additional parameters must be defined for the prototype to be properly
    working: the duration of irrigation/misting and an idle time, which specifies
    the amount of time the rules should be disabled, after the action is performed.
    This is to allow the ecosystem to absorb the changes. The values used for the
    example application were 30 min/1 min and 4 h respectively. The irrigation system
    uses a reservoir, a pump system, standard pipe work, nipples and drippers which
    emit water directly into the plant pot. Flow rate depends on the pump pressure.
    The emitter flow rate per pot is regulated at 1 L h−1 with an application efficiency
    of 95%. In the misting system the drippers are replaced by nozzles that are designed
    to produce a fine spray. 3.3. Machine learning experiments For the machine learning
    experiments datasets collected by the deployed system were used. The attributes
    involved are: CF, PT, SM, AT, PAR, and the derived properties ETR (electron transport
    rate), QE (quantum efficiency of photosynthesis), InfPAR (inflection PAR), and
    the learning goals DS (DroughtStress) and HS (HeatStress) categorized with values
    TRUE/FALSE. The ETR is calculated within PAM meter by combining the CF (represented
    by several fluorescence quotients) and PAR measurements (Pfündel, 2007). InfPAR
    is calculated on the ETR vs. saturated PAR curve (Fig. 10); the curve is calculated
    using a second degree least squares algorithm. The point of inflection is calculated
    as the intersection point between the asymptotic lines of the curve’s first derivative.
    QE is the slope of the above curve. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10.
    ETR vs. saturated PAR curve. Data gathering was performed for a period of seven
    weeks corresponding to the reproductive phase of the crop. For analysis purposes
    we have divided this process into two stages. The first stage is represented in
    a dataset called “ETR_Photosynthetic Activity” which includes only the properties
    related to the plants photosynthetic activity and a characterization of the plant
    DS state, used as the classification parameter of the applied learning algorithms,
    within 234 instances (half of them were characterized as stressed and half as
    not stressed). The classification was done manually by domain experts. The aim
    was to acquire rules that determine the DS status of the plant based on its photosynthetic
    activity (rules #1 and #2 in Table 3). The second stage leverages on the knowledge
    acquired by the previous stage and is represented in a dataset called “MultiParameterCorrelation”
    which includes all attributes, the HS class assessed by the built-in rules (Table
    2) and the DS class assessed by both built-in and inferred rules from the first
    stage, within 4032 instances. The aim was to find new correlations between plant
    stress states and sensor measurements (rules #3–#7 in Table 3). The attribute
    Δtmp denotes the difference between plant and ambient temperature. By examining
    the list of the inferred rules it is obvious that rules #4 and #5 can collide
    with rule #1. Consequently, the rules that have been inferred might not be in
    a fully operational form. To alleviate this specific issue we need to conjugate
    the condition part of rules #4 and #5 with the term “SM > 60” in order to differentiate
    between DS and HS assessment. Table 3. Part of the rules derived by running machine
    learning algorithms. # Inferred rule Correctly classified (%) 1 IF (InfPAR ⩽ 319)
    THEN DS = TRUE 100 2 IF (QE < 0.87) THEN DS = TRUE 100 3 IF (AT ⩾ 18.5 AND AT
    ⩽ 28.5 AND PT ⩾ 20.8 AND PT ⩽ 29.9 AND Δtmp ⩾ 3.3 AND Δtmp ⩽ -1.3) THEN HS = TRUE
    100 4 IF (InfPAR ⩽ 243) THEN HS = TRUE 95 5 IF (PT ( 19 AND InfPAR ⩽ 313) THEN
    HS = TRUE 95 6 IF SM ⩽ 0.62 THEN DS = TRUE 91 7 IF Δtmp ⩾ 0.84 THEN DS = TRUE
    85 Based on the suggested machine learning process model (Fig. 8) and by using
    the WEKA feature selection tools we analyzed the relation between the parameters
    of lower informational value and the learning goals, and we created new data sets
    for each classification goal. This methodology disqualifies the appearance of
    complicated rules with many parameters not related to the classification class.
    Furthermore, we see in Table 3 that the rules for the prediction of the DS can
    be based on 3 different parameters. By having such a pluralism, the failure of
    a sensor may not be critical for the assessment of a state. Rules #6 and #7 in
    Table 3 are particularly interesting as they indicate a possible refinement on
    the threshold values of the corresponding rules for the assessment of the DS state
    with respect to the ones used by the built-in rules. Although the horticulture
    literature suggests a Δtmp value of 1 °C (Mannini and Anconelli, 1993) our machine
    learning experimentation indicates that this could be refined to 0.84 °C. Such
    an update can benefit the adaptation of the system in the current environment
    and improve the precision of the applied rules. This refinement has been also
    explored by the application of the Expectation Maximization (EM) clustering algorithm
    of the WEKA workbench in terms of the PT, AT and SM attributes. The result was
    a four cluster set which is graphically depicted in Fig. 11. As the plot depicts,
    each cluster is generally allocated in one of the four areas separated by the
    dotted vertical and horizontal lines. The different colors indicate the cluster
    a data instance belongs to. Black, blue red and cyan refer to cluster C0, C1,
    C2 and C3 respectively. Cluster 3 contains approximately 95% of the instances
    marked as healthy (DS = FALSE and HS = FALSE). All instances belonging to clusters
    1 and 2 needed irrigation treatment. For cluster 0, 82% of the instances required
    misting treatment and the rest were healthy. Finally, 9% of the instances belonging
    to cluster 3 requested irrigation and 3% requested misting. All other instances
    were stated as healthy. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Clustering
    of the “MultiParameterCorrelation” dataset. 3.4. WSN performance In this section
    we analyze the WSN performance focusing mainly on the estimation of the packet
    loss rate in terms of the number of motes and the duty cycle of the system. The
    duty cycle is defined as the ratio of the time required to sense and transmit
    a sample of the sensors attached to the mote to the sampling period. We assume
    a star topology formed by a set of sensor motes and a coordinator powered from
    the main source. We assume a steady state network where child nodes have already
    been associated to the coordinator node. The unslotted CSMA/CA protocol is used
    for the channel access, briefly described next. Two variables are used for each
    transmission attempt: number of backoff retries (NB) and backoff exponent (BE).
    In the beginning these variables are initialized as NB = 0 and BE = macMINBE (default
    value is 3). NB represents the number of backoff retries before assuming a channel
    access failure having a range between 0 and 5. The 802.15.4 MAC layer uses BE
    to choose a random backoff between 0 and 2BE – 1 to delay the Clear Channel Assessment
    (CCA) phase. BE has a range between 0 and 5 (setting BE to 0 means CSMA/CA is
    switched off). After the backoff period the MAC layer issues a CCA and if the
    channel is clear transmission can start. If the channel is found to be busy, both
    NB and BE are incremented by 1 and a new backoff is attempted. If NB exceeds the
    maximum threshold (macMaxCSMABackoffs = 5) then transmission is aborted. After
    the transmission the node waits for an ack frame. If the ack is successfully received,
    the transmission is considered successful. Our analysis is based on the analytical
    models developed by Timmons and Scanlon (2004) to describe the performance of
    the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol focusing on the estimation of the lifetime of an 802.15.4
    network of sensors in a star topology. For a network of n sensors the probability
    that the channel is clear in the CCA phase after the first backoff interval is
    given by the following formula: (5) where q is the probability of a node transmitting
    at any time. This probability depends in our case on the sampling period interval
    (SPI) defined for taking measurements and the payload size of the data frame.
    We do not take into account the polling messages from a sensor node to the network
    coordinator since these messages are very sparse (a pooling message is sent every
    measurements, approximately three times a day). The total size of the data frame
    is 33 bytes (18 bytes payload, 9 bytes MAC headers and 6 bytes PHY headers). So
    q is calculated as follows: (6) where TDF is the data frame transmission time.
    To estimate the packet loss rate we need to take into account the cumulative probability
    to find the channel clear so that packet transmission can happen (Ptr) by taking
    into account up to five backoff intervals as defined in the 802.15.4 CSMA/CA protocol
    and the probability of packet collision due to the fact that two or more nodes
    can select the same delay and transmit simultaneously. Ptr is defined as follows
    (Timmons and Scanlon, 2004): (7) Given that the probability of selecting the same
    backoff delay leading to collision is we can approximate the packet loss rate
    as follows: (8) The analysis shows that for a large number of sensors (up to 1000)
    with a low duty cycle (0.04% corresponding to an SPI of 5 min) both the probabilities
    of the channel being free for transmission and of not having a collision are greater
    than 99%. This means that the loss of packets is negligible. For the rather small
    number of devices used in our application it would be also more efficient to remove
    the CSMA/CA technique to avoid the initial backoff period and thus save more power.
    Fig. 12 shows the effect of the duty cycle of the system (determined by the selected
    SPI) on the packet loss rate for a constant payload size of 100 bytes. The results
    demonstrate that for a sufficient number of sensors duty cycles up to 1% give
    an acceptable packet loss rate in the range of 5%. Download : Download full-size

    The sensor motes operate according to the duty cycle in order to achieve the monitoring
    requirements of the application and conserve power by entering as much as possible
    to the sleeping mode. The energy consumption can be modeled by the following equation:
    (9) where ESense, ETx, ERx, EInit and ESleep represnt the energy consumed for
    sampling the sensors attached to the mote, transmitting data frames and receiving
    ack frames, initializing the mote and sleeping. Energy ESense is calculated as
    follows: (10) where V is the battery voltage (3.3 V), Ic is the current consumption
    to sample a sensor and ts is the total time to sample a sensor during a time interval
    T. Assuming a sampling period interval SPI then where tm is the measurement time
    for each sampling. For each sensor the Ic and tm values are defined in Table 1.
    Assuming SPI = 5 min Table 4 summarizes the energy consumption for the mote. In
    every cycle the sensing and the transmission operations are taking place only
    once. The duty cycle (DC) of the service is measured at 0.04% and the average
    power consumption is approximated by the following equation: (11) where Pactive
    is the sensing and transmission power consumption and Psleep is the sleep mode
    power consumption. From Table 4 the average power consumption is estimated to
    151 μW. Lifetime of the mote can be computed as where CBATT is the battery capacity
    (expressed in mAh) and E is the average energy given in Table 4. Using a 3.3 V
    Li-ion battery of 500 mAh the lifetime of the mote will be 1.2 years whereas a
    battery of 1200 mAh will achieve a 2.9 years lifetime. Therefore, the mote lifetime
    can easily satisfy the full crop agronomic cycle of strawberries which is 200
    days. Table 4. Energy consumption measurements. Empty Cell Energy (mJ) Power (mW)

    in a notable reduction in water consumption (∼20%) with respect to traditional
    agricultural practices involving user defined timed irrigation based on rules
    of thumb (twice or thrice a week for 1–2 h). The latter was applied in a parallel
    setup for the same growing period of the crop. The irrigation treatments were
    imposed from the beginning of the flowering to the end of the fruit maturity from
    early June to late July. Since the objective of any crop cultivation is to achieve
    the highest yield, crop yield is the most effective way to evaluate the benefits
    of crop growth systems. Therefore we compared the plant-driven irrigation system
    with the traditional irrigation scheme, regarding strawberry growth, in terms
    of crop yield, water use efficiency and other yield parameters. In our experiment,
    the strawberry harvesting stage started about 28 days after flowering and there
    were ten harvests that took place every 3 days. The highest quality of the crop
    was noticed in the first rounds. At each round of the harvest period the yield,
    the number of strawberries and the average weight per strawberry were recorded.
    The dry weight of strawberries was also determined by drying them at 80 °C in
    an oven. Water use efficiency was also determined for each case as the ratio between
    yield and the water amount used. Statistical analysis of the collected data was
    performed by standard analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Statistical Package
    for the Social Sciences for Windows. The irrigation treatments were run as one-way
    ANOVA. Table 5 summarizes the comparison of the two irrigation treatments. There
    was no statistically significant difference between the yields achieved by the
    two irrigation treatments. Traditional irrigation produced a slightly higher yield
    than the plant-driven irrigation, which can be explained by the excess amount
    of water provided. Dry strawberry yields were similar as were the average number
    and average weight of strawberries. On the other hand, the water use efficiency
    of the plant-driven approach was significantly better than of the traditional
    approach. Therefore the plant-driven approach with the system configuration discussed
    in this paper was successful in providing the proper amount of water for the physiological
    growth of the crop producing similar crop yield with the traditional irrigation
    system. Table 5. Crop quality indicators for the different irrigation treatments.

    Related work and discussion Over the years there has been a tremendous progress
    on the application of WSN technology in the precision agriculture domain at various
    forms. In the work of Peres et al. (2011), for example, an Intelligent Precision
    Agriculture Gateway was developed that can provide middleware services between
    on site deployed WSNs and remote locations. Data are gathered by ZigBee operated
    WSNs that feed a local database which can be then queried by authorized remote
    clients. Usability and scalability issues are in the focus of their research.
    As another example, in the work of Garcia-Sanchez et al. (2011) an integrated
    WSN-based system for crop monitoring and video surveillance was developed in a
    distributed environment using cost effective communication technology (IEEE 802.15.4).
    Energy consumption, end-end transmission delays and network synchronization are
    some of the main features that have been addressed during system design by the
    authors. Irrigation scheduling based on WSNs has been proposed by Vellidis et
    al. (2008), by Kim et al. (2008) and by Pardossi et al. (2009). Coates et al.
    (2013) have integrated a commercial WSN with valve control software and hardware
    for agriculture irrigation based on soil moisture monitoring. The design of the
    actuator hardware and the development of the actuator firmware implementing a
    custom communication protocol are discussed in detail. A stress-test of the system
    was conducted with successful results. In a similar setup, Li et al. (2011) report
    a WSAN prototype deployed in a crop field for precision irrigation. While our
    system presents some common features with systems such as the above mentioned
    (e.g., the design and deployment of a WSAN for monitoring the crop and controlling
    irrigation), our overall solution is different in concept. We propose a new proactive
    computing model by looping sensor data with actuators through an adaptive and
    able to learn decision-making layer. In addition, the use of an ontology-based
    knowledge representation scheme for the organization of concepts and definition
    of operational semantics provides system flexibility and adaptability and supports
    the application of automatic inferential and validation mechanisms. Several implementations
    of WSNs have been deployed in greenhouses focusing mainly on crop and climate
    monitoring (Ahonen et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2008, Jimenez et al., 2012). The
    common characteristic of these implementations, independently of their state-of-the-art
    approaches in communication networking or hardware and software integration or
    their theoretical foundation, is that they tend to be simple prototypes which
    lack long-term evaluation. On the other hand, implementations that integrate wireless
    sensors with actuators for automatic control of greenhouse processes are limited.
    Park and Park (2011) developed a monitoring and control prototype that uses a
    WSN deployed in a greenhouse with a goal to gather environmental and plant based
    data. The data are used by a decision support system that attempts to optimize
    the greenhouse climate in order to improve crop productivity by controlling the
    HVAC system. The application logic is encoded in a set of rules which take into
    account current sensor values and actuator states. This prototype presents common
    features with the system we have developed but also has significant limitations
    regarding the size of deployment, the accuracy of measurements (no calibration
    of the used sensors is performed), the lack of supporting tools for application
    development and the lack of an overall system evaluation. Rule-based systems for
    irrigation management have been proposed in the field of agriculture in the form
    of expert systems (Thomson and Ross, 1996, Mohan and Arumugam, 1997). Knowledge
    acquisition is a basic building block of any expert system. Knowledge acquisition
    tools have been developed to help with building and maintaining the required knowledge
    (Rafea et al., 2003). Besides managing the existing knowledge acquired from the
    domain experts and literature using a handy rule editing tool, we have demonstrated
    in this paper the use of machine learning techniques to enhance the knowledge
    base with new rules for irrigation management. Two key parameters explored in
    the proposed rule-based irrigation control system are the plant leaf temperature
    (PT) and chlorophyll fluorescence (CF). Even though experimenting with strawberries
    we have not noticed significant differences in PT and CF between the leaves of
    a plant, this may not be true for other plants and other parameters. It is well
    accepted that plant-based techniques monitoring physiological responses require
    much replication for reliable data (Jones, 2004). In our prototype, for example,
    to get a representative measurement of the plant temperature in a specific zone,
    multiple sensors are used, scattered among multiple plants. Thermistors are used
    in our case because of their low cost, easy installation and high accuracy. Other
    solutions, such as IR imaging, which can scan the canopy of several plants, provide
    alternatives that have their own advantages and shortcomings (Wang et al., 2010).
    IR imaging may not provide as much as accuracy we require at an affordable cost,
    non-leaf objects can create noise and environmental factors such as reflectance,
    heating pipes and suspended light can significantly affect the results returned.
    Frequently, a manual image processing method is required for better accuracy.
    Regarding the CF parameter, this is mainly used for the machine learning process
    and works as a proof of concept that new rules can be learned based on this parameter.
    Irrigation decisions can then be based on multiple parameters and this, in principle,
    can improve system fault tolerance in case of a sensor failure. Undoubtedly, the
    robustness of the system can be improved by replicating the CF sensor. Our modular
    architecture allows the replacement of the current CF sensor with a more affordable
    one, which can be easily replicated, whenever such a sensor is available. We argue
    in this paper that deploying a WSN in a greenhouse to monitor both plant and environmental
    parameters in a way that takes into account space variability, in order to control
    irrigation, constitutes an efficient approach. One advantage of this approach
    is that the solution can be easily scaled to include more inexpensive sensors,
    without disturbing the other system modules, and likely improving the decision-making
    process. On the downside, the WSN maintenance and the calibration of sensors are
    tasks that must be taken into account. Regarding the machine learning process
    important conclusions have been drawn. Firstly, it has been verified that applying
    machine learning strategies in precision agriculture applications is a useful
    and efficient method, although not simple, for learning rules and relationships
    automatically from diverse datasets that simplifies the often tiresome and error-prone
    process of acquiring knowledge from the gathered data. Validation of the inferred
    knowledge, however, will require an iterative approach where the situation observed
    is repeated and thus a safe conclusion can be reached. Secondly, there is a need
    of a two-way interaction between the domain expert and the domain modeler. Their
    collaboration is crucial to transform the raw data received from the sensors into
    the final datasets to be used by the machine learning algorithms. Additionally,
    new rules inferred must be validated for their relevance by the domain expert
    and checked for consistency and redundancy with the existing ones. In principle,
    part of the consistency and integrity checks could be managed automatically through
    the rule-based reasoning engine by defining special conflict detection rules.
    An upgrade of the agronomic evaluation performed would be a comparison of our
    system with modern irrigation scheduling practices based on the estimation of
    crop evapotranspiration (ETc.). Here, the main idea is to balance the amount of
    water taken away through evapotranspiration with the amount of water to be applied.
    ETc. can be calculated using various weather parameters obtained by a weather
    station, statistical data and models developed for predicting ETc. Such models
    are integrated in relevant decision support systems for the daily management of
    irrigation. A more simplified approach to calculate ETc. is by using a Class A
    evaporation pan which relates the measured evaporation to crop water use. In that
    case, an appropriate crop coefficient (Kc) must be applied to determine ETc. Accurate
    Kc values, however, depend on various site-specific parameters (e.g., soil characteristics,
    crop physiology, development stage, etc.) and are often difficult to establish.
    The additional complexity of developing an ETc.-based irrigation scheduling system
    from scratch prevented us from making such a comparison. Plant-based methods for
    irrigation scheduling do not indicate directly the amount of water to be applied
    and experimentation is required to determine control thresholds (Jones, 2004).
    Accordingly, it is not possible to use the plant temperature to stop irrigation
    due to the time lag between applying the irrigation, the permeation through the
    substrate and the subsequent uptake of the water by the plant. To alleviate this
    shortcoming, plant-based sensors are combined with soil moisture measurement sensors
    that can indicate when to stop the irrigation. Thresholds then are established
    through experimentation where irrigation treatments are tested over a range of
    sensor values to identify the best case. In such experiments the thermistors were
    used to commence the irrigation, and the soil moisture probes were used to determine
    when adequate water had been added to the substrate. After experimentation the
    average irrigation time to reach the ideal 60% of water content after the identification
    of a water stress was found to be 30 min. 4. Conclusions We have been involved
    with a facet of precision agriculture that concentrates on plant-driven crop management.
    By monitoring soil, crop and climate in a field and providing a decision support
    system that is able to learn, it is possible to deliver treatments, such as irrigation,
    to specific parts of a field in real time and proactively. We have presented in
    this paper an integrated framework consisting of hardware and software components
    as well as tools that support efficiently the development of an autonomous WSAN-based
    system for precision irrigation in greenhouses. Fertilizer and pesticide treatments
    are other examples of applications in agriculture that could benefit from such
    proactive approaches.The integration of a chlorophyll content meter sensor would
    allow system upgrading to incorporate fertigation (supply of fertilizer via the
    irrigation system). In that case the system ontology will need to be updated with
    appropriate rules to determine where/when exactly a fertilizer (e.g. nitrogen)
    is required. The availability of sensors for the detection of plant-emitted volatile
    organic compounds (VOCs) including ethylene (which signals general stress), esters
    of jasmonic acid (which signal pest attack), and esters of salicylate (which signal
    pathogen attack) would allow the issue of infection alerts and actuate a pathogen
    or pest-specific response as appropriate. By integrating to our platform electronic
    nose technology it is possible that volatile sensor arrays could detect the presence
    of specific pathogens or pests. Moving our research towards a more autonomous
    system with self-adaptation and self-learning characteristics, we have been exploring
    ways of incorporating learning capabilities in the system. Our experiments have
    shown that machine learning algorithms can be used for inducing new rules by analyzing
    logged datasets to determine accurately significant thresholds of plant-based
    parameters and for extracting new knowledge and extending the system ontology.
    To deal with the uncertainty of data, work is in progress to define a model describing
    the uncertainty aspects. Quality indicators can be specified so that the end-user
    (either an application or a person) can make judgements on the confidence level
    that the information entails. Uncertain context mechanisms such as probabilistic
    logic, fuzzy logic and Bayesian networks can be evaluated and applied accordingly.

  description: This paper presents an irrigation system that controls the water distribution
    and determines the amount of water to be provided for a given area in the farm.
    The computed amount of water was based on the data gathered from the environmental
    sensors and actuators installed in the farm. Brassica Rapa, or commonly known
    as Chinese cabbage were the crop being cultivated when the study was conducted.
    The system was composed of a microcontroller with the integration of environmental
    sensor node and actuator node; the actuator node composed of rain gauge and flow
    meter and the sensor node which was composed of temperature and humidity sensor.
    Each node serves as an IoT device. A web application presents the environmental
    parameters being monitored and the controls of each node and configuration settings
    for irrigation. It shows the maximum, minimum, current and the average readings
    for the temperature and humidity sensor. For the computation of the amount of
    water for irrigation, it was based on the Hargreaves -Samani empirical formula
    for the computation of the daily Reference Evapotranspiration, ETo.

  description: 'CONTEXT: Automated monitoring of the soil-plant-atmospheric continuum
    at a high spatiotemporal resolution is a key to transform the labor-intensive,
    experience-based decision making to an automatic, data-driven approach in agricultural
    production. Growers could make better management decisions by leveraging the real-time
    field data while researchers could utilize these data to answer key scientific
    questions. Traditionally, data collection in agricultural fields, which largely
    relies on human labor, can only generate limited numbers of data points with low
    resolution and accuracy. During the last two decades, crop monitoring has drastically
    evolved with the advancement of modern sensing technologies. Most importantly,
    the introduction of IoT (Internet of Things) into crop, soil, and microclimate
    sensing has transformed crop monitoring into a quantitative and data-driven work
    from a qualitative and experience-based task. OBJECTIVE: Ag-IoT systems enable
    a data pipeline for modern agriculture that includes data collection, transmission,
    storage, visualization, analysis, and decision-making. This review serves as a
    technical guide for Ag-IoT system design and development for crop, soil, and microclimate
    monitoring. METHODS: It highlighted Ag-IoT platforms presented in 115 academic
    publications between 2011 and 2021 worldwide. These publications were analyzed
    based on the types of sensors and actuators used, main control boards, types of
    farming, crops observed, communication technologies and protocols, power supplies,
    and energy storage used in Ag-IoT platforms. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The result
    showed that 33 variables measured by various sensors were demonstrated in these
    studies while 10 actuations were successfully integrated with Ag-IoT platforms.
    Perennial crops, which introduced less disturbance to Ag-IoT platforms than annual
    crops, were selected by 64% of researchers. Furthermore, studies in Ag-IoT system
    development were more focused on outdoor than indoor environments. Ag-IoT systems
    based on Arduino were most common among the studies while commercial platforms
    were least adopted, likely due to their inflexibility in customized developments.
    More researchers focused on agricultural applications than the IoT technology
    itself. Soil water content-based irrigation scheduling and controlled environment
    monitoring and controlling were the main applications. Other application areas
    included soil nutrient estimation, crop monitoring based on multiple vegetation
    indices, pest identification, and chemigation. SIGNIFICANCE: Several potential
    future research directions were identified at the end of the review, including
    integration of satellite-based internet connectivity to improve the IoT networks
    in non-connected farms, development of mobile IoT platforms (drones and autonomous
    ground vehicles) with continuous connectivity, and the use of edge-computing and

    communication 1. Introduction Crops are essential for human life because they
    provide food, animal feed, fuel, and raw materials for clothing and shelter. Crop
    yield has to be doubled in 2050 compared to 2009 in order to meet the demand of
    a growing population while increasing the food quality and reducing production
    inputs (Fukase and Martin, 2020). Potential solutions to enhance global food security
    include closing crop yield gaps, reducing food waste, changing dietary habits,
    and reducing inefficiencies in resource use (Foley et al., 2011). Reducing inefficiencies
    in input resources (such as water and nitrogen) can be achieved by continuously
    monitoring crops, soil, and microclimate, and then properly controlling inputs
    without sacrificing the yield and quality of the crop. Internet of Things (IoT)
    becomes a key technology that enables continuous monitoring and control in this
    scenario. The ability to generate (near) real-time quantitative data with high
    spatiotemporal resolution is a major advantage of IoT systems (Liao et al., 2017).
    IoTs are considered big data systems due to volumes, velocities, and varieties
    of data they generate. These data are mined and modeled to elucidate the relationships
    between inputs and outputs (Tsai et al., 2014). Correlation, trend analysis, classification,
    and numerical prediction are implemented on the data to reach meaningful control
    decisions. Compared with the conventional wireless sensor networks, the holistic
    approach of IoT technology allows users to incorporate data analytics on the big
    data collected by IoT sensor devices. Generally, connected actuators are enabled
    to control the inputs to achieve desired application rates. For example, an internet-connected
    soil water content (SWC) sensor network measures the plant water deficit and uploads
    data to a cloud-based data analysis platform. The analysis will find the trend
    of soil water deficit to determine the best time and quantity to apply irrigation
    water. There has been a boom in IoT application development in agriculture (Ag-IoT)
    in the last two decades, particularly around crop, soil, and microclimate monitoring.
    However, the application of Ag-IoT at the commercial scale is still at its early
    stages. A deeper and more holistic understanding of the existing IoT system development
    is important for various stakeholders to sketch the future landscape of Ag-IoT.
    Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to review the key components of
    Ag-IoT including sensors, actuators, data processing, and data transmission, summarize
    its usage in crop, soil, and microclimate monitoring, and identify the research
    needs for successful IoT implementation in the future. Though Ag-IoT is proliferating
    in both crop and animal monitoring and management, Ag-IoT for crop production
    is the focus of this paper. IoT platforms for livestock production, as well as
    other sectors of agriculture (such as postharvest) are not included. IoT can be
    found in the manufacturing industry, consumers products, retail, finance and marketing,
    healthcare, transportation and logistics, smart city, military applications and
    supply chains (Islam et al., 2022). Fig. 1 shows the three main layers of a generic
    IoT architecture: the perception layer, network layer, and application layer (Jabraeil
    Jamali et al., 2020). The perception layer consists of gateways, mobile devices,
    sensors, actuators, power, and energy storage components. Activities in the perception
    layer include sensing, controlling, actuation, energy harvesting, energy storage,
    data transmission, and power management. The perception layer of the Ag-IoT faces
    challenges including harsh environmental conditions, heterogeneity of the applications,
    nonavailability of communication infrastructure, and lack of continuous power
    supplies, to just mention a few. This review therefore emphasizes the perception
    layer of Ag-IoT. The network layer consists of network devices and data transmission
    and processing functions. The application layer is responsible for user-specific
    applications such as data visualization, actuator control dashboards, as well
    as data storage, analysis, and decision making. This three-layer architecture
    of IoT can be expanded to five layers by including transport layer after network
    layer and adding business layer after the application layer (Banu, 2018). The
    transport layer is responsible for data transmission while the business layer
    manages the whole IoT system according to the user''s business model. Download

    Three- and five-layer architectures of generic IoT systems. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows. The method of the literature review is presented in Section
    two. Section three details the major elements of Ag-IoT technology. Section four
    describes the challenges that Ag-IoT systems face with emerging solutions. In
    Section five, supporting technologies for Ag-IoT are discussed. How the information
    from Ag-IoT can benefit farm systems analysis and management is discussed in Section
    six. The final section concludes the review article with future research directions.
    2. Review methodology We have come up with a list of eleven research questions
    to guide the literature review and analysis in Ag-IoT. These questions, along
    with the motivation to ask these questions and our initial hypotheses, are listed

    Ag-IoT systems are more popular with perennial crops To find the answers to questions
    in Table 1, a thorough literature review was conducted. The main approach was
    to find the answers based on the recent research carried out in the field of Ag-IoT.
    We have searched for the recent Ag-IoT research published in scientific journals
    and conference proceedings between 2011 and 2021, using keywords through Google
    Scholar and Scopus web search. Keywords used in the search were Internet of Things,
    IoT, Crop Monitoring, Wireless Sensor Network, Smart Agriculture, and Crop Sensing.
    This search resulted in 200 peer-reviewed journal articles and conference proceedings
    papers. After reading the abstracts, 115 papers were determined to be relevant
    to the topic of Ag-IoT. The selected articles are listed in the Appendix, and
    they were used for in-depth analysis. Research papers selected covered countries
    in all six continents (except for Antarctica, Fig. 2a). Asia presented the largest
    number of papers (Scotford and Miller, 2004), whereas Australia had the smallest
    number of papers. In terms of countries, India (Coleman et al., 2022) and China
    (Chen et al., 2014) had the highest numbers of research outcomes. Fig. 2b presented
    the yearly distribution of the research papers. The number of research papers
    published related to the topic increased over time, with the highest in 2019.
    Demographics of the collected data set provided the answer to question 1 in Table
    1, that Ag-IoT has received global attention. More Ag-IoT research has been completed
    in countries with smallholder farmers such as India and China. The selected papers
    were read carefully and analyzed for the technical specification of the IoT systems,
    including the sensors and actuators in each study, communication technologies
    used, environment the system implemented, and the IoT service provider used. Download

    In Section 3, we have thoroughly reviewed the major components of Ag-IoT. To conduct
    this review systematically, we have divided this section into multiple subsections.
    These subsections are sensors, IoT platforms/main control board, wireless communication
    technology, IoT protocols, cloud platforms, power and energy management, and actuators.
    3.1. Sensors Sensors play a major role in Ag-IoT systems because they serve as
    the converter between real-world signals and their digital representations. This
    section begins with an introduction and categorization of sensors used to measure
    crop, soil, and microclimate parameters. General purpose sensors such as temperature
    sensor, light intensity sensor, accelerometers, soil moisture sensor, etc., can
    be integrated into Ag-IoT systems (White, 1987). Table 2 gives sensor categories
    along with sensor measurands and provides some examples found in the literature.

    et al., 2017) Proper selection of sensors to an application is essential for IoT
    systems developers as well as for users to best use the sensors. The advancement
    of sensor technologies has a major impact on the popularity of IoT. Low energy
    consumption, compatibility in data transmission between the microcontroller and
    the sensor, accuracy, repeatability, sensitivity, and robustness are major considerations
    to select a sensor for IoT system development. To address research question 2
    in Table 1, we marked and counted the sensors in the 115 research papers reviewed,
    with the total count of each sensor given in Fig. 3. Soil moisture sensors were
    used for the largest number of applications (Ivanova et al., 2016) followed by
    humidity sensors (Hurst et al., 2021) and then air temperature sensors (Haque
    et al., 2021). The reason these sensors were integrated most in Ag-IoT so far
    is likely because of the need for continuous in-situ soil moisture monitoring
    for decision making in irrigated agricultural production. Water scarcity is a
    global issue, and the amount of arable land can be expanded significantly if growers
    can apply water efficiently (Aroca et al., 2018). On the contrary, soil water
    tension measured via soil water potential sensors only appeared in three papers.
    This lower interest in soil water potential sensors is likely due to (1) less
    understanding of the relationship between soil water tension and crop growth,
    (2) less availability of low-cost soil water potential sensors, and (3) the difficulty
    in interfacing the available soil water potential sensors to the IoT platforms.
    Next, we will discuss the Ag-IoT sensors found in the literature according to
    the measurand category it belongs to. Download : Download high-res image (192KB)

    research papers and their frequency. 3.1.1. Acoustic sensors Ultrasound distance
    measurement sensors and microphones are the most common acoustic property measuring
    sensors. Direct use of acoustic measurements is limited in Ag-IoT. Hardwood borer
    identification IoT sensor network is a direct application of microphone used in
    pest detection in forestry (Potamitis et al., 2019). Ultrasonic wind speed and
    direction sensor is an important meteorological sensor used in agriculture to
    estimate evapotranspiration (Kameoka et al., 2017). Compared with the mechanical
    anemometer, an ultrasonic anemometer requires less maintenance due to fewer mechanical
    parts involved. Furthermore, an ultrasonic anemometer can capture sudden changes
    in wind speed and direction very accurately. Acoustic sensors were used indirectly
    to measure biological measurands. Crop canopy height estimation by ultrasound
    sensor is an indirect approach to measure biological parameters (Yuan et al.,
    2018; Elci et al., 2018). IoT-enabled ultrasound distance sensors are widely used
    in irrigation systems to estimate the water volume in tanks, wells and reservoirs,
    and it is an essential sensor for irrigation scheduling in automated irrigation
    systems. Recently ultrasound flow meters replaced the mechanical flow meters due
    to their high accuracy in flow rate measurement with less maintenance. Underwater
    ultrasound scanning is possible for aquatic plant growth monitoring purposes such
    as lotas and seaweed and has a huge potential to determine the harvest stage and
    growth rate monitoring (Kool and Bernard, 2019). Fruit ripeness estimation is
    an interesting example of the indirect use of acoustics in agriculture. Daosawang
    et al. (2020) demonstrated that watermelon ripeness could be estimated by a sound
    generator and receiver. In summary, acoustic sensors advanced in recent years
    while replacing some traditional mechanical Ag-sensors and introducing new applications
    in agriculture. 3.1.2. Biological sensors Above-ground biomass of plant, plant
    height, plant density, leaf angle, leaf area index (LAI), count of plant organs
    (leaf, fruit, flower), chlorophyll concentration, sap flow, and stomata conductance
    are useful biological parameters in crop monitoring. Crop yield and the growth
    stage can be estimated from the plant''s mass (biomass). Loadcells are used in
    indoor farming pots to measure the plant weight directly (Long and McCallum, 2015).
    Almost all the field crop biomass estimations have been measured by indirect sensing
    techniques such as biomass-sensitive vegetation indices (VI) or by image processing-based
    techniques. However, both techniques require time-consuming ground truth data
    collection for model calibration. The accuracy of these techniques is subject
    to lighting conditions, sensor type, crop type, model parameters, and training
    data set. Just like crop biomass, many other biological measurands are also estimated
    indirectly. For example, stomata conductance can be quantified through optical
    measurands, and plant height through acoustic sensors. Therefore, most of the
    biological measurands will be discussed as indirect applications under other measurands.
    3.1.3. Chemical sensors Chemical sensors can be categorized into two main types:
    photochemical and electrochemical. Photochemical sensors measure chemical reactions
    or chemicals by their spectral signature, and electrochemical sensors measure
    the electrical properties due to chemical reactions or the presence of chemicals
    (Angkawinitwong and Williams, 2021). Soil pH, soil salinity, soil nutrients, oxygen
    (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), pH and conductivity of irrigation water,
    and photosynthesis are the parameters that often measured by chemical sensors.
    Knowing the pH of water and soil is important because pH affects the solubility
    of nutrients and therefore plant nutrient uptake and growth. Soil and irrigation
    water pH measurements with IoT-enabled sensors were demonstrated in the literature
    in nine studies. Spatial variability and the dependency of sensor accuracy on
    soil condition are the issues to address to promote them in agriculture (Chen
    et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020). The soil salinity sensor and custom-made nitrate
    sensor were counted only once, which highlighted the difficulty of measuring soil
    chemical properties continuously and in a non-destructive manner. The measurement
    of the real-time nutrient content in the soil, especially nitrogen (N), phosphorus
    (P), and potassium (K) are essential for fertigation. These sensors are still
    at the rudimentary stage (Burton et al., 2018) of development. Real-time soil
    nutrient sensing has a huge potential in future agriculture as nutrient leaching
    and groundwater pollution are serious issues people are facing now. Nitrate sensors
    can be fixed to groundwater pumps to monitor the nitrate status of groundwater,
    or installed in leaching water collectors in fields to get reasonable estimation
    about nitrate leaching (Hooper et al., 2019). Soil salinity can be derived from
    the soil''s electrical conductivity (EC), and it was demonstrated three times
    in the literature. This is a very important parameter to measure as soil salinity
    is one of the main soil degrading factors in irrigated agriculture. None of the
    research in the literature highlighted the importance of using EC sensors in soil
    or irrigation systems to ameliorate the soil salinity build-up due to irrigation.
    CO2 and CH4 are greenhouse gases attributed to climate change and agriculture
    is considered a major source of their emission. Accounting for the sourcing and
    sinking of CO2 and CH4 from soil and crops is important to understand the budget
    of greenhouse gases in agriculture. Research suggested that elevation of CO2 can
    increase crop yield as well as improve water use efficiency (Hatfield et al.,
    2011). Therefore, it is essential to measure CO2 and CH4. There are two types
    of gas sensors available. Metal oxide gas sensors increase the electric resistance
    of the sensor when it contacts certain gas. Optical gas sensors measure the absorption
    spectra to detect spectral signatures unique to the gas. O2 sensors can be used
    to monitor the crop respiration rate. Electrochemical sensors can be used to estimate
    dissolved oxygen as the increased dissolved oxygen in water can improve the quality
    and the yield of the aquatic plants (Shi et al., 2018; Ouyang et al., 2020). Another
    interesting parameter to measure is stomatal conductance. Plant stomatal openings
    regulate the exchange of water vapor and CO2 between a leaf and the surrounding
    atmosphere. So far, no IoT-enabled sensor has been developed to measure this parameter
    even though handheld sensors are available (Lamour et al., 2022). Chemical sensors
    can be used to monitor the quality of fruits during harvesting. As an example,
    IoT-enabled Ethelene gas sensors have a huge potential to use in fruit production
    to identify the best time to initiate harvesting (Esser et al., 2012). Although
    chemical sensors improved rapidly in the past decade, applications developed based
    on them in agriculture are still at an early stage. More research is needed to
    incorporate these sensors with Ag-IoT. 3.1.4. Electric sensors Electric sensors
    play a key role in Ag-IoT as they have been used in many industries for a long
    period. The main principle is to measure the change of electrical properties due
    to physical or chemical changes in plants, soil, and the environment. Some electrical
    parameters are charge, current, potential difference, electric field, resistance
    (or conductance), capacitance, and inductance. Soil moisture sensors via IoT systems
    were the most tested sensor in the literature. As most of the agricultural lands
    face water shortages and climate change has heavily affected the water availability,
    most of the studies attempted to address this requirement. We found that electrical
    resistance, capacitance, and permittivity of bulk soils were used to estimate
    soil volumetric water content (VWC). Furthermore, soil water tension was measured
    by the electrical resistance of gypsum blocks. For better irrigation scheduling,
    both VWC and soil water tension are important: VWC quantifies the amount of water
    in the soil whereas soil water tension is a better indicator of how difficult
    plant roots can extract water from the soil matrix. Air temperature and humidity
    sensors are the other two dominant sensors researchers have tested. There are
    three types of humidity sensors: capacitive, resistive, and thermal. Crop ET and
    pest or disease forecasting are the potential applications of the air temperature
    and humidity sensing requirements. But 90% of the research just demonstrated the
    capability of plug play these sensors; only 10% of IoT researchers demonstrate
    the capability of using those sensors for a meaningful task like disease forecasting.
    Humidity is an important environmental parameter directly related to ET calculation,
    crop quality, and pest growth forecasting. Sensors can be deployed to measure
    absolute, relative, and specific humidity. For example, the best time to start
    grain harvesting is highly dependent on grain moisture content and if harvested
    without considering the optimal moisture level it may cause extensive post-harvesting
    damage and economic loss (Zoerb et al., 1993). IoT-based ET modeling and irrigation
    scheduling enable low water usage and low irrigation energy consumption. IoT also
    opened the path for non-conventional VWC measurement. Aroca et al. (2018) presented
    the use of RFID to estimate VWC with a received signal strength of the tag with
    R2 > 0.9. A rain sensor based on the electrical conductivity principle was demonstrated
    as an IoT sensor that could detect the start and end of the rain (Andrey Rivas-Sánchez
    et al., 2019). Based on these literature outcomes it can be concluded that electric
    sensors are mature compared to acoustic and chemical sensors and have been used
    in the industry for a long time and have a wide range of applications in Ag-IoT.
    3.1.5. Mechanical sensors Mechanical sensors convert a physical parameter of interest
    through a mechanical system to an electrical signal. Parameters such as flow rate,
    acceleration, velocity, direction, orientation, and pressure can be measured by
    mechanical sensors. Examples of IoT-enabled mechanical sensors found in the literature
    include rain gauges, mechanical flow meters, air and liquid pressure meters, and
    anemometers. Rain gauge is important to capture the precipitation accurately to
    determine the timing and quantity of irrigation when combined with soil water
    content sensors and evapotranspiration modeling (Kameoka et al., 2017). Tipping
    bucket rain sensor converts water volume it captures to an electrical signal through
    a simple mechanism. Measuring pressure is important for air, liquid, and soil
    pressure calculation. Air pressure is relevant to measure crop transpiration as
    the opening and closing of plant stomata are partially regulated by vapor pressure
    deficit. Soil compaction can be measured by the pressure sensors inserted into
    the soil, which are useful for measuring the impact of heavy agricultural machinery.
    Irrigation line pressure sensors are critical to monitor the irrigation process
    as the wetting pattern of irrigation systems highly depends on the irrigation
    line pressure. High pressure causes loss of irrigation energy while low pressure
    does not allow maximum irrigation area through sprinklers. Anemometers can be
    used to measure the wind speed which is required for calculating ET and detecting
    high-speed wind that could be hazardous to plants. Gas and liquid flow rate are
    significant parameters for crop, soil, and environmental monitoring. Conventionally
    crop and soil inputs in the liquid or gaseous form, such as water input (including
    rain), leaching water, liquid fertilizer, liquid or gaseous insecticides, are
    measured using flow sensors. Some cash crops or niche crops such as wasabi (Sultana
    and Savage, 1970) and lettuce (Sultana and Savage, 1970) need highly precise environmental
    conditions and flow monitoring sensors are important for meeting those conditions
    in the future if climate change imposes challenges to grow them. Overall mechanical
    sensors play a key role in Ag-IoT systems, but most of the mechanical sensors
    are replaced by non-mechanical sensors due to the fact mechanical sensors need
    frequent maintenance and have long response time. 3.1.6. Optical sensors Optical
    measurands play a key role in modern agriculture. There should be a light source
    and an optical sensor to take the measurements. Ultraviolet (UV), visible, and
    near infrared (NIR) are the main wavelength regions where optical sensors are
    operated. It is important to note that optical sensors appear to have the least
    applications as IoT sensors according to the literature. Typical RGB images were
    used to derive RGB image-based vegetation indexes while multispectral sensors
    were used to derive vegetation indexes such as NDVI and NDRE (red-edge NDVI).
    Most of the optical sensors that generate spectral signatures or images of the
    target produce larger volumes of data and consume a higher amount of power compared
    to other sensors in Fig. 3. This appears to be a significant discouraging factor
    to incorporate these sensors into IoT. Naturally, signals in the visible region
    were used as indicators for many crops and environmental parameters such as maturation
    time, crop quality (Long and McCallum, 2015), crop nutrient requirement, pest
    pressure, as well as water and nutrient level in the soil. Historically people
    used their eyes (only responsive to the visible lights) to evaluate the color
    intensities somewhat qualitatively (e.g., comparing those to standard color cards).
    The introduction of these sensors has significantly improved optical measurements
    of crop and environmental parameters by (Akyildiz et al., 2009) enabling quantitative
    assessments and (Alderfasi and Nielsen, 2001) extending the spectral regions from
    visible only to UV and NIR. Fruit spectral signature was used to identify defects
    in the fruit that could not be revealed via visible light. NDVI and NDRE were
    used to quantitatively determine crop density as well as the nitrogen and water
    requirements (Scotford and Miller, 2004). We would like to highlight that more
    research is needed to demonstrate the optical measurand use in Ag-IoT as they
    can be used in a wide range of applications in agriculture. 3.1.7. Thermal sensors
    Thermal measurands have a wide range of applications in Ag-IoT, and most of them
    are measured indirectly with optical and electrical means; for instance, measuring
    crop canopy temperature with infrared radiometers. In the literature, the frequent
    use of air and soil temperature sensors highlighted their importance in crop ET
    modeling and disease forecasting (Symeonaki et al., 2020). These sensors are cheap
    and readily available as off-the-shelf items and support a wide variety of IoT
    platforms (Mohanraj et al., 2016). Thermal parameters have the potential to indirectly
    measure biological measurands. One such example is the sap flow sensor, which
    was described in one study as a transpiration measuring sensor compatible with
    the IoT system (Villalba et al., 2017). The sensor consisted of a flexible tree
    stem heater and a temperature sensor while the IoT platform calculated sap flow
    based on the applied heat and temperature. This sap flow measurement is proportional
    to transpiration (sap movement in the xylem) and therefore useful in crop ET modeling
    (Villalba et al., 2017). Sap flow monitoring is essential in some crops to understand
    the physiological behavior of plants. Rubber, maple, coconut, and palmyra palm
    sap are the output of the harvest, and in these cases, sap flow monitoring is
    useful to estimate yield, optimize production, and develop high-yielding crop
    varieties. Indirectly measured canopy temperature through infrared radiometers
    estimates the transpiration rate and crop water stress index, which is important
    for water stress detection and irrigation scheduling (Alderfasi and Nielsen, 2001).
    Identification of pests such as wild boar through thermal measurement is an interesting
    application in agriculture. Furthermore, the temperature is found to affect the
    quality of grapefruits (sugar content) and flowering time of several crops (Pérez-Expósito
    et al., 2017). Temperature sensors can also record the temperature variation in
    plant leaves and flowering buds and give a warning about frosting time (Barker
    et al., 2017). This listing of thermal measurand applications concluded that thermal
    sensors are very important in Ag-IoT and have been demonstrated in the past literature.
    3.2. Sensing platforms and main control board Section 3.2 summarizes the statistics
    of the Ag-IoT sensing platforms and control boards in the literature. The answer
    for Question 3 in Table 1 was derived from Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res
    image (196KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Main control boards
    of the Ag-IoT systems present in the reviewed papers. 3.2.1. Sensing platforms
    Sensing platforms consist of sensor node including sensors, power supply, energy
    storage, actuators, main control board or the data processing unit, and structural
    components. Structural components determine the sensor node establishment in the
    field. There are two main types of IoT platforms available for crop monitoring.
    Stationery IoT platforms can collect continuous crop data or telemetry data targeting
    a single plant or a group (plot) of plants. The main advantage of stationery IoT
    is the high temporal resolution of the data. Mobile IoT platforms can collect
    data over some areal coverage and with high spatial resolution, but with limited
    temporal resolution. Kumar et al. (2016) presented the development and testing
    of a crop monitoring mobile robot. It is capable of automatically planning the
    path to find crops, recognizing plants using neural networks, applying fertilizer
    timely, and applying water based on the feedback from soil moisture sensors, temperature
    sensors, and humidity sensors. 3.2.2. Main control boards The communication and
    data processing hardware for IoT systems reported in the reviewed papers could
    be broadly categorized into three kinds: commercial platforms, custom build, and
    DIY (do-it-yourself) development boards. The commercial platforms are reliable
    but have limited support for integrating different or additional sensors. IPex12
    (Odin Solutions SL, Peru), Particle Electron (Particle Industries, Inc., USA),
    MICAZ (MICAS AG, Germany), IRIS (IRIS IoT Solutions, UK), and Telosb (Advantic
    Sistemas y Servicios S.L., Spain) are commercial IoT systems. In the last decade,
    commercial IoT platforms were still at their development stage, explaining their
    lower use in the reviewed papers. Custom build hardware is designed by researchers
    based on their own requirements. Researchers have the flexibility to decide on
    the number and types of sensors, interfacing connections, microprocessor clock
    speed, IoT node memory capacity, input voltage, and the communication technology
    used in the node. Furthermore, the technical complexities present in developing
    customized sensor interfacing may also discourage researchers from using commercial
    systems. The custom build hardware platforms have high levels of customization
    but require extensive knowledge of embedded system development to design them.
    DIY platforms are IoT nodes designed based on commercially available development
    platforms, including Arduino, EasyPIC v7, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, and Wapmote. DIY
    development board based IoT systems are popular among researchers because of their
    low cost, high availability, compatibility, and easy programmability. The percentage
    of different hardware platforms used in the reviewed articles is given in Fig.
    4. There were 52 identifiable hardware designs in the list of 115 research. Out
    of them, 29% of the platforms had Arduino only, 8% had Arduino and Raspberry Pi
    hardware jointly, and 2% used Arduino and Arducam hardware together. Ag-IoT research
    was dominated by Arduino-based development systems. Availability, reliability,
    easy programmability, and the option of supporting multiple communication protocols
    made Arduino-based systems popular among Ag-IoT researchers. Raspberry Pi systems
    were demonstrated in 12% of the IoT systems, likely due to their capability of
    capturing images and high computing power compared to Arduino. Selection of the
    IoT platform and the main control board is an important activity in IoT system
    design. The mainboard must support the communication protocols and the power requirement
    (e.g., voltage) of the sensors and actuators. Often voltage and communications
    protocol converters are needed to interface sensors with the main control board.
    Mainboards support three types of digital memories. Volatile memory holds the
    instructions and data of the currently running program until the power is on.
    Volatile memory influences the system''s performance. A larger volatile memory
    is needed for IoT nodes with a large amount of data generated via sensors like
    RGB cameras or spectral sensors. Nonvolatile memory stores data and the program
    when the IoT node power is turned off. The operating system, device identification
    data, and system settings are common data types stored in the nonvolatile memory.
    External nonvolatile memory (e.g., SD cards) can be used to store data or system
    settings, greatly expanding the data storage capability of the Ag-IoT system.
    3.3. Communication technologies and IoT protocols Section 3.3 produces the answers
    to research questions 4 and 5 in Table 1 while discussing findings on the literature
    related to wireless communication technology and IoT protocols. 3.3.1. Wireless
    communication technology Wireless data transmission is a key function of an IoT
    system. To design a successful Ag-IoT system, it is essential to understand the
    radio frequency (RF) contributing factors that impact signal strength, interference,
    system model, bandwidth, and transmission range. Also, understanding of pros and
    cons of wireless communication technologies is essential for a better Ag-IoT device
    selection. Received power (Pr) of wireless data transmission in an unobstructed
    line of sight in a radio signal-free area depends on the transmitter power (Pt),
    transmitter and receiver antenna gains (GTX, GRX), the distance between the transmitter
    and the receiver (R), and the wavelength (λ) of the radio. This relationship is
    expressed in Eq. 1. Therefore, long wavelength radio signals such as LoRa in 900
    MHz are suitable for long-distance data transmission compared to short wavelength
    signals such as Wi-Fi operated in 2.4–3.2 GHz without changing other variables.
    For long-distance communication, the plane earth loss formula is used to account
    for the curvature of Earth for signal strength (Nadir et al., 2008). Equation
    1 Friis transmission equation (Shaw, 2013). Furthermore, radio signals are subject
    to reflection, diffraction, and scattering. These phenomena are illustrated in
    Fig. 5. In open flat agricultural fields, reflection, scattering, and diffraction
    may not occur unless there are large agricultural structures. In hilly areas and
    forests, the effects of wireless signal propagation properties may need special
    attention when placing IoT devices. The Fresnel Zone is the area around the visual
    line-of-sight that radio waves propagate out once they leave the antenna. Blockage
    of Fresnel Zone >40% causes severe signal losses (Tate et al., 2008). Therefore,
    factors such as the height and density of the crop canopies nearby, the presence
    of agricultural structures (e.g., irrigation pivots and storage silos), the locations
    to place IoT nodes, and the antenna height and position are important to account
    for in ensuring the signal transmission quality. In fact, the research on wireless
    communications in rural and agricultural landscapes has raised a lot of interest
    recently (Vuran et al., 2022). The signal quality is also affected by channel
    noise, interference, multipath fading, and attenuation. The success of data transmission
    is measured by a parameter called bit rate error (BRE). Based on the above discussion
    we would like to suggest that it is important to use wireless signal strength
    mapping tools during IoT system installations. Such tools will help to select
    the optimum IoT communication technology (for example, Wi-Fi, LoRa, Mobile Communication)
    suitable for each case, accounting for data transmission rates and signal losses.
    This practice would help farmers to reduce the capital and operational costs involved
    with IoT systems. Download : Download high-res image (63KB) Download : Download

    In the literature, we found that a wide variety of wireless communication technologies
    were used by the researchers. Out of the 35 studies where communication technology
    was clearly mentioned, 34% used Wi-Fi, 17% were conducted using LoRa, and 14%
    used Zigbee. Also 11% of the studies used ethernet or the wired internet connection.
    Less attention was received for mobile communication technologies such as 4G (3%),
    NB-IoT (3%), and GSM (3%). In some cases, researchers used two or more technologies
    to connect different areas in the fields such as LoRa / Wi-Fi, LoRa / TV white
    space (TVWS), and GSM / Zigbee. According to the findings, Wi-Fi and ethernet
    were common in greenhouses while others were favored in outdoor farming practices.

    IoT protocols are data transmission standards that allow communication between
    the endpoint and services with the internet being the common network. IoT protocols
    are broadly classified into two major groups: IoT data protocols and IoT network
    protocols. The data protocols correspond to the application layer whereas network
    protocols correspond to the perception and network layer in the standard IoT architecture
    (Fig. 1). IoT network protocols create networks of device connections. Wi-Fi,
    LoRaWAN, Zigbee, and Bluetooth are such network protocols, and the same term is
    used to represent wireless communication technology. Some common IoT protocols
    are listed in Table 3 with specifications such as frequency, data rate, and range

    IoT network protocol/wireless communication technology has its advantages (Table
    3). Bluetooth is a popular short-range wireless communication technology standard
    convenient to create personal area networks. It is possible to use Bluetooth in
    indoor applications such as mobile phone-connected soil water sensors and sensor
    networking in small greenhouses. ZigBee is useful in large indoor growing spaces
    and LoRa is suitable for field crop monitoring senor networks. Cellular technology
    is useful for indoor or outdoor spaces where the network coverage is available.
    Wi-Fi is suitable for both small or large indoor spaces as well as outdoor applications
    where there is infrastructure support available to setup Wi-Fi gateways. Cellular
    and Wi-Fi allow transmitting images, videos, and other larger data files such
    as 3D point cloud data. Bluetooth shares the same advantage but is limited to
    a short distance. Compared to LoRa, Zigbee, and cellular technology, Wi-Fi has
    high reliability in data transmission, but power consumption is high too. All
    these protocols were tested in real crop growing environments (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016; Codeluppi et al., 2020). 3.4. Cloud platforms and service models
    3.4.1. Cloud platforms Cloud is an essential part of any IoT system. IoT devices
    are not useful without cloud connectivity. Data gathered via individual IoT sensors
    become useful when connected with other relevant sensors. According to the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology, “Cloud computing is a model for enabling
    ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable
    computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services)
    that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or
    service provider interaction” (Mell and Grance, 2011). Essential expected characteristics
    of a cloud system are on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling,
    rapid elasticity, and measured service. Out of the 115 papers we reviewed, only
    25 papers discussed cloud platforms in detail. Among them, 28% of the researchers
    used the ThingSpeak cloud platform developed by MATLAB as the service provider,
    12% used Microsoft Azure, and 12% used Ubidots platform. Furthermore, 12% of the
    researchers built themselves a local data server with the required functionality.
    Google-based Firebase had 8% usage. Other cloud platform service providers including
    Amazon Web Services, cloud sense, generic cloud, sensorDB, SEnviro, and Huawei
    Cloud had 4% use each. The percentage distribution of these cloud platforms is
    given in Fig. 7. Download : Download high-res image (185KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 7. Statistics of cloud service provider selection. 3.4.2.
    Public, private, and hybrid cloud In terms of privacy policies, cloud platforms
    can be divided into three major models: 3.4.2.1. Public cloud Services are offered
    over the public internet and available to anyone who needs to purchase them. Third-party
    cloud service providers own and operate the cloud resources such as servers and
    storage in the public cloud model. Users do not need to spend any capital expenditures
    to scale up; applications can be quickly provisioned and terminated; and users
    pay only for what they use. These are the advantages of the public cloud. Amazon
    Web Services and Microsoft Azure are examples of public cloud services. 3.4.2.2.
    Private cloud A private cloud comprises computing resources used exclusively by
    users from one business or organization therefore hardware must be purchased for
    start-up and maintenance is required. In the private cloud model, infrastructure
    is not shared with users outside the organization. A private cloud can be physically
    placed at a data center owned by the user organization, or it can be hosted by
    a third-party service provider. But the organization has complete control over
    resources and security. 3.4.2.3. Hybrid cloud A hybrid cloud is a computing environment
    that combines a public and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to
    be shared between them. The organizations determine where to run their applications
    while they control security, compliance, or legal requirements. Some organizations
    use a hybrid cloud model to keep sensitive data in the private cloud whereas frontal
    services and web portals are serviced in the public cloud for scalability. Furthermore,
    the public cloud can act as a supporting system if the data and usage exceeds
    the capacity of the private cloud. 3.4.3. Cloud service model Cloud-based services
    provided to the users can be categorized into three major classes based on the
    hierarchy of the service offered. Typical cloud architecture has nine layers.
    They are from bottom to top in order: network, storage, server, virtualization,
    operating system, middleware, runtime, data, and applications. The next section
    will explain cloud service models in detail with hardware and software layers
    they belong. 3.4.3.1. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) IaaS was the original
    cloud services model. For IaaS, the cloud service provider will provide the hardware
    and keep it up to date, but operating system maintenance and network configuration
    are up to the client. For example, Azure virtual machines are fully operational
    in Microsoft datacenters. The main advantage of the IaaS model is the rapid deployment
    of new computing devices. DigitalOcean, Linode, Rackspace, Amazon Web Services
    (AWS), Cisco Metapod, Google Compute Engine (GCE), and Microsoft Azure are some
    examples of IaaS. 3.4.3.2. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) In this cloud service
    model, the cloud provider manages the virtual machines and networking resources,
    and the cloud tenant deploys their applications into the managed hosting environment.
    For example, Azure App Services provides a managed hosting environment where developers
    can upload their web applications, without having to worry about the physical
    hardware and software requirements. 3.4.3.3. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) In the
    case of SaaS, the cloud provider manages all aspects of the application environment,
    such as virtual machines, networking resources, data storage, and applications.
    The cloud tenant only needs to provide their data to the application managed by
    the cloud provider. For example, Microsoft Office 365 provides a fully working
    version of Microsoft Office that runs in the cloud. 3.4.3.4. Network-as-a-Service
    (NaaS) Software-defined networking and software-defined perimeters are services
    that belonged to NaaS. NaaS is a cloud model that enables organizations to easily
    operate the network and achieve the outcomes they expect without owning, building,
    or maintaining their infrastructure through the cloud. NaaS can replace hardware-centric
    VPNs, load balancers, firewall appliances, and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
    connections. Users can scale up and scale down as demand changes, rapidly deploy
    services, and eliminate hardware costs. 3.4.4. Fog and edge computing Edge computing
    is the moving of data processing close to where the data is generated. Wireless
    communication-enabled sensors with microcontrollers can be considered edge computing
    devices. The introduction of the edge computing paradigm was due to issues related
    to centralized cloud computing architecture. Data and control signal transmission
    latency and delays in centralized system data analytics are some disadvantages
    of cloud computing. Therefore, network designers proposed architectures where
    the computing power is distributed more evenly around the network. Fog and edge
    computing push the processing capability out to the edge of the network, closer
    to the source of the data. Such techniques are called fog computing and edge computing.
    Fog computing is a computing layer between the cloud and the edge where edge devices
    send large amounts of data to the cloud. The fog computing layer can get the data
    from the edge layer before it reaches the cloud and filter what is relevant and
    what is not. The filtered data gets stored in the cloud, while the unrelated data
    can be deleted, or analyzed at the fog layer for remote access or to use in localized
    learning models. Precision herbicide applications become popular with field crops.
    There, a moving platform that has a camera, carries and applies the herbicide
    at the exact location of the emerging weed. The image processing hardware and
    software in the moving platform do the image processing instantaneously to reduce
    the delay of cloud-based image processing in larger fields (Coleman et al., 2022).
    The centralized cloud-only needs the weed density from the moving IoT platform
    to forecast the future herbicide need to maintain the required quantity in the
    stocks. Therefore, edge computing is all about placing computing power on the
    very edge of the network, on the actual sensors of the device. Low power consumption
    and low processing power microchips or micro-controllers embedded in the devices
    provide the power for edge computing. For that reason, their processing capacity
    is much more limited but sometimes can be adequate to process images (Chamara
    et al., 2021). 3.4.5. Data analytics in IoT Data analytics is one of the most
    important activities in any IoT system, as the decision-making of an IoT system
    depends on hundreds of sensors and events, which is difficult to analyze manually.
    Data generated by IoT devices fall under three categories. They are structured
    data (such as SQL storage), unstructured data (e.g., images and videos), and semi-structured
    data (like social media feeds). Ag-IoT systems can generate both structured and
    unstructured data (Lea, 2020). Stream processing and batch processing are the
    two main types of data processing techniques. Stream processing is useful for
    mobile Ag-IoT platforms since it allows real-time data processing. Batch processing
    can be applied in irrigation, chemigation, and fertigation applications as data
    are processed as a batch to make the decision. Common data analytics activities
    for IoT platforms are listed in Table 4. Below are some examples how they are
    used in Ag-IoT for crop, soil, and microclimate monitoring. Alerting allows growers
    to receive an alert message when soil water use exceeds the maximum allowable
    depletion (Gamon et al., 2015). Sensors in the field environment are susceptible
    to problems like physical damage, pest attack, misalignment, and breakdown, which
    cause errors in data streams. These problems can be effectively alleviated by
    error finding. Using time-series Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI)
    or Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) to determine the next irrigation or fertigation
    time belongs to trend analysis. Triggering sprinklers in a field based on SWC
    sensor values is an example of signaling. More complex decisions can be formed
    by combining several analytical activities. For example, in automated crop disease
    detection, an average daily temperature above 20 to 25 °C followed by 1–2 in.
    of rain, together with sugar beet leaf color change indicated a sugar beet pathogen
    outbreak (Wolf and Verreet, 2002). This analysis was enabled by data joining,
    tracking, and trend analysis. Table 4. Data analysis activities commonly found
    in Ag-IoT applications. Data analysis activity Function Preprocessing Filter out
    data with little interest to reduce data complexity and duplication Alerting Raise
    an alert if data exceed certain boundary condition Windowing Apply rules on data
    in a predefined time window Joining Combine multiple data streams into a new single
    data stream Error finding Find missing values and anomalies in data streams Tracking
    Identify when or where an event has occurred Trend analysis Quantify change or
    trend of data as a function of time Signaling Send control signal when a decision
    is made 3.5. Power and energy management Power and energy storage are the two
    major driving forces for IoT systems, especially for Ag-IoT located in remote
    fields. In the literature, we found 3 main categories of power management systems.
    Direct main power connected nodes is the first type and most common with indoor
    applications. A rechargeable battery with a recharging option such as solar, hydro,
    or wind is the second option. The third one has a rechargeable battery or a non-rechargeable
    battery but is designed to consume very low power by sending a very low amount
    of data intermittently. Among the 115 pieces of research we have reviewed, only
    27 of them discussed the IoT system power and energy storage features. Out of
    these 27, 11 platforms used solar power as the main power supply while Lithium
    Polymer (LiPo) rechargeable batteries were used as the energy storage solution.
    Out of 11 indoor farming applications which explained the power management options,
    9 used the main grid power supply. Research that focused on IoT system setup under
    high dense canopies used high power density and high-capacity battery-only solutions
    such as 12 V lead-acid batteries. Two studies mentioned they used battery with
    solar but did not disclose details about the specifications. It revealed that
    there are very limited power supplies available for in-field IoT implementation
    and the findings are highlighted in Fig. 8. Download : Download high-res image

    selection of the Ag-IoT systems in the reviewed studies. Unlike edge-computing
    devices, typical IoT end nodes are designed to be less power-hungry. This power
    consumption goes high due to certain reasons such as connected high throughput
    sensors, significant data processing, and massive data transmission. However,
    these power consumptions can be minimized by exploiting different techniques such
    as the semi-active phase and sleep phase (Zhang and Li, 2019). The edge computing-enabled
    devices need more power. It is essential to standardize the IoT power management
    based on the crop and geographical location of the devices. For example, solar
    power is not a very promising solution for locations with large trees such as
    rubber, pepper, and spices that have a dense crop canopy 5–10 m above the ground
    (Villalba et al., 2017). 3.6. Actuators Monitoring and controlling are two agricultural
    operations closely related to each other. Monitoring by itself is an open-loop
    operation; whereas monitoring, controlling, and again monitoring the effects of
    controlling make a system closed loop and can improve the efficiency of the system.
    Efficient controlling of the actuators based on the monitoring is a key feature
    in the agricultural domain for optimizing inputs, maximizing crop yield and quality,
    and reducing the negative environmental impacts. Fig. 9 depicts the number of
    actuators controlled via IoT systems that were reported in our reviewed papers.
    Out of the 115 studies, 54 mentioned IoT-enabled actuation. Some studies used
    more than one actuator, whereas most of the in-field IoT sensor monitoring systems
    did not mention the use of actuators. Download : Download high-res image (130KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Count of actuators controlled via
    IoT systems found in the reviewed papers. Since water is the largest input by
    volume applied to farms, actuators related to water have been mostly discussed
    in the research work. Such controllers are pumps and solenoid valves. Controlling
    these two actuators were demonstrated in 22 and 8 instances, respectively. After
    irrigation, controlling lighting was the most occurred application in indoor farming
    followed by ventilation, fertigation, alert, and air conditioning. Ventilation
    allows outdoor air to come inside the greenhouse while air conditioning includes
    heating or cooling of the air. Alert meant the system sent an email or message
    to the farmer or the operator of the farm when a parameter exceeded a threshold
    value. An IoT-controlled insect repellent actuator was demonstrated twice among
    the 115 case studies evaluated. Automation of soil bed preparation was achieved
    by utilizing stepper motors in one instance of IoT-based indoor farming. According
    to Figure 9, water pumps and valves were the most frequently used actuators, and
    all these systems were closed loop control systems with soil moisture sensors
    and ET modeling. From the study of the above actuator-related research, it can
    be said that there is enormous potential to automate the controlling of the indoor
    crop''s required environment and soil preparation. (See Fig. 9.) 3.7. Ag-IoT for
    crop monitoring Out of the 115 publications reviewed, 71 systems were demonstrated
    in a real environment. Among them, 65% were implemented in the fields, 24% were
    demonstrated in indoor environments, and 11% were simulations. This is an interesting
    finding that reveals the huge potential of implementing outdoor or in-field IoT
    applications. Typically, it is easy to set up indoor IoT sensor networks due to
    fewer technological barriers, such as extreme environmental conditions and sensor
    connectivity issues. Since real applications were available only in 65% (71 out
    of 115) instances, further real implementations can be done to demonstrate the
    capability of Ag-IoT applications. Considering the 71 systems that demonstrated
    the real applications, 49 were practically demonstrated with certain types of
    crops and 22 did not mention the specific crop they used. 15% of these systems
    were demonstrated with grapes while cereal crops accounted for 26%. One research
    was based on both grapes and oranges. In total 50% of the IoT studies focused
    on perennial specialty crops of higher value including grape, moringa, orange,
    citrus, sugarcane, silver maple, apricot, cashew, and olive (Fig. 10). This result
    indicates that IoT can be implemented with diverse crop types to achieve various
    purposes. Ag-IoT systems are easy to set up on perennial croplands as there is
    less soil preparation for the IoT system installation. It is important to develop
    techniques that allow easy IoT implementation to the annual crops as they contribute
    more to global food security. It is also worth to note only one research demonstrated
    the economic viability of IoT implementation (Chen et al., 2019). Therefore, future
    research to assess and understand the economic viability of IoT applications in
    various situations is needed. Download : Download high-res image (167KB) Download

    crop types. 4. Challenges of Ag-IoT systems and potential solutions Ag-IoT faces
    challenges that are unique compared with IoT applications in other industries.
    In this section, we briefly discuss those challenges that are of utmost importance
    for Ag-IoT system researchers and developers. Ag-IoT challenges can be mainly
    classified into three sections: technical challenges, sectoral challenges, and
    business challenges (Elijah et al., 2018). 4.1. Technical challenges Limitations
    of the advancement of technology are the reasons for technical challenges. They
    would likely be effectively addressed as tools and technologies advance with time.
    The Ag-IoT technical challenges are discussed under the three layers of the IoT
    architecture (Fig. 1), namely, perception layer issues, network layer issues,
    and application layer issues. 4.1.1. Perception layer issues Ag-IoT systems''
    perception layer faces unique challenges, because of the requirements it needs
    to meet during crop and environmental monitoring in harsh environments (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). Agricultural lands have limited electricity and communication infrastructure.
    It is not practical or cost-effective to use wired power and communication media
    to connect IoT nodes in the field. Therefore, power management, device longevity,
    and ergonomic design are major challenges related to the Ag-IoT perception layer.
    Power management includes Ag-IoT node-level power generation, strategies to reduce
    power consumption, and energy storage. Section 3.5 Power and Energy Management
    revealed that most of the researchers were interested in solar with rechargeable
    batteries as the power source in agriculture. However, there is a challenge to
    introduce suitable power sources for the Ag-IoT systems under the tall and dense
    crop canopy. Micro wind turbines have the potential as an Ag-IoT power source
    but receive less attention in the literature (Jawad et al., 2017). Continuous
    improvements have been made to rechargeable batteries due to the demand for high
    energy to weight ratio batteries. There are several approaches available to reduce
    power consumption. One approach is to select sensors, actuators, and wireless
    protocols with low energy consumption. Selection of a node duty cycle that turns
    the sensor or actuator on when it reads, sends, or receives signals is another
    viable approach (Estrada-Lopez et al., 2018). Harsh environmental conditions such
    as wind and rainfall, continuous high solar radiation, sub-zero temperatures in
    winter, chemicals commonly used in agriculture, and animal attacks make it difficult
    to keep Ag-IoT nodes in the field in operable conditions for a long time (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). Sensors, cables, and enclosures should be designed to withstand
    such conditions. Standards are available to follow in most cases, but the cost
    becomes high when required standards need to be escalated. Analog signals (Analogue
    voltage or current), Inter-Integrated Circuits (I2C), Serial Data Interface at
    1200 baud rate (SDI-12), and Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART)
    are the common sensor to microcontroller data transmission techniques. The microcontroller
    development boards and commercial IoT platforms are designed to work with different
    voltage levels, such as 3.3 V, 5 V, 7 V, and 12 V. These different communication
    protocols and operation voltages have created barriers to the interoperability
    of the devices in Ag-IoT implementation. Research and development to standardize
    data communication and power supply in Ag-IoT systems would substantially increase
    the scalability, upgradability, and interoperability in the perception layer.
    Improving ergonomic design and reducing the labor intensiveness for deploying
    Ag-IoT systems in the field are urgently needed. IoT-based soil water content
    monitoring is a good example to show this issue. Often soil sensors are buried
    underground for continuous measurements during a season. These sensor nodes also
    have an aboveground section to allow wireless communication, which could interfere
    with farm operations such as tillage, fertilizer application, and chemical spraying,
    and should be closely monitored. For annual crops, the need to remove the sensors
    when crops are harvested and reinstall them in the next season represents a significant
    logistic issue for using them effectively. Research on underground wireless communication
    technology (Akyildiz et al., 2009) and Internet of Underground Things (Vuran et
    al., 2018) is ongoing, bearing the promise to alleviate this challenge associated
    with Ag-IoT node installation and maintenance. No standards are currently available
    on Ag-IoT installation as agricultural fields and practices are highly heterogeneous.
    Novel solutions are necessary to encourage Ag-IoT users. 4.1.2. Network layer
    issues The most common Ag-IoT network layer issues are internet coverage, standard
    interception, interference, propagation losses, communication range, wireless
    link quality, network expansion, network management, communication protocols,
    latency, and throughput. As most farms are in rural areas, remote locations, or
    mountain regions, it is a huge challenge to get internet connectivity to them
    since these underpopulated areas have limited internet infrastructure. One solution
    could be creating a local network, a concept similar to a hybrid cloud. This type
    of system does not connect to the internet but still allows local servers to perform
    the basic IoT functionality (Akyildiz et al., 2009). Due to the recent advancement
    in low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, it would soon be possible to have internet
    connectivity via satellite as illustrated in Fig. 11 on a commercial scale (Ivanova
    et al., 2016). Therefore, we anticipate that, in the future, many agricultural
    fields will rely on satellite-based connectivity to connect their gateways to
    the internet. This system consists of a very small aperture terminal (VSAT) type
    ground antenna which is connected to the nodes through multiple gateways. Gateways
    can follow different communication protocols such as Wi-Fi, LoRa, NB-IoT, or Zigbee.
    One disadvantage of satellite-based internet connectivity is that it needs a clear
    sky to make a successful connection. Therefore, it is logical to have a local
    server for data storage and decision-making when the connection is interrupted.

    Fig. 11. Future Ag-IoT system with satellite connected internet. Standard interception
    refers to difficulties in using the full potential of a communication technology
    due to standards imposed by regulatory authorities to limit the use. Recent advancements
    on long-range low throughput communication technologies such as LoRa become widely
    known communication protocols in Ag-IoT. To promote fair use of LoRa bandwidth,
    governments can regulate the use of wireless frequencies. For example, in Europe,
    the duty cycle or the transmitter uptime of the LoRa node is between 0.1% to 10%.
    This is a challenge in most Ag-IoT applications as there are higher volumes of
    data to transmit and many sensors and actuators to connect. When many IoT nodes
    are deployed, the interference may occur because the data transmission could use
    the same frequency, especially in unlicensed spectrums, such as ZigBee, Sigfox,
    LoRa, and Wi-Fi. Signal interference causes data loss and reduces the reliability
    of the systems (Elijah et al., 2018). Wireless signal propagation strength, communication
    range, and wireless link quality depend on the humidity, temperature, crop growth
    status, and crop morphological characteristics in agriculture fields (Tzounis
    et al., 2017; Cama-Pinto et al., 2019; Vuran et al., 2022). Thus, wireless signal
    propagation strength simulation and visualization software are essential in the
    future for the mass installation of Ag-IoT sensor nodes. Such software will reduce
    the complexity of node placement issues. 4.1.3. Application layer issues Data
    security, data privacy, and data analysis are application layer issues. Ag-IoT
    data is important for a country''s food security as well as for the Ag business
    model security. In the modern competitive world, data breaching could lead to
    a competitive disadvantage on Ag-business model over a competitor as well as risk
    the food security of a country. Therefore, more focus should be put into improving
    the security and privacy of data generated via Ag-IoT systems. 4.2. Sectoral challenges
    4.2.1. Regulatory issues Data ownership creates another business challenge. Companies
    that provide Ag-IoT services can use the data for improvements in their systems,
    but farmers do not receive compensation for that. There is a challenge to implement
    such a system to prevent data monopoly (Misra et al., 2020). Therefore, regulation
    and legal frameworks about the control and rights of data between farmers and
    IoT companies need to be established (Elijah et al., 2018). 4.2.2. Interoperability
    issue According to Elijah et al. (2018), interoperability involves the ability
    to have technical, synthetic, semantic, and organization interoperability. Technical
    interoperability involves the effortless communication among IoT devices using
    protocols. Data interchanging between systems is semantic interoperability. Synthetic
    interoperability deals with IoT system-generated digital data exchange with humans,
    while organization interoperability involves information sharing among different
    regions, infrastructures, and cultures (Elijah et al., 2018). Here we would like
    to introduce a challenge associated with Ag-IoT system interoperability. As most
    of the farmers have crop rotations and multi-cropping systems, it is essential
    to have Ag-IoT systems with context awareness that allows them to work with different
    cropping systems. The heterogeneity of agricultural systems imposes the system
    interoperability challenge. 4.2.3. Business issues The cost and non-availability
    of skilled personnel in Ag-IoT is a business issue. Cost is a challenge for Ag-IoT
    implementation. There are three types of costs involved with Ag-IoT systems: the
    setup cost or the capital expenditure, running cost or operational cost, and upgrading
    cost. Due to the nature of IoT business models and being a relatively new technology,
    analysis on return on investment of Ag-IoT systems is not yet discussed considerably
    in the literature. Chen et al. (2019) highlighted that application of IoT systems
    on irrigation controlling in turmeric turned out to be profitable. Several factors
    increase capital expenditure. Remote and harsh environmental conditions that Ag-IoT
    systems must bear increase the production cost of Ag-IoT systems. Ag-IoT end nodes
    require materials that do not wear and tear due to sun, rain, and chemicals applied
    during crop cultivation. Communication cost is usually a standard rate, but the
    initial investment is required to set up the internet connection, and this cost
    depends on the infrastructure availability where the farms are located. Theoretical
    knowledge and practical experience about the sensing/actuating system and parameters
    of interest are essential to set up a successful Ag-IoT system. Sensor data interpreters
    need an overall understanding of the agroecological principles to reach a decision
    (Duff et al., 2022). Reluctance to use new technology and unskilled manpower are
    apparent obstacles to implementing Ag-IoT in commercial production crop monitoring
    systems. More extension programs are needed to solve this issue while standards
    are necessary for Ag-IoT system development to improve the common Ag-IoT platforms
    that have interoperable qualities. 5. Supporting technologies 5.1. Augmented reality
    and IoT applications Data visualization and real-time decision-making are important
    to IoT. Based on past literature this sector is the least explored area. Wearable
    augmentation devices improve crop monitoring and control. Smart glasses have the
    real-time data visualization capability to indicate the status of crops, soil,
    or environment (Hurst et al., 2021). An irrigation activity can be controlled
    manually by a farmer if he can visualize the real-time soil water content change
    in the field. The conditions within a greenhouse can be controlled in real-time
    and actuators can be controlled via voice command through a smart glass. Harvesting
    can be more enjoyable and more efficient (lower loss) based on image processing
    capable smart glasses. Vegetable or fruit pickers can be assisted through a smart
    glass by viewing what it detects in the fruit to decide whether to pick it or
    not. Untrained labor usage-related losses can be reduced by augmented reality
    related training. 5.2. Big data Big data generated by Ag-IoT are mostly of heterogeneous
    types. The most common IoT agricultural big data are machine-generated data (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). These data are generated from a massive number of sensors and smart
    machines used to measure and record farming processes; which are in turn boosted
    by the IoT. Machine-generated data range from simple sensor records to complex
    computer logs. Big data in agriculture are generated mostly when we introduce
    smart sensing and monitoring with the help of IoT. The main sources of big data
    in Ag-IoT are: sensors, robotics, open data, data captured by airborne sensors
    (Faulkner and Cebul, 2014; Cole et al., 2012), weather/climate data, yield data,
    soil types, agricultural census data (Chen et al., 2014) and so on. Typically,
    telemetry data is generated by sensors such as temperature, rotary, or linear
    encoder. These data are well-structured in contrast to imagery data which need
    post-processing. Such unstructured data have issues in terms of availability,
    quality, and formats (Liu et al., 2015) and can be a concern. As the number of
    sensors is increasing and data volumes are growing rapidly, it is becoming a matter
    of utmost importance to store and process big data. Some approaches to handle
    big data are data shrinking, scale up, scale out, and high-performance computing.
    Data shrinking is the process of throwing away some less important data and still
    being able to reconstruct the original data. Scale-up (vertical scalability) is
    adding additional storage and RAM to store and process the big data in the processing
    node. But this technique has its capacity limit. Scale out (horizontal scalability)
    is the concept of using parallel computers to store and process that big data.
    High-Performance Computing is one of the state-of-the-art techniques to handle
    big data, where computers with multiple cores are grouped to create an efficient
    network to deal with the big data. These techniques are essential for successful
    data handling in Ag-IoT. 5.3. Artificial intelligence in Ag-IoT Techniques that
    enable machines to mimic human behavior are artificial intelligence (AI), while
    a subset of AI that gives machines the ability of learning without being explicitly
    programmed is machine learning. Deep learning techniques are a subset of machine
    learning techniques with multilayer neural network feasibility. The data generated
    from the Ag-IoTs are often used to train machine learning models for specific
    agricultural use cases such as yield forecast, crop stress detection, and pest
    spreading prediction. To be more specific, for the agricultural IoT applications,
    raw sensing information such as field and weather conditions and crop status can
    be collected and used for model training locally or in the remote end that has
    more computational resources. These trained models can later be used to control
    actuators for variable rate irrigation and site-specific pesticide/ herbicide
    applications. Deep learning techniques are heavily used with image processing
    applications in agriculture. Trained deep learning models are available for crop
    type detection (de Filho et al., 2020), plant phenotyping (Pound et al., 2017),
    fruit (Patel et al., 2011), flower (Dias et al., 2018), and leaf detection (Chamara
    et al., 2021), and weed detection for herbicide applications (Coleman et al.,
    2022). AI becomes an integral part of IoT due to its capability of using it as
    a data analytics tool. 6. Ag-IoT for farming systems analyses and management In
    this section, we briefly discuss and envision how Ag-IoT would benefit and potentially
    transform farming systems analyses and management, enabled by its unprecedented
    data, analytics, and connected sensors and actuators. Perhaps the most obvious
    advantages of Ag-IoT come from the high spatiotemporal resolution of farm-level
    data it generates concerning crops, soil, and microclimate (Kagan et al., 2022).
    The high spatial resolution data would quantify the the spatial variability of
    crop parameters (such as yield and leaf area index) and soil parameters (such
    as pH, organic matter, and water holding capacility), and elucidate the relationships
    between them to identify yield-limiting factors at different parts of the field
    (Alfred et al., 2021). This is the underlying principle of site-specific crop
    management, which will be greatly enhanced through Ag-IoT. Modern Ag-IoTs take
    measurements at hourly and sub-hourly intervals. This high temporal resolution
    data allow us to observe the crop responses to environmental cues at finer time
    steps, and enhance our understanding on how basic plant physiological processes
    such as transpiration and photosynthesis vary due to short-term environmental
    fluctuations. Process-based crop and soil models, which are widely used to evaluate
    the economic and environmental consequences of farming practices, usually suffer
    from the lack of site-specific data to parameterize and calibrate them, especially
    the in-season crop data and soil data. These data are exactly what Ag-IoT sensors
    are good at generating, and therefore would improve the accuracy of these models
    for farm-level management assessment. Networked sensors and actuators of Ag-IoT,
    along with the real-time data processing, transmission, and modeling, would greatly
    improve the decision-making cycle of farm-level management practices (Chaterji
    et al., 2021). The traditional crop management decision-making has several limitations.
    First, the decision is usually based on a single set of data, because other datasets
    are unavailable or expensive to obtain. Second, there is usually long latency
    between data generation and decision-making (e.g., several days or weeks). This
    long latency is in contrast to the fact that many stresses in the field (such
    as pest outbreak) occur and develop quickly and need real-time intervention to
    prevent substantial loss. Thirdly, the present management practice only addresses
    one factor at a time whereas in reality crops can undergo multiple stresses simultaneously.
    Altogether, these limitations reflect our inability to capture the complexity
    of the farming system. Ag-IoT has the potential to transform farm-level decision-making
    by enabling multi-inputs, multi-outputs decision strategies, powered by real-time
    data processing and relevant models run in the cloud to shorten the latency. For
    example, crop, soil, and microclimate sensors can simultaneously measure the crop
    water and nitrogen status, soil moisture content and nitrate content, and weather
    variables. These multi-source inputs can be fed into the models to output two
    variables: a nitrogen sufficiency index and a water sufficiency index. These two
    variables can further be converted to a nitrogen and water application rate for
    site-specific fertigation. This paradigm has several advantages. First, it is
    a multi-inputs, multi-outputs decision strategy that accounts for the interaction
    between the water and nitrogen stresses. Second, it reduces the cost of implementation
    and shortens the management cycle because two actions are combined into one (one
    pass of field equipment instead of two). In a similar fashion, decisions such
    as pesticide applications and other chemicals (fungicides, growth regulators)
    could potentially be further stacked to make crop production more efficient. Traditionally,
    farm system analyses and management happen at the individual farm level (Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2019). In other words, data are usually not shared or co-analyzed
    across the farm boundary. In the era of Ag-IoT where farm data are shared and
    stored in the cloud, there represents an opportunity where the analysis and modeling
    of Ag-IoT data can cover a group of farms or at a regional scale. These regional
    analyses would answer other important questions such as regional yield forecasting,
    pest tracking, or agricultural resource prioritization. These questions are not
    necessarily important for individual growers, but are at the heart of other stakeholders
    such as policy makers and input suppliers. Data ownership and privacy, covered
    in Section 4, are two big issues that should be resolved before this type of analysis
    may occur. 7. Conclusions and future directions 7.1. Conclusions Ag-IoT is a promising
    technology that would increase resource use efficiency in agricultural systems,
    and is an essential tool for digital agriculture transformation. In this paper,
    we have overviewed impactful research related to Ag-IoT in the past decade. The
    data collected from these papers were categorized and analyzed under six main
    Ag-IoT system design parameters namely sensors, sensing platforms and main control
    board, communication technology and IoT protocols, cloud platforms, power and
    energy management, and actuators. According to the analyzed data, it is revealed
    that there is an increased global attention towards the Ag-IoT system-related
    research in the recent years. However, there are certain research gaps found in
    the literature. One of them is that the implementations of the sensors and the
    actuators seem to be limited to soil and environmental parameter monitoring and
    irrigation controlling. Furthermore, crop macro and micronutrient demand analyses
    are still at the infant stage due to the non-availability of sensors that can
    measure nutrients in real-time. Therefore, it is essential to improve the sensor
    and actuator applications in crop monitoring and controlling. In addition, heterogeneity
    of the system parameters (such as data, platforms, required power) is a major
    challenge to the Ag-IoT systems implementation, to which the improvement of the
    context-awareness could be a solution. Power harness options for Ag-IoT nodes
    need more exploration as there are limited options available and it would be a
    big advantage for the perennial crop monitoring. The perception and the network
    layers of Ag-IoT systems require more improvements to meet the sensor implementation
    ergonomics and long-range high-throughput data transmission, respectively. Edge
    computing can be a replacement of the high throughput long-range communication,
    but to the best of our knowledge, only a limited number of practical applications
    have been developed based on edge computing to date. Mobile Ag-IoT platforms such
    as unmanned aerial and ground vehicles have a huge potential to increase the spatiotemporal
    resolution in Ag-IoT-based monitoring and controlling. 7.2. Future directions
    From the finding of this review, authors would like to highlight some important
    future requirements for Ag-IoT. The entire Ag-IoT research community needs to
    propose a complete system design for Ag-IoT that will be viable, open, and interpretable.
    The objective is to enable the interconnectivity of heterogeneous systems and
    sharing resources to obtain more detailed and specific agricultural data. Furthermore,
    in the future research work, there is a need to develop complete information perception
    standards and design multi-protocol compatible gateways. With some significant
    efforts in the above-mentioned future research directions, the entire research
    community will be able to solve the problems of inconsistent device interfaces
    and protocols, making the system faster, robust, and more convenient. Making full
    use of long-range low throughput communication technology, virtual reality/augmented
    reality, and big data/AI for Ag-IoT is yet to be thoroughly explored. Declaration

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Trichy, India SECTION I. Introduction Water
    is a basic necessity for all the life forms on Earth [1], [2]. It is well known
    that water is the main reason behind Earth being the only living planet. It is
    impossible for any living being to live without water [3], [4]. Without water,
    a plant cannot perform its essential photosynthesis. It is understandable that
    if the problem of water scarcity continues to increase, it will remove the greenery
    in the future. As a result of which, there will be less rainfall. Water is also
    essential for agricultural production and food security [5]–[7]. Technology has
    always served to overcome such problems and to make lives easy with its innovations.
    Here through this study one such solution is introduced, named ‘lOT based Soil
    Management System,’ a model for controlling irrigation that uses IoTto sense soil
    moisture with temperature and humidity of the surroundings with a microcontroller
    to make an intelligent irrigation system to help millions of farmers and University
    gardeners [8], [9]. Soil moisture is critical to plant growth, and maintaining
    the right amount of moisture can help plants grow faster and produce better yields.
    An efficient soil moisture management system can help conserve water by reducing
    the water needed for irrigation [10], [11]. A soil moisture management system
    can help reduce water usage and lead to cost savings of water bills and other
    expenses. By managing soil moisture levels, it helps to maintain soil health and
    reduce erosion, which is essential for sustainable agriculture [12]–[14]. Farmers
    and growers can proactively avoid drought conditions and other weather-related
    risks that can harm crops by monitoring soil moisture levels [15]–[17]. To evaluate
    the link between soil moisture readings acquired from soil moisture sensors and
    the gravimetric approach, a study was conducted at the Water Technology Centre
    farm (WTC) at Hyderabad based college [18]. In 2021, Fengfei et al.''s Portable
    PHS Method for Moisture in the Soil Monitoring Based on Thermal Effect is implemented.
    The results were compared to those obtained using the drying procedure, confirming
    the practicality of the suggested method [19]. In 2019, G. S. Swileam et al. assessed
    soil heterogeneity utilising electrical resistance for typical alluvial soils
    in Egypt [20]. In 2018 smith et aI., proposed a system for efficiently maintaining
    optimal soil moisture levels for crops using various traditional soil management
    systems [21]. Gupta et al. (2020) analyze whether rooftop harvesting of rainwater
    and outline bunding enhances the moisture in the soil. Their effects on yields
    of crops, availability of water, and soil moisture management are examined [22].
    Contour plowing, terracing, and checking dams in arid environments are the main
    focus of this study by Patel et al. It assesses their ability to reduce soil moisture
    evaporation and increase water retention [23]. To measure the soil moisture content,
    humidity, and temperature using Raspberry Pi Pico and other sensors to minimize
    the over-watering and under-watering of plants. This paper deals with multiple
    sensors/modules and Raspberry Pi Pico to measure the current readings of the soil
    & surrounding of the University plants, analyze them, display the measurements
    on the webpage, and automatically water the plants when required by connecting
    them to a water pump. IoT-based soil management systems can collect real-time
    data on soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and other relevant factors.
    This enables farmers and growers of the university to make data-driven decisions
    and respond quickly to changes in soil moisture levels. Farmers and growers can
    remotely monitor soil moisture levels and other factors with this system. This
    can save time and reduce the need for manual labor in the field. The curated system
    can automate the irrigation process based on soil moisture levels and other data.
    Intelligent systems can help reduce water waste and improve crop yields. IoT -based
    soil management systems can be easily scaled to accommodate more significant areas
    of farmland or garden spaces in universities. These innovative systems are also
    suitable for large-scale agricultural operations and smaller-scale applications.
    SECTION II. Proposed Work This IoT -based system deals with multiple sensors/modules
    and Raspberry Pi Pico to measure the current readings of the soil & surroundings,
    analyze them, display the measurements on the website, and automatically water
    the plants when required by connecting to a water pump. The system uses micro
    python to interface the sensors and modules with the microcontroller Raspberry
    Pi Pico. This project deals with the automatic watering of plants whenever the
    moisture, humidity, and temperature level decreases to a specific standard limit.
    The working of proposed model consists of a soil moisture sensor and a temperature
    humidity sensor, which tracks the soil moisture along with the humidity and temperature
    of the surroundings. When the measurements exceed the required standard readings,
    the relay directs the motor to pump water to plants. This model will benefit people
    with large patches of gardens, Universities, or those farther from their places.
    The proposed system has advantages in reducing costs, restricting water waste,
    and minimizing physical interference. It also promotes irrigation that requires
    little maintenance and is environmentally friendly. In order to regulate the water
    flow, a relay module has been installed. The model shows expected impacts at various
    levels of humidity and temperature. Figure 1 shows the proposed model of our IoT
    -based system. Fig. 1: Proposed IoT-based system for Soil Moisture management
    system Show All SECTION III. Methedologies Used The Soil Moisture Sensor yields
    real-time data in the form of an analog. Analog to Digital (A/D) and data conditions
    are converted using Raspberry Pi Pico Microcontroller. The Microcontroller is
    used to acquire real-time soil moisture using a soil moisture sensor. The Thonny
    Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a cross-platform application that
    supports high-level programming languages like Python. The IDE makes writing code
    and uploading the source program to the board easy. It contains libraries and
    cores. The samples are measured from low to High moisture contents of the soil.
    The gardener can get the processed data through the webpage with the help of Wireless
    Fidelity (Wi-Fi) Technology. This system can give real-time data on soil moisture.
    The Soil moisture system is connected to the web page. We have interfaced the
    soil moisture sensor, DHTII Module, and relay with a Raspberry Pi Pico to measure
    the volumetric concentration of water inside the soil and the humidity and temperature
    of the surroundings. This system uses Raspberry Pi Pico as a microcontroller,
    which is then connected to the Moisture Sensor, which measures the soil''s moisture
    content. Raspberry Pi Pico acts as the central brain of the IoT-based soil moisture
    management system, responsible for data collection, processing, analysis, communication,
    and automated control. It is also linked to DHT -11, the Temperature and Humidity
    sensor, which measures the ambient temperature and humidity. The Pico is also
    connected to the Wi-Fi module ESP-Ol, bridging the divide between the hardware
    and software components of the system shown in fig. 2. The measurements of the
    above sensors and modules and the standard measurements will subsequently be displayed
    for users on our self-designed website using the ESP-Ol. Fig. 2. Schematic Layout
    of our Proposed System Show All SECTION IV. Experimentation & Model Evaluation
    The proposed intelligent system captures data in real-time using a range of sensors
    and modules shown in fig. 5. University gardeners use these sensors to assess
    soil and environmental conditions. The soil management system we built is responsible
    for several duties. It begins by measuring the soil moisture content using a capacitive
    soil moisture sensor and then monitors the humidity and temperature of the surrounding
    environment with a DHTII Module. All plants have a threshold value set to standard
    soil moisture content for home/university gardeners. When the moisture level falls
    below the set standard/threshold level, the relay module turns the Motor On and
    begins pumping water to the plants from the tank until the moisture level returns
    to the desired level. The measurements mentioned above’ readings will be shown
    on a website built with the ESP-OI, which we designed with HTML and CSS and coded
    in Python. Fig. 3 shows the hardware connection of sensors/modules to Raspberry
    Pico and figure 4 depicts the Circuit diagram of the connection of all the sensors,
    modules, and motors. Fig. 3. Hardware connection of sensors/modules to Pico Show
    All Fig. 4. Circuit diagram of our proposed System Show All Fig. 5. Experimental
    model of our proposed System Show All SECTION V. Result Analysis & Validation
    The analysis of the results demonstrates the efficacy of IoT-based watering systems
    in sustaining optimal soil moisture levels for plant growth in the university.
    These systems provide optimal irrigation, water conservation, improved plant health
    and growth, resource efficiency, data-driven insights, remote monitoring and control,
    and flexibility. Using IoT technology, plant owners, farmers, and gardeners can
    achieve precise and effective watering techniques, resulting in healthier and
    more robust plants. The moisture reading experiments conducted at our University
    on different plants and shrubs can provide valuable insights into plant water
    requirements and watering patterns shown in fig. 6. Fig. 6. Soil moisture reading
    experimentation done at our University''s Plants & Shrubs Show All The collected
    data on moisture readings from the different plants and shrubs helps in understanding
    their specific water requirements and watering patterns. This IoT-based system
    enables informed decision-making regarding irrigation scheduling, optimization
    of water management practices, and adjustment of watering parameters based on
    the specific needs of each plant species. The model then starts measuring and
    taking the readings displayed on the Thonny Shell shown in fig. 7. Table I shows
    the soil moisture readings from the capacitive soil moisture sensor & level of
    accuracy of the sensor when compared to the recommended moisture level. Fig. 8
    depicts the soil moisture level and the recommended moisture needed for the plants.
    The relationship between soil moisture levels and the recommended moisture level
    for plants is graphically represented in Figure 8. Individuals can make informed
    decisions to promote healthy plant growth, conserve water, and preserve natural
    and agricultural ecosystems by comprehending this relationship. Gardeners can
    decide when and how much to water their plants by monitoring soil moisture and
    using the specified range. Avoiding under watering and overwatering optimizes
    plant growth and conserves water. Water management influences the ecological balance
    and is essential for plant and animal survival. Fig. 9, the online snapshot showing
    the moisture reading, promotes transparency, engagement, and accessibility, enhancing
    your research''s effect. It supports the study''s findings and contributes to
    broader educational and practical applications, promoting sustainable water management
    and nurturing collaboration within the scientific community. Fig. 7:. Thonny Shell

    driven by the integration of the advanced technologies like internet of things
    (IoT) and machine learning (ML) is revolutionary precision agriculture, especially
    the indoor farming techniques. This chapter explores the comprehensive application
    of IoT and ML in automating indoor cultivation practices, examining their diverse
    benefits and practical uses in comparison with the traditional farming methodologies.
    IoT enables the indoor farmers to create controlled environments through interconnected
    sensors, monitoring crucial variables but not limited to temperature, humidity,
    and light intensity. Complemented by ML algorithms, data analysis becomes efficient,
    providing predictive models for crop growth, pest detection, and disease outbreaks.
    Automated environment climate control systems optimize resource utilization, while
    precision irrigation minimizes water usage. Real-time monitoring and early detection
    of plant health issues reduce crop losses, ensuring high-quality produce. Request

    Introduction Agriculture is one of the key sources that plays a significant part
    in the life of the country''s economy. Traditional agriculture refers to the conventional
    farming methods that have been practiced for centuries, relying on manual labor
    and basic tools. In traditional agriculture, farmers often work in small plots
    of land using traditional seeds and farming practices passes down through the
    generations while traditional agriculture has played a crucial role in meeting
    food demands, it does have it disadvantages. One significant drawbacks is its
    relatively low efficiency and productivity. Manual labor-intensive tasks can be
    time-consuming and labor demanding, leading to potential wastage of water, fertilizers
    and pesticides. Moreover, traditional agriculture is more susceptible to the adverse
    effects of unpredictable weather conditions and environmental factors which can
    result in lower yields and economic losses. Meanwhile, food security is a global
    challenge and impacted by rapidly compounding effects of climate changes, population
    trends and supply chain shortcomings. Agriculture''s global impact cannot be overstated,
    as it remains the primary source of food for humanity. Despite the fact that the
    human population continues to grow, agricultural land remains static (Virk et
    al.2020). The authors (Mesgaran et al. 2017) also discovered that the ever-changing
    climatic conditions significantly reduce agricultural product output in conventional
    agricultural systems. As a result of the varying nature of farming resources and
    poor management, farmers continue to experience low agricultural output. Drawbacks
    of Traditional Farming Due to the low degree of automation in the farming area,
    the current state of the art in agriculture, particularly conventional agricultural
    systems, still confronts significant hurdles in terms of sustainability, labor-intensity,
    and energy efficiency needs. Also, the production level of the crops to be considered.
    Scalability problems also taken into account since the population explosion is
    the major cause. Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming In order to overcome
    the limitations and challenges faced in the conventional farming systems, the
    advent of the smart farming and precision agricultural sector to automate the
    farming processes towards achieving many goals towards sustainable agricultural
    systems. Some of them are listed below: • High quantity of crop yield • Better
    quality of the crops • Efficient resource utilization • Effective to handle climatic
    conditions • Decision making in cropping patterns • Environment and user-friendly
    • Easy maintenance • Minimized crop losses • Easy to handle pests, diseases, weeds
    • Minimize the crop growth time duration • Early prediction on the crop loss or
    gain • Ensures and motivates organic way of crop cultivation • Improves the growth
    of wide variety of crops • Reduces the usage of pesticides, fungicides and other
    chemicals that are not good for health. • Though huge amount for installations,
    less chances for failures and lasts for longer life-time. Continue Reading References

    IEEE SECTION I. Introduction In the western US, substantial year-to-year variability
    in weather conditions complicates planning for water managers and agricultural
    producers, and makes it difficult to apply standard rule-of-thumb approaches to
    agricultural water management. In California, the recent three year drought, from
    2007–2009, underscored the vulnerability of the state''s agricultural industry
    to variability in water supply, with hundreds of millions in economic losses and
    thousands of agricultural jobs lost [1]. Concurrent with the drought, groundwater
    levels in the Central Valley declined substantially [2] as growers pumped water
    to partially offset reductions in surface water deliveries. Inter-annual variability
    in water supply is common throughout the western U.S., where growing urban populations,
    increases in water allocations for endangered species, and climate change—with
    predicted shifts in precipitation and reductions in winter snowpack in the Sierra
    and Rocky Mountains [3]–[5]— will continue to constrain water supplies for agricultural
    users. Because agriculture is typically the largest user of water in the West,
    maximizing the benefits of available agricultural water supplies is central to
    the implementation of drought mitigation and climate adaptation strategies in
    western states. Low cost adaptation strategies for agricultural water users include
    the use of irrigation scheduling technologies that incorporate information on
    weather conditions and crop growth stage. Satellite measurements of water resources
    and hydrologic fluxes have great potential for supporting agricultural producers
    and water managers working to optimize agricultural water supply and use. When
    combined with biophysical models, satellite observations can be applied to scale
    point observations from surface observation networks across larger geographic
    areas. Evapotranspiration (ET) and soil moisture data are particularly relevant
    to both operational water management and long-term planning. Surface measurements
    of these parameters are often difficult and expensive to collect, and generally
    available only from sparsely distributed observation networks. Recent advances
    in modeling and measurement of ET using satellite observations now enable moderate
    resolution (30–1000m), spatially continuous estimates of ET over large areas in
    near real-time [6]–[9]. Integration of this information into current water management
    practices and operational models, however, requires the development of frameworks
    for synthesizing data from multiple sensor networks to drive models for estimating
    evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and other key hydrologic reservoirs and fluxes.
    New approaches are also required for delivery of satellite-derived data and information
    products to water managers and agricultural producers. Table I Summary of Key
    Terms and Abbreviations One water management challenge where integration of ET
    models and sensor network observations has immediate potential utility is in supporting
    agricultural producers and water managers working to optimize irrigation management
    by accounting for current weather and crop conditions when making irrigation management
    decisions. In scheduling irrigation, growers must account for multiple factors,
    including soil type, salinity and leaching fraction, weather conditions and crop
    growth stage. In water limited regions, it is particularly important for growers
    to maximize on-farm water use efficiency by accounting for weather conditions
    in estimating crop water consumption and associated irrigation demand. A common
    method of irrigation scheduling involves estimation of crop water use by multiplying
    weather-based estimates of reference evapotranspiration ( ET o ) by crop coefficients
    ( K c ) for a particular crop. (A summary of key terms and definitions related
    to agricultural irrigation management is included in Table I.) ET o is defined
    as the evapotranspiration from a reference crop, typically a well-watered, actively
    growing grass or alfalfa of uniform height. In the western U.S., agricultural
    weather networks such as the California Irrigation Management Information System
    (CIMIS), AgriMet, and the Arizona Meteorological Network (AZMET) provide hourly
    information on weather conditions and ET o . Within California, CIMIS [10] currently
    operates 139 stations across the state and provides data to growers and irrigation
    consultants on ET o and weather conditions. Spatial CIMIS daily ET o data derived
    using the methods developed by Hart et al. [11] are available from 2003 to present
    at 2km spatial resolution statewide. The method uses cloud cover estimates derived
    from the GOES weather satellites to estimate the daily solar insolation for each
    pixel, and thus represents an initial integration of satellite and surface observations
    within CIMIS. Guideline crop coefficients have been compiled for several crops
    and are available from sources such as the Food and Agriculture Organization Irrigation
    and Drainage Paper 56, commonly known as FAO-56 [12], the University of California''s
    Basic Irrigation Scheduler, the California Department of Water Resources'' Consumptive
    Use Program, and the Wateright system developed by California State University,
    Fresno. K c is a dimensionless value representing typical crop evapotranspiration
    ( ET c ) for a given crop canopy relative to ET o , and it captures the effect
    of crop growth stage on evaporative demand. K c integrates the effects of both
    crop transpiration and soil evaporation. Many growers use a dual-crop coefficient
    approach, which separates the evaporation and transpiration components of ET.
    The basal crop coefficient ( K cb ) represents conditions for an unstressed crop
    on a dry soil surface, and a separate coefficient is used to calculate soil evaporation
    ( K e ) if required. K cb can be used to calculate basal crop ET ( ET cb ) as
    a measure of plant transpiration for a non-stressed crop plus a small diffusive
    soil evaporation component. As such, ET cb also provides a measure of potential
    crop water use, or biological water demand for well-watered crops. While useful
    for seasonal planning, one limitation of this standard approach to operational
    irrigation management is that it requires growers to derive crop coefficients
    from look-up tables and then correct them for site-specific conditions. In addition,
    many crop coefficients were developed decades ago and may not account for current
    farming practices or local and interannual variability in weather conditions and
    crop development rates. Previous research conducted in California quantified the
    observed benefits of using information on ET in irrigation scheduling. This research
    compared applied irrigation and yields reported by growers on 55 farms before
    and after use of ET o data from CIMIS. Results from the study reported an average
    increase in yields of 8%, and a reduction in total applied irrigation of 13% [13],
    [14]. While it is difficult to fully control for the effect of year-to-year variability
    in weather on crop yields in these types of studies, this result suggests that
    during key phases in crop development, some growers may be irrigating to the point
    that the root zone becomes saturated, reducing oxygen availability in the root
    zone and modestly suppressing crop growth. Across the 13 different crop types
    evaluated, including tree and vine crops, vegetable crops, and field crops, growers
    reported total economic benefits from increased yields and reductions in applied
    water ranging from 110to 1,700 per hectare. Due in part to these benefits, use
    of CIMIS data in California has grown from about 450 primary registered CIMIS
    data users in 1987, to nearly 40,000 today. In the year 2010 alone, for example,
    ∼2million reports were generated from the CIMIS database. However, the most recent
    farm and ranch irrigation survey conducted by the USDA indicated that only 12%
    of growers in California utilize reports on daily crop-water ET in scheduling
    irrigation [15], due in part to the barriers described above. Development of an
    automated system for mapping crop coefficients and delivery of data to users would
    enhance the use of ET data in irrigation management. The California Department
    of Water Resources (CDWR) identified statewide mapping of crop coefficients in
    near-real-time as one of the high priority, short term needs for CIMIS [16]. In
    addition to ET o , observations of other parameters related to agricultural water
    management are increasingly available from surface sensor networks and satellites.
    Soil moisture information is available for a limited number of sites from the
    USDA Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN). As the cost of soil moisture sensors
    has declined, an increasing number of specialty crop producers are also deploying
    soil moisture sensor networks in their operations. Satellite and aircraft remote
    sensing observations of crop canopies over agricultural regions are used by the
    USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) to map crop types and fallowed
    acreage on an annual, post-season basis, and increasingly by individual growers
    to identify and map variations in crop canopy conditions that may be indicative
    of pest infestations, variations in soil texture, or irregularities in irrigation
    systems. Seasonal estimates of evapotranspiration from satellite-driven energy
    balance models such as the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) [17]
    and the Mapping EvapoTRanspiration with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) [18]
    model have also been used by water managers for water rights accounting to resolve
    disputes over water resources [19]. Integration of these data sources into current
    management practices and operational models presents a number of challenges, especially
    for applications that require information in near real-time. In addition to typical
    issues associated with processing large volumes of data from heterogeneous sources,
    data from the Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) sensors
    onboard the Landsat satellites must be atmospherically corrected to minimize artificial
    scene-to-scene variability resulting from the effects of aerosols, ozone, and
    water vapor. A hardware failure on the Landsat 7 ETM+ instrument produces regularly
    spaced data gaps that must be addressed. Differences in the spatial scale of different
    satellite sensors must be considered when fusing data from sensors such as Landsat
    TM and ETM+ (30 m–120 m) and the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
    (MODIS) (250 m–1 km) to reduce data gaps due to clouds and improve data reliability.
    Data from surface sensor networks are valuable for calibrating and scaling satellite-driven
    models, but they must be retrieved and transformed into formats that can be ingested
    by various models. At present, a number of satellite-driven energy balance models
    (including SEBAL and METRIC) for estimation of ET also require manual intervention
    to select “cold” and “hot” anchor pixels that serve to constrain the calculation
    of ET, making it difficult to fully automate operation of these models, though
    work by Kjaersgaard et al. [20] shows progress towards resolving this problem.
    As a result of these issues, the full potential of satellite data for supporting
    water managers and agricultural producers has yet to be fully realized. The NASA
    Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS) [21] provides a modeling
    and computing framework for integrating satellite and surface observations in
    near real-time to address many of the challenges described above. In the following
    sections, we describe an application of the TOPS framework to develop a system
    for near real-time mapping of crop canopy conditions and associated crop irrigation
    requirements at the resolution of individual fields. To support continued improvements
    in management of agricultural water supplies, the data processing system is designed
    to provide growers and water managers with frequent, accurate, and easily available
    information that includes key indicators of crop canopy development and crop water
    use requirements. SECTION II. A Framework for Satellite Irrigation Management
    Support Fig. 1. Overview of the TOPS-SIMS architecture with primary data inputs
    and outputs. Show All The TOPS Satellite Irrigation Management Support (TOPS-SIMS)
    framework integrates satellite observations from Landsat and MODIS with meteorological
    observations from CIMIS and ancillary data on crop type and site specific conditions
    (Fig. 1). The system employs a modular architecture to facilitate support for
    a wide range of models and data. The initial implementation provides a capability
    for mapping of fractional cover ( F c ) , associated basal crop coefficients (
    K cb ) , and evapotranspiration ( ET cb ) over 3.7 million ha of farmland in California''s
    Central Valley. F c and K cb are mapped every eight days, and ET cb maps are produced
    on a daily basis at spatial resolutions that are useful for irrigation management
    at the field level (30 m). Automated atmospheric correction and gap-filling algorithms
    are optimized for agricultural areas to provide a robust and reliable data stream.
    Information from TOPS-SIMS is distributed to water managers and agricultural producers
    via a browser-based irrigation management decision support system. Users may combine
    the supplied K cb or ET cb with formal or intuitive estimates of soil evaporation
    to derive total water consumption over the recent period at the field level. By
    accounting for the irrigation application rate, distribution uniformity, and any
    corrections for water replacement targets (e.g., intentional deficit irrigation
    or leaching requirement), users can translate TOPS-SIMS output into an irrigation
    management strategy. To evaluate the utility of the system for commercial farming
    operations, TOPS-SIMS estimates are compared against ET data collected by surface
    renewal stations [22] and information from wireless soil moisture sensor networks
    deployed in operational agricultural fields across California in cooperation with
    growers. The TOPS-SIMS architecture facilitates forecasting of potential consumptive
    use and associated irrigation demand with lead times of up to 1 week through integration
    of forecast data from the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) Forecasted Reference
    Evapotranspiration system (FRET). This capability is particularly relevant for
    future extension of TOPS-SIMS to support both irrigation scheduling and water
    delivery planning. Finally, the TOPS-SIMS architecture is designed to support
    the future addition of other satellite-driven models for estimation of ET, soil
    moisture, and crop stress, all of which further the goal of improving water management
    and making irrigation scheduling more practical, convenient, and accurate. SECTION
    III. Methods TOPS, a NASA modeling and data assimilation framework developed to
    monitor and forecast environmental conditions, provides a range of capabilities
    for integrating observations from satellites and surface sensor networks via models
    including crop models, biogeochemical and carbon cycle models, ecological models,
    and numerical weather and climate models [21]. The TOPS framework has also been
    adapted to run on high-end computing resources in the NASA Advanced Supercomputing
    (NAS) facility as part of the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) [23]. NEX combines supercomputing
    resources, Earth system modeling, remote sensing data from NASA and other agencies,
    and a scientific social networking platform to deliver a complete work environment
    in which users can analyze large Earth science data sets, run modeling codes,
    collaborate on new or existing projects, and share results within and among communities.
    NEX provides direct access to the full archive of Landsat and MODIS data for the
    western U.S., as well as on-demand access to thousands of processing cores, facilitating
    rapid processing of both historic data archives and incoming satellite data. Leveraging
    these capabilities, TOPS-SIMS ingests Landsat-5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ , and MODIS
    satellite imagery for California''s Central Valley and other agricultural regions.
    Landsat provides the spatial resolution necessary to produce information at the
    scale of individual fields. The daily temporal resolution of MODIS provides a
    gap-filling capability to ensure data availability. Methods employed by the remote
    sensing community for satellite mapping of ET at field scales (30 m) rely primarily
    on energy balance models, e.g., [17], [18], [24], or reflectance-based mapping
    of crop coefficients, e.g., [25]–[28]; see also review by Gowda et al. [29]. Of
    these approaches, strategies for full automation at the scale of individual fields
    have only been developed for mapping of crop coefficients from surface reflectance,
    and thus the initial suite of algorithms implemented in the TOPS-SIMS framework
    relies on this approach. In the future, it may be possible to implement additional
    models, including energy balance models and models for downscaling of soil moisture
    estimates from satellite missions such as the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)
    mission. Each Landsat scene is atmospherically corrected using software developed
    under the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) project
    [30]. LEDAPS incorporates the 6S atmospheric radiative transfer modeling approach
    of Vermote et al. [31], as included in the standard MODIS data processing chain.
    Landsat TM and ETM+ data are tiled onto a common grid to form an 8-day composite.
    This facilitates use of overlapping portions of each scene to increase the frequency
    of observations and reduce data gaps due to cloud cover. This compositing approach
    also reduces the effects of the ETM+ scan line correction error, as only the central
    portion of the Landsat 7 scenes are used, where the gaps are narrower. The next
    step is to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) [32] from
    the composited Landsat scenes. NDVI is an index calculated from the red and near
    infrared wavelengths and provides a measure of photosynthetic capacity. At this
    stage, a suite of gap-filling algorithms are employed to ensure spatially continuous
    data over agricultural regions. Current algorithms include the use of moving window
    averages and linear interpolation to fill small data gaps over agricultural fields.
    Field boundaries available from many of the County Agricultural Commissioners''
    offices in California facilitate identification of MODIS 250 m NDVI pixels that
    are fully contained within agricultural field boundaries, and thus enable use
    of MODIS data to fill the majority of the remaining data gaps with reasonable
    accuracy. Use of the STAR-FM algorithm [33], as implemented within TOPS, can be
    employed to address any remaining gaps through fusion of Landsat and MODIS by
    disaggregating MODIS data to the Landsat scale. Prior to further processing, non-agricultural
    areas are masked out using the USDA NASS Cropland Data Layer (CDL)1 [34] and field
    polygons from local County Agricultural Commissioner offices, when available.
    The CDL is also used to spatially differentiate annual crops from perennial orchards
    and vineyards. Following the compositing and gap-filling procedures, NDVI data
    are transformed to F c via empirical relationships developed by USDA and NASA.
    Johnson and Trout [35] and Trout et al. [36] collected field measurements of F
    c across multiple crop types in the Central Valley. These data were compared with
    satellite observations collected on the same day, and revealed a robust relationship
    between NDVI and F c (Fig. 2(a)). This approach is consistent with previous studies
    showing that various spectral vegetation indices, calculated from visible and
    near-infrared (NIR) reflectance data, are linearly related to canopy light interception
    [37]–[39]. To convert F c to K cb , TOPS-SIMS uses different approaches for retrospective
    versus near real-time mapping of K cb . For retrospective mapping of annual crops
    or for fields where information on the current crop type is available from the
    grower, F c is converted to K cb based on a physical description of the crop canopy
    [40]. A density coefficient ( K d ) , based on F c and estimated plant height,
    is calculated first to link increases in the crop coefficient with increasing
    vegetation amount. K d is then used to interpolate between the minimum and maximum
    K cb for a given crop type, as listed in FAO-56. Using methods described by Fig.
    2. Past studies conducted by USDA in collaboration with NASA [35], [36] provide
    the basis for linking NDVI to fractional cover using relationships that are robust
    across different crop types and canopy architectures ( R 2 =0.97) (a). In (b),
    use of a generalized equation (after methods of Allen and Pereira [40]) for converting
    fractional cover to FAO crop coefficients provides a robust approach for mapping
    K cb values for annual crops ( R 2 =0.90) . When the crop type at a particular
    location is specified or can be identified with confidence, crop specific equations
    may also be applied. Show All Allen and Pereira [40], a crop specific F c − K
    cb conversion can be applied retrospectively to a given field based on the CDL
    crop classification or information provided by the grower or farm manager. The
    CDL is not publicly available until after December 31 of each year, however, presenting
    a challenge for near real-time mapping of K cb using this approach. While the
    crop type for perennial fields (vineyards, orchards) can be reasonably determined
    from prior-year maps, the spatial distribution of annuals, such as lettuce, tomato,
    or cotton, is generally unknown within-season due to the complex and diverse nature
    of the agricultural cropping patterns throughout much of California. A generalized
    F c − K cb relationship representing a best-fit to crop specific relationships
    (Fig. 2(b)) is thus applied for near real-time mapping of fields deemed by CDL
    to contain annual crops. Use of this approach introduces K cb mean estimation
    uncertainty ranging from 3–14% across the major crop categories (vegetables, roots/tubers,
    legumes, fibers, oils, cereals). For perennial crops, results from multi-year
    studies recently performed on large weighing lysimeters at the University of California
    Kearney Agricultural Center are used for F c − K cb conversion [41], [42]. Both
    studies reported a strong relationship between mid-day canopy light interception,
    which is closely related to F c , and the crop coefficient. Finally, ET cb for
    both annuals and perennials is calculated as the product of K cb and ET o . For
    California, ET o is retrieved by TOPS-SIMS via FTP (file transfer protocol) from
    the standard Spatial CIMIS 2 km daily statewide ET o grids. Fig. 3. Examples of
    comparisons between profiles from TOPS-SIMS using generalized (solid blue line)
    and crop-specific (dashed blue line) relationships versus FAO-56 [12] (solid green
    line) for various crops during 2011. The comparisons highlight the ability of
    TOPS-SIMS to modify the idealized FAO-56 for observed crop cover and phenology
    as related to site-specific management practices and local weather conditions.
    Show All TOPS-SIMS simplifies the process of deriving crop coefficients for estimating
    ET cb using an automated data integration and processing system, fully independent
    of contemporaneous crop type classification, and provides a framework for assimilating
    other sensor network observations and models to provide information on crop canopy
    conditions and ET. Crop coefficient values from the fully automated TOPS-SIMS
    compare well with crop coefficients derived from FAO-56 planning guidelines during
    initial growth and at near full cover, but can deviate during vegetative growth
    and maturation. Comparisons for individual fields highlight differences due to
    agronomic practices and crop response to site-specific weather conditions (Fig.
    3). For example, the seasonal profiles for tomatoes and cotton closely match the
    FAO-56 profiles when using a crop-specific formula to convert F c to K cb , while
    lettuce and watermelon were better characterized by the generalized F c − K cb
    conversion. Corn and wheat observations reveal different development rates and
    overall phenological progression than those of FAO. Johnson and Melton [43] also
    compared TOPS-SIMS ET cb estimates against ET c values from SEBAL, which employs
    a more complex energy-balance approach. SEBAL has been widely used to model ET
    over agricultural regions, but requires a highly trained analyst to manually perform
    the required calibrations and operate the model. TOPS-SIMS ET cb values compared
    favorably with SEBAL ET a estimates for unstressed crops for representative San
    Joaquin Valley crop types, with mean differences ranging from 0.4 to 0.85 mm/day
    (Fig. 4). SECTION IV. Integrating Satellite and Surface Sensor Networks With ET
    Models Automated integration of satellite observations of crop canopy development
    with surface observations of ET o is an important first step in developing a fully
    integrated sensor network or “system of systems” capable of providing estimates
    of ET and soil moisture derived from multiple data sources to water managers and
    agricultural producers. Integration of soil moisture observations from soil moisture
    sensor networks installed in agricultural fields is an important additional advance,
    as soil moisture observations can provide operational users with an independent
    check on a water balance derived from satellite ET cb estimates and field-specific
    irrigation and weather records. Integration of soil moisture data also provides
    a mechanism for future automation of model calibration to account for intentional
    deficit irrigation by the grower. It is cost prohibitive to collect soil moisture
    observations across an entire field, but selective use of soil moisture sensors
    can increase confidence in satellite-derived estimates and facilitate use of satellite
    data to scale information derived from soil moisture observations over larger
    areas. Fig. 4. Comparison of daily water use estimates (mm) for unstressed San
    Joaquin Valley fields generated by two satellite-driven models (from Johnson and
    Melton [43]). Actual evapotranspiration ( ET a ) generated using the SEBAL surface
    energy balance approach. Basal evapotranspiration ( ET cb ) generated by TOPS-SIMS.
    Mean absolute error (MAE) in mm/day was calculated as a measure of model agreement,
    as shown. All dates 2009. Show All The cost of soil moisture sensors and wireless
    data loggers has declined substantially over the past decade, and there are now
    a number of commercially available options for growers interested in deploying
    soil moisture sensor networks. In addition, new cost effective techniques have
    been developed for measuring actual ET ( ET a ) in agricultural environments characterized
    by fields on the order of 10–40 hectares. While techniques such as the surface
    renewal approach [22] are still too expensive and complex for use by commercial
    farms growing specialty crops, field instrumentation has now become more cost
    effective, such that multiple sites can be monitored by water management agencies
    or small research teams providing important reference and validation data. To
    assist in understanding relationships between satellite estimates of ET cb and
    surface observations of ET a and soil moisture, we deployed soil moisture sensor
    webs on 12 commercial farms in the Central and Salinas Valleys, in research fields
    located at California State University Fresno in Fresno, CA, and at the University
    of California West Side Research and Extension Center in Five Points, CA. Sensors
    deployed included capacitance probes for volumentric soil water content measurement,
    soil water potential sensors, passive capillary lysimeters for measuring deep
    drainage, in-line flow meters for measuring total applied irrigation, aboveground
    pheno-cams (which record digital images of the field once per day), and meteorological
    stations. In collaboration with CDWR, we also deployed and operated above-ground
    surface renewal stations at seven sites in a range of crops to provide measurements
    of each component of the surface energy balance, facilitating calculation of ET
    a for each site. In surface renewal analysis, ET is calculated as the residual
    of a surface energy balance equation using measured net radiation, ground heat
    flux, and high-frequency measurements of air temperature [22]. These temperature
    traces exhibit low-frequency ramp-like structures which are used to calculate
    sensible heat flux. Surface renewal makes no assumptions regarding atmospheric
    stability, and is here combined with sonic anemometer data to account for unequal
    heating of air parcels across heterogeneous landscapes [44]. Integration of data
    from these sources has clear value for understanding spatial and temporal patterns
    in ET and soil moisture. Integration of satellite derived ET cb data with observations
    of volumetric soil water content and soil water potential has particular value
    for optimization of irrigation scheduling. Fig. 5(a) provides an example for a
    sub-surface drip irrigated cotton field located near Huron, CA. The satellite
    data provides information on the day-to-day crop water use under well-watered
    conditions, while the soil moisture sensors assist in identifying the onset of
    water stress and magnitude of deficit irrigation. The net water balance, or change
    in total estimated soil water content ( SWC e ) , is calculated as: Δ SWC e =P+I−D−
    ET cb View Source Fig. 5. To illustrate the benefits of integrating satellite
    estimates of ET cb with soil moisture measurements from surface sensor networks,
    measures of ET and soil moisture from different sources are plotted for a cotton
    field near Five Points, CA. Cumulative TOPS-SIMS ET cb (green line), combined
    total irrigation and precipitation (light-blue dashed line), net water balance
    (dark-blue dotted line), and observed volumetric soil water content (VWC, brown
    line) are plotted together in (a). On June 8, daily ET cb begins to exceed daily
    precipitation and applied irrigation as indicated by the negative slope of the
    net water balance line. By July 4 the cumulative water balance turns negative
    (indicating potential onset of plant water stress), and deficit irrigation is
    sustained through August. In (b), incorporation of a crop stress coefficient (
    K s ) of 0.85 to account for soil water limitations on plant transpiration from
    July 4 onward (solid green line) substantially improves agreement between ET cb
    estimates from TOPS-SIMS (dashed green line) and ET a measurements from a surface
    renewal station located in the field (solid dark-blue line). Show All where P
    is precipitation in mm measured by the on-site weather station; I is irrigation
    in mm, calculated as the average flow measured in two drip laterals and divided
    by effective irrigated area; D is drainage below the rooting zone measured with
    a Gee capillary lysimeter installed at a depth just below the rooting zone (120
    cm); and ET cb is the basal crop ET in mm. The daily measured volumetric soil
    water content (VWC) is calculated as the average of the volumetric water content
    measured using capacitance probes (Decagon 10 HS) installed at three depths (0–10
    cm, 35–45 cm, and 70–80 cm) at each of eight locations throughout the field. ET
    a is the measured ET from the surface renewal station located in the center of
    the field. As shown in Fig. 5(b), ET a and ET cb agree well during the early stages
    of crop development when the crop is well-watered. After June 8, 2011, daily ET
    cb exceeds total applied irrigation and after July 4, the cumulative water balance
    turns negative. This is reflected in the observed VWC which declines from June
    8 onwards. The sustained negative net water balance also reflects intentional
    deficit irrigation by the grower, and this deficit is captured by the difference
    between the surface renewal ET a measurements and the satellite-based ET cb estimates.
    Plants respond to water stress by reducing transpiration, and under the FAO-56
    approach, a crop water stress coefficient ( K s ) based on soil water content
    is used to account for this reduced transpiration in calculating ET c [12]. The
    addition of a K s coefficient of 0.85 to account for the deficit irrigation results
    in close agreement between the satellite-derived and surface renewal ET a estimates
    (Fig. 5(b)). This example illustrates the potential benefits of using surface
    observations of soil water content or soil water potential measurements in coordination
    with estimates of ET cb that integrate satellite and surface observations. The
    satellite-derived information can assist with tracking the daily irrigation demand,
    while soil moisture sensor networks provide an important check to ensure that
    the timing and magnitude of irrigation deficits are in-line with targets set by
    the grower. SECTION V. Data Distribution via Web Interface and Web Services While
    TOPS-SIMS simplifies the process of integrating satellite and surface observations
    to map K cb and ET cb values, distribution of data and information via intuitive,
    easy to use interfaces is critical to facilitating use of the information by water
    managers and agricultural producers who may not be familiar with the specialized
    data formats used by the remote sensing science community. A web-based user interface
    providing access to visualizations of TOPS-SIMS information eliminates the barriers
    to data access, as only a web browser is needed to view and query the information,
    and no knowledge of specialized data formats is necessary. The TOPS-SIMS web-based
    front-end relies on an open-source software stack that utilizes the Open Layers
    JavaScript library to display maps and execute queries on map data from within
    web browsers (Fig. 6(a)). To facilitate geographic searches by users and provide
    a spatial context for the TOPS-SIMS information products, the interface combines
    TOPS-SIMS overlays with a selection of open-source and commercial base map layers,
    including maps of streets, land use, and aerial imagery. NDVI, F c , and K cb
    overlays are updated on nominal 8-day intervals; ET cb is updated daily. In addition
    to providing views of TOPS-SIMS data at the native 30 m resolution, the web interface
    also allows users to retrieve quantitative information from any variable by specifying
    a point or polygon and requesting the most current values or a time-series summary
    (Fig. 6(b)). Fig. 6. The TOPS-SIMS web interface provides capabilities for visualization
    and data access, including support for geographic queries and selection of data
    for visualization by date. The map in (a) shows ET cb (mm/day) for 3.7 million
    hectares of farmland in the Central and Coastal Valleys on 02-Aug-2011. Retrospective
    time-series for TOPS-SIMS output can be generated, as shown by the K cb graph
    for 2011 for a location near Huron, CA (b). Time-series data can be downloaded
    from the interface in CSV format directly into a spreadsheet for further analysis.
    Show All The TOPS-SIMS web interface relies on data services provided by an open-source
    software stack running a Python-based web server. Tools from the Geographic Data
    Abstraction Library (GDAL) generate the tiles used in the web maps. The server
    responds to map queries by retrieving data resting on an OPeNDAP web service (Open-source
    Project for a Network Data Access Protocol; http://opendap.org) and generates
    time-series charts from the resulting data using the Matplotlib graphics library.
    OPeNDAP is a software framework that facilitates remote access to local data regardless
    of local storage format, and thus simplifies the process of making scientific
    data sets available for other applications via web services. A working beta-version
    of the interface and associated web data services are available at http://ecocast.arc.nasa.gov/sims/,
    and are currently being evaluated by commercial growers, irrigation consultants,
    and water managers in California through a series of ongoing pilot studies. SECTION
    VI. Extending the TOPS-SIMS Framework The current TOPS-SIMS K cb and ET cb mapping
    capabilities demonstrate the potential utility of a modeling framework to integrate
    observations from satellite and surface sensor networks to provide new data and
    information services to the agricultural and water resource management user community.
    However, the TOPS-SIMS modular architecture also allows for a number of extensions
    that can be rapidly implemented to expand the data and information services. Key
    short term objectives include: i)linking TOPS-SIMS to ET o forecasts to provide
    forecasts of irrigation demand at various lead times; ii) use of web services
    and a model web approach [45] to integrate TOPS-SIMS outputs with operational
    and planning models utilized by water managers; iii) incorporation of site specific
    information provided by growers to include generation of customized reports; iv)
    expansion of inputs to include observations from a constellation of moderate resolution
    satellite sensors to increase observation frequency and improve the reliability
    and accuracy of data and information products from TOPS-SIMS; and v) incorporation
    of additional publicly available models for estimation of ET, including satellite-driven
    energy balance models for estimation of ET. At present, managers of agricultural
    water supplies generally rely on historic climate data and static estimates of
    irrigation demand when making decisions about the volume of water to release from
    reservoirs. For agricultural water delivery systems such as the Central Valley
    Project (CVP) and the California State Water Project (SWP), which together provide
    water for 3.75 million acres of California farmland, water managers must rely
    on this historical data to time water releases up to a week or more in advance
    to meet the needs of growers. While water managers must also consider a range
    of other factors, including environmental constraints and hydropower production,
    new sources of data on forecasted irrigation demand could support improvements
    in the ability to anticipate periods of particularly high demand in response to
    high temperatures or sustained winds, while conserving water during cooler periods
    with lower irrigation demand. The recent development of two experimental ET o
    forecasting systems provides the possibility of using forecasts of short-term
    water consumption in place of estimates derived from historic climate data and
    maps of cropping patterns. The NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) Forecasted
    Reference ET (FRET) system2 forecasts ET o with a lead time of up to seven days.
    The FRET forecasts for California are driven by outputs from the Weather Research
    and Forecasting model (WRF) [46], and utilize WRF forecast fields to parameterize
    the Penman-Monteith equation for ET o as adopted by the Environmental Water Resources
    Institute, American Society of Civil Engineers [47]. Experimental 8-day forecasts
    and seasonal ET o outlooks are also being developed by the National Center for
    Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the Bureau of Reclamation, and employ statistical
    forecasting methods to provide probabilistic ET o outlooks3. Data from the NOAA
    NWS FRET system are already being ingested by TOPS-SIMS via a web service, and
    can be directly integrated with K cb maps to provide estimates of weekly irrigation
    demand over California at the scale of individual fields. Pending the outcome
    of ongoing analyses to identify biases and quantify uncertainty in these forecasts
    relative to observed ET o values from CIMIS, data from these forecast systems
    will be applied to produce and distribute ET cb forecasts to agricultural producers
    and water managers to assist in quantification of local, regional, and statewide
    crop water consumption and irrigation demand. Improved data on current and forecasted
    irrigation demand that incorporates satellite observations of crop conditions
    can also be incorporated into operational models utilized by the CDWR such as
    CALSIM [48], and planning models such as Cal-SIMETAW [49], [50]. Incorporating
    recent historic data into these models has potential utility for evaluating past
    decisions on water releases, identifying opportunities for future improvement
    in delivery of water to growers, and developing strategies for implementation
    of water markets during drought years. In cases where forecasted demand is significantly
    higher or lower than historic demand for a given period, water operations managers
    could adjust management practices and improve their ability to deliver water to
    growers when and where it is most needed. Satellite derived K cb and ET cb maps
    are also potentially valuable as inputs into longer term planning models, and
    the development of a 10+ year record of observed crop canopy conditions and K
    cb values could lead to improvements in models used for long term planning, such
    as Cal-SIMETAW. Because TOPS-SIMS is implemented on NEX and data products are
    already distributed via an OPeNDAP web service, integration with other models
    is straight-forward, as data can be requested via existing web services, and data
    not already available in the NEX archive can be rapidly generated by TOPS-SIMS.
    Incorporation of site-specific information from growers can assist in eliminating
    sources of uncertainty in estimating ET associated with crop type, the timing
    and amount of irrigation applied, and the irrigation system configuration. Research
    is ongoing to extend the TOPS-SIMS framework to allow growers to specify this
    information for individual fields, facilitating use of crop-specific relationships
    for mapping K cb from satellite data, and allowing growers to specify correction
    factors to account for intentional deficit irrigation or a leaching fraction.
    Grower information on precedent irrigation schedule and irrigation system type
    would allow estimation of soil evaporation and conversion of ET cb to ET c . Allowing
    growers to input information on irrigation system type and application rates would
    also allow TOPS-SIMS to translate ET cb into recommended irrigation system run
    times. TOPS-SIMS algorithms for deriving K cb from NDVI currently rely on data
    from the Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+ , and MODIS satellite sensors, but NDVI can
    also be derived from observations from multiple other satellite sensors currently
    collecting data in the red and near-infrared wavelengths at resolutions from 20
    m to 60 m. Data from the SPOT-5 satellite instruments, the Indian Resource Satellite
    Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS), and the upcoming Landsat Data Continuity Mission
    (LDCM) and Sentinel-2 satellite mission offer the potential for integration of
    observations into a “system of systems” to provide field-scale observations of
    crop canopy development multiple times per week, reducing data latency and data
    gaps resulting from cloud cover. While issues associated with inter-sensor calibrations
    must be fully resolved [51] and open data policies have not yet been finalized
    for all of these missions, TOPS-SIMS provides a framework for ingesting and compositing
    data from a constellation of moderate resolution (30–250 m) sensors to provide
    robust and reliable data and information services to agricultural producers and
    water managers. Finally, TOPS-SIMS is designed to support multiple models for
    estimation of ET from satellite observations, including energy balance models
    that incorporate information from the thermal bands on Earth observation satellites.
    The initial suite of algorithms implemented within TOPS-SIMS relies on the use
    of spectral information in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths to map F
    c and K cb values since this approach can be fully automated. As research progresses
    on automation of the internal calibration procedures for energy balance models
    [20], TOPS-SIMS is designed to support integration of these models, and to facilitate
    use of a suite of publicly-available models to provide a robust capability for
    automated, frequent, field-scale mapping of ET over regions the size of the western
    U.S. SECTION VII. Summary TOPS-SIMS employs a “system of systems” approach and
    applies the TOPS modeling framework to ingest observations from satellite and
    surface sensor networks to provide new data and information products to agricultural
    producers and water managers via easily accessible web interfaces and web services.
    The current framework supports near real-time mapping of indicators of crop canopy
    development and crop water consumption at field scales over 3.7 million ha of
    California farmland. Integration of satellite-derived estimates of basal crop
    evapotranspiration with observations of soil moisture from surface sensor networks
    offers promise for supporting agricultural producers and water managers working
    to optimize management of agricultural water resources. Use of the NEX computing
    architecture enables rapid processing of large volumes of satellite data and facilitates
    implementation of TOPS-SIMS over regions potentially as large as the western U.S.
    TOPS-SIMS is designed to integrate additional models and data services to support
    forecasting of crop irrigation requirements at weekly to seasonal lead times,
    and concurrent modeling of potential and actual crop evapotranspiration. Future
    integration of observations from a constellation of moderate resolution satellites
    would support further improvements in the frequency and long-term operational
    reliability of satellite-derived estimates of evapotranspiration and crop water
    requirements. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The energy-balance comparison data were generated

  description: In recent years, precision agriculture and Wireless Sensor Network
    (WSN) technology have attracted great attention and concentration in industrial
    and academic levels. The combination between WSNs and the agricultural sector
    will be beneficial to solve several issues and challenges. This combination can
    realize a set of benefits such as improving the quality of the agricultural product,
    increasing the efficiency of production, improving the efficiency of crop, and
    conserving energy and water resources. Precision agriculture manages a set of
    different services (e.g., irrigation, fertilization), especially irrigation systems.
    The irrigation system is considered one of the most critical factors for successful
    agricultural production and development of the agriculture. However, the current
    irrigation systems are characterized by poor performance and a significant increase
    in demand for agricultural productivity. In addition, these current systems are
    affected by many factors and problems such as the water scarcity, drought, and
    waste of limited water resources. To correct these problems, we propose a prototype
    for an intelligent irrigation system that is based on the integration of a drip
    irrigation technique with the wireless sensor network. In this paper, we develop
    an automated and intelligent irrigation technique using a WSN and ZigBee wireless
    communication technology for saving water and increasing the performance and efficiency
    of irrigation systems and we present the operation and design of this system.
    The proposed system controls irrigation water through the detection of temperature
    and soil moisture and other environmental parameters; the data is measured using
    several special sensors deployed near the root part of plants. This system also
    allows an analysis and checks the measured data with a developed base of threshold
    values for each measured parameter in order to activate or deactivate the irrigation
    mechanism. The main aims of our proposed system are saving of water, time, and
    energy.

  description: This research presents the designing of a smart irrigation system to
    automatically supply water and fertilizer to different plants depending on each
    plant 's individual requirement and the integration of this smart irrigation system
    to a domestic home. The microcontroller was programmed to operate under two modes.
    Fully automated and semi-Automated. These two modes give all the monitoring information
    to the user in real-Time, while fully automated mode provides water and fertilizer
    to the plants calculating optimum conditions with minimum human interaction. Microcontroller
    was programmed to (1) analyze and process the received input data from soil moisture
    sensors, humidity and temperature sensors, (2) check the activated mode and other
    user settings, and (3) control the valves to water or fertilize the plants accordingly.
    Microcontroller and the IoT device maintain communication to receive or send data
    to the user through internet. A web interface was developed to display sensor
    data and with a control interface for the user. The user can connect to the system
    through Wi-Fi to access the web interface. By using the controls, soil moisture,
    temperature and humidity thresholds can be changed, and watering or fertilization
    systems can be activated. For data analysis and flowrate simulations, 'SolidWorks'
    was used. Using the same software, the enclosures and other hardware components
    needed to store the microcontroller, the Wi-Fi module, the power supply, and connector
    array of sensors were designed, 3D printed, and the complete system was assembled
    and tested.

    a smart irrigation system to automatically supply water and fertilizer to different
    plants depending on each plant ’s individual requirement and the integration of
    this smart irrigation system to a domestic home. The microcontroller was programmed
    to operate under two modes. Fully automated and semi-automated. These two modes
    give all the monitoring information to the user in real-time, while fully automated
    mode provides water and fertilizer to the plants calculating optimum conditions
    with minimum human interaction. Microcontroller was programmed to (1) analyze
    and process the received input data from soil moisture sensors, humidity and temperature
    sensors, (2) check the activated mode and other user settings, and (3) control
    the valves to water or fertilize the plants accordingly. Microcontroller and the
    IoT device maintain communication to receive or send data to the user through
    internet. A web interface was developed to display sensor data and with a control
    interface for the user. The user can connect to the system through Wi-Fi to access
    the web interface. By using the controls, soil moisture, temperature and humidity
    thresholds can be changed, and watering or fertilization systems can be activated.
    For data analysis and flowrate simulations, ‘SolidWorks’ was used. Using the same
    software, the enclosures and other hardware components needed to store the microcontroller,
    the Wi-Fi module, the power supply, and connector array of sensors were designed,
    3D printed, and the complete system was assembled and tested. Published in: 2022

    Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia SECTION I. Introduction The amount of sunlight, the amount
    of water and the amount of nutrition a plant gets and as well as the environment
    temperature can have a huge impact on the growth of a plant. To maintain a plant
    these factors must be taken care of. Among them watering the plants is the most
    frequent activity. Traditionally, watering the plants is done regularly without
    a concern about the amount of water the plant gets. A smart system, where the
    amount of water and the environmental factors are always monitored and regulated
    can be of a huge help in the growth of a plant. [1], [2]. It is found that the
    upcoming trends and most of the existing home designs include small roof or balcony
    gardens to fuse in with nature. On the other hand, while adding an element of
    beauty to the homes, these small roof or balcony gardens poses the issue of having
    to dedicate the homeowner’s time to tend to these plants. In our research project
    we are designing a smart irrigation system that can be incorporated into small
    roof or balcony gardens to overcome the issue of having to carry out this monotonous
    task of watering these plants and the need to determine when to water these plants.
    The main reason for carrying out this research project is to help overcome the
    tedious tasks of maintaining a garden which requires the homeowner’s attention
    and time. Determining when to water the plants as well as how much water should
    be supplied at a certain time requires a lot of attention and practice from the
    side of the owner. Different types of plants require different volumes of water
    [3] and watering should be done at different times of the day. A correct watering
    schedule is essential for the healthy growth of plants. If too little water is
    supplied, the plant will not have enough water to successfully carry out photosynthesis,
    and the plant will wilt. In case of flowering plants, they will not bloom and
    in plants that produce fruits, the yield will decrease if the supply of water
    is lower than that is needed. If this incorrect watering pattern continues the
    plants will eventually die. Conversely, if too much water is supplied, in addition
    to the wastage, it will damage the roots of plants. Too much water reduces the
    air pockets present in soil and this will result in less water been absorbed by
    the roots. This will result in plant diseases as well as death of the plants.
    Therefore, only the necessary volume of water should be supplied to the plants
    at the correct time to maintain a healthy garden and to increase yield of fruits
    and flowers. This proposed method will help the homeowners in this aspect. In
    addition, a social aspect of carrying out this research project is to reduce the
    wastage of water. Water is essential for humans, and it is also critical for the
    sustainable development of humans. Access to clean water is decreasing day by
    day. The unplanned use of water in the irrigation of plants further adds to this.
    The conservation of water should be a major objective when designing irrigation
    systems for any purpose like for gardening, agriculture or even in maintaining
    lawns. In our proposed method we will be determining the optimum amount of water
    that should be supplied and only that amount will be supplied to the plants. Therefore,
    we believe our research project will also help in conserving this essential resource
    by the effective usage of water, so that in turn it will help the whole world.
    SECTION II. Literature Review There are numerous projects carried on the aspect
    of designing smart irrigation systems. These projects have their own advantages
    and disadvantages. One such proposed method allows the user to remotely control
    the system, but this system needs the user to analyze the current soil moisture
    level given by the sensors and set the motor status to ‘On’ and ‘Off’ states when
    required. Although this method has the advantage of controlling the system from
    a remote location, it needs considerable attention from the user if he needs to
    supply only the required amount of water and when the water is needed [5]. Another
    such proposed method uses only a method to detect the need to water the plants,
    it does not suggest a method to automatically supply the water to the plants [7].
    A study on a smart Irrigation system for a crop field using IoT for Surveillance
    [6] - An Arduino microcontroller, a soil moisture sensor and a temperature and
    humidity sensor are used. Two sensors have been used therefore it increases reliability.
    The DHT11 sensor, has been selected mainly due to its very low cost. Bluetooth
    has been used as the communication protocol since it consumes less power, but
    it provides very limited range between the two devices involved in the communication.
    GSM based Automated Rain gun Irrigation-System [4] - Only soil moisture sensors
    are used. The user should press a button in the calling function to give the signal
    back to the microcontroller to control the valves, therefore user’s attention
    and time is needed. The GSM module and microcontroller are connected using a MAX232
    device. Sending the message to the user using GSM repeatedly will add to higher
    costs [4], [11]. SECTION III. Methodology The implementation of the system was
    covered under 3 parts: the physical design, embedded system, and the web application.
    An extensive literature review was carried out initially. Then the optimum components:
    soil moisture sensor, temperature and humidity sensor, level sensors, micro-controller,
    the WiFi module and the solenoid valves were selected. By considering the pros
    and cons of the different irrigation methods available, localized irrigation method
    was selected. The physical system was initially designed in a 2D platform by using
    Draw.io software and then using Solid-Works (Fig. 1). The microcontroller was
    programed to take input readings from the sensors and then give an output according
    to the obtained readings. The threshold values for the soil moisture sensors were
    also determined experimentally. Then the microcontroller was programmed to control
    the solenoid valves according to the obtained soil moisture and temperature values.
    Next a Serial communication link was established between the microcontroller and
    the Wi-Fi module. Then a web interface with all the monitoring information and
    controls of the system was developed. Finally, all the parts were integrated,
    and system was tested. A. System Hardware Fig. 1. SolidWorks Design Show All The
    Arduino MEGA microcontroller - It contains 54 digital I/O pins and 16 analog inputs.
    It was selected because of its comparatively low cost, the higher number of I/O
    pins and the ease of programming. Arduino IDE is used to program this microcontroller.
    The capacitive soil moisture sensor v1.2 - These sensors measure the changes in
    the dielectric. Dielectric is the ability to transmit electric force without conduction.
    The dielectric is mainly affected by water, thus when the water level changes,
    it causes a change in the dielectric formed in the soil. This change in dielectric
    cause a change in the capacitance and this is measured by the sensors. Temperature
    and humidity sensor – These sensors are used to measure both the air temperature
    and moisture level. The DHT22 sensor was selected as the temperature and humidity
    sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the air
    and gives out a digital signal. It does not require any analog input pins. The
    DHT22 sensor gives more accurate readings compared to the DHT11 sensors. This
    sensor is desirable for making readings over the range of − 40 ∘ C to 80 ∘ C temperature
    readings with ± 0.5 ∘ C accuracy. It has a sample rating of 0.5Hz. It is also
    a low-cost sensor. Optical Infrared Water Liquid Level Sensor - This sensor contains
    no mechanical moving parts and can be mounted using a locking nut. It has an operating
    voltage of 5VDC. Wi Fi module - ESP8266 which is a System on a Chip (SoC) was
    selected as the Wi – Fi module. It contains a 32 – bit microcontroller named as
    Tensilica L106 and a Wi – Fi transceiver. It consists of 11 GPIO pins and an analog
    input. The ESP8266 has only one analog input pin but we require four analog pins
    for this system, therefore a microcontroller is also used. To program this module,
    Arduino IDE was selected because of the easiness of this method. ESP8266 NodeMCU
    was selected to program because it is a development board with a USB interface.
    Therefore, it can be programmed over USB directly. Solenoid valves - Selected
    solenoid valve was DC 12V Electric Solenoid Valve Water Air Normally Closed. This
    solenoid valve was selected because of its low price, efficiency, high quality,
    good performance, low power consumption, long life service, and easy to use. And
    this valve was selected it can take care pressure up to 0.8Mpa. For this project
    we need 9 solenoid valves. Relay - It acts as a switch in the circuit. The relay
    operates on the concept of electromagnetic induction. According to the electromagnetic
    induction principle, when current flows through a relay coil, a magnetic field
    is created. This field draws the conduction plate, and when the current stops
    flowing, the coil releases the conduction plate, providing the relay with switching
    action. B. Software Dreamweaver software - The ESP8266 NodeMCU module was used
    to develop the back end while Dreamweaver software is used to make the front end
    of the webpage. Dreamweaver is a software which allows to design, code, and manage
    websites. This software lets us to write codes and to make website by using a
    visual interface. Dreamweaver supports CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and HTML also. Therefore,
    it’s easy to use for developing websites. The front end of the web page was completed
    with Dreamweaver software. HTML language is used in the Dreamweaver software.
    The Dreamweaver software supports HTML, JavaScript, XML and CSS. HTML codes can
    be developed with a split view in Dreamweaver. In the split view, there are two
    screens divided horizontally, one at the top which is referred to as a live view
    and one at the bottom which is referred to as the code view. C. System Functions
    Fig. 2. System Block Diagram Show All The proposed smart irrigation system consists
    of an Arduino MEGA microcontroller, capacitive soil moisture sensors, DHT22 temperature
    and humidity sensor, optical level sensors and an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module (Fig. 2).
    The overall system was designed to implement in the following way. The sensors
    will sense the environment of the plant and send the readings to the microcontroller.
    Then the data obtained from the sensors will be analyzed and compared with the
    threshold values that were predefined by the user. These predefined values can
    be varied by the user through the web application. Then depending on the soil
    moisture and temperature values the decision whether to water the plants or not
    will be decided and the microcontroller will turn the solenoid valves ON or OFF.
    The function was developed such that for each of the plants, first the soil moisture
    reading will be compared with their respective predefined threshold values. If
    the value is above the threshold value, the next condition will be checked to
    see whether the temperature value is below the threshold value. If the temperature
    reading is below the threshold value, it will open the solenoid valve connected
    with that plant to let water flow into the plant. Therefore, the solenoid valve
    will open only if both the soil moisture and temperature criteria are fulfilled.
    If either condition is not satisfied, the solenoid valve will remain turned off.
    When water is supplied to the plant after the solenoid valve is opened, the soil
    moisture content in the soil will increase (refer Fig. 3 and Table I). The soil
    moisture sensors continuously measure the moisture content with a delay of 1 second,
    so with the increasing amount of water added, the moisture reading will continue
    to decrease. When the decreasing soil moisture value drops below the threshold
    value, it will turn the solenoid valve off. For the above function the threshold
    value for temperature is taken as 27 ∘ C . This is because if water is supplied
    to the plants when the temperature is higher than 27 ∘ C , this will affect the
    metabolic functions in the plants. Further, when temperature is high, the water
    will evaporate quickly from the soil and also from the surface of the leaves through
    stomata. This will make the watering process inefficient. Therefore, the temperature
    reading of 27 ∘ C was taken as the optimum threshold value. The sensor readings
    will be displayed to the user via the web page. It was designed with four main
    items such as home, statistics, settings and about. All the four sections consist
    of information relevant to the system and they were placed with buttons. In the
    home section, current soil moisture values, temperature and humidity values are
    included. In the settings section, additional features can be set. Status of the
    fully automated mode Status of the semi – automated mode The user has freedom
    to select any mode, and to monitor status of the modes. In the about section,
    it shows the main information about the system. Through the webpage, the user
    can monitor the-soil moisture sensor readings and temperature and humidity, and
    they too can give the command to water the plants or not depending on the information
    displayed to them. If the fertilizer level is low, the user will be notified and
    request the user to fill it. This system could be controlled with a high level
    of flexibility through the web page. Therefore, the user can have the access to
    fully control the system via a laptop or smartphone. D. Physical Implementation
    This physical design was implemented with the aims of reducing the cost, power
    consumption, maintenance cost and the complexity. The user may prefer to set this
    system either inside or outside in the open, therefore when implementing the design,
    special attention was given to the following factors. The wiring of the system
    was done with utmost care because an unsafe wiring would be highly dangerous in
    conditions of rain and especially when pets and people are around. The surrounding
    material should be corrosive free to increase the safety and durability of the
    system. Further, the material of the system should be highly durable and should
    be able to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Two different pipelines were
    installed to supply the fertilizers and water separately. Initially silicon pipes
    were used but when the components were tested under different weather conditions
    it was found that when exposed to sun for several days the pipes become distorted.
    This could cause leakages which will in turn lead to changes in flow rates through
    the pipes. Therefore, the silicon pipes were replaced with PVC pipes which have
    good heat resistance and higher durability than silicon pipes. To protect the
    micro-controller, relay modules, ESP8226 module and the solenoid valves enclosures
    were created. In addition, wires were run through conduit tubes. By doing so we
    completely water sealed the above stated electric components. Table (Table I)
    shows the performance of the solenoid valves. Table I Summary of Solenoid Valve
    Operation SECTION IV. Results A. Deriving an equation to obtain a connection between
    sensor readings and moisture level The threshold value for the soil moisture sensors
    was found experimentally using the following process. A unit sample of the soil
    composition which is used to grow the plants was taken. Initially the soil moisture
    reading of the soil sample that was left dry for 24 hours was measured. This value
    was considered as the soil moisture reading for 0% water content. Then water volumes
    of 100ml were added each within equal time intervals of 2 minutes. To improve
    the accuracy, this was repeated three times with three different unit samples
    of the soil composition and the average value was calculated for each volume.
    The table (Table II) shows the average value of the readings that were obtained
    for each volume. The logic of controlling the solenoid valves is provided with
    below figure (Fig. 3). The graph of soil moisture sensor reading against volume
    of water added was plotted (Fig. 4). Fig. 3. Solenoid valve controlling logic
    Show All Table II Average Value of the Readings Obtained For Each Volume Fig.
    4. Soil moisture sensor reading against Water Volume Show All A linearized equation:
    a Polynomial trendline of 6th order was obtained (dotted line in Fig. 4) and the
    relevant equation was derived (1). y=0.0043 x 6 −0.1678 x 5 +2.5863 x 4 −19.75
    x 3 +78.704 x 2 −175.3x+394.96 (1) View Source In the above equation ’y’ is the
    sensor reading and ’x’ is the water level. Equation (1) can be used for any particular
    plant that is to be planted in the garden as the relevant sensor value for the
    required moisture level can be obtained. That sensor value is the threshold value
    that is utilized to operate the functionality of the solenoid valves. Sensor readings
    were displayed to the user on Arduino serial monitor (Fig. 5). Fig. 5. Sensor
    values and messages displayed on Arduino serial monitor Show All B. Web Application
    WebSocket was used for sending and receiving data to make the communication between
    the client and the server. To display the sensor readings in the web page, WebSocket
    server was established in the code at a particular port. Some functions which
    are responsible to start the WebSocket server and receive data from the client
    were declared in the code. A JavaScript base code was written inside the HTML
    document to develop the WebSocket server on the client side. A function was constructed
    on the HTML document to get the messages that sent through the serial monitor.
    The messages were displayed on the text areas which were set to the sensor values
    separately. We could get the actual data from the sensors by using the read method
    of the serial object (Fig. 7). Before that, the user should provide username and
    password to log into the web page (Fig. 6). After the username and the password
    are given, user can view the web page which have all the monitoring and controlling
    information. From the main menus in the web page, user has freedom to select any
    section. All the sensor readings can be viewed from “Home” section (Fig. 7). Watering
    process could be activated from the “Settings” section. The status of the modes
    can be obtained as the mode is changed by the user (Fig. 8) Threshold values for
    the sensor values can be set by the user as he/she wants. According to the threshold
    values, the watering process could be activated. In the settings section, the
    overall system can be controlled through the semi – automatic mode or fully automatic
    mode. Four functions were developed inside the HTML document which belongs to
    the settings section of the web page, to perform the function for the ON and OFF
    buttons in the semi – automatic mode and fully automatic mode (Fig. 8). The code
    was modified inside the ESP server to read out the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
    formatted data and to turn on and off fully automatic mode and semi – automatic
    mode. To develop the code in the ESP side, Arduino JSON library was installed
    into the Arduino IDE. Front end of the web page was developed with Dreamweaver
    software while the back end part of the web page was developed with Arduino IDE.
    The implemented web page was successful as the mode selection, sensor reading
    display was 100 % functional. The final fabricated prototype of the overall system
    was obtained with high accuracy (Fig. 9). Fig. 6. Login Page of the Web page Show
    All Fig. 7. Sensor readings displayed during testing Show All Fig. 8. Settings
    section of the web page Show All SECTION V. Conclusion and Future Work In this
    project we have presented an accurate, reliable and user-friendly method to detect
    the need to water the plants and supply water to the plants either automatically
    or with the user intervention remotely through a web application. The testing
    phase was carried out with four plants by individually monitoring them and supplying
    them with water and fertilizers. The results obtained from the testing phase portrays
    that the system successfully operates according to the obtained soil moisture
    level and the ambient temperature. An equation was derived (Eq. (1)) to make a
    connection between the soil moisture percentage and the sensor reading values.
    This reduces the set-up time of the system drastically as the sensor calibration
    time is significantly reduced. Since the system was developed in a modular form,
    it can be expanded or changed according to the physical environment without doing
    any major change to the components which increases the versatility and adaptability
    of the system. In our project, the system can be controlled through a laptop or
    a smart phone that can access the web page and the web page was functioning as
    intended. Fig. 9. Fabricated Prototype Show All As future development, we can
    integrate our system into a smart home. Also, a dedicated app can be made for
    the system for both Android and iOS platforms. Also, the user requires certain
    technical knowledge to change the threshold levels of the solenoid valves. Therefore,
    separate section can be made in the web page which allows the user to change the
    threshold values via the web page itself. This will make this system more user
    friendly and approachable for people. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics

  relevance_evaluation: The paper is moderately relevant to the point of combining
    data from multiple sources for a comprehensive view of system health. While the
    paper focuses on the use of sensors to monitor soil moisture, humidity, and temperature
    for irrigation management, it does not explicitly discuss the combination of data
    from other sources or the use of fusion techniques like Kalman filters or Dempster-Shafer
    theory. However, the system's reliance on multiple sensors and its ability to
    analyze and process the received input data suggest its potential applicability
    to a broader range of data sources and fusion techniques in the future.

  description: This paper aims to implement a wireless sensor network to automate
    greenhouse operations, with the primary objective of achieving optimal plant growth
    conditions. To effectively monitor crucial micro-climatic parameters such as temperature,
    soil moisture, light, pH, and salinity, the system employs slave unit sensor nodes
    equipped with a diverse array of sensors. Additionally, a mobile application is
    utilized to enable farmers to set customized threshold values for each parameter,
    granting them complete control over the greenhouse environment via their mobile
    devices. These threshold values serve as benchmarks to ensure that the growing
    conditions remain within desired ranges. Multiple slave units have been strategically
    deployed throughout the greenhouse to ensure comprehensive and accurate data collection.
    Each slave unit actively collects sensor data and efficiently transmits it wirelessly
    to the central master unit. The master unit plays a vital role in the automation
    process by receiving the data set by the mobile application and meticulously comparing
    it with the real-time data received from the slave units. This meticulous comparison
    allows the system to precisely assess the current conditions against the desired
    threshold values. Based on this comparison, the system takes prompt actions to
    regulate and maintain the most favorable growing conditions for the plants, optimizing
    their growth potential. An essential aspect of this system's design is the integration
    of edge computing, enabling localized processing and decision-making. This approach
    significantly reduces latency and dependence on constant cloud connectivity, ensuring
    that the system remains responsive and reliable, even in areas with limited network
    coverage. The implementation of this automated greenhouse system brings numerous
    benefits to agriculturists, as it alleviates the burden of manual monitoring and
    control. Instead, farmers can concentrate on strategic planning and overall agricultural
    management, optimizing their efforts for improved productivity. Moreover, the
    system's ability to maintain optimal growing conditions results in maximized crop
    yield while promoting resource-efficient and environmentally sustainable farming
    practices.

    devices. These threshold values serve as benchmarks to ensure that the growing
    conditions remain within desired ranges. Multiple slave units have been strategically
    deployed throughout the greenhouse to ensure comprehensive and accurate data collection.
    Each slave unit actively collects sensor data and efficiently transmits it wirelessly
    to the central master unit. The master unit plays a vital role in the automation
    process by receiving the data set by the mobile application and meticulously comparing
    it with the real-time data received from the slave units. This meticulous comparison
    allows the system to precisely assess the current conditions against the desired
    threshold values. Based on this comparison, the system takes prompt actions to
    regulate and maintain the most favorable growing conditions for the plants, optimizing
    their growth potential. An essential aspect of this system''s design is the integration
    of edge computing, enabling localized processing and decision-making. This approach
    significantly reduces latency and dependence on constant cloud connectivity, ensuring
    that the system remains responsive and reliable, even in areas with limited network
    coverage. The implementation of this automated greenhouse system brings numerous
    benefits to agriculturists, as it alleviates the burden of manual monitoring and
    control. Instead, farmers can concentrate on strategic planning and overall agricultural

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Bengaluru, India SECTION I. Introduction
    Climate change introduces us to many problems and the challenge is intensified
    by agriculture''s extreme vulnerability to climate change. Climate change is already
    having a negative impact, with rising temperatures, increased weather variability,
    shifting ecosystem boundaries, invasive crops and pests, and more frequent extreme
    weather events. The solution for such a problem is a controlled environment such
    as a greenhouse, also called a glasshouse, which is a building designed for the
    protection of tender or out-of-season plants against excessive cold or heat. Maintenance
    and working in the greenhouse are tough as the knowledge of multiple parameters
    such as Electric Conductivity (EC), pH, light intensity, humidity, moisture, and
    temperature is required. This procedure simplified the problem of obtaining the
    reading and the steps required to preserve the plants in a controlled environment.
    Here, drip irrigation is automated to water the plants in a regulated manner on
    a regular basis. Also, it aims to maintain pH and EC using water, by adding fertilizer
    and salt to control pH and EC [1]. Install automated light bulbs and curtains
    to control the light received by the plants in a regulated manner based on the
    plant''s requirements. For example, Gerbera is commercially propagated through
    the division of clumps (suckers). Tissue-cultured plants, on the other hand, can
    be used for commercial flower production. Day temperature of 22- 300C and night
    temperature of 120C to 160C is ideal for growth and flower production. An adequate
    amount of shade net (50%) must be provided to regulate excess light and temperature.
    Humidity should be maintained at 60% Farmers need frequent visits to their farms
    for tasks like watering and fertilizing, which can be costly and time-consuming.
    As agricultural lands grow, remote monitoring and management systems are becoming
    more prevalent. However, weak or inadequate internet connectivity can hinder remote
    farm monitoring and control. The Internet of Things is typically used in agriculture
    through a monitoring network with numerous sensor nodes. Using edge computing,
    which distributes the cloud server burden and reduces wait times, could help address
    this issue. Edge computing applications include pest identification, product safety
    tracking, autonomous equipmentuse, promoting agricultural technology, and intelligent
    management [2]. The paper is divided into 6 sections. Section 1, consists of an
    introduction and motivation. In section 2, a detailed literature review is presented.
    Section 3 consists of the system overview which includes information about the
    slave unit, master unit, methodology, and block diagrams. Section 4 is all about
    hardware and software implementation with all flowcharts. Section 5 explains about
    Results. In Section 6, the conclusion is mentioned. SECTION II. Related Work Greenhouses
    are structures, either with frames or inflated, that are covered with transparent
    materials. They are designed to provide a suitable environment for plant growth,
    allowing for optimal growth and productivity by controlling environmental-mental
    conditions to a partial or full extent. This section includes research done in
    Smart Greenhouse monitoring Systems and EDGE Computing. An automatic irrigation
    system using edge nodes has beenproposed that is unaffected by communication delay
    and disconnection [3]. The Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi 3 Model B were evaluated
    as edge node candidates andthe Jetson Nano was found to perform better at hightemperatures.
    The system can be used to evaluate AImodels and determine water stress for crop
    cultivation. It is currently used for high sugar tomato cultivation in Japan with
    manual parameter management. An Intelligent IoT-based Automated Irrigation system
    has been developed that captures sensor data on soil moisture and temperature.
    The data is communicated to a Raspberry Pi3 control unit where a KNN machine learning
    algorithmis used for analysis and irrigation prediction. The system is developed
    using cheap embedded systems such as Raspberry Pi 3 and Arduino Uno [4]. A wireless
    sensor network is used to gather data for the prediction of energy and water requirements
    for maintaining a greenhouse''s climate [5]. The input data from sensors is processed
    using fuzzy logic methods to produce output data. The greenhouse is managed and
    monitored through an Android-based user interface. The paper [6] presents a system
    architecture that integrates artificial intelligence at the local network layer
    for smart agriculture and farming applications. Edge and Fog computing, as well
    as LPWAN technology, are used to extend functionality and solve the low-bandwidth
    transmission challenge of LPWAN technologies. The system includes a sensor node,
    an Edge gateway, LoRa repeaters, a Fog gateway, cloud servers, and an end-user
    terminal application. The article in [7], discusses the potential of wireless
    sensors and IoT in agriculture and the challenges of integrating this technology
    with traditional farming practices. It lists the available sensors for soil preparation,
    crop status, irrigation, and insect/pest detection, and how this technology helps
    the growers throughout the crop stages. Applying the fuzzy logic method to the
    input data from sensors (temperature and humidity sensors, such as the DHT11)
    has produced the output data. Through an Android-based user interface, the writers
    manage andkeep an eye on the greenhouse [8]. A greenhouse smartphone monitoring
    system has been suggested that combines Eclipse''s Android programming tools and
    Visual Studio''s C++/MFC. The system offers strong cross-platform and secondary
    development portability, enabling real-time data interchange between client software
    and the core module [9]. The article [10] provides a comprehensive overview of
    important technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence used in agriculture
    to inform consumers about the products they consume. The research also sheds light
    on difficulties encountered with tasks like task assignment, data analysis, service
    stability, and privacy protection. Edge AI, also known as local network layer
    artificial intelligence, enables smart farming and agricultural applications using
    edge and fog computing as well as LPWANtechnology for extensive coverage. Moving
    data analyticsand compression close to end devices solves the low-bandwidth transmission
    issue of LPWAN technologies. The system [11], [12] includes a sensor node, an
    Edgegateway, LoRa repeaters, a Fog gateway, cloud servers, and an end-user terminal
    application. The article discusses the impact of IoT-based technologies on smart
    agriculture and the potential of wireless sensors. It lists sensors for various
    agricultural applications and explains how they aid farmers throughout the production
    process. The article also highlights modern IoT-based agricultural systems and
    platforms. The article [13] highlights the state-of-the-art IoT-based architectures
    and platforms used in agriculture. The system that forecasts how much water and
    energy willbe needed to keep greenhouse climate factors like soil moisture, relative
    humidity, and temperature stable. Using a wireless sensor network, node packs
    arranged in a star topology are used to gather the data needed for predictions.
    The papers [14], [15] discusses the advantages of advanced wireless sensor networks
    for soil sampling processes, the challenge of maintaining power supply, and the
    potential of ambient energy harvesting as a solution, while also noting the current
    limitations of battery less sensor nodes for extensive environmental monitoring.
    The paper presents a Wireless SensorNetwork prototype with MicaZ nodes for monitoring
    temperature, light, pressure, and humidity in greenhouses, sharing measurement
    data through the Internet of Things for remote control by farmers via mobile phones
    or computers. The paper explores the automation of greenhouse monitoring systems
    using edge nodes, automated plant watering, and sensors to track temperature,
    light, humidity, and soil moisture. It highlights the significance of also monitoring
    soil pH and EC, which can be challenging when dealing with multiple plantation
    areas. To address this, a mobile application and a master-slave unit are proposed,
    enabling the owner to manage all parameters remotely and efficiently across different
    greenhouse sections. SECTION III. The System Overview The system consists of both
    hardware and software technologies. The following sections describe the methodology
    and the block diagram of the system. The goal of this Paper is to fully automate
    a greenhouse shown in Fig. 1. There are three parts in the system, 1. Mobile Application.
    2. Slave unit. and 3. Master Unit. The Mobile application is used to set the parameters
    with respect to the plantation area. The Slave units are implemented in the plantation
    area of the greenhouse and used to sense the temperature, light, moisture, pH,
    and salinity using multiple sensors. The sensed data are sent to the master unit
    wirelessly. The data received from the Slave unit is to the master unit. The master
    unit will take appropriate action to control parameters in the greenhouse with
    respect to the data set by the owner through the mobile application. To regulate
    the pH, EC, temperature, and moisture, a separate solution is prepared and kept
    in a tank. The app helps the user (Farmer)to view the greenhouse condition and
    change, control, and setparameters for the plants as required remotely. The app
    also contains default parameters to set for specific plants. Fig. 1. Block Diagram
    of Greenhouse. Show All A. Mobile Application The owner-specified plant''s threshold
    values for temperature, moisture, light, and soil pH are set using a mobileapplication.
    Users must first sign up and log in using the same email. Users can set data in
    2 modes in the application. The first one is done manually using a slider as shown
    in Fig. 2(a), and if the plant owner is unaware of its specifications, they can
    simply choose the plant type as shown in Fig. 2(b). In accordance with the owner''s
    threshold valve, the master unit will take the appropriate action. Fig. 2. (a)
    Login page of app. (b) Manual setting using slider and Plant type selection. Show
    All B. Slave Unit The Slave unit consists of temperature, luminosity, pH, and
    soil EC sensors along with a microcontroller i.e., ESP32 as shown in Fig. 3. The
    sensor node senses the environmental parameters such as temperature, luminosity,
    soil pH, EC, and Moisture inside the greenhouse with the help of DHT11, light,
    pH, and EC (JXBS-3001-EC-RS-I) sensors respectively. The sensed data is sent to
    the Master unit wirelessly. Multiple slave units are deployed at strategic points
    of the greenhouse. The control signals from these different nodes communicate
    with the master unit. Fig. 3. Slave Unit Show All C. Master Unit As shown in Fig.
    4, the proposed system''s master unit consists of a microcontroller (ESP32), solenoid
    valves, and a diaphragm motor. The control signals from the sensor nodes are received
    by the Master unit from the slave unit. The received data from the slave unit
    is stored locally and also transferred to the cloud using ESP32 module and analyzed
    as an edge node. The control signals indicate the conditions prevalent in the
    greenhouse. The control signals are relayed to the microcontroller which processes
    the data and necessary actions such as bringing the temperature down using the
    humidifiers, improving the lighting conditions maintaining using artificial lighting.
    Soil with a pH level below 6.5 is considered acidic and requires the amendment
    of lime, while soil with a pH level above 8.5 is categorized as acidic soil and
    requires the amendment of gypsum which is added to the soil by mixing it with
    water controlled by the solenoid valves. If the EC level of the soil exceeds the
    established threshold, which indicates the presence of saline soil, and the recommended
    solution is leaching to flush out the excess salts. Fig. 4. Master Unit Show All
    SECTION IV. Implementation A. Hardware The system hardware in the slave unit consists
    of Soil EC sensor, pH sensor, Light sensor, DHT11, Moisture sensor and ESP32 module.
    The primary responsibility of the slave unit is to gather and transmit data to
    the master unit about all sensed data. Fig. 5 explains the complete system design
    of slave circuit. The complete design of the master unit circuit is provided in
    Fig. 6. The primary role of the master unit is to regulate the soil''s acidic
    pH, base pH, temperature, moisture, and electrical conductivity (EC) using solenoid
    valves. These valves are controlled by the ESP32 microcontroller integrated into
    the master unit. The working of solenoid valves depends on the data sent by slave
    unit to master unit. Master unit controls solenoid valves so that the environment
    is suitable for greenhouse plants. Pumping solution out of tanks for drip irrigation
    is done with a diaphragm motor. Fig. 5. Circuit of Slave Unit Show All Fig. 6.
    Circuit of Master Unit. Show All B. Flowchart This Paper employs software technologies
    to build user-facing applications, and it stores all of the data it has gathered
    on the cloud. A mobile application was created to update the preloaded data and
    configure the threshold parameters for the particular plantation. The user (owner)
    must first register and log in for the same account in order to manually set the
    parameters using the slider and establish a set of settings, particularly for
    the plantation area. The mobile application''s flowchart, as shown in Fig. 7.
    Fig. 8 explains how the slave unit operates. Fig. 7. Mobile Application flow graph
    Show All Fig. 8. Slave unit flow graph Show All The slave unit collects data from
    all sensors and transmits it to the master unit as soon as it receives power.
    Themaster unit flow will be managed in accordance with the data sent, as shown
    in Fig. 9. The water solution value will open and the motors will pump to maintain
    the soil''s moisture levelif the moisture value falls below the threshold value.
    Then, if the temperature data exceeds the threshold, sprinklers are utilized to
    maintain the temperature. Fig. 9. Master unit flow graph Show All Acid solution
    is used when the pH value exceeds the threshold. Base solution is used when the
    pH value is below the threshold. A motor will pump solutions to keep the pH of
    the soil stable. Then, with the aid of lights, intensity is adjusted by comparing
    light intensity with the threshold value. SECTION V. Results As a case study,
    the Gerbera plants are chosen for implementing and testing the proposed work in
    real-time. Table I represents the ideal environmental conditions for the growth
    of the Gerbera plant. The outcomes of the work are presented in the subsequent
    sections. Table II shows the greenhouse monitoring system can deviate from ideal
    values for optimal plant growth conditions. However, after deployment and operation,
    these parameters are effectively controlled and regulated, resulting in improved
    plant cultivation conditions. The mobile application login success depicted in
    Fig. 2 signifies thatusers have gained access to the system. The cloud-based infrastructure
    empowers real-time monitoring of greenhouse conditions while offering manual parameter
    customization and plant type selection, enhancing usability and adaptability.
    Table I. Ideal Values of the Parameters for Gerbera Plant Table II. Comparison
    of Parameters Inside Greenhouse Before and After Controlling to That of Ideal
    Values The model implementation displayed in Fig. 12 showcases the master unit
    and slave units, forming an efficient architecture for data processing and control.
    Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 provide avisual representation of all parameters before and
    after monitoring and control, taking into account the user mobile application''s
    threshold value. These figures illustrate the changes in various measured quantities
    and how they compare to the set threshold. The visual representation presents
    a clear overview of the parameter values, allowing users to assess the effectiveness
    of the monitoring process and identify any deviations from the desired threshold.
    The successful uploading of all slave unit data shown in Fig. 13 through the app
    enables real-time monitoring. Finally, Fig. 14 demonstrates the successful testing
    conducted in the greenhouse, validating the system''s effectiveness in maintaining
    optimal growing conditions. From survey, so far pH and EC in real time is not
    implemented but in this paper both pH and EC are controlled. Fig. 10. (a), (b),
    (c) and (d) are Light Intensity before, after monitoring and Temperature of the
    greenhouse before and after monitoring respectively Show All Fig. 11. (a), (b),

    after monitoring respectively Show All Fig. 12. Greenhouse implementation Show
    All Fig. 13. Control Page with various parameters. Show All Fig. 14. Real-time
    implementation of the system. Show All SECTION V. Conlusion The proposed system''s
    primary contribution is focused on maintaining the soil pH within the desired
    range. Users have the ability to set all relevant parameters using a mobile application.
    Additionally, all processing tasks carried out by the master unit are efficiently
    performed through edge computing. This ensures effective soil pH regulation and
    simplifies the greenhouse management process for users. Smart greenhouse monitoring
    using edge computing was tested in real time at Akshaya nursery near Gulur. As
    part of the proposed work, the master unit and slave unit both underwent successful
    design and testing. The master unit has the ability to control all greenhouse
    parameters, enabling thorough management. The data from the slave unit can be
    successfully updated to the cloud system, guaranteeing precise and real-time monitoring
    of the greenhouse environment. Two slave units are used to get the soil and environment
    conditions such as Soil pH, temperature, moisture, and light intensity. A master
    unit is used to control the different solenoid valves to let the different solutions
    flow into the plantation area to maintain the soil pH, moisture and control the
    artificial lighting according to requirements based on edge computing. A mobile
    application that allows users to manually change parameters based on plant type
    has also been developed. For quick and personalized control of greenhouse conditions,
    this app offers a user-friendly interface, with these developments able to automate
    the greenhouse, which improved plant growth and reduced manual labor. Edge computing
    eliminates processing delays in greenhouse automation systems by completing processes
    faster, typically within 3–4 minutes. This local data processing and decision-making
    reduces latency, enhancing efficiency andresponsiveness, allowing timely actions,
    and minimizing delaysin critical processes. Authors Figures References Keywords

  description: Agriculture is the backbone of all the developing countries. The economy
    of a developing country mainly depends on agriculture and farms in rural areas
    and applying traditional approaches is not sufficient in today’s scenario. Now
    a day, water scarcity is one of the main challenges faced by the farmers. Another
    major challenge featured by Indian agriculture sector is that the increase in
    rate of farmers’ suicide due to debt. Monitoring environmental conditions is the
    major factor to reduce the cost of farming and improve yield of the efficient
    crops. Focusing on encouraging innovative challenges in agriculture, smart farming
    is the solution for the problems that the industry is currently facing. Use of
    modern technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) gives a new dimension in the
    area of smart farming in agriculture domain with low cost and scalable solutions.
    Smart irrigation system not only overcomes this problem but also provide clean
    source of energy. The IoT technology has realized the smart wearable's, connected
    devices, automated machines, and driverless cars that contain electronics, software,
    sensors and connectivity which allows these things to connect, interact and exchange
    data. However, in agriculture, the IoT has brought the best impact. This paper
    includes development of a smart irrigation system which can monitor temperature,
    humidity, moisture in agricultural field through sensors using PIC Microcontroller
    and in case of any discrepancy send a SMS notification as well as a notification
    on the application developed for the same to the farmer’s smart phone using Wi-Fi/3G/4G.
    The proposed system gets Live Data feeds, various devices like Smart Phones, Tablets
    are used. The data generated via sensors can be easily shared and viewed by agriculture
    field owner (farmer) anywhere remotely via Cloud Computing technology integration.
    The farmers can see the field data (moisture, temperature, humidity) using Thingspeak
    website through their unique login id and password from database with cloud computing.
    Unauthorized person can’t view or access that field data without getting permission
    from the owners.

  description: 'Water, one of the most valuable resources, is underutilized in irrigated
    rice production. The yield of rice, a staple food across the world, is highly
    dependent on having proper irrigation systems. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD)
    is an effective irrigation method mainly used for irrigated rice production. However,
    unattended, manual, small-scale, and discrete implementations cannot achieve the
    maximum benefit of AWD. Automation of large-scale (over 1000 acres) implementation
    of AWD can be carried out using wide-area wireless sensor network (WSN). An automated
    AWD system requires three different WSNs: one for water level and environmental
    monitoring, one for monitoring of the irrigation system, and another for controlling
    the irrigation system. Integration of these three different WSNs requires proper
    dimensioning of the AWD edge elements (sensor and actuator nodes) to reduce the
    deployment cost and make it scalable. Besides field-level monitoring, the integration
    of external control parameters, such as real-time weather forecasts, plant physiological
    data, and input from farmers, can further enhance the performance of the automated
    AWD system. Internet of Things (IoT) can be used to interface the WSNs with external
    data sources. This research focuses on the dimensioning of the AWD system for
    the multilayer WSN integration and the required algorithms for the closed loop
    control of the irrigation system using IoT. Implementation of the AWD for 25,000
    acres is shown as a possible use case. Plastic pipes are proposed as the means
    to transport and control proper distribution of water in the field, which significantly
    helps to reduce conveyance loss. This system utilizes 250 pumps, grouped into
    10 clusters, to ensure equal water distribution amongst the users (field owners)
    in the wide area. The proposed automation algorithm handles the complexity of
    maintaining proper water pressure throughout the pipe network, scheduling the
    pump, and controlling the water outlets. Mathematical models are presented for
    proper dimensioning of the AWD. A low-power and long-range sensor node is developed
    due to the lack of cellular data coverage in rural areas, and its functionality
    is tested using an IoT platform for small-scale field trials.'

  explanation: This study proposes a mathematical model for dimensioning a large-scale
    alternate wetting and drying (AWD) system for rice production. The model considers
    irrigation system components as distributed systems, and separates them into pipe
    networks, localized water control, and clustered pumps with centralized control.
    The proposed model is applicable to both AWD and non-AWD irrigation systems. The
    pipe network will facilitate both micro- and macro-level irrigation control in
    a scalable manner. The distributed health monitoring of the pipe network and the
    clustered pumps will make the system more fault-tolerant. Various field-level
    sensors in an IoT-connected WSN will help build a long-term database enabling
    scientific research to study the impact of climate change on crop yield, physiological
    changes, greenhouse gas emissions for different crops, and the application of
    various irrigation models. The proposed system uses a low-power and long-range

    Water, one of the most valuable resources, is underutilized in irrigated rice
    production. The yield of rice, a staple food across the world, is highly dependent
    on having proper irrigation systems. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) is an
    effective irrigation method mainly used for irrigated rice production. However,
    unattended, manual, small-scale, and discrete implementations cannot achieve the
    maximum benefit of AWD. Automation of large-scale (over 1000 acres) implementation
    of AWD can be carried out using wide-area wireless sensor network (WSN). An automated
    AWD system requires three different WSNs: one for water level and environmental
    monitoring, one for monitoring of the irrigation system, and another for controlling
    the irrigation system. Integration of these three different WSNs requires proper
    dimensioning of the AWD edge elements (sensor and actuator nodes) to reduce the
    deployment cost and make it scalable. Besides field-level monitoring, the integration
    of external control parameters, such as real-time weather forecasts, plant physiological
    data, and input from farmers, can further enhance the performance of the automated
    AWD system. Internet of Things (IoT) can be used to interface the WSNs with external
    data sources. This research focuses on the dimensioning of the AWD system for
    the multilayer WSN integration and the required algorithms for the closed loop
    control of the irrigation system using IoT. Implementation of the AWD for 25,000
    acres is shown as a possible use case. Plastic pipes are proposed as the means
    to transport and control proper distribution of water in the field, which significantly
    helps to reduce conveyance loss. This system utilizes 250 pumps, grouped into
    10 clusters, to ensure equal water distribution amongst the users (field owners)
    in the wide area. The proposed automation algorithm handles the complexity of
    maintaining proper water pressure throughout the pipe network, scheduling the
    pump, and controlling the water outlets. Mathematical models are presented for
    proper dimensioning of the AWD. A low-power and long-range sensor node is developed
    due to the lack of cellular data coverage in rural areas, and its functionality
    is tested using an IoT platform for small-scale field trials. Keywords: AWD; IoT;
    WSN; smart irrigation 1. Introduction Rice (Oryza sativa) is the second highest
    ranked food staple in the world, feeding one third (2.6 billion) of the population
    (7.8 billion). About 90% [1] of the world’s rice is produced in Asia, and it is
    the fastest growing staple food in Africa and Latin America [2] due to its ease
    of preparation compared to that of corn and wheat. It provides 21% of global human
    energy per capita and is the largest single source of energy [3]. A total of 75%
    of world rice is produced in 92 million hectares of irrigated lowland, and Asia
    occupies 56% of this land [4]. Irrigated rice uses up to 43% of the world’s irrigated
    water, which is two to three times more than other irrigated crops, and thus places
    an excessive demand on water usage compared to other staple crops. Bangladesh,
    an Asian country with a growing population and an increasing demand for rice,
    is playing an important role in rice research. According to the Bangladesh Rice
    Research Institute (BRRI), the main source of irrigation for rice is from ground
    water. However, the ground water is retrieved using shallow tube wells (STW) and
    deep tube wells (DTW), which is resulting in deteriorating ground water levels
    [5]. The production of 1 kg of rice requires 3000–5000 L of water [6], and Boro
    rice, which is generally grown in dry months, predominantly relies upon the groundwater.
    In order to address this situation, the International Rice Research Institute
    (IRRI) developed an irrigation method called alternate wetting and drying (AWD)
    that requires 30% less water than the traditional irrigation method used during
    the growing phase [7]. Studies presented in [8] have shown that, compared to the
    traditional method, AWD requires five fewer irrigation cycles and fewer pumps
    which saves about 40% of fuel. Besides minimizing the use of groundwater, AWD
    reduces irrigation cycles without affecting the yield [9]. Due to intermittent
    flooding in AWD, emission of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) is reduced by 73%
    in the dry season and by 21% in the wet season [10], compared to the continuous
    flooding method. This also decreases arsenic concentration in the shoots of rice
    plants [11]. Unlike other countries adopting AWD, where water is charged based
    on volumetric usage, most of Bangladesh’s irrigation water is charged per hectare,
    without any incentives for the farmers to reduce their water usage. Sharing a
    single pump amongst the farmers often gives rise to conflicts that usually deter
    any collaborative effort [11], which is a key point of AWD. The lack of proper
    knowledge and information sharing are also limiting the adoption of the AWD method.
    Research has shown that there is a significant opportunity for AWD in Southeast
    Asian countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam [12]; however, due to social, economic,
    and technical challenges, the AWD method is not well perceived in these regions
    [13]. Besides the challenges of AWD described above, applying AWD to a wide area
    poses additional challenges, such as monitoring and controlling the complex mechanism,
    before it can become economically feasible. To achieve this, an automated IoT-connected
    wireless sensor network (WSN) is required. WSN is a network of sensors that accumulates
    monitoring data in centrally located storage, such as cloud storage. Most WSNs
    require three different types of network elements including the sensor node (SN),
    the cluster head (CH) and the data sink (DS), also called a base station, as shown
    in Figure 1a. All of the SNs are distributed into multiple, unequal clusters headed
    by a CH that sends sensor data to the DS. Functionally, the clustering process
    and data transfer protocol may vary depending on the nature of the application
    and the distribution of the SNs. Recent applications also require these WSNs to
    be connected with other networks through gateways and to the internet infrastructure
    [14], as shown in Figure 1a. Figure 1. (a) Network elements and functional layers
    of the IoT-connected wireless sensor network (WSN), and (b) Automated AWD-specific
    WSN with IoT connectivity. IoT is the network of various smart devices to facilitate
    information flow to the end-user through the existing internet. The exponential
    growth and distribution of IoT devices are giving rise to numerous innovative
    and real-life applications. COVID-SAFE [15] monitors and predicts the infection
    by monitoring social distancing with the help of wearable IoT devices. Various
    wearable IoT devices are used for human emotion recognition [16] to facilitate
    online communication. The growth of the IoT applications, such as smart health
    using wearable IoT devices and smart cities, results in security threats to the
    network itself. The authors [17] proposed an IoT Botnet Detection using salp swarm
    algorithm (SSA) and ant lion optimization (ALO) models to minimize security threats.
    Authors of [18] proposed an enhanced information-centric networking (ICN) for
    IoT using artificial intelligence (AI) and edge computing in the internet cloud.
    Studies are conducted on the design and fabrication technologies to utilize smart
    IoT devices [19]. The researchers focus on IoT nodes’ accurate and fast localization
    [20]. IoT connected to WSN has been implemented on a limited scale in agriculture
    as reported in [21,22,23,24]. Most WSN- and IoT-based irrigation automation systems
    utilize soil moisture content and other environmental variables to schedule irrigation
    without considering plant growth; however, this is insufficient for automating
    the AWD method and gaining the farmers’ trust. Besides monitoring and controlling
    the pumps, an effective water distribution system through pipes is also required,
    giving rise to the added complexity of having to both monitoring and controlling
    the distribution system. Moreover, present WSN technologies are optimized for
    applications with densely populated SN and small area coverage. Wide-area monitoring
    requires long-range and low-power wireless connectivity [25]. Therefore, wide-area
    AWD automation involves three different WSNs, dedicated for (1) field water-level
    and environmental monitoring; (2) irrigation system monitoring; and (3) irrigation
    system controlling, as shown in Figure 1b. Therefore, densely populated and widely
    distributed sensor and actuator nodes are required for these three different WSNs.
    These three WSNs will be interconnected virtually. Traditional WSN virtualization
    involves multilayer connectivity and control, which increases inter-layer WSN
    traffic [26] for the AWD application. Besides wide-area coverage, automated AWD
    also requires external parameters, such as real-time weather forecast data, plant
    physiological data, and the farmers’ input. These data can be used by connecting
    the WSNs with different servers throughout the IoT network, as shown in Figure
    1b. Literature shows that large-scale irrigation is required to limit water usage
    to provide more water for the growing industrial sectors and increasing urban
    population [27,28]. Large-scale multiple cropping can further limit water usage
    [29] using the automated irrigation framework proposed in this article. Despite
    the inherent advantages of the AWD, both small- and large-scale implementations
    are yet to achieve the expected success for lack of proper adaptation of technologies,
    namely IoT and WSN [30]. Moreover, the large-scale implementation of an irrigation
    system, such as AWD, involves multiple stakeholders and different technologies.
    That may require an effective dimensioning tool for a practical convergent solution.
    The research presented in this article has focused on automation through proper
    technology adoption by providing a mathematical model and addressing all the required
    systems. The proposed mathematical model considers the irrigation system as a
    distributed system. It separates its components into pipe networks, localized
    water control, and clustered pumps with centralized control, thus making the automation
    platform applicable to AWD and non-AWD irrigation systems. The pipe network will
    facilitate both micro- and macro-level irrigation control in a scalable manner.
    The distributed health monitoring of the pipe network and the clustered pumps
    will make the system more fault-tolerant. Various field-level sensors in an IoT-connected
    WSN will help build a long-term database enabling scientific research to study
    the impact of climate change on crop yield [31], physiological changes, greenhouse
    gas emissions for different crops, and the application of various irrigation models.
    The major contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows. (1) Develop
    a dimensioning model for large-scale implementation of AWD using pipes, actuator-based
    water distribution, and clustered pumps. (2) Design WSN architecture combining
    three different functionalities with IoT-based automation for scalability and
    effective control and operation of the overall system. (3) Develop a low-power
    and long-range (LoRa) sensor node and data sink using LoRa, 3G, and WiFi interfaces
    for field monitoring using an IoT network. (4) Sample automation algorithms for
    the closed-loop AWD control using various internal and external parameters that
    can be used in both the WSNs and the IoT connected network. (5) Provision for
    scientific research through the database of long-term sensor data and applying
    Machine Learning (ML) for future wide-area implementation. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews existing literature related to the
    automation of AWD. Section 3 discusses the problem formulation for the automation
    of large scale AWD while Section 4 provides the proposed solution. Section 5 describes
    the system design and integration of WSN with AWD. Section 6 provides a description
    of the related field trial and Section 7 describes the performance of the system.
    Section 8 concludes the paper outlining future plans and work needed on this topic.
    2. Related Work Irrigation automation is not a very recent phenomenon and, as
    a result, is usually performed by adopting existing mathematical models and optimization
    algorithms. These primarily control the irrigation pumps to maximize water utilization.
    Baki et al. [32] have proposed a numerical scheme that utilizes weather forecasts
    and the water flow in soils to determine the optimal irrigation depth on scheduled
    irrigation days for the highest irrigation efficiency and optimum crop yield.
    Shahdany et al. [33] developed a mathematical model to automate canal irrigation
    using both known and unknown water demands for different irrigation systems. Besides
    the model-based optimization approaches, machine learning is also used by [34]
    to predict crop irrigation requirements based on soil parameters. Linker et al.
    [35] proposed a real-time and sub-optimal irrigation scheduling system that utilizes
    weather data alongside the crop’s physiological state and soil water availability.
    However, users need to decide between yield and irrigation performance depending
    on their applications. To achieve better optimization, Munir et al. [36] included
    parameters such as the plant type, watering time, air humidity, light intensity,
    and soil type for their fuzzy logic-based irrigation scheduling system that uses
    low power sensor-nodes. In [37], the authors designed an irrigation controller
    prototype based on the fuzzy rule to inspect water wastage by providing an optimal
    irrigation environment for farming. An artificial neural network (ANN) is used
    by [38] to predict soil moisture changes and to schedule irrigation based on climatic
    information and rooting depth. This ANN method was compared with the established
    water stress (WS) method, which well predicted the soil moisture during the main
    growing season, but was error prone at lower soil moisture levels. ANN and non-linear
    regression (NLR) were used by [39] to find the distances between the emitters
    in order to achieve optimum drip irrigation in the wet areas. Human expertise
    is also used by [40] for their proposed online decision support system (DSS),
    which consists of a meteorological model for weather forecasts, and a computational
    model for soil water balance and irrigation scheduling. It generates an irrigation
    schedule for a week in advance based on the DSS data repository. Irrigation automation
    is further upgraded by utilizing various sensors, wireless links, and internet
    infrastructure due to the increasing availability and decreasing cost of these
    technologies. Water level-based scheduling was proposed by [41] and uses a low-cost
    water level sensor along with inputs from the local farmers through the IoT. In
    [42], the authors present a framework using an IoT-based water distribution and
    management system that utilizes water flow meters, ultrasonic sensors and motors.
    The over-usage of freshwater for flood irrigation is addressed by [43]. The author
    proposed an IoT-based intelligent decision support system to improve the farmer’s
    water utilization by using weather data and sensor data. A complete irrigation
    supervisory control and data acquisition ( SCADA) with WSN was implemented by
    [44] to compare seven different irrigation scheduling algorithms and found that
    soil-based approaches were not adequate in providing sufficient water for the
    plants. Recently, more irrigation research on automated AWD systems is being reported
    in the academic literature. Localized pump automation is achieved by sensing the
    water level lacking remote monitoring or IoT connectivity and using solar panels
    as the power source [45]. An IoT-based system integrates laser sensors for precise
    water level measurement for automation of the AWD technique [46]. The proposed
    system was implemented for different sizes of fields, from 0.7 acres to 55.8 acres.
    Besides these local and remote irrigation automations, performance optimization
    of the WSN platform is also focused on by [47]. They developed a 3D ray-launching
    (3D-RL) deterministic algorithm to characterize the radio channel of LoRa and
    LoRa wide area network (LoRaWAN) in order to provide better connectivity to transmit
    sensor data in obstacle filled scenarios for irrigation automation. Cardoso et
    al. [48] have proposed a narrow band IoT (NB-IoT) and LoRa-based system to monitor
    and schedule irrigation using machine learning. Unlike irrigation automation,
    AWD requires additional parameters such as plant physiological data in order to
    automate the irrigation system. As discussed in the previous paragraph, some irrigation
    automation utilizes weather data or plant physiological information from the farmer;
    however, this platform targeted only a single pump as the irrigation control unit.
    Most of these solutions are offline, of the open-loop type, and do not synthesize
    the data from all of the different sources. They lack wide-area considerations
    and do not focus on the complexity that comes with the integration of multiple
    physical and logical WSNs with the IoT. Proper dimensioning of pipe-based water
    distribution networks, pump clustering, irrigation depth, and plant lifecycle-specific
    schedule mapping is absent. Therefore, any one of them individually or in combination
    may not be suitable for the automation of the AWD method in wide area applications,
    which is highly required for the socio-economic success of the AWD implementation.
    3. Problem Formulation As one of the rice-producing countries of southwest Asia,
    Bangladesh produces three types of rice: Aus, Aman, and Boro. The north-west part
    of Bangladesh produces more than one-third of these three types of rice and 35%
    of Boro rice is produced in the country. Hence, the irrigated lowland of this
    part can be considered for the AWD implementation, as shown in Figure 2. Figure
    2a shows the annual Boro production areas in overall Bangladesh. Figure 2. Boro
    production and illustrative implementation of AWD in Bangladesh; (a) Total Boro
    cultivation (2015–2016), (b) Portion of the medium Boro production zone focused
    for AWD implementation as marked in (a) by the red box, and (c) closer view of
    an IoT-based AWD system. For implementation of the wide area AWD, a portion of
    the medium Boro production area that produces less than 16% Boro [49] and lacks
    adequate irrigation facilities, as marked by the yellow box in Figure 2b which
    was chosen as the test site. Figure 2c shows the land condition of this area.
    The AWD zone is 5 km by 20 km, covering more than 24 thousand acres of cultivable
    lands that suffers from lack of irrigation. The closest water source is a river
    which is at least 2 km away from the cultivable land. Therefore, traditional canal-based
    irrigation methods are inadequate as they can suffer from water seepage of about
    40% [50]. Furthermore, manual AWD is not able to provide efficient water level
    control over this large area of irrigated land. The proposed IoT-based automation
    system with pipe-based water transportation and distribution using the AWD system
    may reduce the seepage loss by up to 90% [51]. Local or centralized automation
    is not adequate in monitoring and controlling the large number of elements in
    the AWD system. Therefore, an intelligent layered IoT-based closed-loop automation
    system is required and is proposed for this project. 4. Proposed Solution The
    proposed automation of AWD is a closed-loop control system that uses an IoT based
    WSN, which is represented by a simplified block diagram as shown in Figure 3.
    This system has three different types of inputs, which are: (i) environmental
    inputs from the field and weather forecast server; (ii) irrigation inputs from
    a plant physiology database; and (iii) inputs from the users of the pumping network
    and water distribution system. Figure 3. Functional blocks of the IoT–WSN-based
    AWD automation control loop. The environmental parameters to be monitored are
    temperature, pressure, humidity, and the greenhouse gas methane ( 𝐶 𝐻 4 ) . Rice
    fields emit a considerable amount of methane, which can be reduced significantly
    by the intermittent flooding that occurs in the AWD method. The field temperature,
    pressure, and humidity data are required to calculate the evapotranspiration loss,
    seepage loss, and water level of the field, which are used to calculate the basic
    parameters used in the AWD method. Other environmental parameters, such as wind
    speed and daylight, can be collected from the weather forecast server through
    the IoT cloud. The wide area AWD requires an adequate number of pumping machines
    and a pipe-based water distribution system to meet the field irrigation requirement.
    To maintain uniform irrigation throughout the area, the water pressures of the
    pipes need to be monitored continuously. The actuators for the water outlets and
    pumps are controlled to maintain proper pressure and water flow during the wetting
    phase of the AWD method. Additionally, the pump power and mechanical parameters
    need to be monitored continually. The crop coefficient ( 𝐾 𝑐  ) determines the
    AWD stages and can be determined from plant physiological data stored in the database
    and from input entered by farmers. The external data obtained from sensors in
    the field, the weather forecast, the crop coefficient, and user input are combined
    and processed in the closed control loop by the cloud-based AWD server through
    the IoT network. The control logic generated by the cloud server is then sent
    to the actuators and pumps through the IoT network to control the irrigation processes.
    All of the sensor nodes (SN) and actuator nodes (AN) are grouped into clusters
    and connected with the base-station (BS) through the cluster head (CH) using a
    LoRa wireless interface. The BS connects the whole WSN to the IoT network through
    the general packet radio service (GPRS) or third generation (3G) cellular network
    as per availability and coverage. The BS also acts as the WSN to an IoT gateway
    that converts the SN/AN data packets to message query telemetry transport (MQTT)
    messages. 5. System Design and Integration The proposed AWD automation consists
    of two main parts: (a) design and dimensioning of the AWD system; and (b) design
    and integration of the WSN. The AWD method at its core is an irrigation schedule
    that depends on certain the water requirements which vary depending on soil condition
    and the growth stages of the crop. Automation of the AWD using the IoT and WSN
    requires the sensor and actuator networks to be designed together, integration
    of various service modules, and development of the software algorithm. These are
    described in the following sub-sections. 5.1. Irrigation Scheduling The water
    volume of the irrigated field changes due to evapotranspiration and percolation.
    Evapotranspiration is influenced by the crop’s growing stage, wind speed, solar
    radiation, temperature, humidity, and soil properties. The crop evapotranspiration
    (𝐸 𝑇 𝑐 ) [52] can be calculated as 𝐸 𝑇 𝑐 =𝐸 𝑇 0 × 𝐾 𝑐  (1) where ( 𝐾 𝑐 ) is the
    crop coefficient (potency of soil evaporation and crop transpiration), and (𝐸
    𝑇 0 ) is the reference evapotranspiration. Among the different methods, the Food
    and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) Penman–Monteith method [52] is considered
    to be the best estimation for 𝐸 𝑇 0 , and can be expressed as 𝐸 𝑇 0 = 0.408Δ (
    𝑅 𝑛 −𝐺)+γ 900 𝑇+273 𝑢 2 ( 𝑒 𝑠 − 𝑒 𝑎 ) Δ+γ(1+0.34 𝑢 2 )   (2) where, 𝑅 𝑛 = net
    radiation at the crop surface ( MJ m −2 d −1 ) , G = soil heat flux density (
    MJ m −2 d −1 ) , T = mean air temperature (°C), Δ = slope of saturation vapor
    curve (kPa°C−1), 𝑢 2 = wind speed ( ms −1 ), 𝑒 𝑠 = saturation vapor pressure (kPa),
    and 𝑒 𝑎 = actual vapor pressure (kPa). Water requirements for rice (WRR) in cm/day
    is given in Equation (3), which measures the receding water level. 𝑊𝑅 𝑅 𝑗 =(𝐸
    𝑇 𝑜 × 𝐾 𝑐 𝑗 )+𝑃𝐸𝑅𝐶 (3) where PERC is the percolation loss from water seeping into
    the ground through pores, and j is the growth-stage index (1 to 3). Figure 4 illustrates
    the irrigation scheduling for the AWD method. The irrigation frequency (lower
    row) changes along with the development stages of the crop. Three development
    stages (transplantation, flowering, and panicle initiation) along with a water
    level indicator (middle row) are shown to indicate where continuous standing water
    and irrigation scheduling is required. Figure 4. Irrigation scheduling in alternate
    wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation method. The different crop coefficients, including
    Kc of rice, for these three stages are shown in Figure 4 [53]. It is quite evident
    when AWD is initiated that, for approximately 5 to 8 days, depending on the soil
    type, no irrigation is required [54]. Continuous standing water is required at
    the beginning of all three stages which approximates to about 30 days in total;
    hence, utilization of the AWD method is suspended during these times. Therefore,
    depending on the stages and in accordance with the 𝑊𝑅 𝑅 𝑗 , irrigation scheduling
    is applied. Irrigation scheduling is divided into two sections. The first section
    is for continuous standing water and the second section is for AWD period. Continuous
    Standing Water: For the three development stages, if the standing water level
    recedes to 2 cm from 5 cm as given in Equation (4), then the irrigation schedule
    or cycle 𝐼 1𝑗 is applied using Equation (5). 𝐼 1𝑗 represents the number of times
    the pump is turned on and is used to maintain a continuous water level of 5 cm
    above the ground. In this equation, TPFj is the total number of days related to
    the transplantation, panicle initiation, and flowering stages. 𝑖𝑓 ∑ 𝑡=1 𝑇 𝑊𝑅 𝑅
    𝑗 (𝑡)=3 cm 𝑖𝑛 𝑇 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠, 𝑗∈{1,2,3}  (4) 𝐼 1𝑗 = 𝑇𝑃 𝐹 𝑗 𝑇 (5) Establishment of continuous
    standing water during these stages is necessary as rice is quite sensitive to
    fluctuation in water level. Alternate Wetting and Drying Method: For the AWD method,
    when the water level falls 5 cm from above the ground and reaches 15 cm below
    the surface as given in Equation (6), then irrigation 𝐼 2 , which is the number
    of times the pump is turned on, is implemented using Equation (7), where 𝑊 𝑗 is
    the total days for the AWD method, to bring the water level back to 5 cm above
    the surface. 𝑖𝑓 ∑ 𝑡=1 𝑇 1 𝑊𝑅 𝑅 𝑗 (𝑡)=5 cm 𝑖𝑛  𝑇 1  𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠  𝑎𝑏𝑜𝑣𝑒 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒  𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛
    𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 =15 𝑐𝑚 𝑖𝑛  𝑇 2  𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠 𝑏𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒     (6) 𝐼 2𝑗 = 𝑊 𝑗 𝑇 1 + 𝑇 2 𝑗∈{1,2,3}
    (7) The AWD method is utilized in three different stages of the plant development
    period: (i) 15 days after transplantation; (ii) then seven days before panicle
    initiation; and (iii) finally seven days after flowering. 5.2. Dimensioning of
    the AWD System Proper dimensioning of the water distribution network’s pipes is
    required for the implementation of a large-scale AWD system. Multiple pumps are
    used in several clusters for a field of 25,000 acres to reflood the field in the
    shortest time possible. Multiple clustered-pumps facilitate the multiple inlet
    rice irrigation (MIRI) option available with AWD which allows the water to flow
    into the fields from several inlets, flooding the field in the shortest amount
    of time. The capacities of the pumps are chosen to meet the recommended minimum
    swift flooding rate of 0.00126 m3/s per acre (20 gallons per minute per acre),
    which varies depending on the type of soil [55]. Equation (8) shows the total
    number of pumps required ( 𝑛 ), when operating for 𝑡 hours with pumping capacity
    ( c ) in m3/s. The available pumping capacities include 0.02524, 0.05047, 0.06309,
    0.1009, and 0.1262 m3/s, and are achieved with 400, 800, 1000, 1600, and 2000
    GPM (gallons per minute) pumps that cover an acre of area (A) with q (150/m for
    one cm per hour water delivery) amount of water. 𝑛= 𝐴 𝑐×𝑞×𝑡       (8) Figure 5a
    shows the number of pumps required to irrigate 100 acre-inches. Using our proposed
    area of 25,000 acre-inches, it will require a total of 250 pumps with 2000 GPM
    capacities. Figure 5. (a) Number of pumps required when operating for duration
    of time (b) Average power consumption between different water lifting devices
    (c) Efficacy of the water lifting devices. Beside the volume of water to be delivered,
    the selection of water pump depends on lifting head, water pressure, and parameters
    of the water sources. Depending on the lifting head and the source of the water,
    there are three different types of pumps used for irrigation in South-East Asian
    countries including Bangladesh. For the surface water on bodies of water such
    as rivers and lakes, low-lift pumps are used where the lifting head is between
    1 to 5 m. A shallow tube well (STW) is used for more than 73% of ground water
    irrigation [56]. The rest is performed by pumps with higher lifting capacities
    called deep tube wells (DTWs). Irrespective of the type of pump used, pumps with
    higher efficiencies must be selected [57]. Pumps with 70% efficiency (as commonly
    used) are chosen for better selection among different lifting capacities. Average
    energy consumption (Ea) is calculated using Equation (9). 𝐸𝑎=ℎ𝑝·𝜂· 𝑡  (9) where
    hp is the horsepower of the pumps, η is the pump efficiency, and t is the operating
    time of the pumps. The efficacy of the system is measured using Equation (10).
    𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑐𝑦=𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 ( m 3 /s)/ 𝐸𝑎  (10) The average power consumption and efficacy
    of different water lifting devices are shown in Figure 5b,c. The efficacy curves
    in Figure 5c assume 600 GPM, 400 GPM, and 1110 GPM capacities for the low-lift
    pumps (LLP), STW, and DTW pumps. Figure 5b,c shows that LLPs have greater efficacy
    and low energy consumption compared to the other two types. This is mainly due
    to less heads [58] and thus makes the LLP type an economically feasible solution.
    Therefore, multiple low lift pumps are to be used for the wide-area AWD implementation
    as it would allow for proper utilization of the surface water and help lessen
    the exploitation of groundwater irrigation. The proper dimensions of pipes are
    of paramount importance in carrying surface water to the field; therefore, pipes
    are chosen to ensure minimum friction loss while maintaining the recommended water
    flow velocity [59]. The pipes are placed on a downward slope, as shown in Figure
    6a, to overcome the loss of pressure that occurs when travelling larger horizontal
    distances. Moreover, due to multiple inlets for irrigation, the pressure of water
    may fall from one inlet to the other; hence, when needed, the inlets closer to
    the source can be closed, to ensure sufficient water pressure at the opposite
    end of the field. Figure 6. (a) Downward slope water pipe (b) In-field Automated
    AWD setup. According to Equation (8), 250 units of 0.1262 m3/s (2000 GPM) capacity
    pumps need to be formed into clusters to ensure that the field is reflooded within
    16 to 17 h of operating time. The frictional head loss for a steady pipe’s flow
    is calculated using the Hazen–Williams equation [59], which is given by Equation
    (11). ℎ 100𝑓𝑡 =(0.2083× ( 100 𝑐 ) 1.852 × 𝑞 1.852 )/ 𝑑 ℎ 4.8655 (11) where ℎ 100𝑓𝑡
    = friction head loss, in feet, of water per 100 feet of pipe, c = Hazen–Williams
    roughness constant, q = volume flow (gal/min) and 𝑑 ℎ = inside diameter of the
    pipe (inches). Subsequently, the friction loss in psi [59] can be calculated using
    the following Equation (12). 𝑓 100𝑓𝑡 =(1/2.31)× ℎ 100𝑓𝑡 (12) where, 𝑓 100𝑓𝑡 =
    friction loss in psi per 100 feet of pipe. Equations (11) and (12) are required
    to determine the diameter of pipes needed for specific applications. The holes
    of the inlet would need to be 0.0635 m in diameter to obtain a flow of 0.004732
    m3/s (75 GPM) from every inlet in order to fill the field in the shortest possible
    time [55]. Table 1 shows the proposed AWD system with the number of monitoring
    and driver nodes needed to ensure that water gets dispersed evenly throughout
    the field. Figure 6b shows the AWD setup of the field, designed to ensure that
    all farmers receive a fair share of irrigation water, thus resulting in greater
    acceptance of the AWD. Table 1. Proposed AWD system setup. 5.3. WSN and IoT Integration
    IoT-based automation of the AWD system requires different WSNs for sensors and
    actuators. All of these networks work independently with the same base station.
    A WSN collects field parameters such as water level, gas emissions ( 𝐶 𝐻 4 ),
    temperature, pressure, and humidity. These data are then transmitted at 15 min
    intervals. The other WSN monitors the pipe and pump health parameters, such as
    pipe pressure, flow rate of water in pipes, and pump electric power. Based on
    these data, it generates alarms to shut down the pump in emergency situations.
    There is continuous monitoring at the SN which allows for immediate action when
    needed. The actuator network operates the actuators of the pipe to control the
    water flow through the pipe and is updated every 15 min. Comparing the low-power
    wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies, LoRa was chosen for the WSN in order to
    achieve the wide area coverage needed at the monitoring area for the AWD automation.
    Table 2 summarizes the LPWAN technology features [14] including range, data rate,
    and power requirements. It shows that LoRa is the best suited technology in terms
    of range with higher data rates when compared to Sigfox. Table 2. Basic features
    of wireless technologies. LoRa employs chirp spread spectrum (CSS) modulation
    for better noise immunity and sensitivity in order to achieve low-power and long-range
    wireless connectivity. The LoRa data rate ( 𝑅 𝑏 ) depends on the channel bandwidth
    (BW), coding rate (CR), and the CSS spreading factor (SF), and can be calculated
    using Equation (13). Data Rate=SF [ 4 4+CR ] [ 2 SF BW ]  (13) For the proposed
    automated-AWD system, the LoRa physical layer was chosen instead of LoRaWAN in
    order to customize the channel access interval and achieve better channel utilization
    by implementing a custom MAC (Medium Access Control) layer. Furthermore, WSN coverage
    can be improved by increasing the CSS spreading factor of LoRa, without increasing
    transmission power or changing any network elements [14]. Table 3 summarizes the
    LoRa configuration parameters used for the SN where the data rate Rb is calculated
    using Equation (13). Table 3. LoRa parameters. The multi-purpose sensor node (SN),
    shown in Figure 7a, is designed for all WSNs in order to keep the network homogeneous.
    It consists of a LoRa transceiver module (SX1278) unit, main processor (ATMega
    328), and network specific sensors and actuator drivers. Depending on the specific
    application, the sensor node can be used to either drive actuators or collect
    and monitor sensor data. Figure 7 shows the hardware blocks of the SN with the
    power unit and the base station. Figure 7. Hardware block diagram showing (a)
    Sensor node consisting of sensors, actuator drivers, and power unit; (b) base
    station (BS) with LoRa and cellular data connectivity. The base station (BS) consists
    of a Raspberry Pi-4 which acts as a host computer to control the WSN, data communication,
    and gateway functionalities. It has both LoRa and Wi-Fi/3G/LTE to maintain the
    connection with the WSNs and IoT cloud. Figure 7b shows the hardware block diagram
    of the BS. 5.4. Communication Protocol and Automation Algorithm Data transmission
    from the SN is controlled by the BS. The BS initiates data request messages to
    a specific SN using their unique ID and sends an acknowledgement after successful
    reception of the sensor data. For the actuator node (AN), the BS sends the actuator
    control messages to the AN, and updates the actuator nodes in the server database
    after receiving the data and from the AN. All of these communications between
    the WSN and the BS are performed using LoRa with messages transferred as LoRa
    packets. The BS processes the LoRa data packets and sends them to the IoT server
    as MQTT messages. The commands used to control the pumps and actuator, sent from
    the IoT server, also use MQTT. On the user side, a smartphone app and web interface
    are connected with the IoT server through a cloud-implemented MQTT-hypertext transfer
    protocol (HTTP) gateway. All of the data communication and AWD automation processes
    are performed by the SN, BS, and cloud IoT server. Figure 8a,b show the possible
    software algorithms designed for the SN and AN, respectively. At first, it configures
    and initializes the sensors, LoRa module, and driver unit. It then starts reading
    the field, pipe, and pump sensors to monitor their condition continuously. The
    AN takes all necessary actions according to certain pump operating conditions
    and control logic defined by the user during the initialization phase. All the
    internal control variables are updated according to external parameters at regular
    intervals in a closed loop at node A. These external parameters, such as user
    input, plant-specific data, and weather forecasts, are collected through the IoT
    server. Figure 8c shows the AWD automation control logic performed by the IoT
    server. The SN algorithm, shown in Figure 8a, was used for the field trial (described
    in Section 6). The algorithms, shown in Figure 8b,c, intended for wide-area AWD
    automation, were not used in the field trial. Initially, the irrigation phase
    (TPF or AWD) is ascertained, at which point all of the phase specific decisions
    are taken. For example, the surface water level (SWL) is monitored in terms of
    TPF, and, for the AWD, the below surface water level (BSWL) is checked to determine
    whether to toggle the actuator nodes on or off. Subsequently, after toggling the
    actuators and pumps, the SWL is measured for both the TPF and AWD, and then, if
    the SWL reaches 5 cm above the surface, the actuators and pumps are switched off.

    actuator node algorithm, and (c) Control logic algorithm for the AWD server intended
    for wide-area AWD automation. 6. Field Trial A field trial was performed in two
    phases: (i) WSN formation and data collection at UIU (United International University),
    Bangladesh; and (ii) remote data collection using the IoT network in an AWD plot
    at the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI). Figure 9a shows the location
    of the UIU campus fields and Figure 9b shows the BRRI’s research agricultural
    field on Google Maps. Figure 9. Field trial location: (a) On-campus trial at United
    International University. (b) Agricultural land trial at BRRI. Figure 10a shows
    the IoT-connected (wireless sensor and actuator network (WSAN) architecture which
    is comprised of two sensor networks (WSN1 and WSN2) and one wireless actuator
    network (WSN3), as described in Section 5.3. In phase one, four sensor nodes (SNs)
    were placed at each corner of a 500 m by 500 m field with the indoor base station
    (BS) located in a lab on the fifth floor of the campus building. The approximate
    distances between the SNs and the BS were 500 m to 750 m, as shown in Figure 10b.
    Figure 10. (a) IoT-connected WSAN architecture (b) On-campus trial setup with
    sensor devices connected to a base station IoT-connected WSAN architecture. Sensor
    data were collected on a round-robin basis to avoid the co-channel interference
    that occurs at high frequencies (30 s period), and to evaluate the data transfer
    performance of the WSN. The base station (BS) consisted of a Linux-based (Redhat
    7) Apache web server with Node.js, HTM, Python 3, and Maria Database. It also
    acted as a WSN-IoT gateway using the LoRa–WiFi interface. To collect real-life
    data and to evaluate the AWD algorithm’s performance, SNs were placed in the agricultural
    plots of BRRI in a Boro field. The field was divided into irrigation blocks of
    15 m by 15 m, and the SNs were placed 200 m apart from each other. The irrigation
    system was controlled using a central pump. Figure 11 shows the field setup. Figure
    11. Agricultural field level trial setup: (a) Top view of a sensor device in the
    field (b) The receiver base station setup. The BS located at BRRI acquired all
    the sensor data from the field and stored it in the IoT server in a lab at UIU
    through the 3G cellular network. To monitor and process the field data in real-time,
    a distributed application structure was designed, as shown in Figure 12c. Here,
    a smartphone app, web interface, and other automation applications were developed
    and primarily implemented within the central IoT server [60]. Figure 12a,b show
    the smartphone app and the web interface. Figure 12. (a) Mobile Application, (b)
    Web Application, and (c) client-server connectivity for user interface. The mobile
    and web applications were linked to a Node.js server. A mobile Android application
    was used to collect data, a server was used to store the data and generate notifications,
    and a web client was used as a dashboard to display all the AWD specific information.
    The mobile app and web dashboard used rESTful APIs, HTTP requests, and web sockets
    to interface with the server. Sensor data from the external sensor devices was
    recorded on the server, where it was reactively pushed to the mobile client and
    dashboard using web sockets. Web sockets were used to communicate between the
    server and the clients. Both the Android and web apps provided similar services,
    such as user registration, sensor data acquisition, warning generation based on
    sensor data, and data and AWD status reports on the dashboard. The end user, farmers,
    can reconfigure the AWD parameters, such as water level and pump operation time
    using either the smartphone app or web interface. 7. Performance Analysis In traditional
    irrigation systems, water distribution is performed using earthen canals [50]
    due to their low initial cost. However, these canals result in poor distribution
    efficiency, less area coverage, and, in the long run, results in high maintenance
    costs. The greatest concern in using earthen canals is the high water loss, which
    is expressed as water conveyance loss (S) [51] and can be calculated using Equation
    (14). 𝑆={( 𝑄 1 − 𝑄 2 )÷𝐿}×100 (14) where S = the rate of conveyance loss in the
    canal ( m 3  s −1 ) per 100 m distance, Q1 = rate of flow at the inlet ( m 3  s
    −1 ), Q2 = rate of flow at the outlet ( m 3  s −1 ), and L = distance between
    two points (m). The main factor causing this loss in the earthen canals is due
    to seepage loss. Studies have found that about 40% of the water is lost during
    the distribution time through the earthen canals [50]. The proposed automated
    AWD system using plastic pipes can overcome this conveyance loss, and help reduce
    the irrigation time, which in turn results in less energy (fuel or electricity)
    to operate the pumps. The conveyance loss rate for the proposed project derived
    from [51] is shown in Figure 13. It compares the conveyance loss between earthen
    canals and plastic piping when water is transported 5000 m from the water source
    to the field. Thus, the proposed design saves about 90.91% of water when transporting
    it from the source using plastic piping instead of earthen canals. Furthermore,
    studies conducted by [51] have found that the incorporation of the AWD method
    with plastic pipes has saved about 42% of water, and reduced energy consumption
    by 41.2% compared to the traditional method. Figure 13. Conveyance loss compensation
    between earthen canal and plastic pipe. Using Equations (5) and (7), the frequency
    of irrigations, 𝐼 1𝑗  and  𝐼 2𝑗 , can be used to determine the total energy consumption
    of the pumps. For instance, to reflood a 100-acre field with 3 cm of water while
    maintaining continuous water during TPFj, a single 2000-GPM capacity pump with
    70% efficiency and 12 hp, operating for 18 h, would be sufficient as seen in Figure
    5a. Then, using Equation (9), average power consumption of the pump is found to
    be 142.8 KWh. Similarly, the average energy consumption can be determined for
    the AWD method. Therefore, the total energy consumption for the whole season can
    be found by using Equation (15): 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 (𝐾𝑊ℎ)= 𝐼 1𝑗 ∗𝐸𝑎(𝑇𝑃 𝐹
    𝑗 )+  𝐼 2𝑗 ∗𝐸𝑎(𝐴𝑊𝐷) (15) where 𝐸𝑎(𝑇𝑃 𝐹 𝑗 ) represents the energy consumption during
    the TPF stages in order to supply 3 cm of water to the field, and 𝐸𝑎(𝐴𝑊𝐷) denotes
    the energy required to supply water when water reaches 15 cm below ground during
    the AWD method. It can be observed that, compared to the traditional method which
    utilizes continuous water, the proposed automated system is expected to require
    less energy. Figure 14 shows the dimensioning steps and mathematical calculations
    that are used for the proposed AWD system. Figure 14. Required dimensioning and
    calculation steps for an IoT-based AWD system. Table 4 compares the automated
    AWD method with manual AWD systems. Manual AWD studies focused on limited field
    sizes, soil types, and water sources. Sharing a limited number of water-lifting
    devices amongst numerous farmers tended to cause conflicts among them. Furthermore,
    the number of farmers it supported was generally quite limited. However, in the
    proposed IoT- and WSN-based automated AWD system, large-scale implementation is
    possible using a pipe and actuator-based water distribution system with cluster
    pump operation and monitoring. In this proposed system, 10 clusters, each containing
    25 pumps with capacities of 0.1262 m 3 /s (2000 GPM), can cover an area of 25,000
    acres. In this system, the pumps have 12 hp with an average pumping efficiency
    of 70%, which can support a large number of farmers while still allowing each
    farmer to obtain a fair share of water. Table 4. Comparison between manual AWD
    and automated AWD. In manual AWD, due to manual inspection of water levels throughout
    the irrigation season, pumps may operate for more hours than necessary, resulting
    in the wastage of valuable resources. However, in automated systems, pumps are
    switched off as soon as the water level reaches a certain threshold level, resulting
    in water and energy savings. The experiments presented in [46] showed that the
    automated AWD saved between 13–20% of water, with a 25% decrease in irrigation
    energy cost, and an increase in rice yields by 2–11% over manual AWD. The AWD
    automation scheme proposed in this paper is expected to reduce irrigation costs
    further since it uses plastic pipes to carry water. Moreover, integration of weather
    forecast data will operate the pumps effectively (e.g., keeping pumps off when
    the forecast predicts precipitation). Research in [45,46] presented automation
    of the AWD process by using sensors to precisely measure the water level precisely.
    These studies focused on small areas compared to that of the system described
    in this paper. For large-scale automation of AWD, multiple WSNs need to be designed
    and implemented. While automated AWD systems offer certain advantages over the
    manual AWD, as described in Table 4, the dimensioning of the wide-area automated
    AWD system may face challenges during implementation. The plant physiological
    database for developing countries such as Bangladesh is not regularly updated
    and is not easily accessible. In Bangladesh, where farmers are largely not exposed
    to technology, their knowledge and experiences about rice and irrigation are not
    readily available. Moreover, one of the research constraints is that the weather
    forecast information is not based on the specific local territory. Rather, it
    is based on the general meteorological information of the whole region. 8. Conclusions
    This paper has presented an approach to automating a wide-area AWD system covering
    a total irrigation area of 25,000 acres. Implementation of AWD in such a large
    irrigation area has not been reported in the existing literature. It is imperative
    that such a large system uses automation instead of the traditional manual operation
    and monitoring approach. The automation can be achieved by integrating three essential
    and intricate wireless sensor networks (WSN): a mechanical subsystem comprised
    of pumps, actuator networks, and a water distribution network, and an IoT system
    that runs the automation algorithm and issues control commands. The data from
    the WSN, along with other operating parameters, are processed at a central server
    that decides whether to activate the pumps and the actuator valves. The system
    is scalable and the algorithm can be adjusted for irrigation areas with different
    sizes within a practical limit. The required set of equations to support the design
    and operation of the overall system is provided in this paper. The hardware for
    the system is presented and described in order to facilitate the implementation
    of the automation system. The communication protocol and automation algorithm
    have also been presented in sufficient detail. A sample study on a small-scale
    field trial is presented as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the effectiveness
    of the proposed system. An analysis of the proposed system’s expected performance
    is discussed by comparing it with manual and automated AWD systems in the existing
    literature. The analysis highlights the large irrigation area and the complete
    automation aspect of the proposed system. Despite numerous advantages, such as
    reduced water consumption, and economic and environmental benefits, widespread
    adoption of AWD is yet to be materialized due to social, economic, and technical
    challenges. This paper demonstrates that, with the adoption of existing sensor
    networks and IoT-based technologies, wide area adoption [25] is feasible and economically
    viable. The proposed wide-area AWD system allows for continuous monitoring and
    real-time decision making along with a fair distribution of water amongst the
    farmers. The authors are optimistic that, with the adoption of the proposed system,
    wide area AWD will be implemented in rice-growing countries. These countries will
    then reap the full benefits of the technological advantages that AWD has to offer.
    For future expansion of the proposed system, long-term data can be collected and
    analyzed to improve the system further and to further control the greenhouse emissions
    more effectively. Since the proposed system enables the collection of data and
    creation of a large database, new models can be generated and advanced techniques,
    including machine learning and big data, can be applied for better performance.
    Furthermore, incorporating the farmer’s valuable input alongside previous data
    and algorithms will make it possible to accurately identify the different physiological
    stages of plants during the season, resulting in the improved development of plants
    and yields. Author Contributions Conceptualization, G.M.E.R. and R.M.; methodology,

  data_sources: multi-source data of crop type, climate factors, and the digital elevation
    model (DEM)
  description: Northeast China (NEC) is one of the most important national agricultural
    production bases, and its agricultural water dynamics are essential for food security
    and sustainable agricultural development. However, the dynamics of long-term annual
    crop-specific agricultural water and its crop type and climate impacts remain
    largely unknown, compromising water-saving practices and water-efficiency agricultural
    management in this vital area. Thus, this study used multi-source data of the
    crop type, climate factors, and the digital elevation model (DEM), and multiple
    digital agriculture technologies of remote sensing (RS), the geographic information
    system (GIS), the Soil Conservation Service of the United States Department of
    Agriculture (USDA-SCS) model, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
    Nations Penman–Monteith (FAO P-M) model, and the water supply–demand index (M)
    to map the annual spatiotemporal distribution of effective precipitation (Pe),
    crop water requirement (ETc), irrigation water requirement (IWR), and the supply–demand
    situation in the NEC from 2000 to 2020. The study further analyzed the impacts
    of the crop type and climate changes on agricultural water dynamics and revealed
    the reasons and policy implications for their spatiotemporal heterogeneity. The
    results indicated that the annual average Pe, ETc, IWR, and M increased by 1.56%/a,
    0.74%/a, 0.42%/a, and 0.83%/a in the NEC, respectively. Crop-specifically, the
    annual average Pe increased by 1.15%/a, 2.04%/a, and 2.09%/a, ETc decreased by
    0.46%/a, 0.79%/a, and 0.89%/a, IWR decreased by 1.03%/a, 1.32%/a, and 3.42%/a,
    and M increased by 1.48%/a, 2.67%/a, and 2.87%/a for maize, rice, and soybean,
    respectively. Although the ETc and IWR for all crops decreased, regional averages
    still increased due to the expansion of water-intensive maize and rice. The crop
    type and climate changes jointly influenced agricultural water dynamics. Crop
    type transfer contributed 39.28% and 41.25% of the total IWR increase, and the
    remaining 60.72% and 58.75% were caused by cropland expansion in the NEC from
    2000 to 2010 and 2010 to 2020, respectively. ETc and IWR increased with increasing
    temperature and solar radiation, and increasing precipitation led to decreasing
    IWR in the NEC. The adjustment of crop planting structure and the implementation
    of water-saving practices need to comprehensively consider the spatiotemporally
    heterogeneous impacts of crop and climate changes on agricultural water dynamics.
    The findings of this study can aid RS-GIS-based agricultural water simulations
    and applications and support the scientific basis for agricultural water management
    and sustainable agricultural development.

  explanation: The paper maps the spatiotemporal distribution of crop type-specific
    agricultural water dynamics in Northeast China from 2000 to 2020. The study found
    that climate changes had a substantial impact on the irrigation water requirement.
    Increasing temperature and solar radiation lead to increasing irrigation water
    requirement, while increasing precipitation resulted in decreasing irrigation
    water requirement in Northeast China. Crop type transfer contributed 39.28% and
    41.25% of the total irrigation water requirement increase from 2000 to 2010 and
    2010 to 2020, respectively.
  extract_1: Increasing temperature and solar radiation lead to increasing irrigation

    and soybean, respectively. Although the ETc and IWR for all crops decreased, regional
    averages still increased due to the expansion of water-intensive maize and rice.
    The crop type and climate changes jointly influenced agricultural water dynamics.
    Crop type transfer contributed 39.28% and 41.25% of the total IWR increase, and
    the remaining 60.72% and 58.75% were caused by cropland expansion in the NEC from
    2000 to 2010 and 2010 to 2020, respectively. ETc and IWR increased with increasing
    temperature and solar radiation, and increasing precipitation led to decreasing
    IWR in the NEC. The adjustment of crop planting structure and the implementation
    of water-saving practices need to comprehensively consider the spatiotemporally
    heterogeneous impacts of crop and climate changes on agricultural water dynamics.
    The findings of this study can aid RS-GIS-based agricultural water simulations
    and applications and support the scientific basis for agricultural water management
    and sustainable agricultural development. Keywords: agricultural water use; irrigation

    Water is one of the most important material resources for the development of human
    society, and it is indispensable for any production process [1]. With rapid socio-economic
    development and environmental deterioration over the past century, water scarcity
    has become a thorny problem [2]. More than 40 countries (about 40% of the world’s
    population) face the challenge of water scarcity, which seriously limits their
    sustainable economic development [3,4]. There are many reasons for water scarcity;
    specifically, global population growth, climate change, excessive industrial production,
    rapid urbanization, and the expansion of agricultural land have all led to an
    increased demand for water [5,6,7]. Agriculture accounts for 70% of the world’s
    water resources [8,9]. Therefore, it is critical to understand the water supply
    and demand in the agricultural sector and explore rational water allocation to
    help to maintain sustainable agricultural development. As the world’s leading
    agricultural nation, the crop irrigation water requirement in China constitutes
    over 90% of the total agricultural water requirement [10]. The agricultural irrigation
    requirement is the key to growing crops and sustainable food production and security
    [11]. As a result, the crop irrigation water requirement has received significant
    attention [12,13]. The increase in the irrigation water requirement has resulted
    in an increasing trend in crop yield [14]. Only 20% of the world’s irrigated land
    had grown over 40% of the grain production yield, and irrigated land yields roughly
    2.5 times the grain production compared to non-irrigated land [15]. Approximately
    three-quarters of the grain production was cultivated in irrigated farmland [16,17].
    In the late 1960s, our country made great efforts to build irrigation infrastructure
    on farmland and this led to crop yield increasing rapidly [10]. The crop irrigation
    water requirement is expressed as the difference between the crop water requirement
    and the effective precipitation [18,19]. Methods for calculating the irrigation
    water requirement include field observation, non-spatial crop models, and the
    spatial crop method (Table 1). The first method obtains a mass conservation function
    for calculating the crop irrigation water requirement by considering the relevant
    parameters [20,21]. The second method uses point data of reference evapotranspiration
    and crop coefficient values from the available literature, with over 100 different
    crop models available [22]. The most frequently utilized models include CROPWAT,
    AquaCrop, and PolyCrop [23]. CROPWAT is a model developed by the Food and Agriculture
    Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in 1991 to calculate crop water requirements
    and it plays a significant role in crop water requirement estimation for different
    regions and crop types [24]. AquaCrop has the advantages of simple input parameters,
    a simple interface, and stable simulation results [25]. PolyCrop can calculate
    variations in the water requirement for a crop cultivation system based on crop
    type changes and growth seasons [26]. However, these models cannot address irrigation
    water changes caused by the crop type and spatiotemporal differences. The third
    method can predict the spatial distribution of the relevant data, which can directly
    reflect spatiotemporal changes and help to reveal spatial phenomena and laws [27,28].
    However, considering the lack of a spatial crop model, conducting long-term annual
    crop-specific studies has great significance for gaining insight into the water
    dynamics of major crops. Table 1. Advantages and disadvantages of methods for
    estimating crop irrigation water requirements. As one of the most crucial grain
    production bases in China, the agricultural irrigation water requirement accounts
    for 78% of the total water in Northeast China (NEC) [35,36]. The crop planting
    structure has been largely adjusted in recent years, especially having rapidly
    expanded the area of the water-intensive crops but reduced the water-saving soybean
    crops [37]. This has led to an increase in the regional crop irrigation water
    requirement [38,39]. In addition, climate changes have an impact on the crop irrigation
    water requirement [40,41,42]. However, previous studies have mainly focused on
    the spatiotemporal changes in the crop water requirement for a specific crop type
    and analyzed the effects of climate changes or crop type changes on irrigation
    water requirement, rather than discussing these on a raster scale [43,44,45,46].
    In addition, there are few research studies on long-term changes, annually analyzing
    spatiotemporal changes in the crop water requirement [47,48,49]. This study used
    multi-source remote-sensing (RS) data and digital agriculture technologies to
    map the annual crop-specific spatiotemporal distribution of effective precipitation
    (Pe), crop water requirement (ETc), irrigation water requirement (IWR), and water
    supply–demand index (M), reveal the impacts of the crop type and climate changes
    on agricultural water dynamics in the NEC from 2000–2020, and discuss the policy
    recommendations and future research topics for integrated water resource management
    and sustainable agricultural development. 2. Materials 2.1. Study Area The NEC
    (38°52′–53°55′N, 115°52′–135°09′E) consists of three provinces of Heilongjiang,
    Jilin, Liaoning, and the four eastern leagues of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
    Region (Chifeng, Tongliao, Xing’an, and Hulunbeier), covering an area of 1.24
    × 106 km2 (Figure 1a). The region straddles the mesothermal and subfreezing zones
    from south to north and has a temperate monsoon climate with distinct seasons.
    It has warm, rainy summers and cold, dry winters. From the southeast to the northwest,
    the annual precipitation drops from 1000 mm to less than 300 mm, and the transition
    is from a humid and semi-humid area to semi-arid area. The NEC has fertile black
    soil, accounting for approximately 12% of the total area of the world’s total
    black soil area, which makes the NEC one of the main grain-producing areas in
    China, representing a quarter of the country’s total food production. The main
    food crops are mainly distributed in the central and southern areas of maize,
    the eastern area of rice, and the northern and northwestern areas of soybean,
    respectively (Figure 1b). Figure 1. Geographical location, climate stations (a),
    and crop type distribution (b) in the NEC. 2.2. Data Sources The multi-source
    data used in this study included climate factors, crop type RS products, the digital
    elevation model (DEM), and the administrative boundary. Climate factors included
    daily field observations of temperature (maximum, minimum, and average), precipitation,
    wind speed, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, and sunshine hours in the
    NEC from 2000 to 2020, which were from 60 climate stations of the National Meteorological
    Science Data Center (https://data.cma.cn/, accessed on 25 July 2023). We further
    spatially interpolated the field observations into 500 m spatial resolution daily
    raster data using the thin-plate spline method that introduced DEM as a covariate
    in the ANUSPLIN version 4.3 software [50]. The monthly averages of these climate
    factors in Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, and Inner Mongolia are shown in Table
    2. Table 2. Monthly climate factors for the four areas in the NEC. The crop type
    RS products were the 500 m spatial resolution annual distributions of maize, rice,
    and soybean in the NEC from 2000 to 2020, which were provided by Liu and Wang
    [37]. The crop type data were obtained using 111-dimensional MOD09A1 features,
    recursive feature elimination, and random forest algorithms on the Google Earth
    Engine (GEE) platform, with the sample-based classification accuracies of 84.73–86.93%
    and a statistics-based R2 of 0.81–0.95. DEM data were sourced from the Resource
    and Environmental Science and Data Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (https://www.resdc.cn/,
    accessed on 25 July 2023), with a spatial resolution of 500 m. National and provincial
    administrative boundary data were the 2015 multi-level national vector map from
    the Resource and Environmental Science and Data Center of the Chinese Academy
    of Sciences (https://www.resdc.cn/, accessed on 25 July 2023). 3. Methods In this
    study, based on multi-source data of daily climate data, DEM, and crop type RS
    data, we first used the Soil Conservation Service of the United States Department
    of Agriculture (USDA-SCS) model to calculate Pe and used the RS-based FAO Penman–Monteith
    (P-M) model to estimate ETc in the NEC from 2000 to 2020 (Figure 2). Second, we
    used the FAO IWR formula to calculate the IWR and applied the water supply–demand
    index (M) to evaluate the agricultural water supply–demand situation. Third, we
    adopted transfer matrix-based statistics to estimate the IWR change and its contribution
    rate caused by different crop type transfers and used a gradient boxplot to reveal
    the impact of climate change on the ETc and IWR. Figure 2. Research framework
    for crop water requirement. 3.1. Calculation of Effective Precipitation Effective
    precipitation is the amount of precipitation that can be effectively used, excluding
    surface runoff and seepage below the crop root zone [23]. There are more effective
    precipitation influencing factors, such as crop type and physiological characteristics,
    soil texture, and climate changes. This study used the USDA-SCS model to calculate
    the daily effective precipitation (Pe) during the crop growth period [51,52,53].
    The formula for Pe was as follows: 𝑃𝑒= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨     𝑃×(4.17−0.2)/4.17 4.17+0.1×𝑃
    𝑃<8.3 𝑃≥8.3 (1) where Pe is the daily effective precipitation (mm), and P is the
    daily precipitation (mm). 3.2. Calculation of Crop Water Requirement This study
    used daily climate raster data and the FAO P-M model to calculate reference crop
    evapotranspiration (ETo) and the crop water requirement (ETc) [54], by adopting
    the crop type RS products to obtain the crop-specific spatial distribution of
    key crop parameters. Notably, the parameters for a certain crop in this study
    were the same in space. The formula for ETo was as follows: 𝐸 𝑇 𝑜 = 0.408×𝛥( 𝑅
    𝑛 −𝐺)+𝛾× 900 𝑇+273 × 𝑢 2 ( 𝑒 𝑠 − 𝑒 𝑎 ) 𝛥+𝛾(1+0.34× 𝑢 2 ) (2) where ETo is the
    reference crop evapotranspiration (mm/d); Δ is the slope of the saturated water
    vapor pressure–temperature curve (KPa/°C); Rn is the net crop canopy surface radiation
    (MJ/(m2∙d)); G is the soil heat flux (MJ/(m2∙d)), when calculating with daily
    climate data, G = 0; γ is the psychrometric constant (KPa/°C); T is the average
    temperature at 2 m (°C); u2 is the average wind speed at 2 m (m/s); es is the
    saturated water vapor pressure (KPa); ea is the actual vapor pressure (KPa); es
    − ea is the saturation pressure deficit (KPa). The crop water requirement (ETc)
    is determined by crop coefficients and the reference crop evapotranspiration.
    The formula for ETc was as follows: 𝐸 𝑇 𝑐,𝑖 = 𝐾 𝑐,𝑖 ×𝐸 𝑇 𝑜 (3) where i is the
    crop type; ETc,i is the crop water requirement (mm); Kc,i is the crop coefficient
    during various growth periods, which is calculated using the single crop coefficient
    method; Kc is categorized according to the growth periods of the crop into Kc
    ini (during the initial and rapid growth period), Kc mid (during the mid-growth
    period), and Kc end (during the final growth period). The Kc values for the three
    crops were based on the crop fertility situation (Table 3) and relevant experimental
    results [55]. Table 3. The growth period and Kc coefficients of three crops in
    the NEC. 3.3. Calculation of Irrigation Water Requirement The crop irrigation
    water requirement (IWR) is the difference between the crop water requirement and
    the effective precipitation [56]. The formula for IWR was as follows: 𝐼𝑊 𝑅 𝑖 =
    ⎧ ⎩ ⎨     𝐸 𝑇 𝑐,𝑖 −𝑃 𝑒 𝑖 0 𝐸 𝑇 𝑐,𝑖 >P 𝑒 𝑖 𝐸 𝑇 𝑐,𝑖 ≤𝑃 𝑒 𝑖 (4) where IWRi is
    the irrigation water requirement of crop i during the growth period (mm); ETc,i
    is the crop water requirement of crop i during the growth period (mm); Pei is
    the effective precipitation of crop i during the growth period (mm). 3.4. Calculation
    of Water Supply–Demand Index The water supply–demand index reflects the relationship
    between the effective supply and demand of regional agricultural available water
    resources [46]. The formula for M was as follows: 𝑀 𝑖 = 𝑊 𝑖 𝐷 𝑖 (5) where Mi is
    the water supply–demand index for crop i; Wi is the effective water supply for
    crop i during the growth period, which is the effective precipitation (Pe); Di
    is the crop water requirement for crop i during the growth period (ETc). Normally,
    the value of M ranges from 0 to 1. The larger the M value, the better the matching
    degree, whereas the smaller the M value, the poorer the matching degree. When
    M ≥ 1, the crop effective precipitation has met the irrigation water requirement.
    3.5. Linear Regression Trend Analysis This study used linear regression to analyze
    the trends of Pe, ETc, IWR, and M for different crops from 2000 to 2020 in the
    NEC. The slope in the regression equation represents the inter-annual variability
    and is calculated using the least squares method. The formula for slope was as
    follows: 𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒= 𝑛× ∑ 𝑛 𝑡=1 𝑡× 𝑊 𝑡 −( ∑ 𝑛 𝑡=1 𝑡)( ∑ 𝑛 𝑡=1 𝑊 𝑡 ) 𝑛× ∑ 𝑛 𝑡=1 𝑡 2
    − ( ∑ 𝑡 𝑖=1 𝑡) 2 (6) 𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒%=𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒× 𝑛 ∑ 𝑛 𝑡=1 𝑊 𝑡 ×100 (7) where slope is the inter-annual
    trend, n is the number of years; Wt is the value of this index (Pe, ETc, IWR,
    M) in year t; a positive slope indicates an increasing trend and a negative slope
    indicates a decreasing trend; slope% is the ratio of slope to the multi-year average
    W, which aims to calculate the magnitude of change in the multi-year average of
    W. 4. Results 4.1. Annual Spatial Distribution and Temporal Changes in Pe The
    average of Pe in the NEC from 2000 to 2020 showed a slowly increasing trend (Figure
    3). The average Pe value reached its highest value of 239.39 mm in 2019, while
    it reached its lowest value of 153.13 mm in 2007. The slope of Pe in 2000–2020
    was 2.99 mm/a and the slope% was 1.56%/a (Table 4). The average Pe for maize,
    rice, and soybean showed an upward trend (Figure 4a). The average Pe for maize
    reached its highest value of 242.72 mm in 2005, while it reached its lowest value
    of 158.62 mm in 2000. The average Pe for rice reached its highest value of 266.88
    mm in 2019, while it reached its lowest value of 144.83 mm in 2007. The average
    Pe for soybean reached its highest value of 252.33 mm in 2019, while it reached
    its lowest value of 131.11 mm in 2007. The multi-year average Pe for the three
    crops was 195.52 mm, 180.68 mm, and 193.28 mm, respectively. The slope of Pe from
    2000 to 2020 for maize, rice, and soybean was 2.24 mm/a, 3.69 mm/a, and 4.04 mm/a,
    respectively, and the slope% was 1.15%/a, 2.04%/a, and 2.09%/a, respectively (Table
    4). Figure 3. The annual average Pe, ETc, IWR, and M values in the NEC from 2000
    to 2020. Figure 4. The annual average Pe (a), ETc (b), IWR (c), and M values (d)
    for different crop types in the NEC from 2000 to 2020. Table 4. Slope and slope%
    of Pe, ETc, IWR, and M for different crops in the NEC from 2000 to 2020. The average
    of Pe for maize was the highest in Liaoning at 207.28 mm and the lowest in Inner
    Mongolia at 155.72 mm (Table 5). The average of Pe for rice was the highest in
    Liaoning at 184.10 mm and the lowest in Inner Mongolia at 151.55 mm. The average
    of Pe for soybean was the highest in Heilongjiang at 206.79 mm and the lowest
    in Liaoning at 165.45 mm. The standard deviation of Pe for maize was the highest
    in Jilin at 40.08 mm and the lowest in Liaoning at 17.98 mm. The standard deviation
    of Pe for rice was the highest in Heilongjiang at 56.57 mm and the lowest in Inner
    Mongolia at 39.45. The standard deviation of Pe for soybean was the highest in
    Jilin at 37.40 mm and the lowest in Liaoning at 10.81 mm. Table 5. The average
    and standard deviation Pe, ETc, IWR, and M values of different crops for the four
    areas in the NEC from 2000 to 2020. The Pe had different spatial changes in 2000–2020
    in the NEC (Figure 5). The average Pe from west to east showed a trend of first
    increasing, then decreasing and then increasing in the whole NEC during the past
    two decades. The maximum standard deviation of Pe was mainly distributed in the
    eastern area in Heilongjiang, and the minimum standard deviation of Pe was mainly
    distributed in the southeastern area in Inner Mongolia. Pe in Inner Mongolia generally
    showed a trend of being low in the central area and high in the northern and southern
    areas. Heilongjiang was higher in the southeastern area, with a southeast–northwest
    dividing line and a decreasing trend towards both sides. Jilin showed a trend
    of gradual decrease from the southeastern to the northwestern area. Liaoning showed
    a gradual trend of decreasing from the eastern to the western area. The maximum
    value of Pe was mainly distributed in the southeastern area in the NEC from 2000
    to 2011, which moved gradually from the southeastern to the central–eastern area
    from 2012 to 2020 in the NEC. The minimum value of Pe was mainly distributed in
    the central and eastern areas in the NEC. Figure 5. The spatial distribution of
    annual Pe and their average and standard deviation in the NEC from 2000 to 2020.
    4.2. Annual Spatial Distribution and Temporal Changes in ETc The average ETc in
    the NEC showed a gradual increase from 2000 to 2020 (Figure 3). The average ETc
    reached the highest value of 763.27 mm in 2020, while reached the lowest value
    of 622.93 mm in 2000. The slope of ETc was 5.09 mm/a and the slope% was 0.74%/a
    (Table 4). The average of ETc for maize, rice, and soybean showed a decreasing
    trend (Figure 4b). The average ETc for maize reached the highest value of 826.50
    mm in 2001, while it reached the lowest value of 699.27 mm in 2013. The average
    ETc for rice reached the highest value of 1294.11 mm in 2001, while it reached
    the lowest value of 1019.20 mm in 2013. The average ETc for soybean reached the
    highest value of 474.97 mm in 2007, while it reached the lowest value of 368.42
    mm in 2013. The multi-year average ETc values for the three crops were 755.21
    mm, 1147.53 mm, and 421.29 mm, respectively. The slope of ETc from 2000 to 2020
    for maize, rice, and soybean was −3.50 mm/a, −9.09 mm/a, and −3.76 mm/a, respectively,
    and the slope% was −0.46%/a, −0.79%/a, and −0.89%/a, respectively (Table 4). The
    average of ETc for maize was the highest in Inner Mongolia at 825.91 mm and the
    lowest in Heilongjiang at 729.70 mm (Table 5). The average of ETc for rice was
    the highest in Inner Mongolia at 1249.20 mm and the lowest in Heilongjiang at
    1142.03 mm. The average of ETc for soybean was the highest in Liaoning at 455.04
    mm and the lowest in Heilongjiang at 404.78 mm. The standard deviation of ETc
    for maize was the highest in Inner Mongolia at 262.58 mm and the lowest in Liaoning
    at 149.37. The standard deviation of ETc for rice was the highest in Jilin at
    283.61 mm and the lowest in Inner Mongolia at 158.41 mm. The standard deviation
    of ETc for soybean was the highest in Inner Mongolia at 57.28 mm and the lowest
    in Liaoning at 34.04 mm. The ETc had different spatial changes in 2000–2020 in
    the NEC (Figure 6). The average ETc from north to south and from west to east
    showed a gradual tread of increasing in the whole NEC during the past two decades.
    The maximum standard deviation of ETc was mainly distributed in the eastern area
    in Heilongjiang, and the minimum standard deviation of ETc was mainly distributed
    in the southwestern area in Liaoning. The ETc of Inner Mongolia generally showed
    a trend of being higher in the southern area and lower in the northern area. Heilongjiang
    expanded from the center to the surroundings, which showed a trend of being lower
    in the central area and higher in the surroundings. Jilin and Liaoning had basically
    the same trend, both of which showed a decreasing trend from the central area
    to the surroundings. The maximum value of ETc was mainly in the southern and eastern
    areas from 2000 to 2001 in the NEC. Since 2002, the maximum value of ETc has gradually
    moved from the southern to the northern area until the south–central area in the
    NEC. The eastern area of the NEC has remained one of the major distribution areas
    for the ETc maximum. The spatial distribution of the minimum value of ETc was
    basically unchanged from 2000 to 2020, it was still mainly found in the central
    area of Heilongjiang and eastern–central area of Inner Mongolia. Figure 6. The
    spatial distribution of annual ETc and their average and standard deviation in
    the NEC from 2000 to 2020. 4.3. Annual Spatial Distribution and Temporal Changes
    in IWR The average IWR in the NEC showed a gradual increase from 2000 to 2020
    (Figure 3). The average IWR reached the highest value of 706.71 mm in 2001, while
    it reached the lowest value of 475.08 mm in 2013. The slope of IWR was 2.08 mm/a
    and the slope% was 0.42%/a (Table 4). The average of IWR for maize, rice, and
    soybean showed a decreasing trend (Figure 4c). Crop types varied in the irrigation
    water requirement. The average IWR for maize reached the highest value of 663.19
    mm in 2001, while it reached the lowest value of 480.01 mm in 2013. The average
    IWR for rice reached the highest value of 1138.41 mm in 2001, while it reached
    the lowest value of 819.55 mm in 2013. The average IWR for soybean reached the
    highest value of 343.87 mm in 2007, while it reached the lowest value of 125.68
    mm in 2013. The multi-year average IWR for maize, rice, and soybean was 559.51
    mm, 967.12 mm, and 228.00 mm, respectively. The slope of IWR from 2000 to 2020
    for maize, rice, and soybean was −5.77 mm/a, −12.73 mm/a, and −7.80 mm/a, and
    the slope% was −1.03%/a, −1.32%/a, and −3.42%/a, respectively (Table 4). The average
    of IWR for maize was the highest in Inner Mongolia at 669.69 mm and the lowest
    in Heilongjiang at 522.76 mm (Table 5). The average of IWR for rice was the highest
    in Inner Mongolia at 1097.31 mm and the lowest in Heilongjiang at 960.23 mm. The
    average of IWR for soybean was the highest in Liaoning at 289.59 mm and the lowest
    in Heilongjiang at 198.02 mm. The standard deviation of IWR for maize was the
    highest in 276.45 mm and the lowest in Inner Mongolia at 149.16 mm. The standard
    deviation of IWR for rice was the highest in Inner Mongolia at 226.28 mm and the
    lowest in Liaoning at 129.48 mm. The standard deviation of IWR for soybean was
    the highest in Jinlin at 77.11 mm and the lowest in Liaoning at 33.82 mm. The
    IWR had different spatial changes in 2000–2020 in the NEC (Figure 7). The average
    IWR showed a gradually increasing trend from north to south in the whole NEC during
    the past two decades. The maximum standard deviation of IWR was mainly distributed
    in the eastern area in Heilongjiang, and the minimum was mainly distributed in
    the northern area in Heilongjiang. Inner Mongolia showed an increasing trend from
    the northern to the southern area. Heilongjiang expanded from the center to the
    surroundings, which showed a trend of being lower in the central area and higher
    in the surroundings. Jilin showed a trend of gradual decrease from the northeastern
    to the southwestern area. Liaoning showed a decreasing trend from the center to
    the surroundings. The maximum value of IWR was mainly in the south–central and
    eastern areas in the NEC from 2000 to 2001. Since 2002, the maximum value of IWR
    has gradually moved from Liaoning to the central area in the NEC. The eastern
    area of the NEC has remained one of the major distribution areas for IWR maximum.
    The spatial distribution of the minimum value of IWR was relatively unchanged
    from 2000 to 2020; it was still mainly concentrated in the central area of Heilongjiang
    and eastern–central area of Inner Mongolia. Figure 7. The spatial distribution
    of annual IWR and their average and standard deviation in the NEC from 2000 to
    2020. 4.4. Annual Spatial Distribution and Temporal Changes in M The average M
    showed an increasing trend in the NEC from 2000 to 2020 (Figure 3). M reached
    the highest value of 0.39 in 2005, while it reached the lowest value of 0.23 in
    2007. The slope of M was 0.003/a and the slope% was 0.83%/a (Table 4). The average
    M for maize, rice, and soybean showed an increasing trend from 2000 to 2020 (Figure
    4d). The average M value for maize reached the highest value of 0.34 in 2005,
    while it reached the lowest value of 0.20 in 2001. The average M value for rice
    reached the highest value of 0.25 in 2019, while it reached the lowest value of
    0.12 in 2007. The average M for soybean reached the highest value of 0.67 in 2013,
    while it reached the lowest value of 0.28 in 2007. The multi-year average M values
    for maize, rice, and soybean were 0.27, 0.16, and 0.48, respectively. The slope
    of M from 2000 to 2020 for maize, rice, and soybean was 0.004/a, 0.004/a, and
    0.01/a, and the slope% was 1.48%/a, 2.67%/a, and 2.87%/a, respectively (Table
    4). The average of M for maize was the highest in Heilongjiang at 0.29 and the
    lowest in Inner Mongolia at 0.19 (Table 5). The average of M for rice was the
    highest in Heilongjiang at 0.164 and the lowest in Inner Mongolia at 0.12. The
    average for soybean was the highest in Heilongjiang at 0.53 and the lowest in
    Liaoning at 0.37. The standard deviation of M for maize was the highest in Jilin
    at 0.102 and the lowest in Liaoning at 0.062. The standard deviation of M for
    rice was the highest in Heilongjiang at 0.085 and the lowest in Inner Mongolia
    at 0.043. The standard deviation of M for soybean was the highest in Jilin at
    0.12 and the lowest in Liaoning at 0.03. The M had different spatial changes in
    2000–2020 in the NEC (Figure 8). The average M from south to north showed a gradual
    increasing tread in the whole NEC during the past two decades. The maximum standard
    deviation of M was mainly distributed in the northern area in Heilongjiang, and
    the minimum standard deviation of M was mainly distributed in the southwestern
    area in Liaoning. Inner Mongolia showed a decreasing trend from the southern to
    the northern area. Heilongjiang narrowed from the center to the surroundings,
    which showed a trend of being higher in the central area and lower in the surroundings.
    Jilin and Liaoning had basically the same trend, which showed a trend of being
    lower in the center and higher in the surrounding areas. The maximum value of
    M was mainly distributed in the central area of Heilongjiang and showed a gradually
    decreasing trend from the central area to the surroundings from 2000 to 2020.
    The minimum value of M was mainly distributed in the central and eastern areas
    of Heilongjiang. Figure 8. The spatial distribution of annual M and their average
    and standard deviation in the NEC from 2000 to 2020. 4.5. Impacts of Crop Type
    Change on IWR The total IWR varied with crop area changes, which increased by
    33.59 × 109 m3 (20.36%) in the NEC (Table 6). The total IWR of maize and rice
    showed an increasing trend, while the total IWR of soybean showed a decreasing
    trend from 2000 to 2020. The total IWR of maize and rice increased by 55.15 ×
    109 m3 (79.47%) and 32.83 × 109 m3 (109.18%), respectively, while the total IWR
    of soybean decreased by 54.39 × 109 m3 (−80.81%). Table 6. Changes in the crop
    cultivation area and IWR in the NEC from 2000 to 2020. Crop type transfer has
    led to a change in irrigation water requirement, and this study analyzed two phases
    (Table 7). The transfer between different crop types resulted in an increase of
    24.71 × 109 m3 in the total IWR in the NEC, which accounted for 39.28% of the
    total IWR change from 2000 to 2010. The expansion of the crop area resulted in
    an increase in the total IWR of 62.91 × 109 m3 (60.72%). The largest transfer
    from soybean to maize was 8.70 × 106 ha; the total IWR increased by 17.57 × 109
    m3 (27.93%). The transfers from maize and soybean to rice were 1.69 × 106 ha and
    1.39 × 106 ha, respectively. This resulted in the total IWR increasing by 4.78
    × 109 m3 (7.60%) and 9.33 × 109 m3 (14.84%), respectively. However, the transfer
    from maize to soybean and the transfer from rice to maize and soybean resulted
    in reductions by 3.58 × 109 m3 (−5.69%), 2.83 × 109 m3 (−4.50%), and 0.56 × 109
    m3 (−0.89%) in the total IWR, respectively. Table 7. The contribution of crop
    type transfer rates to IWR in the NEC from 2000 to 2010. The transfer between
    different crop types resulted in an increase of 14.80 × 109 m3 in the total IWR
    in the NEC, which accounted for 41.25% of the total IWR change from 2010 to 2020
    (Table 8). The largest transfer from soybean to maize was 4.16 × 106 ha; the total
    IWR increased by 11.45 × 109 m3 (31.92%). The transfers from maize and soybean
    to rice were 1.11 × 106 ha and 0.50 × 106 ha, respectively. This resulted in increases
    in the total IWR by 4.85 × 109 m3 (13.53%) and 3.43 × 109 m3 (9.57%), respectively.
    The transfer from maize to soybean and the transfer from rice to maize and soybean
    resulted in decreases by 2.01 × 109 m3 (−5.60%), 2.36 × 109 m3 (−6.58%), and 0.57
    × 109 m3 (−1.59%) in the total IWR, respectively. The expansion of the crop area
    resulted in an increase in the total IWR of 35.87 × 109 m3 (58.75%). Table 8.

    2020. 4.6. Climate Impacts on Spatial Heterogeneity of ETc and IWR This study
    used gradient analysis to calculate the influences of key climate factors on ETc
    and IWR. ETc increased with increasing temperature in the NEC without distinguishing
    crops, and ETc was reduced by temperature when the average temperature exceeded
    5 °C (Figure 9). The effect of solar radiation on ETc was similar to the effect
    of temperature on ETc. However, the effect of precipitation on ETc was to have
    basically no impact on ETc as the precipitation increased. In terms of crop types,
    temperature had little effect on the ETc for maize, while the ETc increased with
    increasing temperature for rice and soybean. Precipitation for maize had little
    effect on ETc, but the ETc decreased with increasing precipitation for rice and
    soybean. The ETc increased with increasing solar radiation for maize, rice, and
    soybean. Figure 9. ETc variations under different temperature gradients without
    distinguishing crops (a) and for different crops (b), under different precipitation
    gradients without distinguishing crops (c) and for different crops (d), and under
    different solar radiation gradients without distinguishing crops (e) and for different
    crops (f) in the NEC. The IWR in the NEC increased with increasing temperature
    without distinguishing crops, and the IWR increased with increasing solar radiation
    (Figure 10). However, the IWR decreased with increasing precipitation. In terms
    of crop types, the temperature change for maize and rice had little effect on
    the IWR, but the IWR increased with the temperature increase in soybean. The IWR
    decreased with the increasing precipitation for maize, rice, and soybean. Solar
    radiation was the opposite to precipitation, and the IWR increased with increasing
    solar radiation for maize, rice, and soybean. Figure 10. IWR variations under
    different temperature gradients without distinguishing crops (a) and for different
    crops (b), under different precipitation gradients without distinguishing crops
    (c) and for different crops (d), and under different solar radiation gradients
    without distinguishing crops (e) and for different crops (f) in the NEC. 5. Discussion
    5.1. Reasons for the Spatiotemporal Heterogeneity of IWR The increased irrigation
    water requirement is the main reason for changes in the crop planting structure,
    with the expansion of cultivated land having the greatest impact. Specifically,
    the expansion of maize and rice sowing amounted to 11.96 × 106 ha (111.15%) and
    4.02 × 106 ha (148.34%), respectively, resulting in an increase in the total IWR
    by 55.15 × 109 m3 and 32.83 × 109 m3, respectively, which led to a water shortage
    of 87.98 × 109 m3. This is similar to Zhang’s finding [46] that the expansion
    of water-intensive crops increases the amount of water used for agricultural irrigation
    and exacerbates the problem of water scarcity. Farmers tend to cultivate and increase
    the area of highly water-intensive maize and rice in order to increase their returns,
    which mainly because of the two crops have higher yields and economic benefits
    than soybean [37]. However, the expansion has led to an increase in the agricultural
    water requirement, a decline in the groundwater levels, reduction in soil organic
    matter, and degradation of black soil, which is not conducive to sustainable agriculture
    development [57,58,59,60,61]. Thus, we should curb the massive expansion of water-intensive
    crops and encourage an increase in the area of soybean that is water-saving and
    soil-beneficial. In addition, we need to quantify the trade-offs and synergies
    of the multi-dimensional effects of different crop yields, agricultural water
    efficiency, and carbon sequestration when rationalizing the crop planting structure.
    Climate change is another factor that generates heterogeneity in the irrigation
    water requirement. The results showed that the IWR was gradually decreased with
    increased precipitation for the three crops, but it was gradually increased with
    increased temperature and solar radiation for the three crops (Figure 10). Increased
    precipitation makes the land wetter, and the soil water storage function provides
    more adequate water during the critical growth period of crops, thus reducing
    the agricultural manual irrigation [62,63]. Increased temperature and solar radiation
    promoted the photosynthesis of crops, which led to increased evaporation and crops
    needing more water, thus leading to an increase in the irrigation water requirement
    [64,65,66]. In addition, the reasons affecting irrigation water requirement are
    not only the crop type and climate changes we analyzed, but also improvements
    in agricultural infrastructures and field management practices. The improvements
    in agricultural infrastructures included building high-standard farmland and improving
    the water and irrigation facilities. And field management practices include irrigation
    technology promotion and deep ploughing and tilling by large machinery that would
    enhance the soil water retention capacity. 5.2. Policy Recommendations and Practical
    Implications Water resource consumption is extremely high, and agriculture uses
    the most water during irrigation, which leads to a decrease in water-use efficiency
    in the country [67,68]. Therefore, irrigation water saving and improving water
    resource utilization have become an important strategic task in maintaining sustainable
    socio-economic development [69,70]. There have been large-scale changes in crop
    type to increase economic and social incomes in the NEC. With the expansion of
    total crop cultivation, the crop cultivation area has far exceeded the maximum
    cultivation area that can be provided by the available water resources, which
    has ultimately led to an excess irrigation water requirement and severe water
    shortage [18,71]. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the crop planting structure
    to reduce the cultivation of water-intensive crops and alleviate the imbalance
    in the agricultural water supply [72,73,74]. The IWR gradually increased from
    the northern to the southern area, and the IWR exceeded 1000 mm in severely water-scarce
    areas. The total crop irrigation water requirement far exceeded the maximum water
    supply in the NEC. This indicated that the effective precipitation has been unable
    to meet the amount of water required for crop growth in the NEC and needs agricultural
    irrigation measures [71,75]. Therefore, we propose to build water conservancy
    projects vigorously and set strict water quotas, strictly controlled crop water
    requirement in water-scarce areas, promote drip irrigation, sprinkler irrigation,
    rain harvesting and irrigation to achieve water-saving irrigation, and strengthen
    the precision management of the agricultural water requirement and reduce agricultural
    water losses [76,77,78]. 5.3. Innovation, Deficiencies, and Prospects Compared
    to previous studies [79,80,81], this study analyzed the annual spatiotemporal
    changes in the irrigation water requirement for different crops, calculated the
    amount of crop type transfer contributing to IWR, and explored the spatial heterogeneity
    of key climate factors on the ETc and IWR. This study could provide some insight
    into the amount of water requirement for crop growth in different years and it
    improved the agricultural irrigation efficiency, and it was also possible to adjust
    the profitable crop cultivation to agricultural producers and managers and provide
    recommendations for more effective water allocation. However, this study only
    estimated the theoretical crop irrigation water requirement, not the actual irrigation
    water requirement. Future research could use multi-source remote-sensing data
    to reveal the spatial and temporal distribution for the actual crop irrigation
    water requirement and provide more comprehensive basic data for sustainable agricultural
    water management. In addition, the model parameters used in this study differed
    by crop type, but the parameters of the same crop in different spaces are the
    same. Future research could integrate RS vegetation indexes and technologies and
    field observations to map spatially-differentiated and crop-specific key parameters
    (e.g., growth period and Kc coefficients) for the more accurate estimation of
    agricultural water use in future studies. Moreover, we used gradient boxplots
    to analyze the impact of climate change on the ETc and IWR, but we did not quantify
    the climatic contribution rate and the correlation coefficients between climatic
    factors and agricultural water use. Future research could use spatial correlation
    analysis and a structural equation model to analyze the correlation and quantitative
    contributions of key climate factors to agricultural water dynamics, supporting
    a more in-depth scientific basis for sustainable agricultural water management
    practices. 6. Conclusions This study integrated multi-source data and multiple
    digital agriculture technologies to analyze annual crop-specific spatiotemporal
    changes in Pe, ETc, IWR, and M, reveal the impacts of crop type and climate changes
    on agricultural water dynamics, and discuss the reasons and policy implications
    for spatiotemporally heterogeneous changes and impacts in the NEC from 2000 to
    2020. The results indicated that regional average Pe, ETc, IWR, and M increased
    by 1.56%/a, 0.74%/a, 0.42%/a, and 0.83%/a, respectively. Jointly influenced by
    crop type and climate changes, the regional total IWR increased from 166.78 ×
    109 m3 in 2000 to 200.37 × 109 m3 in 2020, of which 39.28% and 41.25% were attributed
    to crop type transfer, and the remaining 60.72% and 58.75% were caused by cropland
    expansion from 2000 to 2010 and 2010 to 2020, respectively. This suggested that
    we should curb the massive expansion of cropland and water-intensive crops and
    encourage the cultivation of water-saving and soil-beneficial soybean to reduce
    the IWR and promote agricultural sustainability. Gradient boxplot analysis found
    that the ETc and IWR increased with increasing temperature and solar radiation,
    and increasing precipitation led to decreasing IWR in the NEC. The scientific
    implementation of crop planting structure adjustment and water-efficient management
    practices need to comprehensively quantify the trade-offs and synergies of the
    spatiotemporally heterogeneous multi-dimensional impacts of crop type and climate
    changes on agricultural water use and its efficiency, crop yield, and photosynthetic
    and soil carbon sequestration. Future studies could more accurately estimate agricultural
    water use through RS-based mapping of spatially differentiated parameters, and
    more synthetically quantify the impact mechanisms of key natural–anthropogenic
    factors to support the scientific basis for integrated water resource management
    and sustainable agricultural development. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

  key_findings:
  - The annual average Pe, ETc, IWR, and M increased by 1.56%/a, 0.74%/a, 0.42%/a,
    and 0.83%/a in the NEC, respectively.
  - Crop-specifically, the annual average Pe increased by 1.15%/a, 2.04%/a, and 2.09%/a,
    ETc decreased by 0.46%/a, 0.79%/a, and 0.89%/a, IWR decreased by 1.03%/a, 1.32%/a,
    and 3.42%/a, and M increased by 1.48%/a, 2.67%/a, and 2.87%/a for maize, rice,
    and soybean, respectively.
  - Although the ETc and IWR for all crops decreased, regional averages still increased
    due to the expansion of water-intensive maize and rice.
  - The crop type and climate changes jointly influenced agricultural water dynamics.

  main_objective: to map the spatiotemporal distribution of crop type-specific agricultural
    water dynamics in Northeast China from 2000 to 2020 and assess the impacts of
    crop type and climate changes on agricultural water dynamics
  relevance_evaluation:
    extract_1: Increasing temperature and solar radiation lead to increasing irrigation
      water requirement, while increasing precipitation resulted in decreasing irrigation
      water requirement in Northeast China.
    extract_2: Crop type transfer contributed 39.28% and 41.25% of the total irrigation
      water requirement increase from 2000 to 2010 and 2010 to 2020, respectively.

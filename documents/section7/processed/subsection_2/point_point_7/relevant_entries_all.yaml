    \ in the use of digital tools and smart\nsolutions, particularly in the realm\
    \ of building energy automation. While realising the potential\nbeneﬁts of smart\
    \ cities, a broader scope of smart initiatives is required to support the transition\
    \ from\nsmart buildings towards smart neighbourhoods, which are considered critical\
    \ urban development\nunits. To support the interplay of smart solutions between\
    \ buildings and neighbourhoods, this study\naimed to collect and review all the\
    \ smart solutions presented in existing scientiﬁc articles, the technical\nliterature,\
    \ and realised European projects. These solutions were classiﬁed into two main\
    \ sections,\nbuildings and neighbourhoods, which were investigated through ﬁve\
    \ domains: building-energy-\nrelated uses, renewable energy sources, water, waste,\
    \ and open space management. The quantitative\noutcomes demonstrated the potential\
    \ beneﬁts of implementing smart solutions in areas ranging\nfrom buildings to\
    \ neighbourhoods. Moreover, this research concluded that the true enhancement\
    \ of\nenergy conservation goes beyond the building’s energy components and can\
    \ be genuinely achieved\nby integrating intelligent neighbourhood elements owing\
    \ to their strong interdependencies. Future\nresearch should assess the effectiveness\
    \ of these solutions in resource conservation.\nKeywords: smart building; smart\
    \ energy grid; smart energy management; neighbourhood building\nstock; sustainable\
    \ development goals\n1. Introduction\nThe provision of sustainable energy has\
    \ become the main priority of developing\nand developed countries, particularly\
    \ European Union members, which are among the\ntop fossil-fuel-importing countries\
    \ in the world. According to a Statista report, Europe\nimported approximately\
    \ 13.5 million barrels of oil per day in 2021 [1]. Owing to the\nlarge amount\
    \ of carbon dioxide and other harmful environmental emissions it releases,\nthe\
    \ construction industry has earned a reputation as a serious contributor to global\
    \ cli-\nmate change. Furthermore, vintage buildings and inefﬁcient construction\
    \ materials in the\nhistoric neighbourhoods of European countries have spurred\
    \ a greater need for energy,\nmaking them major energy-intensive sectors [2].\
    \ These concerns have imposed pressure on\nEuropean governments and energy markets\
    \ to seek cost-effective solutions that strike a\nbalance between reducing energy\
    \ consumption and decarbonising construction activities.\nSubsequently, in recent\
    \ years, the construction industry has discovered that the applica-\ntion of digital\
    \ technologies and smart solutions is a promising approach to reduce the\nenvironmental\
    \ repercussions of buildings and improve the quality of life of residents [3].\n\
    The implementation of smart systems utilising information and communication tech-\n\
    nologies (ICT) can create excellent opportunities to deliver different building-\
    \ and urban-\nscale services through an integrated set of smart grids and address\
    \ the existing challenges\nhindering the achievement of the sustainable development\
    \ goals (SDGs) [4]. Technically,\nwhen smart and intelligent tools aim to meet\
    \ sustainability objectives, they can be inter-\npreted within the domain of smart\
    \ sustainability (also known as digital sustainability).\nEnergies 2023, 16, 5701.\

    Energies 2023, 16, 5701\n2 of 35\nTherefore, an inclusive program intended to\
    \ introduce the application of these tools must\ncover all the committed goals,\
    \ such as economic, environmental, social, and cultural norms\nand spiritual values\
    \ [5,6].\nGenerally, with the advancement of technology towards digitalisation\
    \ and smarter\ndevices, more daily activities are being affected by computer tools\
    \ and intelligent devices.\nThis evolution has caused a signiﬁcant shift towards\
    \ more automated and connected ways\nof living, and increased dependency between\
    \ humans and technologies [7]. Meanwhile,\ntechnologies such as smart grids, machine-learning\
    \ approaches, the Internet of Things\n(IoT), and artiﬁcial intelligence are clear\
    \ examples that have transformed daily routines\nand construction activities in\
    \ different socioeconomic and environmental contexts [8].\nThese emerging technologies\
    \ have added value to urban management by introducing\nnovel methods of responding\
    \ to urban needs (e.g., distributed energy generation from\nrenewable sources\
    \ and storage facilities that simplify the response to demand) [9]. With\nthese\
    \ technological advancements, every point and subject can be read and analysed\
    \ using\nsensors, cameras, and software, which is a signiﬁcant component of an\
    \ IoT network. It has\nbeen alleged [10] that by the year 2030, more than 50 billion\
    \ devices will be connected to\nthe IoT network, and approximately 52% of users\
    \ will use smart and digital systems to\nimprove their activities. Therefore,\
    \ connecting different nodes and elements of smart cities\nto the Internet is\
    \ an essential requirement that should be considered in every smart city [11].\n\
    Although the myriad beneﬁts of creating these data ﬂows have not yet been fully\
    \ realised,\nthey are widely regarded as the cornerstone of the transition towards\
    \ the true development\nof a smart and efﬁcient city [4]. In other words, digitalisation\
    \ and smart systems can provide\nmany beneﬁcial tools, and their utilisation should\
    \ be examined to ensure their alignment\nwith sustainable objectives and to avoid\
    \ their designation for frivolous purposes [12].\nIntegrating ICT technologies\
    \ with building and urban elements has introduced new\ninteractive features to\
    \ European energy markets, such as dynamic responses to residents’\nneeds and\
    \ the ﬂexible adjustment of system operations with respect to their internal and\n\
    external conditions [13]. Similarly, enabling buildings to intelligently optimise\
    \ their energy\nusage based on time-of-use electricity tariffs and residents’\
    \ energy demands has become\none of the leading perspectives in this sector [14,15].\
    \ For instance, Ref. [16] highlighted\nthe signiﬁcance of transitioning from conventional\
    \ building energy design to the deploy-\nment of smart heating, ventilation, and\
    \ air conditioning (HVAC) systems that manage\nenergy demand and generation according\
    \ to weather conditions, energy grid balance,\nand residents’ needs. This paradigm\
    \ shift in the building automation process requires a\ndetailed technical guide\
    \ to deﬁne and clarify the required smart readiness levels, thereby\nenabling\
    \ data transfer and management in an integrated building energy system. To this\n\
    end, the European Commission (EC) developed the Smart Readiness Indicator (SRI),\
    \ a\ncomprehensive descriptor in the Clean Energy for All Europeans package, to\
    \ deﬁne and\nsupport smart elements that can be deployed in smart buildings. The\
    \ SRI report presents a\nclassiﬁcation of building components that can be automated\
    \ at different levels to provide\nmore efﬁcient energy operations [17].\nHowever,\
    \ various research gaps in this context must be investigated. One of the\nmain\
    \ limitations of using the SRI is that there is no practical or enlightening example\n\
    to demonstrate the potential percentage of energy reductions that might be obtained\
    \ by\napplying the automation list. This lack of a numerical evaluation of the\
    \ energy performance\nof smartened buildings may cause discouraging confusion\
    \ among stakeholders who have\nno perspective on the ﬁnal performance of the project.\
    \ Moreover, alongside the building-\nscale initiatives outlined in the SRI, there\
    \ is a broad spectrum of smart solutions at higher\nscales that can support energy\
    \ conservation, the integration of renewable energy, and other\nlive elements\
    \ of the community, which must be considered. However, there is no technical\n\
    benchmark similar to the SRI that supports these smart initiatives at the community\
    \ level\nin a practical manner.\nEnergies 2023, 16, 5701\n3 of 35\nTo bridge these\
    \ research gaps, with a speciﬁc reference to projects at the neighbourhood\nscale,\
    \ which is considered the most important and practical scale of urban development\
    \ [18],\nthis research investigates diverse smart solutions and innovative technologies\
    \ that can\nsupport the attainment of global sustainable programmes (i.e., the\
    \ SDGs) and energy\noptimisation, both at the building and neighbourhood scales.\
    \ One of the novelties and\ncontributions of this study is the deﬁnition of a\
    \ clear boundary to conﬁne the domains\nand elements that can be smartened across\
    \ the neighbourhood building stock. Moreover,\npresenting the potential achievements\
    \ obtained through these smart solutions stimulates\nthe integration of all the\
    \ elements through the use of ICT. Clarifying the actual deﬁnition of\nsmart solutions\
    \ allows us to distinguish them from common sustainability measurements\nthat\
    \ have been widely carried out in this context. To this end, a literature review\
    \ was\nconducted to collect, from scientiﬁc papers, the technical literature,\
    \ and European projects,\nall the smart solutions that could be applied at the\
    \ neighbourhood scale. The structure of\nthis paper is as follows: The methodology\
    \ of this research is explained in Section 2. Section 3\nexplores the multifaceted\
    \ aspects of utilising the collected smart solutions in six community-\nscale\
    \ domains, further classiﬁed into different smart solutions. Finally, Section\
    \ 4 concludes\nand summarises the overview and perspectives obtained from this\
    \ research.\n2. Methodology\nThere are numerous types of literature reviews, including\
    \ systematic, cumulative,\ndevelopmental, and narrative [19]. The ﬁrst type is\
    \ used when theoretical objectives and\nboundaries can be established in advance\
    \ to eliminate bias and obtain a more reliable set\nof ﬁndings. Cumulative reviews\
    \ aim to summarise the ﬁndings of papers that focus on\nspeciﬁc topics, and they\
    \ often help identify research gaps in the literature. Developmental\nreviews\
    \ track the evolutionary trend of a particular issue. Finally, a narrative literature\n\
    review provides an overview of studies conducted on a particular topic without\
    \ strict\nrestrictions on the inclusion or exclusion of articles [20].\nThe methodology\
    \ used in this study was based on a combination of narrative and sys-\ntematic\
    \ literature reviews. As the main objective of this research is to present an\
    \ elaboration\nof the use of smart solutions that can be applied across the neighbourhood\
    \ building stock,\nit begins by searching scientiﬁc articles, the technical literature,\
    \ and EU projects to ﬁnd\nexisting smart solutions, which are almost always accompanied\
    \ by the deployment of novel\ntechnologies. In this study, the deﬁnition of a\
    \ smart solution is based on the concept of a\nsmart system. To perform smart\
    \ actions, a smart system incorporates sensing, actuation,\nand control functions\
    \ based on data collected from internal and external sources. As there is\nno\
    \ scientiﬁc benchmark to conﬁdently determine smart solutions that can be implemented\n\
    in a neighbourhood, a narrative literature review was conducted to initially encompass\
    \ all\ndisciplines, the management of which can be bounded in this context.\n\
    In the following step, all the smart solutions that can be implemented at the\
    \ building\nand neighbourhood scales are separated and thematically classiﬁed\
    \ into ﬁve domains,\nnamely, building-energy-related uses, renewable energy sources\
    \ (RESs), water, waste, and\nopen space management, which are widely discussed\
    \ in many sustainability protocols. The\ncollection of smart solutions in the\
    \ search process is based on the answer to the following\nthree research questions\
    \ (RQs) respecting the sustainability performance of each domain:\n(i) Which smart\
    \ solutions can improve each domain? (ii) How can smart solutions improve\neach\
    \ domain? (iii) To what extent can these smart solutions improve each domain?\n\
    In the following steps, certain ﬁltrations are adapted to exclude smart solutions\
    \ that\nare beyond the scope of this study. For instance, although many sustainability\
    \ protocols\ndeal with improving the economic or mobility elements of a neighbourhood,\
    \ these issues\ncannot be incorporated in this context. In addition, there are\
    \ many neighbourhood planning\nand regeneration initiatives that may enhance the\
    \ quality of the neighbourhood’s elements\nEnergies 2023, 16, 5701\n4 of 35\n\
    (e.g., proximity of facilities and bus stations). However, based on the above-mentioned\n\
    deﬁnition of smartness, they cannot be considered smart and should be excluded.\
    \ Figure 1\nschematically illustrates the methodology used in this study.\nEnergies\
    \ 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n4 of 35 \n \ncannot be incorporated in this context.\
    \ In addition, there are many neighbourhood plan-\nning and regeneration initiatives\
    \ that may enhance the quality of the neighbourhood’s \nelements (e.g., proximity\
    \ of facilities and bus stations). However, based on the above-men-\ntioned definition\
    \ of smartness, they cannot be considered smart and should be excluded. \nFigure\
    \ 1 schematically illustrates the methodology used in this study. \n \nFigure\
    \ 1. Schematic steps for the inclusion and exclusion of smart solutions. \nIt\
    \ should be clarified that the smart solutions collected in this research aimed\
    \ to de-\nlivering a series of smart services that not only enhance human intervention\
    \ to make \nsmarter decisions but also improve energy conservation (e.g., smart\
    \ parking systems that \nsteer drivers towards empty slots and reduce the time\
    \ of use of cars, a smart irrigation \nsystem that controls sprinkler operation\
    \ based on plant needs and reduces energy con-\nsumption related to water use).\
    \ \nFinally, smart solutions are organised in thematic order to highlight the\
    \ constituent \nelements of each domain, which are also emphasised in different\
    \ references. Although the \navailability and advancement of existing smart solutions\
    \ have not been consistently ad-\ndressed within different domains, a comprehensive\
    \ review of the collected documents \ndemonstrates a relative consensus among\
    \ researchers and urban developers regarding the \nimportance of certain classifications.\
    \ Moreover, the description given for each smart solu-\ntion may cover either\
    \ digital ICT technologies (e.g., optimisation algorithms in design, \ncommunication\
    \ protocols, and mobile applications), physical devices (e.g., sensors and \n\
    digital screens), or the integration thereof (e.g., smart thermostats). The description\
    \ also \nincludes some examples of the implementation of smart solutions, presented\
    \ in tables, to \ncompare their potential benefits with their corresponding base-run\
    \ scenarios, which are \nalmost all non-smart approaches. \n3. Results and Discussion\
    \ \nThis section presents smart solutions that have been applied in building and\
    \ neigh-\nbourhood contexts to boost energy conservation in a smart manner. The\
    \ findings collected \nfrom the literature review are organised into two main\
    \ sections, building-energy-related \nuses and neighbourhood scales, which are\
    \ further classified into different domains and \nsmart solutions. As shown in\
    \ Figure 2, each domain is investigated using one or more \nsmart solutions. \n\
    Figure 1. Schematic steps for the inclusion and exclusion of smart solutions.\n\
    It should be clariﬁed that the smart solutions collected in this research aimed\
    \ to deliv-\nering a series of smart services that not only enhance human intervention\

    \ Uses\nWith the rapid growth in the urban population, it is estimated that energy\
    \ consump-\ntion in the building sector will increase by approximately 65% by\
    \ 2050. A study [21]\ndemonstrated that approximately 50% of the total energy\

    \ [22] also claimed that the average energy\nconsumption of residential buildings\
    \ for heating, domestic hot water (DHW), cooling,\nand lighting was 27.3%, 13.1%,\
    \ 11.8%, and 7.2%, respectively. The lack of reliability in\nconventional energy\
    \ management plans and the manual collection of data related to energy\nconsumption\
    \ are among the critical obstacles to upgrading building energy systems. In\n\
    addition to the residents’ misbehaviour in the use of energy systems, the low\
    \ thermal\nperformance and poor quality of building envelopes have often brought\
    \ about overheating\nrisks or caused high energy consumption due to overcooling.\
    \ From another perspective,\nother possible factors, such as the installation\
    \ of faulty elements, inappropriate adjustment\nof energy systems, and poor maintenance\
    \ of equipment, may also lead to a large amount of\nenergy wastage from buildings\
    \ [23]. In this regard, different control systems and strategies\nhave been proposed\
    \ to mitigate the operating time, energy consumption, and costs across\nall elements.\n\
    3.1.1. Smart HVAC System\nThe ultimate goal of smart HVAC systems is to maintain\
    \ a comfortable indoor envi-\nronment in terms of temperature and air quality\
    \ with minimal energy consumption [24].\nPreviously, the utilities used to create\
    \ comfortable indoor environments were limited to\nEnergies 2023, 16, 5701\n6\
    \ of 35\nheating and cooling functions. Indeed, the incorporation of the thermostat\
    \ and control\nsystem allowed for HVAC systems to operate more efﬁciently. Since\
    \ then, the introduction\nof communication technologies to the heating and cooling\
    \ equipment circuit boards has\nenabled them to operate more intelligently. In\
    \ this case, instead of relying on manual control\nor rigid settings for heating\
    \ and cooling operations, which often lead to overheating or\novercooling in indoor\
    \ spaces, smart HVAC systems can intelligently adjust their operation\nbased on\
    \ data collected from the surrounding environment, such as indoor temperature,\n\
    outdoor temperature, and number of occupants [25].\nIn particular, for smart ventilation\
    \ systems, the concept of demand-controlled ventila-\ntion (DCV) was introduced\
    \ to specify the response to the temporal or spatial ventilation\nneeds [26].\
    \ DCV strategies can be classiﬁed based on the types of sensors, control al-\n\
    gorithms, and building regulations [27]. Similarly, Ref. [28] proposed a classiﬁcation\
    \ of\ndifferent ventilation control strategies, including variables such as outdoor\
    \ temperature,\nzone occupancy, predicted or measured exposure to contaminants,\
    \ zonal control (single or\nmultiple zones), dynamic or ﬁxed direction, and rate\
    \ of airﬂow (exhaust, supply, balance).\nFor instance, Ref. [29] developed a control\
    \ system to monitor local occupancy, grid signals,\nand outdoor temperature. This\
    \ smart ventilation system, designed for residential buildings\nin California,\
    \ achieved a 20% energy reduction and delivered demand response beneﬁts. A\ncomparison\
    \ of different types of DCV strategies, which include occupancy and contaminant\n\
    trackers [30], shows that smart ventilation scenarios developed based on zonal\
    \ control\nand unzoned control (i.e., supplying the entire dwelling) can reduce\
    \ energy consumption\nby approximately 20% and 7%, respectively. The authors of\
    \ [31] developed an outdoor-\ntemperature-based smart ventilation control strategy\
    \ to maintain the equivalent indoor air\nquality, aligned with ASHRAE 62.2-2013;\
    \ the implementation of this DCV on a two-story\nresidential building delivered\
    \ an up to 6% reduction in annual energy use. The authors\nof [32] developed smart\
    \ ventilation strategies for humidity control, and applied them\nto near-zero-energy\
    \ buildings. This study, which evaluated ten smart control strategies\nacross\
    \ six types of climatic conditions, revealed that smart control systems could\
    \ reduce the\nfraction of annual hours of relative humidity (RH) from above to\
    \ below 60% (in the worst\nclimatic conditions, it was approximately 16%). The\
    \ authors of [33] developed different\nsmart ventilation strategies based on occupancy\
    \ detection and auxiliary fans, demonstrat-\ning that the energy savings obtained\
    \ from occupancy control were not signiﬁcant owing to\nthe intensiﬁed recovery\
    \ period required when residents returned home (i.e., up to double\nthe rate of\
    \ airﬂow). Concerning the intensiﬁed operation of the ventilation system after\
    \ re-\noccupancy, Ref. [34] stated that the energy performance of the occupancy-based\
    \ ventilation\ncontrol could be improved if the control strategy automatically\
    \ turned on the ventilation\nsystem at a normal level before the residents’ arrival\
    \ time.\nAlthough the results obtained from these strategies can vary between\
    \ different climatic\nconditions [35], smart ventilation systems often provide\
    \ signiﬁcant energy savings in all\nsituations, except for climates with fewer\
    \ seasonal temperature variations.\nIn light of this trend, based on the speciﬁc\
    \ goal of the control system, the following\nparameters can be obtained from sensors\
    \ installed indoors and outdoors and signals in en-\nergy grids: (i) occupancy,\
    \ (ii) air quality conditions (e.g., parameters such as humidity and\ntemperature),\
    \ (iii) electricity grid status, (iv) contaminants, and (v) the operation of HVAC\n\
    systems (e.g., fans, ﬂow rates, and velocity) [35]. Figure 3 shows an example\
    \ of the general\ncomponents of the smart HVAC system. To model smart ventilation\
    \ systems, the recom-\nmended values and ranges of the following contextual parameters\
    \ were obtained based on\nthe daily events and activities of households and extracted\
    \ from the cited standards and\nguidelines: occupancy, CO2 [36], moisture [37],\

    \ in Buildings\nThe ultimate goal of smartening water systems in buildings is\
    \ to measure water ﬂow\ncharacteristics and optimise them based on user needs\
    \ and behaviour. Generally, water\nconsumption can be curbed at a large scale\
    \ (i.e., infrastructural actions and regulations)\nEnergies 2023, 16, 5701\n8\
    \ of 35\nand individual conservation scale (i.e., building and community efforts).\
    \ At the building\nscale, this can be achieved through the use of advanced meters\
    \ based on ultrasonic or elec-\ntromagnetic readings that provide more accurate\
    \ data (e.g., potential leakages and amount\nof water consumption) than conventional\
    \ meters [48,49]. The authors of [50,51] underlined\nthree initiatives that can\
    \ be achieved by deploying smart water meters: (i) increasing the\ncommunity awareness\
    \ of water value, (ii) billing and alternative pricing schemes, and\n(iii) forecasting\
    \ water consumption, which results in water and energy preservation. The\nauthors\
    \ of [52] suggested the use of an in-home display (IHD) to provide real-time feedback\n\
    to users, resulting in a 16% reduction in water consumption. The authors of [53]\
    \ also used\nIHDs to notify users when consumption exceeded predeﬁned limitations\
    \ and consequently\nled to a 23% reduction in water use.\nIn addition to precise\
    \ measurements, smart water systems designed for buildings\nincorporate intelligent\
    \ control systems that automatically adjust the desired temperature\nand volume\
    \ of water based on consumption patterns, ensuring that water is used appro-\n\
    priately while minimising energy consumption. By dynamically adapting these to\
    \ user\nrequirements, these systems can optimise water usage without compromising\
    \ comfort or\nconvenience [54]. Indeed, in addition to the adaptation of well-established\
    \ measures, such\nas the insulation of pipelines, careful planning of draw-off\
    \ points, and use of renewable en-\nergies, there are smart solutions to improve\
    \ the energy efﬁciency of DHW systems [55–57].\nThe authors of [58] reported that,\
    \ among the types of energy consumed in the European\nbuilding stock, the energy\
    \ required for heating and DHW accounted for 64% and 15% of\nthe total energy,\
    \ respectively. According to this study, resident behaviour and lifestyle have\n\
    a more signiﬁcant impact on energy consumption than the type of heat source. To\
    \ address\nthis issue, Ref. [55] proposed the application of submeters, also known\
    \ as the individual\nmetering and charging (IMC) of hot water, as a potential\
    \ solution in a multifamily case\nstudy in Poland, and achieved a 20% reduction\
    \ in the use of DHW. To measure the amount\nof water accurately, it is necessary\
    \ to install different sensors and auxiliary devices to\ncollect and transfer\
    \ data with high accuracy in a short time, particularly when RESs are\nused to\
    \ supply the heating required for DHW [55]. An example of a smart solution in\
    \ this\nﬁeld is presented in [59], which measured the impact of the data collection\
    \ interval on\nenergy consumption and found that by reducing the interval from\
    \ 1 min to 6 s, the energy\nrequired for peak demand could be reduced by 40%.\
    \ DHW meters typically quantify\nand demonstrate the total household consumption\
    \ that is suitable for calculating bills.\nUsing individual smart sub-meters provides\
    \ the possibility of transmitting interpretable\nreal-time information to residents,\
    \ which can signiﬁcantly reduce their consumption [60,61].\nAccording to [55],\
    \ the most critical value that can be obtained by a DHW smart meter is the\ncaloriﬁc\
    \ value required for supplying hot water, which requires typical equipment such\n\
    as temperature sensors, ﬂow meters, computing cores, and communication sectors.\
    \ This\nstudy also introduced other important data that can be collected from\
    \ servers, such as\nwater temperature and time synchronisation, which can be analysed\
    \ to deliver valuable\ninformation such as endpoints, discarded energy, ﬂow, accumulated,\
    \ and instantaneous en-\nergy. Moreover, Refs. [50,51] underlined three initiatives\
    \ that can be achieved by deploying\nsmart water meters: (i) increasing community\
    \ awareness of water value, (ii) billing and\nalternative pricing schemes, and\
    \ (iii) forecasting water consumption. Smart water metering\ncan pave the way\
    \ towards more ﬂexible water pricing methods and resource management.\nThe authors\
    \ of [62] claimed that the remote control of boilers equipped with smart\nsensors\
    \ helps determine consumption patterns in advance (i.e., the desired temperature,\n\
    required volume of water, and time of use), which results in water and energy\
    \ savings.\nAccording to [63], which highlighted the 50% heat loss in conventional\
    \ DHW systems\nwith storage tanks, an efﬁcient effort has been the 4th-generation\
    \ district heating, which\ncirculates hot water at lower temperatures and subsequently\
    \ lowers energy use. However,\none of the main challenges of low-temperature district\
    \ heating (LTDH) is the increased\nrisk of Legionella growth [64]. To solve this\
    \ problem, Ref. [65] suggested using dual-\nfunctional residential thermal stations\
    \ (RTS), in which standby loss is eliminated and the\nEnergies 2023, 16, 5701\n\
    9 of 35\nenergy provided for the heating system is also used for DHW. In these\
    \ systems, the control\nmethods of electric tracing can signiﬁcantly affect the\
    \ ﬁnal performance of the system.\nTable 2 presents several examples of the application\
    \ of novel ideas and smart solutions\nto smarten and enhance the water management\

    \ through this approach.\nTable 2. Examples of smart solutions in water management\

    \ Systems\nThe ultimate goal of smart lighting systems is to provide comfortable\
    \ and healthy\nlights based on the speciﬁc the environment and occupant demands.\
    \ A smart lighting\nsystem (SLS) may comprise different elements, namely, efﬁcient\
    \ light sources (i.e., light\nemitting diodes (LEDs)), as a prerequisite, a smart\
    \ control system that may include a\nwireless communication network, software\
    \ and sensors, and a remote control system that\nrealises speciﬁc innovative actions\
    \ [75]. In light of this trend, Refs. [76,77] concluded that\napplying an SLS\
    \ in ofﬁce buildings could save up to 95% of energy, depending on the\nactivity\
    \ patterns and type of control system. For example, a control system equipped\n\
    with the occupancy detection sensors adopted in [78] saved up to 60% of energy.\
    \ Having\nhighlighted the impact of building and window characteristics (e.g.,\
    \ direction and latitude)\non the efﬁciency of SLSs, Ref. [79] adopted a daylight-integrated\
    \ lighting control system\n(i.e., enabling lamps to dim or completely turn off\
    \ after detecting an adequate amount\nof natural light) to save up to 47% of energy\
    \ compared with conventional systems. They\ncalculated energy savings of 35% and\
    \ 20% through the separate use of occupancy detection\nand daylight-harvesting\
    \ sensors, respectively. The authors of [80] analysed the application\nof a time-based\
    \ lighting control system, which depends on the clarity of commuting\npatterns,\
    \ to save from 10% to 40% of energy in ofﬁce buildings. Although most projects\n\
    on SLS have focused on issues related to energy conservation, recently, the examination\
    \ of\nresidents’ well-being has become more signiﬁcant, and the improvement of\
    \ features such\nas the aesthetic aspects of the environment, visual comfort,\
    \ and light effects beyond vision\nis actively discussed [81,82]. Table 3 presents\
    \ the energy efﬁciency and cost reductions\nachieved by SLS deployment.\nTable\

    \ smart building openings is to adjust solar radiation by trans-\nmitting, reﬂecting,\
    \ and absorbing sunlight through windows. The building can conserve\nenergy and\
    \ maintain a comfortable environment [85] using movable shading devices or\nby\
    \ adopting dimmable glass (also known as smart glass or switchable glass). Although\n\
    many sustainable design solutions can be applied to design and form a façade that\
    \ is able\nto improve the energy performance of buildings (e.g., double-layer\
    \ air corridors, external\nand internal insulation layers, windows with low U-values)\
    \ [86], a building envelope can\nonly be considered intelligent and smart when\
    \ it can automatically adapt itself to weather\nEnergies 2023, 16, 5701\n11 of\
    \ 35\nconditions, occupant behaviour and needs, and conﬂicts [87]. Because it\
    \ is not possible to\npredict 100% of the environmental and climate conditions,\
    \ an intelligent envelope system\nmust be able to manage the strategy required\
    \ to deal with these variables [87]. The control\nsystem used for intelligentisation\
    \ of the envelope should be designed for self-powered\nsensing, control, and actuation.\
    \ According to EU Commission projects, smart windows can\nalso provide better\
    \ natural ventilation [88]. To this end, the volume of air that leaves and\nenters\
    \ a room must be managed to mitigate the need for mechanical ventilation. From\
    \ an\narchitectural perspective, an additional smart solution involves the application\
    \ of AI tech-\nnologies to strike a balance between a comfortable environment\
    \ and energy efﬁciency by\nconsidering the building orientation and opening dimensions\
    \ for optimal lighting, heating,\ncooling, and ventilation [89].\nAlong with this\
    \ trend, Ref. [90] proposed two new models of smart windows, ther-\nmochromic\
    \ and electrochromic windows, utilising crystal droplets and suspended particles\n\
    to change glass transparency. The authors of [91] designed a solar smart window\
    \ system in\nwhich ﬂexible photovoltaic cells were installed on one side of the\
    \ blind and cooling coats\non the other side, which led to a 4–9% reduction in\
    \ temperature during passive cooling\nperformance. Examples of smart windows are\
    \ listed in Table 4.\nTable 4. Examples of the use of novel and smart implementations\

    \ Management Systems\nThe ultimate goal of smart electricity management in a building\
    \ is to automatically\nmanage the time and mode of operation of electric devices,\
    \ aiming to shift loads and\nreduce electric bills. Although there are several\
    \ systems that allow for residents to remotely\ncontrol electric devices through\
    \ installed actuators (e.g., switching washing machines or\novens on/off through\
    \ mobile phones), they are merely intended to enhance residents’\ncomfort and\
    \ are different from interfaces that provide an intelligent reduction in energy\n\
    consumption [93]. In November 2016, the European Commission updated the application\n\
    of smart technologies in the Energy Performance of Building Directive (EPBD),\
    \ which\nwas ﬁrst introduced in 2002 to optimise energy use in buildings [94,95].\
    \ A corollary of\nthis update reveals the potential beneﬁts of smart buildings\
    \ in creating an intelligent\nenvironment integrated with home automation to enhance\
    \ comfort, safety, and energy\nefﬁciency [96]. A signiﬁcant capability in this\
    \ area is the collection of data from devices\nand their processing using heterogeneous\
    \ and dynamic sources. An advanced IoT-based\nsystem can consider variables such\
    \ as building data, current and the predicted amounts of\navailable renewable\
    \ energy (in the case of a smart grid), energy prices, weather data, and\nend-user\
    \ behaviour to optimise the time and mode of electrical device operation [47].\
    \ These\noptimisations can be designed using a set of rules that are incorporated\
    \ into intelligent\nelectricity management [97].\nSimilarly, Ref. [98] showed\
    \ that demand-side load management, which refers to the\nshift in residents’ consumption\
    \ towards the period of off-peak demand, can effectively\nimprove the overall\
    \ energy efﬁciency. The authors of [99] developed an electricity manage-\nEnergies\
    \ 2023, 16, 5701\n12 of 35\nment tool that provides a personalised plan with awareness\
    \ services that lead to behavioural\nchanges in users. Several tools are available\
    \ to support end-user energy management. For\ninstance, Siemens Synco is designed\
    \ for mixed-use small to medium-sized buildings, in\nwhich the control system\
    \ manages energy plants by monitoring and adjusting HVAC\nelectrical equipment\
    \ [100]. Honeywell Attune Advisory Services is another monitoring and\noptimisation\
    \ tool supported by Software as a Service (SaaS) and cloud-based technologies,\n\
    which help facilities determine the best way to save resources [101]. These tools\
    \ are helpful\nfor energy service companies, specialists, and facility managers\
    \ willing to use the collected\ndata and processed information to make decisions\
    \ and set rules [102]. Some well-known\ntools and companies working in this ﬁeld\
    \ are as follows: Loop Energy Saver and Origami\nEnergy in the United Kingdom\
    \ [102,103]; NUUKA and OPTWATTI in Finland [104,105];\nBidgely, Enetics, and PlotWatt\
    \ in the USA [106–108]; Plugwise in the Netherlands [109];\nand SMARAKIA in Spain\
    \ [110]. Indeed, these tools utilise IoT-based systems to collect\nand analyse\
    \ input data and provide monitoring and controlling services, such as data\nvisualisation\
    \ and notiﬁcation, that assist users in identifying potential ways to reduce\n\
    electricity consumption [47].\nAnother important function that has shown great\
    \ potential for being smart is the\nuse of metering methods and reporting systems.\
    \ Because smart meters, such as gas and\nelectricity meters, are often installed\
    \ in out-of-sight places, installing an IHD, a small\nmonitor displaying valuable\
    \ and understandable information from smart meters, has been\nrecommended [111].\
    \ The authors of [112] alleged that a control system that manages smart\nmeters\
    \ can analyse and provide valuable information as a virtual assistant for residents,\n\
    showing defective consumption patterns and discovering energy guzzlers in their\
    \ homes.\nThe authors of [113,114] helped improve users’ insight into their lifestyle\
    \ by listening to\nthe unique energy signature of homes and subsequently proposing\
    \ a different series of\nrecommendations, enabling remote control, and automatically\
    \ turning off electricity. The\nauthors of [115] showed that offering feedback\
    \ about consumption patterns to consumers\ncan reduce their consumption by approximately\
    \ 5–15% compared to the baseline. In\naddition, approximately 64% of the people\
    \ with smart meters in their homes think twice\nabout the energy consumption of\
    \ their devices. Table 5 presents the outcomes that speciﬁc\nsmart solutions can\
    \ obtain from a system.\nTable 5. Examples of smart technologies in smart electricity\

    \ goal of smartened maintenance and commissioning is to enhance the\nefﬁciency\
    \ of the maintenance and monitoring processes of building services by carrying\n\
    them out at the right time and in the most cost-effective manner [123]. In light\
    \ of the\ntechnological evolution in different sectors of the building industry,\
    \ it is vital to progress\nthrough the concept of utility services and commissioning\
    \ to realise the smart maintenance\nconcept. To this end, integrating two well-known\
    \ terms, lean and smart maintenance, has\nled to the formation of a dynamic, intelligent,\
    \ and value-added management model that\nembraces all building components [124].\
    \ The highest step in the maintenance hierarchy\nis smart maintenance and commissioning,\
    \ which goes beyond the ﬁxed commissioning\nplan by embracing the measurements\
    \ conducted using diagnostic tools integrated into\nthe control system [124].\
    \ Indeed, apart from the specialist contractors, an integrated\nnetwork of IoT\
    \ devices that are actively patched to the ﬁrmware is needed to provide\nand transfer\
    \ updates on the operation status of systems within a reasonable timescale to\n\
    keep the network secure [125]. Therefore, smart maintenance can provide services\
    \ based\non intelligent systems operated by technologies embedded in various urban\
    \ or buildings\nelements [126]. To develop a smart management plan, it is necessary\
    \ to consider the\nfollowing aspects:\n-\nData management: Using data generated\
    \ by cyber-physical systems for predic-\ntive maintenance.\n-\nKnowledge management:\n\
    Externalisation of existing technical knowledge to\nnew labourers.\n-\nLearning\
    \ orientation: integration of fundamental steps into the maintenance cycle.\n\
    -\nWeak-point elimination: Big data analytics and IT systems are used to eliminate\n\
    weak points.\n-\nEmployee qualiﬁcations: Precise qualiﬁcation of specialists working\
    \ in mainte-\nnance sections.\n-\nOptimisation of maintenance strategy: Optimal\
    \ decisions between reactive, preventive,\npredictive, and proactive measurements.\n\
    As it is still difﬁcult to explore the beneﬁts of recent smart maintenance and\
    \ commis-\nsioning programs, no quantitative elaborations have been found.\n3.2.\
    \ Smart Solutions Shared within a Neighbourhood\n3.2.1. Smart Solutions to Improve\
    \ Energy Provision\nThe high energy demand and environmental repercussions of\
    \ fossil fuel depletion\nhave stimulated the development of renewable energy technologies\
    \ for many years. De-\npending on environmental and contextual features, available\
    \ technologies, and urban\nEnergies 2023, 16, 5701\n14 of 35\nmanagement systems,\
    \ the community may decide to deploy a speciﬁc type of RES (i.e.,\nsolar, geothermal,\
    \ wind, biomass, and even hydraulic energy) to generate energy [127,128].\nHowever,\
    \ uncertainty in the efﬁciency of the energy generation process makes it difﬁcult\n\
    to calculate the return on investment (RoI), which discourages investment in this\
    \ area.\nAnother challenge in this ﬁeld is the low capacity (i.e., the realised\
    \ output to the max-\nimum possible output) of renewable power plants. Because\
    \ of the intermittent nature\nof renewable sources (e.g., lack of strong winds\
    \ and cloudy weather), which means that\nthese energy resources are not always\
    \ available, the capacity factor is often lower than\nthat of fossil-fuel-based\
    \ plants [129]. This periodic availability of all RESs exacerbates\nthe mismatch\
    \ between supplied energy and demand, which can make blackouts and low\nvoltages\
    \ regular occurrences [130,131]. However, enlarging plants and designing them\n\
    based on peak demand can impose additional ﬁnancial pressure. In this regard,\
    \ deciding\nbetween underproduction and overproduction in plants has remained\
    \ a major issue for\nseveral years [127]. Nevertheless, smart solutions exist,\
    \ and innovative ideas can resolve\nthese obstacles.\nSmart Renewable Energy Grid\n\
    The ultimate goal of smartening a renewable energy grid is to secure the energy\
    \ supply\nand improve widespread access to energy without a dependency on fossil\
    \ fuels. The smart\nmanagement of renewable power plants relies on the integration\
    \ of all components in\nenergy generation systems with smart infrastructure, considering\
    \ different objectives (e.g.,\nenergy efﬁciency improvements and emission control)\
    \ in real time. As energy management\nin a smart energy network can be automated\
    \ by a technical control centre that allows\nfor immediate real-time data transmission\
    \ and analysis, Refs. [132,133] highlighted the\nsigniﬁcance of identifying and\
    \ executing corrective actions to diagnose and prevent er-\nrors in time. Although\
    \ existing renewable energy grid systems may already cover some\nsmart functionalities,\
    \ such as balancing supply and demand, Ref. [134] demonstrated\nthat achieving\
    \ a real smart grid system requires the incorporation of ICT into all aspects\n\
    of electricity supply, delivery, and consumption. In this regard, Ref. [135] classiﬁed\
    \ the\napplication of ICT in the development of renewable energy plants into two\
    \ imperative\ndisciplines: optimal power ﬂow (OPF) and conﬁguration strategies\
    \ (CSs); CSs deal with the\nplacement of RESs or generators in the power distribution\
    \ system, whereas OPF refers to\nload ﬂow problems and operating conditions. Owing\
    \ to the uncertain availability of RESs,\ndifferent ICT technologies and forecasting\
    \ algorithms have been employed to boost CSs\nand OPF [136]. The authors of [137]\
    \ claimed that incorporating a multitude of RESs into a\nmicrogrid has potential\
    \ beneﬁts, such as a greater effectiveness of the local implementation\nof computational\
    \ intelligent models, facilitating conﬁguration and fault control, eliminating\n\
    deep charge problems, and increasing the quality and reliability of power. The\
    \ authors\nof [134] demonstrated that, depending on the types of renewable energy\
    \ and geographical\ndemand proﬁles, the highest ratio of renewable energy supply\
    \ to the peak load (deﬁned\nas the renewable penetration level) in an electricity\
    \ system can be classiﬁed into three\nlevels. The lowest level can be implemented\
    \ without smart technology, with a capacity\npenetration of less than 15%. The\
    \ medium penetration level of renewables is between 15%\nand 30%, which necessitates\
    \ the consideration of smart components throughout the grid.\nThe authors of [138]\
    \ also alleged that incorporating digital tools and innovative designs\nwithin\
    \ a renewable smart grid could secure a capacity penetration higher than 30%.\n\
    Moreover, given the high potential for intelligentisation in energy storage, this\
    \ has\nbecome a theme that has stimulated active discussions. The authors of [127]\
    \ stated that\nenergy storage is a logical solution for saving energy in a system,\
    \ making variable renewable\nenergy systems more desirable and feasible in existing\
    \ electrical grid systems among\ncommunities. Although electricity can be stored\
    \ in different storage media, such as batteries,\nfuel cells [139], ﬂywheels [140,141],\
    \ and compressed air energy storage (CAES) [140,142],\nonly batteries and fuel\
    \ cells are appropriate for neighbourhood-scale projects owing to\ncharacteristics\
    \ such as their charge/discharge time and energy density. Although all these\n\
    Energies 2023, 16, 5701\n15 of 35\nsystems are equipped with sophisticated pieces\
    \ of technology, without smart self-control\nover their performance, they are\
    \ dumb machines that can only store and discharge energy.\nA smart energy storage\
    \ system can be deﬁned based on the following features:\n-\nSelf-optimisation\
    \ and justiﬁcation of charging and discharging processes based on\nelectricity\
    \ prices.\n-\nControl of the time and energy source to achieve a longer cycle\
    \ life.\n-\nCoordination of operations with other storage systems, power plant\
    \ capacity, and\nload demands.\n-\nPrediction and prevention of failures and unusual\
    \ catastrophes that may degrade the\nbattery performance (e.g., thermal runaway\
    \ and energy imbalance among cells in a\nbattery pack).\nEnergy storage can beneﬁt\
    \ from smart solutions that use precise and well-structured\ndata to empower AI\
    \ systems. Similarly, Ref. [143] clariﬁed that the automation and optimi-\nsation\
    \ of energy storage systems require sufﬁcient knowledge and real-time communication\n\
    regarding power plant production and consumer load demands. This crucial information\n\
    enables decentralised decision-making for regulating the microgrid components.\

    \ Distribution Networks\nAccording to World Bank data, the amount of non-recovery\
    \ water loss due to leakage\nand breakage in developing countries is approximately\
    \ 35–50% of water consumption [156]\nand related auxiliary energy (water treatment,\
    \ distribution, etc.) [157]. The intricate system\nof pipes with different proﬁles\
    \ buried in the ground is a major obstacle to better water\nmanagement. The long-term\
    \ exposure of cast iron pipes to moist soil may accelerate the\ncorrosion process\
    \ and reduce their expected useful life. However, a complete replacement\nof all\
    \ systems’ cast iron pipes, which are, in some cases, more than 120 years old,\
    \ would\nimpose a huge ﬁnancial pressure on municipalities; therefore, the inability\
    \ to diagnose the\nproblem or predict system deterioration requires expensive\
    \ crisis intervention. In addition\nto the ﬁnancial and physical barriers, the\
    \ global water crisis requires a practically efﬁcient\nmethod to address these\
    \ challenges [158].\nEnergies 2023, 16, 5701\n17 of 35\nSeveral smart solutions\
    \ have been proposed. Different advanced technologies can\nbe employed to collect\
    \ the required data and simulate the performance of water systems.\nAlthough retroﬁtting\
    \ activities are often managed at the district or city scale, some smart\nmeasurements\
    \ and technologies must be considered and applied at the neighbourhood\nscale.\
    \ In the following sections, smart solutions related to water delivery in neighbourhoods\n\
    are summarised.\nSmart Water Distribution Systems\nThe ultimate goal of smartening\
    \ a water distribution system is the continuous moni-\ntoring and control of the\
    \ water-supply network and its performance in carrying potable\nwater under effective\
    \ pressure. According to [128,159], a smart water distribution system\naddresses\
    \ two aspects: (i) smart leakage detection and (ii) smart water quality preservation.\n\
    Smart water distribution systems deploy high-tech equipment and systems to monitor\
    \ the\ndifferent characteristics of water ﬂow and abnormalities in distribution\
    \ network pipelines.\nTechnologies, such as sensors, integrated communication\
    \ modules, software, and open-\nsource platforms for cloud access, are required\
    \ [159]. From the perspective of pressure\nmanagement, which affects the related\
    \ energy consumption, sensors can also be utilised in\ndifferent methods to detect\
    \ abnormal water ﬂow, such as bursts and leakages. To this end,\nhydraulic-based\
    \ solutions and acoustic sensing have often been used to analyse variations\n\
    in the ﬂow and pressure of water at different nodes of the network. For instance,\
    \ Ref. [160]\nused wavelet analysis and cumulative sum (CUSUM) (a widely used\
    \ statistical control\nmethod) to identify potential burst events across pipelines\
    \ by revealing the accurate time\nof abnormalities in pressure and ﬂows. Because\
    \ of the high cost of installing sensors, the\nnumber of sensors in these models\
    \ must be optimised and allocated to strategic nodes in\nthe network [161]. Therefore,\
    \ the smart water grid refers to the smart design and placement\nof all physical\
    \ components of the system to realise the operational efﬁciency of smart water\n\
    management, as expected and foreseen with smart devices. Figure 5 presents a general\n\
    perspective of a smart water distribution system in a neighbourhood. Different\
    \ critical\ncomponents of the water distribution system (e.g., pumps, valves,\
    \ tanks, and end-use water\ntaps) can be monitored through a network of sensors,\
    \ each of which is connected to a\nmicrocontroller that can store and interpret\
    \ the data and send the information wirelessly to\ndesired points (e.g., users\
    \ or technician teams) [159,162].\nEnergies 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n17 of\

    \ the sensitivity of customers to \nwater loss) to optimise the maintenance models.\
    \ In summary, [69] listed the following i\nFigure 5. Example of smart solutions\

    \ grid:\n•\nReal-time monitoring of conditions across pipelines, which enables\
    \ technicians to\napply preventive maintenance at the right time.\n•\nReal-time\

    \ damage, water loss, and spread\nof pollution.\n•\nReal-time feedback on technical\
    \ measurement to calibrate pumps, and subordi-\nnate utilities.\nAccording to\
    \ [164], deploying a smart supply system in Lisbon reduced nonrecov-\nered water\
    \ losses by approximately 40%. In a comprehensive review article, Ref. [165]\n\
    investigated the application of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)\
    \ in water\ndistribution systems and revealed that deploying real-time alarms\
    \ and automatic operation\nplants could result in 30% energy savings and a 20%\
    \ decrease in water loss. In addition,\nRef. [69] leveraged joint time-frequency\
    \ analysis (JTFA) to analyse the pressure signals\ncollected throughout the sensors\
    \ for burst event identiﬁcation within the range of from 3 to\n71/s (the burst\
    \ event is often treated as a discrete occurrence; therefore, the higher the rate,\n\
    the more accurate the system). The authors of [166,167] highlighted the ﬁnancial\

    Smart Grey Water Reclamation Systems\nThe ultimate goal of green water reclamation\
    \ is to establish and secure reliable treat-\nment systems that can detect abnormal\
    \ materials in sewage ﬂows, potential risks, and errors.\nIn light of digitalisation\
    \ and smartness in grey water reclamation, Ref. [184] mentioned\nthe types of\
    \ components and volumes of sewage ﬂow in the short and long term, which\ncan\
    \ change because of the diverse steps required for the treatment process. Accordingly,\n\
    Refs. [185,186] highlighted the use of real-time control in the treatment process,\
    \ in which\nanomalies in the components of grey water can be immediately detected\
    \ and transferred\nto expert technicians or control systems to take further urgent\
    \ measures. To this end,\ndifferent intelligent technologies, such as big data,\
    \ sensors, IoT, and artiﬁcial intelligence\nmethods, may be used, focusing on\
    \ monitoring and controlling patterns, identifying and\ndiagnosing anomalous plant\
    \ behaviour and errors, and predicting wastewater inlet ﬂow\nand required workloads.\
    \ For example, sensors allow for the acquisition of physical and\nchemical parameters,\
    \ such as pH, nitrates, temperature, and ammonium. These parameters\ncan be collected\
    \ within speciﬁc short intervals (e.g., 1 min) in a cloud environment and\nprocessed\
    \ in a higher layer of modules [184].\nIn addition to using sensors and smart\
    \ control systems, some novel ICT-based meth-\nods are available. For instance,\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) technologies have been widely\nused to reduce the\
    \ energy and costs of these processes. The authors of [187] employed\nthe data\
    \ mining (DM) method to optimise the aeration process and reduce the required\n\
    energy by 31.4%. The authors of [188] also used the DM method to optimise the\
    \ activated\nsludge process (ASP), an aerobic biological process, by controlling\
    \ the dissolved oxygen\nin the wastewater, which resulted in a 15% reduction in\
    \ the required airﬂow. Using an\nexpert system (ES) method in an oxic reactor\
    \ (i.e., a treatment process with high biogas\nproduction and low energy consumption)\
    \ [189] can reduce total treatment costs and energy\nconsumption by 40%. The authors\
    \ of [190] also used advanced control in Flemish plants,\nwhich resulted in a\
    \ from 10% to 20% reduction in the energy needed for the aeration process\nand\
    \ a 30% reduction in chemical doses. Data collected from the wastewater ﬂow can\
    \ also\nbe used to calculate the optimal tank water level, which reduces the high\
    \ pressure behind\nthe pipes in the network and subsequently reduces leakage risks\
    \ [191].\n3.2.3. Smart Solutions for Waste Management\nRecycling and reusing materials\
    \ has been one of the main priorities of municipalities\nin recent decades, aiming\
    \ to achieve a circular economy [192,193]. However, limited\nknowledge of the\
    \ formal or informal sectors responsible for such activities and a lack\nof advanced\
    \ facilities and infrastructure to efﬁciently collect and sort waste are the two\n\
    main challenges that have caused inefﬁciencies in solid waste management, particularly\n\
    in developing countries [194]. Another critical issue is the open dumping and\
    \ burning of\norganic waste in low-income districts and cities, which can be used\
    \ as a source of waste-to-\nenergy or composting plants [4,195]. Using current\
    \ methodologies to control composting or\nsorting and recycling processes is a\
    \ time-consuming and high-energy task, which requires\nhighly skilled workers\
    \ [196].\nTo achieve such sustainability objectives, it is crucial to adopt intelligent\
    \ measures that\ncan effectively control waste management processes at either\
    \ the building or neighbourhood\nscale. Although the application of smart waste\
    \ management is a city-scale vision that\nrequires sufﬁciently advanced infrastructure\
    \ and components (e.g., smart waste collectors\nequipped with GPS and connected\
    \ to the sensors of smart bins), some elements should be\nhandled at the neighbourhood\
    \ scale. The following section presents two smart solutions\nthat can be used\
    \ in this ﬁeld.\nSmart Waste Bins\nThe ultimate goal of smartening waste bins\
    \ is to automate some of the initial steps\nin the waste management chain, such\
    \ as minimisation, collection, and separation, in an\nintelligent manner, which\
    \ culminates in energy and cost reductions. According to [197],\nEnergies 2023,\
    \ 16, 5701\n21 of 35\nthe potential for reducing the amount of unrecycled material\
    \ is between 30 and 130 kg/y\nper person. Hence, numerous digital tools have been\
    \ developed to support the gradual\ntransformation of the “design, use, disposal”\
    \ model to a circular model in which discarded\nwaste can be recycled and reused\
    \ [197]. For instance, smart bin deployment can make a\ndirect contribution to\
    \ waste minimisation by the digital tracking of waste, where residents\nwould\
    \ be charged based on the content and weight of their trash through the new sys-\n\
    tem of “pay-as-you-throw” (PAYT) [198,199]. This system sends feedback based on\
    \ the\nhistorical data of individuals and introduces different procedures to decrease\
    \ costs. Berlin\nintroduced the application of radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID)\
    \ to PAYT systems in\ncommunities [199]. The authors of [200,201] also highlighted\
    \ smart bins equipped with\nother types of technologies, such as sorting features\
    \ based on image recognition technology\n(e.g., using sensors to identify waste\
    \ content or the colour of plastics) and a conveyor belt\nthat separates waste.\
    \ The authors of [202] introduced a smart bin model in which a solar-\npowered\
    \ compacting lever was added to compress the volume of waste by approximately\n\
    700% and reduce the collection frequency by 85%. To realise these solutions, the\
    \ required\nsensors and devices must be mounted in smart bins. Figure 7 shows\
    \ a sample of a smart bin\nequipped with ﬁll-level sensors and solar-powered compactors.\
    \ In another step in smart\nwaste management that should be supported by a higher\
    \ administrative level of urban\nmanagement, data related to the districts’ waste\
    \ containers can be collected through cloud\ncomputing and, once processed, the\
    \ control system can navigate waste trucks towards full\ncontainers in an efﬁcient\
    \ route via a mobile application [203].\n \nthe waste management chain, such as\
    \ minimisation, collection, and separation, in an in-\ntelligent manner, which\
    \ culminates in energy and cost reductions. According to [197], the\npotential\
    \ for reducing the amount of unrecycled material is between 30 and 130 kg/y per\n\
    person. Hence, numerous digital tools have been developed to support the gradual\
    \ trans-\nformation of the “design, use, disposal” model to a circular model in\
    \ which discarded\nwaste can be recycled and reused [197]. For instance, smart\
    \ bin deployment can make a\ndirect contribution to waste minimisation by the\
    \ digital tracking of waste, where residents\nwould be charged based on the content\
    \ and weight of their trash through the new system\nof “pay-as-you-throw” (PAYT)\
    \ [198][199]. This system sends feedback based on the his-\ntorical data of individuals\
    \ and introduces different procedures to decrease costs. Berlin\nintroduced the\
    \ application of radio frequency identification (RFID) to PAYT systems in\ncommunities\
    \ [199]. The authors of [200][201] also highlighted smart bins equipped with\n\
    other types of technologies, such as sorting features based on image recognition\
    \ technol-\nogy (e.g., using sensors to identify waste content or the colour of\
    \ plastics) and a conveyor\nbelt that separates waste. The authors of [202] introduced\
    \ a smart bin model in which a\nsolar-powered compacting lever was added to compress\
    \ the volume of waste by approx-\nimately 700% and reduce the collection frequency\
    \ by 85%. To realise these solutions, the\nrequired sensors and devices must be\
    \ mounted in smart bins. Figure 7 shows a sample of\na smart bin equipped with\
    \ fill-level sensors and solar-powered compactors. In another\nstep in smart waste\
    \ management that should be supported by a higher administrative\nlevel of urban\
    \ management, data related to the districts’ waste containers can be collected\n\
    through cloud computing and, once processed, the control system can navigate waste\n\
    trucks towards full containers in an efficient route via a mobile application\
    \ [203]. \n \nFigure 7. Typical components of smart waste bins for transmitting\
    \ data [204][205]. \nThe authors of [206] presented an application of autonomous\
    \ sweeping vehicles de-\nsigned to clean streets and public spaces. These compact-size\
    \ smart sweepers are often\nequipped with an odometer and high-precision positioning\
    \ system (e.g., Global Naviga-\ntion Satellite System (GNSS)) that enable the\
    \ control system to adjust the time, position,\nspeed, and attitude of the machine.\
    \ These smart machines are currently employed on ad-\nvanced campuses and parks\
    \ in Beijing, China [207]. Table 9 lists the potential performance\nof related\

    \ waste composter is to monitor and control\nthe composting operations by automatically\
    \ adding the precise amounts of water and\nair required and reducing human intervention.\
    \ Generally, the provision of small-scale\ncomposting plants in the neighbourhood\
    \ effectively eliminates the gap between the places\nwhere organic waste is generated\
    \ and where it is processed to produce fertilisers [212].\nThis system reduces\
    \ the CO2 emissions, costs, and energy consumed when collecting\nand transmitting\
    \ organic waste. Intelligent composting has been used to monitor and\ncontrol\
    \ the moisture and temperature of the process, which are indispensable for obtaining\n\
    high-quality products [196]. The authors of [196,213] introduced different types\
    \ of sensors\nin intelligent composting machines to control air circulation and\
    \ measure the moisture\nand temperature of the composting material in different\
    \ nodes of piles, and subsequently\ntransfer data to the control system through\
    \ wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in real time.\nThe same procedure was used to\
    \ build composting plants at different scales, and small\nmachines are now available\
    \ for households, buildings, and neighbourhoods [212,214].\nAlthough these smart\
    \ systems can signiﬁcantly contribute to waste reduction and energy\nconservation,\
    \ no quantitative results have been reported regarding the beneﬁts obtained\n\
    from these smart solutions.\n3.2.4. Smart Solutions for Outdoor Spaces\nThe smart\
    \ solutions categorised in this domain are those that cannot be included in any\n\
    specific subjective domain (e.g., buildings and waste) or in building-energy-related\
    \ uses.\nSmart Outdoor Lights\nThe ultimate goal of smartening outdoor lights\
    \ is to provide residents with a safe\nand comfortable environment in shared public\
    \ areas while reducing energy consumption\nand light pollution. Smart outdoor\
    \ lighting ﬁxtures employ special technologies such\nas cameras, optical sensor\
    \ photocells, and other sensors to perform real-time monitoring\nfunctions and\
    \ the intended tasks [215]. By providing adequate brightness at the appropriate\n\
    time, smart outdoor lighting systems not only foster a sense of satisfaction and\
    \ safety among\nresidents but also reduce energy consumption. The technology used\
    \ in smart outdoor\nlighting systems can be similar to general smart lighting\
    \ technologies, such as motion\ndetection, lighting, and dimming control, and\
    \ the infrastructure of this system can also be\nEnergies 2023, 16, 5701\n23 of\
    \ 35\nused as the backbone of other activities, such as monitoring weather, air\
    \ pollution, and\ntrafﬁc [216–218]. Table 10 presents the results obtained from\
    \ previous related research\nprojects concerning the effect of using smart outdoor\
    \ lights on energy consumption and\ncost reductions.\nTable 10. Examples of smart\

    \ smart parking system (SPS) is to provide real-time data on the\navailability\
    \ of parking lots for different types of vehicles, such as cars, EVs, and bicycles,\n\
    in the neighbourhood and surrounding areas to save time and energy and stimulate\n\
    the use of more efﬁcient vehicles. The authors of [223] alleged that an SPS is\
    \ one of the\nfundamental elements of smart mobility, particularly in densely\
    \ populated neighbourhoods\nand districts that suffer from a scarcity of parking\
    \ spaces. An SPS is a good solution for\nremediating trafﬁc congestion, thus reducing\
    \ air pollution and the concomitant health\nrisk [224]. In this regard, Ref. [225]\
    \ used a multi-agent system (MAS) to empower drivers\nto negotiate parking fees\
    \ with an SPS based on predeﬁned criteria. The atuhors of [226]\nemployed IoT\
    \ and RFID tags to develop a car parking framework that provides payment\nfacilities,\
    \ parking lot retrieval, and security. The authors of [227] used the Global System\n\
    for Mobile (GSM) to develop a system in which the driver can securely reserve\
    \ a parking\nspot using a simple short message (SMS) through a layout animation\
    \ of parking space\noccupancy status. The authors of [228] presented a visual\
    \ vehicle parking space for real-time\noccupancy detection using a deep convolutional\
    \ neural network (CNN). These services may\nbe provided on different user interfaces,\
    \ such as smartphone applications, web applications,\nand vehicle information\
    \ and communication systems (VICS). Figure 8 schematically depicts\nthe architecture\
    \ of an SPS in which all parking spaces are monitored through sensors\nconnected\
    \ to a control system.\nAlthough these platforms are usually developed for large-scale\
    \ areas, the facilities and\ntechnologies equipped in parking lots can be implemented\
    \ individually in a single parking\narea in a neighbourhood. Hence, Ref. [224]\

    \ and information system (PGIS): This provides a real-time number \nof available\

    \ As most of the guidelines presented in this context focused\non smart homes\
    \ or smart cities, the boundaries of which are more clearly determined, the\n\
    ﬁrst contribution of this research lies in the presentation of a complete set\
    \ of smart solutions\nthat are particularly applicable to the neighbourhood building\
    \ stock. The key difference\nbetween the neighbourhood building stock and urban\
    \ planning strategies or single-home\nrenovation is the set of activities that\
    \ are socioeconomically feasible at this scale. In this\nregard, clarifying a\
    \ clear boundary among all the smart solutions and selecting those that\ncan be\
    \ deployed in the neighbourhood-building stock could play a crucial role in assessing\n\
    opportunities for intelligentisation. This study also signiﬁcantly contributes\
    \ to clarifying\nthe direct and indirect impacts of smart solutions on reducing\
    \ energy consumption.\nIn this research, all the smart solutions were investigated\
    \ in two main sections, building\nand neighbourhood, and further classiﬁed under\
    \ ﬁve domains: building energy-related\nuses, RESs, water, waste, and open space\
    \ management. The smart solutions collected in the\nbuilding energy-related domain\
    \ are almost entirely laid out in the SRI report [17]. However,\na comparison\
    \ of the levels of functionalities presented in the SRI report and the collected\n\
    smart solutions in the ﬁrst domain revealed that only the last two levels of each\
    \ indicator\ncould be considered smart. A literature review in this domain showed\
    \ that one of the\nmain obstacles that may prevent the realisation of this expected\
    \ improvement is the lack\nof skill among building users, preventing them from\
    \ adapting their energy usage proﬁle\nto an appropriate behavioural pattern. In\
    \ the ﬁeld of energy generation, there is a naïve\ngeneral overview that the supply\
    \ of sustainable energy from RESs can be interpreted as\na smart solution at any\
    \ level. This research strove to make a clear distinction between\nsustainable\
    \ and smart measures by summarising the elements that should be deployed\nin the\
    \ renewable energy grid to solve their major challenges. Moreover, in the ﬁelds\
    \ of\nwaste management and water distribution networks, which are inseparable\
    \ subjects of all\nsustainability protocols, all the smart solutions that should\
    \ be applied at the neighbourhood\nscale and supported by higher levels of urban\
    \ management were elaborated. A review of\nthe potential impacts of smart solutions\
    \ proved that energy enhancement is not only limited\nto the intelligentisation\
    \ of building components but can also be achieved through other\nneighbourhood\
    \ elements in direct and indirect ways. For instance, owing to the strong\ninterrelationships\
    \ among these elements, increasing community awareness in different\nﬁelds through\
    \ the use of smart water meters, smart energy meters, and smart parking\nsystems\
    \ can boost the effective conservation of energy and other resources.\nAlthough\
    \ potentially missed articles and projects could have contributed more to\nthis\
    \ review, the various indispensable aspects of the neighbourhood scale covered\
    \ here\nEnergies 2023, 16, 5701\n26 of 35\nrevealed an uneven workload distribution\
    \ in the development of smart tools across different\ndisciplines. This uneven\
    \ distribution has resulted in certain areas, such as smartening\nwater reclamation\
    \ and smart composting plans, which have rarely been investigated in\nthis context.\
    \ In addition, most smart-oriented studies merely focused on designing and\ndeveloping\
    \ new tools and methods, without examining their effectiveness. Although this\n\
    trend has led to a rapid advancement in smart and digital tools, it can be an\
    \ obstacle for\nstakeholders seeking observable investment outcomes.\nConsidering\
    \ all these factors, having a comprehensive framework not only as a guide-\nline\
    \ but also to measure and compare the level of smartness and potential achievements\n\
    in energy conservation can play a signiﬁcant role in structuring the content of\
    \ this ﬁeld.\nThis study introduces a novel perspective on the concept of smartness\
    \ by focusing on\nthe intermediate scale between the city and building levels,\
    \ which has the potential to\naccelerate the development of smart solutions, particularly\
    \ in neighbourhoods charac-\nterised by residents who share common values, such\
    \ as housing cooperatives. Increasing\npolicymakers’ awareness of the beneﬁts\
    \ of implementing smartness at this scale makes\nit possible to bridge the gap\
    \ between theory and practice, and contributes to the overall\nimplementation\
    \ of smart city initiatives.\nMoreover, this study emphasises the importance of\
    \ considering the boundaries and\nlimitations of smart solutions, from the building\
    \ to the neighbourhood scale, to ensure\na holistic and sustainable approach and\
    \ enhance the practical applicability of smart city\ndevelopment. In this regard,\
    \ this research highly recommends that future studies focus\non developing a comprehensive\
    \ reporting framework (similar to the level(s) speciﬁed\nfor building sustainability\
    \ [242]), with speciﬁc reference to smart solutions for energy\nconservation in\
    \ the neighbourhood building stock.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

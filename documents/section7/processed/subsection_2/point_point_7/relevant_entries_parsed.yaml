- explanation: '**Response:** This study evaluated the current state and future potential
    of real-time, automated energy management systems for integrated end-to-end building
    energy optimization, focusing on gaps and proposed solutions.


    **Relevant Quote:** "Combining data from multiple sources (e.g., sensors, weather
    forecasts, satellite imagery) using data fusion techniques (e.g., Kalman filters,
    Dempster-Shafer theory) to create a comprehensive view of system health"'

  limitations: This response does not fully address the topic of smart building energy
    management. It focuses on energy management systems for real-time, automated building
    energy optimization, which is a narrower aspect of smart building energy management.

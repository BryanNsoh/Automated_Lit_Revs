    Tarim Basin, China. Journal of Hydrology, 620, 129399.'
  explanation: 'In this study, the authors used ensemble machine learning to predict
    groundwater levels in four different ecosystems: the Oasis-Taklimakan desert (OTD),
    Nature land in Oasis system (NLOS), Irrigation area (IA), and Oasis system (OS)
    in the Tarim Basin of China.


    They used five different base learners (M5, Random Forest (RF), Gaussian radial
    basis function networks (GRBFN), Multilayer Perceptron Neural network (MLP)) and
    five different ensemble algorithms (Additive regression (AR), Bagging, Dagging,
    Random Subspace, and Rotation Forest) to create 25 different models for each ecosystem.
    They also used five different spatial resolutions (30, 90, 250, 500, and 1000
    m) for each model.


    The best model for each ecosystem was selected based on the root mean square error
    (RMSE) and R2 values. The best model for OTD was AR_GRBFN (250 m), with an RMSE
    of 6.09 m and R2 of 0.92. The best model for NLOS was RotationForest_MLP (30 m),
    with an RMSE of 5.66 m and R2 of 0.96. The best model for IA was AR_GRBFN (250
    m), with an RMSE of 3.78 m and R2 of 0.86. The best model for OS was AR_RF (90
    m), with an RMSE of 3.49 m and R2 of 0.50.


    The authors found that the optimal scale for groundwater level prediction varied
    depending on the ecosystem. The optimal scale for OTD was 250 m, for NLOS was
    30 m, for IA was 250 m, and for OS was 90 m.

    accuracy of the base learners. Random Subspace, Rotation Forest, and Additive

  explanation: 'The extraction point is a critical component in the TSEB model for
    calculating the temperature related to canopy and soil, in this study, the derived
    Ts and Tc are used to calculate surface energy balance equation for the soil and
    canopy components of the composite land surface system. The initial Tc value in
    the TSEB model is set to the traditional Priestly-Taylor formula. Then, Ls and
    LEc are computed as a residual of the Eqs. 6-8.


    The innovation of our study is the construction of hybrid DNN-TSEB. DNN approach
    has a strong ability for non-linear fitting, feature extraction, and fault tolerance.
    DNN is used to establish a relationship between LST and NDVI and to achieve finer
    resolution LST in this experimental area. The DNN-based LST model not only considers
    the relationship between LST and NDVI but also ensures the theoretical foundation
    of the method. The predicted LST exhibited a good agreement with the measured
    LST (Fig. 6), with an RMSE value of 2.53 K and 3.81 K for DNN-Landsat-like and
    DNN-MODIS-like, respectively.'
  extract_1: In this study, a revised TSEB model (Kustas and Norman, 1999) was utilized
    to obtain surface heat and water vapor fluxes. The revised TSEB model partitions
    the composite surface radiometric temperature (Trad), i.e., LST, into soil (Ts)
    and canopy (Tc) component temperatures based on the fraction of vegetation cover
    (fc) observed by the sensor at an angle θ, using the Stefan Boltzmann law, which
    relates a blackbody temperature to radiance emission (Kustas and Norman, 1999,
    Norman et al., 1995). The derived Ts and Tc are used to calculate the surface
    energy balance equation for the soil and canopy components of the composite land
    surface system (Kustas et al., 2012).
  extract_2: 'The net radiation (Rn) from soil and vegetation i.e., Rns and Rnc are
    estimated by the algorithm proposed by Kustas and Norman (1999). The formulas
    are as follows: Rn= Rns + Rnc (6) Rns= (1 − αs)Rs↓ − εsσTs4 (7) Rnc= (1 − αc)Rc↓
    + εcσTc4 − G0 (8) where Rs↓ and Rc↓ is correspond to the incoming shortwave and
    longwave radiation from the sky (W/m−2); αs and αc is the albedo for vegetation
    and soil, respectively; εs and εc are the emissivity for vegetation and soil,
    respectively; σ is the Stefan Boltzmann constant of ∼0.06 kPa K−1; G0 is the surface
    soil heat flux (all in W/m−2). The G0 can be estimated as a fraction of Rns or
    Rn (i. e., or , where was the empirical coefficient and can be set to ∼0.1 according

  explanation: The purpose of the study is to develop and validate an end-to-end methodology
    to combine the strengths of remote sensing and model-based products for estimating
    soil moisture (SM) at a fine spatial resolution. The study focuses on evaluating
    different soil moisture data sources in various ways to produce reliable and complete
    SM products at a 1 km daily scale.
  extract_1: To overcome these problems, this work developed an SM disaggregation
    methodology. The best model-based SM product was first assessed using the triple
    collocation (TC) method, which allows us to obtain the weight of individual product.
    The model-based and microwave SM products were combined based on weight to produce
    daily seamless SM data at 25 km. Second, the iterative multi-temporal reconstruction
    and the ESTARFM method were combined to solve the invalid grids problem of optical/infrared
    product, thus obtaining 1 km daily seamless auxiliary data. Finally, daily seamless
    SM data at 1 km were obtained by geographically weighted regression (GWR) method.

    and the resulting SM product achieved a satisfied accuracy (ubRMSE = 0.044 m3/m3),
    with characteristics of spatiotemporal continuity as well as fine spatial detail.
    The disaggregated SM product makes full use of model-based, microwave, and optical/infrared
    products, which is valuable in areas such as agricultural management policy, high-resolution
    hydro-meteorological simulations, and disaster monitoring.

    of the raw data used during the estimation process.

  explanation: This study proposes a mathematical model for dimensioning a large-scale
    alternate wetting and drying (AWD) system for rice production. The model considers
    irrigation system components as distributed systems, and separates them into pipe
    networks, localized water control, and clustered pumps with centralized control.
    The proposed model is applicable to both AWD and non-AWD irrigation systems. The
    pipe network will facilitate both micro- and macro-level irrigation control in
    a scalable manner. The distributed health monitoring of the pipe network and the
    clustered pumps will make the system more fault-tolerant. Various field-level
    sensors in an IoT-connected WSN will help build a long-term database enabling
    scientific research to study the impact of climate change on crop yield, physiological
    changes, greenhouse gas emissions for different crops, and the application of
    various irrigation models. The proposed system uses a low-power and long-range
    (LoRa) sensor node and data sink using LoRa, 3G, and WiFi interfaces for field
    monitoring using an IoT network, and has potential applications in scientific
    research through the database of long-term sensor data and applying Machine Learning
    (ML) for future wide-area implementation.

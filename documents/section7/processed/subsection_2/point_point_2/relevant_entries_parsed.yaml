- explanation: 'The proposed mitigation framework is deployed in four parallel vital
    software components, namely:


    (a) Traffic Capture

    (b) Traffic Monitoring, Analytics, and Detection

    (c) Attack Detection Service

    (d) SDN-based Mitigation


    These software components are autonomous and independent in their work. However,
    each software component communicates to send or seek the data. Fig. 11 shows the
    comprehensive view of the deployment model. Further, Fig. 12 illustrates the flow
    diagram for end-to-end IoT-DDoS mitigation modules.


    **Traffic Capture**


    The Fog layer employs an automated Python script at the entry point leveraging
    standard ‘tcpdump’ to capture ingress traffic traces with configurable PCAP size.
    The ‘tcpdump’ is configured for the ‘number of packets’. The default configuration
    is set to 10,000 packets. The ‘tcpdump’ keeps listening to the network until it
    captures the configured amount of packets (say, 10,000 packets). When the desired
    packets are captured, ‘tcpdump’ outputs the packets into PCAP and listens to another
    set of packets.


    Therefore, the prime responsibility of the ‘Traffic Monitoring’ module is to listen
    to ingress network traffic and dump the packets into the PCAP file.


    **Traffic Monitoring, Analytics, and Detection**


    Traffic monitoring, analytics, and detection module are implemented as a Watchdog
    and corresponding Watchdog Handler (as shown in Fig. 12). The watchdog triggers
    FileCreateEvent as soon as ‘tcpdump’ creates a traffic dump file. The FileCreateEvent
    event handler converts the PCAP into a CSV feature file and queries the ‘IoT-DDoS
    attack detection service’ module for blacklisting of IP addresses sending the
    attack traffic. The blocked IP addresses are stored in ‘Blacklist-DB.’


    **IoT-DDoS Detection Service**


    The IoT-DDoS Detection Service module is deployed on a Docker-based H2O.ai pipeline
    with master and worker configuration for analyzing the real-time traffic to make
    predictions. The service responds to incoming HTTP requests for attack prediction
    with the required attributes as parameters to HTTP requests. The attack detection
    service module is upheld with the exported trained binary model, which serves
    as the heart of the service.


    **SDN-based Mitigation**


    Algorithm 4 describes the pseudo-code for the SDN-based mitigation module. The
    sequence diagram in Fig. 13 depicts the mitigation module and classifies the web
    resource request into legitimate and attack requests. Various stages are labeled
    at the top of the sequence diagram for end-to-end traffic flow.


    The legitimate case explains that SDN intercepts the request for web resources.
    SDN-based mitigation module queries Blacklist-DB for any blocked IP address. SDN
    is not involved in analytics, making the mitigation framework lightweight. In
    the event of a legitimate request with no entry for the incoming IP address in
    the database, the SDN quickly transmits the signal, enabling the traffic to flow
    smoothly.


    In contrast, SDN finds the IP address from the incoming request in the database
    for attack traffic and installs the rule to block traffic from the prohibited
    IP address.


    The proposed work expounds upon the end-to-end IoT-DDoS attack detection and mitigation
    process in real time. Each stage involved in the framework describes the communication
    between the atomic yet connected framework components bridging the gaps in the
    cutting-edge solutions. Thus, the proposed work offers a comprehensive toolkit
    that researchers can leverage to augment their research and development endeavors.'

- explanation: 'Object Detection and Tracking (ODT) using computer vision techniques
    has emerged as a powerful tool in precision agriculture. This technology enables
    the identification, classification, and tracking of objects of interest in agricultural
    settings. The use of ODT has been demonstrated across various agricultural applications,
    including crop monitoring, pest detection, disease identification, and resource
    optimization.


    ODT involves two fundamental tasks: object detection and object tracking.


    * **Object detection** refers to the identification and localization of objects
    of interest within an image or video frame. Deep learning algorithms, such as
    convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are commonly used for object detection.
    These algorithms are trained on extensive datasets containing labeled images to
    recognize and locate specific objects.


    * **Object tracking** involves following the detected objects over time, even
    if they move or change appearance. Object tracking algorithms typically use a
    combination of motion models and appearance matching techniques to maintain the
    object''s identity and location across consecutive frames.


    The integration of ODT into precision agriculture offers numerous benefits. By
    enabling real-time monitoring and analysis of crops and livestock, farmers and
    researchers can make data-driven decisions to optimize production processes, reduce
    costs, and minimize environmental impact.


    Here are some notable examples of ODT applications in precision agriculture:


    * **Crop monitoring**: ODT can assist in counting and measuring crop yield, assessing
    plant health, and detecting nutrient deficiencies using drone or satellite imagery.

    * **Pest detection**: ODT can identify and track pests, such as insects and rodents,
    enabling targeted pest control measures to reduce crop damage.

    * **Disease identification**: ODT can assist in the early detection of plant diseases
    by analyzing visual symptoms and patterns on leaves and stems.

    * **Resource optimization**: ODT can be used to monitor and optimize the use of
    resources, such as water and fertilizer, by analyzing irrigation patterns and
    crop growth rates.


    Despite the advantages of ODT, certain considerations and challenges should be
    taken into account for its successful implementation in precision agriculture:


    * **Data availability**: Training and validating ODT models require large and
    diverse datasets. Acquiring labeled data in agricultural settings can be time-consuming
    and expensive.

    * **Computational requirements**: ODT algorithms often demand significant computational
    resources for training and inference, which may not be readily available on-farm.

    * **Environmental factors**: Agricultural environments can be affected by weather
    conditions, illumination variations, and occlusions, which can impact the performance
    of ODT algorithms.

    * **Real-time requirements**: Many precision agriculture applications require
    real-time or near real-time processing of data, which poses additional challenges
    for ODT algorithms to meet latency constraints.


    Overcoming these challenges requires ongoing research and development in ODT algorithms
    and methodologies. Future advancements in deep learning, edge computing, and sensor
    technologies hold promising prospects for enhancing the capabilities and practicality
    of ODT in precision agriculture.'
  relevance_evaluation: '7.2. Advanced Monitoring Techniques for Automated Irrigation
    Systems


    Object Detection and Tracking have gained importance in recent years because of
    the great advances in GPU computing power (Davies, 2004) and the boost in image
    analysis techniques. Hence, the number of research studies performed on those
    domains has increased significantly, drawing significant attention to DL projects
    (Vargas et al., 2017). In particular, Deep Learning (DL) (LeCun et al., 2015,
    LeCun and Bengio, 1995) has shown important advances in agriculture in performing
    various important tasks such as plant phenotyping, yield estimation, crop classification,
    or disease detection (Ariza-Sentís et al., 2023b, Bouguettaya et al., 2022, Kamilaris
    and Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018, Zhou et al., 2023). In addition, when Deep Learning-based
    Object Detection is integrated with tracking, it gives rise to a distinct field
    known as “Object Detection and Tracking”, an area that has seen rapid growth in
    recent years, driven by advancements in GPU computing power (Davies, 2004) and
    the boost in image analysis techniques. Hence, the number of research studies
    performed on those domains has increased significantly, drawing significant attention
    to DL projects (Vargas et al., 2017).


    The agricultural and livestock domain has also benefited from this trend. Object
    Detection and Tracking techniques have shown great potential to enable behaviour
    analysis and object interactions, which is crucial for applications like autonomous
    vehicles and enhancing animal welfare (Khairunissa et al., 2021); allowing plant
    ID recovery even if a plant temporarily leaves the view of the camera, ensuring
    individual plant recognition and avoiding repeated spraying by the robot (Hu et
    al., 2022); or to develop key tasks such as detecting plants and their fruits
    (de Jong et al., 2022, Zhang, Wang et al., 2022), which eases the inspection time
    which is currently carried out by field operators.


    Moreover, Object Detection and Tracking permit the automation of crop harvesting
    to improve field productivity and optimize operational costs (Junos et al., 2021),
    paving the way for robotization of the agricultural sector. Furthermore, Object
    Detection and Tracking allow for precise monitoring and management of livestock
    animals’ movement (Huang et al., 2023, Myat Noe et al., 2023). It facilitates
    real-time analysis of behaviours and health metrics, which optimizes care and
    resource allocation for each individual animal. The challenges and applications
    of Deep Learning in agriculture have been comprehensively addressed in prior surveys
    (Alibabaei et al., 2022, Bouguettaya et al., 2022, Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú,
    2018, Wang, Cao et al., 2022). However, there is a notable absence of literature
    reviews specifically focusing on the integration of Object Detection and Tracking
    in enhancing Precision Farming techniques. Consequently, the motivation for writing
    this review article was to address the need for a comprehensive analysis of the
    utilization of Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques applied to Object
    Detection and Object Tracking within the field of Precision Farming, considering
    the increasing interest in this sector and the potential transformative effects

    Most crops require the right amount of water at the right time. Water stress or

  explanation: 'This article implements an IoT device with an intelligent fuzzy logic
    controller for agricultural systems. It combines Cisco Packet Tracer with Matlab/Simulink
    to automate irrigation systems, using the Internet of Things to ''connect'' the
    devices together. The authors conducted a literature review on previous works
    and then discuss mathematical models, detailing the equations that represent the
    outflow and inflow rates of water tanks and how these models are used to develop
    the fuzzy logic controller.


    The fuzzy logic controller is used to control the opening of the water valve based
    on soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. The authors provide the membership
    functions and the fuzzy logic rules that were used to design the controller.


    The results section shows the output of the valve opening, moisture in the sounding,
    pump flow rate, outflow, water level, and ADH values, which are 10.00000013 rad/s,
    34.72%, 4.494%, 0.025 m3/s, 73.31 cm3, and 750 values, respectively. The authors

    from the tanks, and the control signal fluctuates, indicating that the valve is
    opening.'

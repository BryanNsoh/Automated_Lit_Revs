    Deploying a heterogeneous network of IoT sensors to collect real-time data on
    soil moisture (e.g., capacitive, tensiometric), temperature (e.g., thermocouples,
    thermistors), humidity (e.g., capacitive, resistive), and plant health (e.g.,

    system that captures the spatial and temporal variability of the soil-plant-atmosphere
    system. This advanced monitoring system enables the development of intelligent
    irrigation strategies and ensures precise and efficient water application.


    **2. A succinct yet detailed explanation of how the specifics of the paper contribute
    to addressing the point within the outline.**


    By integrating multiple sensor modalities, the proposed system can capture a comprehensive
    view of the irrigation system. Soil moisture sensors monitor the water content
    in the soil, temperature sensors measure the temperature of the soil and air,
    humidity sensors measure the amount of water vapor in the air, and plant health
    sensors monitor plant water status, stress levels, and growth. This data is then
    used to create a digital twin of the irrigation system, which is a virtual representation
    of the physical system that can be used to simulate and optimize irrigation strategies.


    The digital twin can be used to develop intelligent irrigation strategies that
    take into account the spatial and temporal variability of the soil-plant-atmosphere
